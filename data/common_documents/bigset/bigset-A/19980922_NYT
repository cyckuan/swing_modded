KARIYA RETURNS TO ACTION
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Being the perfectionist that he is, Paul Kariya was
concerned with his performance upon his return to competitive
hockey Sunday versus Calgary at the Pond. The Mighty Ducks winger
was more concerned about that than taking his first hit in game
conditions since Gary Suter cross-checked him on Feb.1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little nervous, I wanted to get it over with,'' said
Kariya on Monday of his return. ``I got better each period. My
timing is still off, but that is to be expected, when you haven't
played in seven months.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rust, Kariya had nine shots on goal, scored an
empty-net goal and got an assist. He said he will need all six or
seven exhibition games in which he is expected to play to regain
his timing, but expects to be 100 percent by the time the regular
season begins on Oct.10 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya took hard several checks, including a blow to the head by
Calgary defenseman Sami Helenius, but said he ``felt fine'' and ``I
didn't even think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg said he didn't think about Kariya
getting hit until he actually was.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he took a couple of hits I watched to see if he was all
right, and he was,'' Hartsburg said. ``He has full medical
clearance and I don't think it will be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Fredrik Olausson, who missed the first week of
practice due to an enlarged spleen has received medical clearance
and has begun practicing with the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg said Olausson will not play tonight against the Kings,
or Wednesday against Colorado. It's hoped he will be ready to play
either Saturday in Colorado or next Monday against the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks and Kings will renew their Southland rivalry tonight
at the Great Western Forum, but Anaheim won't be heading down the
freeway with a full bus. Neither Teemu Selanne nor Kariya will play
in Inglewood. Both are scheduled to be back in the lineup on
Wednesday.

ANGELS TRY TO RELAX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- The three-game series against the Texas Rangers is
about the closest the Angels have been to playing in a playoff
series since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, the Angels want the crowd into it to help raise
their level of play. On the other, the Angels are doing everything
they can to treat the games like any other games so they don't get
uptight.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I'll continue to do is make sure our guys stay
loose, manager Terry Collins said. ``I'll walk around and remind
them to relax and have fun, continue to plug along. I don't want
them to get caught up in all the pressure of `head-to-head'. If you
think this is tense, wait 'til you play in a World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing the Angels keep reminding themselves is that no
matter what happens in the series with Texas, the division won't be
decided until the final four games of the season -- the Angels will
be in Oakland and Texas will be in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next seven days will be like the playoffs, center fielder
Jim Edmonds said. ``Even if we win two of three from Texas, we've
still got to win three of four in Oakland to solidify our place in
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad started Monday's game even though his strained left
hamstring is not healed. Erstad ran from home to first and second
to home for Collins Monday afternoon and convinced him he was good
enough to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't play him ... We need him in the lineup, Collins
said. ``If I keep him out of the lineup the next three or four
days, we might not need him until March. I'm sitting here thinking
I may have to hold him out for the playoffs. But if we don't use
him, we may not get to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad said he didn't expect to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised, he said. ``When I went out there I was not
expecting to play. It actually hurts more now. I feel it when I
run, but it's not pulling, it's more like the feeling of a bruise.
The trainers said that's part of the natural progression of
healing.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Kreuter got his first start as an Angel in 1998 in the
club's biggest game of the season Monday night. With knuckleball
pitcher Steve Sparks' personal catcher Phil Nevin out with a
sprained ankle, Kreuter, acquired from the White Sox on Friday, got
the start.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter has caught knuckleballers before -- Dennis Springer last
season and Charlie Hough early in Kreuter's career.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Jim Edmonds has had a good September, hitting
.364 (24 for 66) with four homers and 17 RBIs going into Monday's
game. At times he has been the only Angel producing any offense.
And lately, he's playing defense like he did last season, when he
won his first Gold Glove. Edmonds made diving catches in key
situations both Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy's taking his game to another level, Collins said.
``That's what great players do. They have the ability to step up
their play.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds said he rarely reads the newspaper, but last Friday he
read an article that noted he was the only Angel hitting during
their four-game losing streak. Later that day, a reporter asked his
about his hot streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone came and asked me about it ... he jinxed me, Edmonds
said. ``I had seven (bad) at-bats in a row after that. I'm not
talking about hitting anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Ken Hill threw a sideline workout Monday reported no
problems with his right elbow, which has been sore lately. Hill is
still slated to start Wednesday's game against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Paco Martin started at third base Monday instead of Troy Glaus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of things that went into that, Collins said.
``He's a good runner. And in a game like this I may have to do some
things with the bottom of the lineup. He can hit-and-run, bunt. And
he has good hands. I thought this would be a good day to play him.

COOPERSTOWN MAY NEED WHOLE NEW WING TO HOUSE 1998 HIGHLIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ He took the night off. So now Cal Ripken Jr. has put
his own historic stamp on the 1998 baseball season. He joins a
pretty cool club _ one that already had done enough to make this
season rival any as the best baseball has ever known.
</P>
<P>
   Now, getting Ripken's No. 8 jersey from Baltimore to Cooperstown
should prove a little easier than the odyssey involved in
transporting Mark McGwire's stuff to the hallowed National Baseball
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   That is, it SHOULD be easier when Ripken decides to hand over
something by which the whole world can remember his awesome Iron
Man Streak, which ended Sunday at 2,632 consecutive games because
Ripken made The Call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have anything from the record,'' Hall of Fame
spokesman John Ralph said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken has yet to present the Hall anything from that Sept. 6,
1995, night when he broke Lou Gehrig's consecutive game record of
2,130. So far, there is no indication about how or when Ripken will
satisfy the Hall's request to possess something from Ripken's last
game before he ended The Streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cal has been very, how should I say this, patient in deciding
what he is going to do,'' Ralph said. ``We called the Orioles
(Sunday night) after Cal took himself out of the lineup and I spoke
to someone again. We're very hopeful, and Cal has always said he
will take care of us.''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't this the summer of taking care of people? Hasn't every
bigger-than-life baseball god taken care of us, making this season
one that history should say outshines every other season?
</P>
<P>
   Probably the more-guarded and more-private Ripken now will be
moved to act swiftly on the Hall's behalf. It is tough not to be
inspired by the love and goodwill McGwire and Sammy Sosa have
inspired.
</P>
<P>
   After collecting every shred of clothing, leather and lumber
pertaining to McGwire's 62nd home run on Sept. 8 _ McGwire all but
stripped down to his underwear to make sure the Hall had what it
needed _ Hall of Fame president Donald C. Marr Jr. and executive
director of communications Jeffery Idelson were whisked 70 miles
from the airport in Albany, N.Y., to Cooperstown by police escort.
State troopers with lights flashing took McGwire's stuff to the
place where it will forever rest with stuff from Roger Maris and
Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the night before they left St. Louis, Jeff slept with
McGwire's bat in his bed at the hotel,'' Ralph said Monday, when
more phone calls and more jerseys were being sought to bolster the
Hall of Fame collection.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you are suffering the incredible and overwhelming
highs of this unbelievable baseball season, pity the poor folks
whose job it is to stock the Hall of Fame with historic
memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph was with Sosa in Chicago when the Cubs outfielder became
the second this month to surpass Maris' 37-year-old record of 61
home runs in a season. He has spent a week with Sosa, and said Sosa
was very happy to have the Hall of Fame there with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right after the game, I went in to see him. He had just gotten
done saying he didn't really want to give up the bat, since he had
been hitting so well with it. But he did. He just kissed it a
number of times and then handed it over,'' Ralph said.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's bat _ now on display in a special ``Chasing Maris''
exhibit at the Hall _ sits in special company. A replica
old-fashioned scoreboard charts the homers day-by-day of McGwire,
Sosa, Ken Griffey Jr. and Greg Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a private donor has loaned the Hall a uniform worn by
Maris at one point during the 1961 season, along with the bat and
ball from Maris' 61st homer.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's entire uniform is in glass, as are the bat, ball and
scorecard from Cardinals announcer Jack Buck. And the uniform that
McGwire's son, Matt, wore the day McGwire hit 62 also is featured
in Cooperstown now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked for that, since Mark and Matt have had such a special
relationship. We thought it was a neat human interest part of the
story,'' Ralph said.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a lot of that going around this summer. Yankee
pitcher David Wells threw a no-hitter, so his cap went to the Hall
along with a Beanie Baby that was a giveaway at Yankee Stadium that
day.
</P>
<P>
   And now that the home run chase is getting down to the wire,
Hall of Fame representatives will go back out on the road to
collect more stuff.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Mariners have been asked to send any of the
bats Griffey used to hit homers after No. 50, especially now that
Griffey has joined the elite company of players who hit 50 homers
and stole 20 bases. There will be a request for a bat or jersey
from Alex Rodriguez, who has become only the third player in
history to go 40/40 _ a feat now statistically more rare than
clocking 60 homers.
</P>
<P>
   Most important now for 1998, Ripken will have to ship something
off to the Hall. Ending The Streak might not have felt like lifting
a burden off Ripken's back. But lifting the No. 8 jersey off
Ripken's back and putting it into the Hall will forever put him in
the company of other fine men who, in 1998, gave baseball heart and
soul, and the shot at being the best season ever.

DISNEY PLANNING INTERNET ENTRYWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Walt Disney Co., in a major expansion of its
Internet presence, announced on Monday that it would launch an
easy-to-find Internet site called go.com later this year as one of
the entrance hubs on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment giant, which already has 9 million people
viewing its Web sites regularly, promised that its Go Network will
offer fast access to Disney sites, along with search and directory
services through its partnership with Web search specialist
Infoseek Corp. It proclaimed that go.com will become the
third-most-visited Web site behind only Yahoo! and American Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a lot of sense for Disney to use a name like this
that's easy to remember,'' said analyst Linda Bannister of Edward
Jones &AMP; Co. ``I think it's going to be very successful, given the
strength of Disney's marketing muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney agreed in June to buy 43 percent of Infoseek for $70
million. The deal provided for $165 million in marketing support,
such as ads on Disney's ABC, ESPN and other networks. Analysts
believe Disney can use the worldwide appeal of its brand names and
characters to attract the millions of people who have not yet
become regular Internet users, particularly parents with children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, the Internet is probably going to have a couple of
major points of access, so there's still a lot of opportunity,''
said Sanford Bernstein analyst Tom Wolzien, who noted that fewer
than 30 million U.S. homes have Internet access. ``It's not too
late for a new player.''
</P>
<P>
   Go.com will make it more likely for Web surfers to detour on to
Disney's major sites such as Disney.com, ESPN Sports Zone and
ABCNEWS.com, leading to further promotion of its theme parks,
movies, merchandise and TV networks. ``With Go Network, we are
making clear that we intend to seize this opportunity and be just a
click away from consumers around the globe,'' Disney Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Michael Eisner said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction of the Internet to media giants such as
Burbank-based Disney is growing because operators of directories
get to decide exactly what an Internet user initially views when
entering the World Wide Web.

HELLING IS SORELY NEEDED BY RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Tonight will be the most significant start
thus far in the professional career of Rangers right-hander Rick
Helling.
</P>
<P>
   The state of the American League West makes it so.
</P>
<P>
   Helling's state, though, remains in question before tonight's
crucial divisional game with the Angels at Edison International
Field of Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Helling, who entered last night's games as one of only three
19-game winners in the American League, will likely pitch with
discomfort for the second time in as many starts.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old pitcher endured by far his worst performance
this season during his previous start Thursday against the Angels.
Helling, though, refused to use the injury _ stiffness and pain in
the upper left side of his back _ as an alibi.
</P>
<P>
   That will not change tonight, the Rangers' scheduled starter
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't affect the way I pitch,'' said Helling, who will
attempt to become the Rangers' third 20-game winner during their
27-year existence. ``It's going to hurt. I know that. I'm just
going to have to pitch through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling, who recorded only four outs during Thursday's
appearance, surrendered six runs on seven hits and two walks during
the Rangers' 7-6 victory against the Angels at The Ballpark in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the Rangers might be that Helling (19-7, 4.54
earned-run average) experienced no major setbacks Saturday during
his bullpen session between starts with pitching coach Dick Bosman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boz said he threw the ball on his work day without any
problems,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``Well, I shouldn't
say that. It was with him, but he was able to make all of his
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling echoed the manager's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the same,'' Helling said. ``It hasn't gotten any
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The status of Helling and right-hander Aaron Sele (18-11, 4.22)
serves as one of the primary reasons Oates chose to stay with a
five-man rotation during the season's final week.
</P>
<P>
   Oates last week acknowledged thoughts of removing right-hander
John Burkett from the rotation and pitching right-handers Helling,
Sele, Todd Stottlemyre and Esteban Loaiza on three days' rest.
</P>
<P>
   Helling and Sele, whom Oates described Friday as less than ``100
percent right now,'' made that option less attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Helling and Sele have pitched 2081/3 and 2062/3 innings,
respectively. That represents single-season highs for both during
their professional careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are a lot of guys struggling, tired and aching
this time of year,'' Oates said. ``That's part of being a
professional athlete. There are a lot of people aching when it
comes down to the end of the season.''

TIRED TEAM REPLAYS 1996 SCENARIO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ After 156 games covering one of the hottest
summers in Texas history, you have every right to worry that the
Rangers, like a staggering marathon runner, have hit the wall a
week too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Check your memory bank: Weren't we agonizing over precisely the
same thing exactly two years ago, in this very stadium?
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes history can be a cool, soothing hand on a fevered
brow. And if you're not running a raging temperature over this
pennant race, you're just not paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   There was a definite sense of haven't-we-been-here-before? as
the Rangers opened what manager Johnny Oates labeled ``the most
important regular-season series in this organization's history''
last night at Edison International Field.
</P>
<P>
   The deja vu crowd couldn't help but notice: The evening marked
the two-year anniversary of the day John Burkett won the most
important regular-season game in club history as the Rangers
snapped a five-game losing streak with a 7-1 victory against the
Angels on Sept. 21, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The stomach-churning skid, which included a four-game Seattle
sweep at the Kingdome, had seen the Mariners whittle the Rangers'
lead to a single game (and actually draw even in the loss column).
</P>
<P>
   Until Burkett's victory, and another by Ken Hill the following
day, there was serious concern over whether the Rangers had enough
gas left to finish the race after drawing out to a 10-game lead in
mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   After winning two of three here in '96, the Rangers came home to
Texas to clinch their first-ever American League West championship
a few nights later.
</P>
<P>
   If the situations aren't exactly the same, they're close enough
to serve as a gentle, even comforting, reminder that Yogi's right:
It ain't over, till it's over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we tired?'' reliever John Wetteland echoed a question
before last night's game pitting two teams dead even in the
standings. ``You can ask every person in this room and get a
different answer. No, you'll probably get the same answer, but you
``should'' get a different answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a saying I like to use: You can be tired in November.''
</P>
<P>
   It becomes, Wetteland said, a matter of mind over body. Arms
ache, legs are dead, tortured muscles scream that they can work no
more. But there's a another game to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that this time of the season there are a lot of guys
tired, aching, hurting,'' Oates said. ``That's baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The infernal, baking heat of a Texas summer, however, might take
more of a toll than anyone realizes, Wetteland suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played in Texas now for two years,'' Wetteland said,
``Nothing's like a Texas summer, I'll tell you that. Ain't nothing
like it. Some days are very, very difficult to get through
physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been a tough road trip and you get home late and
have to show up early the next day to deal with a hundred-plus
degrees. All of a sudden it hits you. `What am I doing here? Gee
whiz, I'm exhausted.' Then you play the game and you see the
performance on the field and you understand why.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not stuff I'm happy to admit. But when you see it and
it's happening before your very eyes in certain situations
consistently, you can't avoid what you see.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates has alluded to the fatigue he sees in his starting
pitchers, particularly Rick Helling and Aaron Sele, who have both
pitched more innings than at any time in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the fatigue you'd normally feel after 150-something
games,'' Sele said. ``You don't change anything. You don't reach
back for something extra. You just keep pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not a lack of desire, Wetteland said. It's fatigue and that
can be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just takes an extra measure of mental discipline,'' he
said. ``You have to continue to apply yourself to the task. Don't
get caught up in the fact that your body feels like it can't do
something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of how your body feels or how your mind feels when
you get to the park, prepare yourself for that day. You've got to
listen to your body and keep your finger on the pulse. This is a
long, long season, longer than any in sports, and sometimes you
just have to back off.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, just when they looked as if they'd be pronounced
DOA by the time they got back to Texas, the Rangers found a
reservoir of energy and strength and finished the season with a
kick that left the Mariners eating their dust.
</P>
<P>
   Now they're faced with the same challenge. They can be tired in
November, and right now, that still seems like a long, long way
away.

JUST IN TIME, DEION HEALS AILING COWBOYS PSYCHE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ He whirls. He dervishes. And now, he
even heals things.
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders, that man of religion, performed his first
prime-time revival here last night.
</P>
<P>
   With no Troy Aikman, no Emmitt Smith and little that happened in
September to swell them with optimism, the Cowboys watched as
Sanders almost single-handedly breathed fresh life into their
season.
</P>
<P>
   The former Neon Deion, now a professed reformed man _ i.e., from
neon to stained glass _ took a second-period punt back 59 yards for
a touchdown, made a soaring 55-yard reception to ignite another
scoring drive and then, as if Giants fans weren't already ill
enough, stepped in front of a fourth-quarter Danny Kanell pass and
sashayed 71 yards for his second touchdown of the game.
</P>
<P>
   He whirled. He dervished. He sent New York fans home early,
31-7.
</P>
<P>
   Training camp never seemed so useless.
</P>
<P>
   It was Deion whose mending ankle kept his early camp practice
snaps to a minimum. And it was Deion who fractured a rib in a
scrimmage against the Saints on Aug. 11 and didn't surface again
until the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   But with Aikman expected to be out for a month, coach Chan
Gailey needed another weapon.
</P>
<P>
   That would be Sanders _ part weapon, part whoopee cushion.
</P>
<P>
   A week of earnest practice with the offense enabled Deion to
line up as an extra target in Gailey's multiple-wideout formations.
His third-period, 55-yard catch came on a third-and-eight play.
</P>
<P>
   More notable was that Sanders himself had felt sickly after his
second-period punt return for a touchdown. The first announcement
said that Deion was dehydrated. Later, he reportedly tossed up the
pregame meal. The third period was already under way when Sanders
emerged from the locker room and went straight onto the field to
resume playing cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever said the man doesn't have a flair for the dramatic.
His 59-yard scoring punt return involved one major change of
direction, followed by two signature jukes and then a final
sidestep to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The return left a conspicuous grin on Cowboys special-teams
coach Joe Avezzano's face. Sanders has done these kinds of things
before.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, few of them have come at such a provident time. With a
``Monday Night Football'' audience watching, the two teams had
traded punts and errant passes for most of the game's opening 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The start probably made Cowboys fans miss Aikman. It was NFC
East football at its snoring worst. A defensive struggle, coaches
would call it, as America reached for the remote control.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanders changed all that with, first, the punt return and
then the 55-yard reception. Two snaps later, the once-released,
now-resurrected Sherman Williams was bursting into the end zone to
make the Cowboys lead 24-7.
</P>
<P>
   It was all over but the dervishing.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever said the man couldn't play. From this end, the
primary complaint against Sanders was always his considerable cost
(underscored by a $12.9 million signing bonus) and the way his $7
million contract this season shackles the team with the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes, even in pro football, you get what you pay for.
</P>
<P>
   The asterisk on this lopsided Cowboys victory would have to be
the Giants' stumbling secondary. Three New York defenders somehow
managed to let the Cowboys' Billy Davis catch the ball at the
visitors' 40 and turn it into an 80-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, however, deserves credit for giving sub quarterback
Jason Garrett an ace in the hole _ Sanders, the erstwhile Neon
Deion, the born-again Reverend Do-Rag. Deion doesn't exactly run
well-chiseled pass routes, but the Giants were forced to pay
attention to him.
</P>
<P>
   By the time that Sanders dashed to the end zone again on his
71-yard interception return, few Giants fans were around to see it.
There were heavy rains and Cowboys celebrations in the immediate
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   If you're scoring along at home, Deion extended his NFL record
for most career touchdowns scored by returns (16).
</P>
<P>
   All of his big plays last night included impromptu midfield
hosannas from Sanders. The Cowboys provided the scoreboard amens.

PETTITTE FAILS TO MAKE HIS CASE FOR THE PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For a while, Andy Pettitte appeared to have found a
relaxation technique Monday night. He was as loose as Jell-O as he
settled into an easy rhythm, looking like a pitcher without a care
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Then the fifth inning hit him like a tension headache. And the
same Pettitte who has stressed over his performances for the last
six weeks _ wondering how safe his spot on the playoff rotation is
_ grew tight and ineffective when the first sign of trouble
disrupted him at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   He could only look up at the night sky in disgust after giving
up a grand slam to Enrique Wilson, a substitute Cleveland player
who had just one home run on his major league resume. That was all
the ammunition the Indians and Charles Nagy (15-10) needed as they
defeated the Yankees, 4-1, and sent Pettitte to his fifth loss in
his last seven decisions.
</P>
<P>
   This was likely the last full start for Pettitte (16-11), who
may see only limited action in the Yankees' final game against
Tampa Bay on Sunday. While struggling for the last month, Pettitte
has been faced with questions about his role on the playoff roster.
He has had to ask himself what two pitchers manager Joe Torre will
decide to start behind David Wells and David Cone, with Pettitte,
Hideki Irabu and Orlando Hernandez to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   There was a look of concern on Pettitte's face this week when
Torre, who has admitted that he has been purposely vague about his
rotation intentions, acknowledged that Pettitte had a chance of
being left out. Before Monday night's game, Torre seemed to be
leaning in Pettitte's direction if for no other reason than his
playoff experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy has done it more than Irabu has,'' Torre said. ``He has
more in the bank. He has done it in the post-season, winning some
big games for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm asked if there is a chance, there's always a
chance,'' Torre said when discussing the possibility that Pettitte
will be left out of the rotation. ``But don't make too much out of
my vagueness.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte could have erased the gray area with a solid outing.
But it was not a particularly reassuring evening for the
left-hander. He left the game down, 4-0, after 111 pitches and
seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   After working through four scoreless innings, Pettitte began to
unravel against some unlikely threats in the fifth inning. With one
out, he allowed Alex Ramirez to record his first major league hit,
which was followed by a single from the ninth batter in the
Indians' order, Elnar Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   Out of sorts, Pettitte threw a wild pitch in the dirt and
proceeded to walk Omar Vizquel to load the bases. Up stepped the
unassuming Wilson, a backup second baseman just up from the minor
leagues who has had three stints in the majors. Wilson sent
Pettitte's first pitch into a high arc just inside the right-field
foul pole for a grand slam that gave Cleveland a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte could only kick the dirt on the mound, look up and
shake his head in frustration. Once again, his stuff was failing
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want him to go out there and trust his stuff,'' Torre
said before the game. ``I do not want him putting this in a test
tube.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte has been inspecting everything, stressing over the
details of his mechanics for the last six weeks. Instead of letting
go of a poor outing he had against Kansas City on Aug. 9, he seemed
to obsess over it as he tried to figure out what went wrong that
day, when he gave up eight hits and four runs in five and
two-thirds innings.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he began wrestling with his mechanics and
overthrowing. Trying too hard to do too much, he started gripping
the ball too tightly. Suddenly, his breaking ball was not breaking,
and batters were swatting away. The groove he had while going 12-5
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte's earned run average has climbed from 3.54 before Aug.
9 to 4.30. Nothing has felt right for Pettitte of late. He lost two
consecutive starts in mid-August, picked up a victory despite
giving up five runs, and then was torn apart for six runs in two
innings against the Chicago White Sox on Sept. 5. Last week,
Pettitte's tumble continued when he gave up six runs in six innings
against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   His velocity has not been the issue, not when his fastball was
registering 93 miles an hour. If he could only relax.
</P>
<P>
   ---------
</P>
<P>
   Inside Pitch
</P>
<P>
   With a day off, Mets second baseman Carlos Baerga &UR;  &LR; was in the
Indians clubhouse to see his former teammates Monday ... Manager
Joe Torre &UR;  &LR; admitted he would be keeping close tabs on the game
between the Anaheim Angels and the Texas Rangers, but not
necessarily because the Yankees will play one of those teams in the
first round of the playoffs. ``Todd Stottlemyre's pitching for
Texas,'' Torre said referring to the son of Yankee pitching coach,
Mel Stottlemyre. ``It'll be tough if we play Texas. I told Mel to
remind his wife where the paycheck comes from.''

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ After watching the videotape of President
Clinton's grand jury testimony on television Monday, Gov. Christie
Whitman of New Jersey called for him to resign, saying that ``his
disdain for the truth is a national disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement she gave in the midst of a five-day trade mission
that brought her to Mexico with 30 executives from top New Jersey
companies, Mrs. Whitman, a Republican, said that she was most
offended by Clinton's argument that his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky did not fit a narrow legal definition of sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard some of the definitions about what applied to
whom when, it was just mind-boggling,'' Whitman said. ``I don't
know what I can believe of what this president says now or in the
future about this or any other issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said that she had reached a personal decision after
catching portions of the grand jury videotapes on television in her
hotel room and at the U.S. Embassy here. She said she did not
consult with other members of the Republican Party about her
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Although at least a dozen Republican members of Congress have
called for Clinton's resignation, so far only four other governors,
all Republicans, have done so: David Beasley of South Carolina,
Kirk Fordice of Mississippi, George Voinovich of Ohio and Terry
Branstad of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans have worried that it might hurt their chances
in the next presidential election if Vice President Al Gore, who
has remained largely on the sidelines of the Lewinsky scandal,
steps into Clinton's position now. But Whitman said the political
calculus around Gore was ``immaterial'' to her decision.
</P>
<P>
   She made no criticism of Kenneth Starr, the independent council
who has been accused by Clinton and his allies of conducting a
prurient investigation into the president's personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is of the president's own making,'' she said. ``He could
have put this to rest seven months ago. But now we can't put this
genie back into the bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, speaking shortly after meeting with Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo, said that being in Mexico gave her an acute sense
of how Clinton's authority as a world leader has been ``seriously
undermined'' by the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   She said that if Clinton did not resign, she hoped that Congress
would conduct swift impeachment proceedings. ``I want to see this
issue put behind us,'' she said.

MACLEAN IS HOPING HE'LL FIT IN WITH RANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John MacLean and Bruce Driver began their National Hockey League
careers in 1983-84, and for more than a decade grew to prominence
with a New Jersey Devils franchise that became a league power and
won the Stanley Cup in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Driver, a defenseman, left the Devils after that championship
season and finished his career with three unfulfilling years as a
Ranger. In 1997-98, as the Blue Shirts floundered and missed the
playoffs, Driver became a scapegoat for hecklers in Madison Square
Garden and retired last summer at age 36.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough when guys you started to play with are starting to
retire,'' said MacLean, who will turn 34 on Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean, a right wing, stayed with New Jersey until early last
season, when he was traded to San Jose after 26 games. He was the
Devils' leader in games, goals, assists and points. Having joined
the Rangers as a free agent last summer, MacLean will try to help
revive the rebuilding Rangers on even-strength shifts and on the
power play. Garden fans are likely to scrutinize him carefully.
Their treatment of MacLean could depend on both his individual
performance and the success of the team that used to be his chief
rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to be judged on my play,'' MacLean said. ``I'm
making the commitment to helping the Rangers win. Nothing's forever
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   These circumstances could be starkly evident this week when the
two teams play a home-and-home series of exhibition games. They
meet at the Garden Wednesday night and at the Meadowlands on
Saturday. When asked whether he was eager to get the reintroduction
over with, MacLean replied: ``Yeah, I think so. I'm aware of the
situation, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing him in the red, white and blue of the Rangers will be
difficult for some Devils fans who remember MacLean's role in
pivotal Devils moments. One came in the final game of the 1987-88
season when MacLean scored against Chicago to force overtime before
adding the winning goal at 2 minutes 21 seconds of the extra
session. The victory put the Devils into the playoffs for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   Although he still lives in New Jersey and counts many Devils
among his friends, MacLean said the realities of the business
occurred to him this summer when talking with former teammates.
Things weren't quite the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a funny game,'' MacLean said. ``Once you're gone, you're
gone.'' Another former teammate, defenseman Ken Daneyko, is likely
to be targeting MacLean for hard checks. ``I'm sure he will be,''
MacLean said.
</P>
<P>
   With a smile, he added, ``Kenny looked for me in practice'' when
they were teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, former rivals become allies. When the Rangers and
Devils last met in the playoffs, in the second round during the
spring of 1997, MacLean swung his stick and broke a bone in the
wrist of New York's Niklas Sundstrom. That put Sundstrom out for
the rest of the playoffs and damaged the Rangers' chances of
upsetting Philadelphia in the third round. The Flyers eliminated
the Rangers in five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologized,'' MacLean said, referring to Sundstrom. ``He's
comfortable. I'm comfortable. I felt terrible about it. We're over
that. When it all came down, I felt bad about it. It was an
unfortunate incident, something I'm not proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one new teammate made him feel welcome with a gracious
gesture. Through his career, MacLean has worn the No. 15 while
scoring 360 goals in 15 seasons. In Ranger colors, that number
belonged to Darren Langdon, who gave it to MacLean at the start of
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unexpected,'' MacLean said. ``Darren gave it up.''
MacLean seemed grateful for the favor. ``I've had a lot of success
with that number,'' he said. ``Athletes tend to be superstitious.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first appearance as a Ranger at the Garden, in Sunday
night's 4-2 loss to Carolina, MacLean had no goals or assists. But
he looked comfortable on the power play, taking passes from Wayne
Gretzky and Brian Leetch that created scoring chances. As a
right-handed shooter, MacLean could be a crucial component of the
attack with the manpower advantage because a right-handed forward
can stand to the left side of the goal crease, which is smaller
this season, take passes from the right side and from behind the
goal line and one-time the shot without stopping the puck to tee it
up.
</P>
<P>
   At even strength, Ranger coach John Muckler wants an up-tempo
style of puck pressure in which his players will try to force
turnovers outside their blue line. The approach is radically
different from the Devils' style of waiting back passively in a
neutral-zone trap. Noting that MacLean scored 3 goals with the
Devils and 13 with the Sharks, Muckler suggested he might produce
more this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can score more than he did last year,'' Muckler said. ``He
won't be playing in Jersey. There was a disappointment there. He
didn't produce in the manner he could. He's an excellent checker,
but we want to use him in an offensive role.'' &QL;

 CRACK'S EFFECT ON BABIES IS REAL, EXPERTS SAY, BUT REVERSIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the first babies were born to crack addicts in
the mid-1980s, images of trembling infants with tubes up their
noses led to fears that such children were irreversibly damaged and
doomed to grow into violent misfits.
</P>
<P>
   The dire predictions failed to materialize by the early 1990s,
prompting a different conclusion: that cocaine causes no lingering
effects on children born to drug-addicted mothers. Instead, it was
asserted, whatever problems the children had could be attributed to
poverty and other environmental factors.
</P>
<P>
   Now many pediatricians and other child development specialists
who work with these children believe that the complex truth lies in
between.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run the risk of the pendulum swinging the other way and
saying, no, it's not cocaine, it's all the environment,'' said Dr.
Barry Lester, a professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at Brown
University School of Medicine. ``That would be a tremendous
disservice to thousands of children out there who need special
intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   While the specialists disagree about the extent and duration of
the damage caused to infants by cocaine, they do agree that early
intervention can help reverse any damage, whether it is caused by
drugs or bleak surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not doomed children,'' said Dr. Evelyn Davis, a
behavioral development pediatrician at Harlem Hospital Center.
</P>
<P>
   The studies of these children have been hindered by the mothers'
often rootless lives and the scattering of children into adoptive
and foster homes. But the lack of authoritative research has not
stopped one state, South Carolina, from prosecuting women for using
crack cocaine while pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is hardly academic for New York City, where crack
cocaine remains the most common street drug, and 15,371 newborns
tested positive for cocaine from 1988 to 1994, according to the
city Department of Health. They accounted for 1 percent of the
city's recorded births in 1994, down from a high of 2.3 percent of
the births in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute on Drug Abuse has estimated that in 1992,
45,000 women nationwide used cocaine during their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last year or so, it has become clear that cocaine can
affect the developing brain,'' said Dr. Alan I. Leshner, the
institute's director.
</P>
<P>
   Leshner said the evidence emerged after researchers who tested
the effect of cocaine on laboratory animals compared notes with
clinicians who examine children for medical, learning and
behavioral disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The problems can be treated, Leshner said. ``We don't want to
stigmatize these kids as a lost cause, but at the same time we
should not ignore that some of them have serious problems that need
to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been difficult to isolate crack's effect on babies
exposed in the womb because mothers who use cocaine also often
ingest alcohol, marijuana or even heroin. Pregnant addicts also
tend not to eat properly or get prenatal care.
</P>
<P>
   ``These issues alone, without cocaine, could cause children to
develop poorly,'' Lester said. ``What cocaine becomes is a form of
double jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   The picture may become clearer within a few years, after the
National Institutes of Health completes a wide-ranging maternal
lifestyle study involving 1,400 children born to drug users.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, previous smaller studies have yielded sometimes
contradictory evidence. For example, Brown University School of
Medicine conducted a study in 1996 of 1- and 2-day-old babies of 57
mothers, 20 of whom smoked crack during pregnancy. The study found
that the cocaine left infants tense and jittery after the sound of
a rattle or bell, or, alternatively, lethargic and indifferent. But
the study found no proof that cocaine in the womb inflicted
hemorrhages, lesions or other physical damage to the infants'
brains.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another New York doctor, Daniel Neuspiel, followed 250 babies
exposed to cocaine, tracking them for three to six years at North
Central Bronx Hospital, before his program ran out of money. He
found that the newborns were irritable, showed a quicker heartbeat
and had trouble eating and sleeping, but he said these symptoms
wore off after 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't observed persistent problems related to
cocaine,'' said Neuspiel, now a pediatrician at Beth Israel Medical
Center. ``The only consistent findings I've seen have been more in
their growth _ reduced birth weight, premature labor, smaller head
circumference.''
</P>
<P>
   Lester, who maintains a computer database of published research,
drew a somewhat different conclusion. He cited a statistical
summary concluding that the IQs of children exposed before birth to
drugs like heroin and cocaine run an average 3.26 points lower than
those of other children. The disparity is doubled, he said, in
measuring the children's ability to understand and express
language.
</P>
<P>
   Some pediatricians who work with inner city children have
noticed similar problems. From 1987 to 1996, Davis saw 530 young
children at Harlem Hospital Center who were exposed to cocaine in
the womb. Nearly half the children were born prematurely, a
condition to which she attributed at least some of their abnormal
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Davis reported that a third of the children experienced sleep
disturbances, nearly two-thirds had delayed language skills and
slightly more than half had delayed motor skills. One-third also
suffered from hyperactivity and attention deficit disorder, and two
out of five displayed behavioral disturbances. Only 12 percent of
the children were still with their mothers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine does not ravage every pregnancy where it is detected,
any more than alcohol does, but there is evidence that it can cause
problems, said Dr. Herbert Kleber, an addiction psychiatrist who
served in the Office of National Drug Control Policy under the Bush
administration. He is now a cocaine researcher and a professor of
psychiatry at Columbia University's College of Physicians and
Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists generally agree that cocaine increases the risk of
premature birth. Dr. Farrokh Shahrivar, the chairman of neonatology
at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center and Beth Israel Medical
Center, has examined newborns after delivery for 30 years. ``The
devastating effect of crack causes premature labor, separation of
the placenta, higher morbidity and mortality, a low birth weight
and other problems related to prematurity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kleber cited numerous studies showing that cocaine distorts the
sensitivity of receptors in the brain. And the immaturity of a
fetus' central nervous system, he said, makes it more vulnerable to
chemicals than an adult's.
</P>
<P>
   The effects are real but subtle, Kleber said. ``They could be
worsened or improved by many environmental factors, but that's true
of many conditions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vulnerability of such children has prompted the intervention
of programs like Hale House in Harlem, which has provided a home
and treatment to more than 3,000 infants exposed to illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They certainly do manifest problems,'' said Lorraine Hale, a
child development specialist who is president of Hale House. ``They
are cranky and, as they get older, their tendency is to get quite
moody.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hale has also marveled at their resilience. ``We thought
that the children would be a heck of a lot more damaged,'' she
said. ``We were pleasantly surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   At Dreitzer Women and Children's Treatment Center in East
Harlem, which is run by Project Return, a drug rehabilitation
network, the debate has not been lost on the mothers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   When Glenda C., a patient at Dreitzer, was pregnant and smoking
crack, she did not need a study to convince her that cocaine was
bad for her baby. ``I said, God, please encamp angels around my
unborn child,'' Glenda said. ``Every time I got a hit, I would
throw up. It was like she was rejecting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her observations about her 17-month-old daughter echo the
sometimes ominous, sometimes heartening findings of the medical
studies. ``They say that babies whose mothers are using crack are
very sensitive and easily upset,'' she said. ``I notice that my
daughter is sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, she added, ``I look at all the kids around here and
most of them seem to be doing just fine.''

EDITORIAL: NEW RESPECT FOR FOSTER PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 22:
</P>
<P>
   A federal district judge in New York City has taken an important
step toward recognizing the special relationship that exists
between long-term foster parents and children they are seeking to
adopt. The case stemmed from a caseworker's abrupt removal of a
4-year-old boy from the Bronx home of a foster mother who had cared
for him since he was a month old, and who was in the final stages
of the adoption process. The adoption was eventually approved, but
the foster mother sued anyway, arguing that her due process rights
had been violated when the city denied her a prompt hearing as well
as visitation rights.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Kimba Wood agreed. Her 50-page opinion asserted a
``constitutionally protected liberty interest in the stability and
integrity'' of the relationship between the foster mother and
child, and found that the city had indeed violated the mother's
right to due process.
</P>
<P>
   Wood carefully applied her ruling to a relatively small class of
foster children whose birth parents' rights have already been
terminated, and to foster parents who have cared for their foster
children continuously for more than a year and who have agreed to
adopt them. But the decision sends a broader message of respect for
parental relationships that are often more important in a child's
life than biological bonds.

COWBOYS CAN FIND HOME ATOP NFC LEAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Ask not if the Cowboys can survive the
Jason Garrett Era. Instead, start figuring the magic number for
winning the NFC Least.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett resurfaced here last night after four years of bench
hibernation. The Cowboys' defense resurfaced here last night eight
days after Denver humiliation. And for those waiting endlessly for
a big play from Big Bucks Deion, well, the Meadowlands had all that
and more.
</P>
<P>
   In a shockingly easy 31-7 rout of the Giants, many factors
turned up positive for the Cowboys. But as much as anything, it was
a team that came out poised, confident and coached, then improved
on that for four quarters. Those, of course, are items that lead to
Chan Gailey's front door.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it's only September, and even with the Denver thing
still a fresh memory, the Cowboys' performance last night meant
they are officially declared the team to beat in the NFC East. Part
of that is because the East is loaded with miserable clubs that
can't beat anybody, and if the Cowboys can just whip-up on the
division, that's eight wins right there. With two of the W's
already in the bag.
</P>
<P>
   The way the doctors figure it on Troy Aikman's collarbone,
Garrett will be quarterbacking for three more weeks. The way Gailey
will try to coach it is for Garrett to have three more weeks like
this one.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Garrett was el perfecto in both turnovers and
major mistakes. By playing miscue free in his first start in four
years, he never put pressure on himself or the Cowboys' defense.
Gailey, however, didn't hesitate to load up Garrett with added
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been questionable strategy for Gailey to
repeatedly put Garrett in the shotgun for third-and-short. Power
football in the first half with Emmitt Smith seemed to be the
proper call, except that the end result was a decisive Cowboys
victory. There's your proper call.
</P>
<P>
   And once Emmitt limped off late in the second quarter with a
strained groin muscle, the Cowboys finished up with a backfield of
Garrett and Sherman Williams. And never missed a beat, either.
Figure that one.
</P>
<P>
   While Garrett helped himself, he also had plenty of assistance
from an offensive line that kept him sack-free. The Giants'
once-proud defense found itself totally outplayed by a defensive
unit attempting to recover from a drilling in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Campo, the defensive coordinator, promised better days were
immediately ahead. And that promise was delivered.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so this wasn't the Denver machine, Campo and Co. were
facing. Then again, the NFL doesn't have many Denver machines.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, the Giants started off last night with a lot
of spread offense and quarterback Danny Kanell in the shotgun.
Obviously, these people had watched too much game film of the
Cowboys' performance against Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to copy-cat the Broncos' offense failed miserably, beaten
by a Cowboys' blitz that recorded two first-half sacks and a lot of
pressure on Kanell. By the time the Giants returned to their one
and only offensive weapon _ the power running game _ the Cowboys
also had that clamped.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his defense, which ended up with four sacks, Garrett
was never put in a position of playing scoreboard catch-up. There
was also no sweat about a scoreless first quarter in which the
Cowboys had but two first downs. The Giants weren't threatening
either.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second quarter, Deion set sail on a 59-yard punt
return for a touchdown to start an evening of big plays for him.
Even after the Giants tied the score late in the second quarter,
the turning point came before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   A Garrett slant pass to Billy Davis went 60 yards longer than
planned when three New York defenders pinballed each other, safety
Tito Wooten being the main culprit. Davis ended up with an 80-yard
touchdown play, which was followed by a Richie Cunningham field
goal, courtesy of a Kevin Mathis interception. Mathis was subbing
at corner for Deion, still exhausted from his punt return.
</P>
<P>
   It was 17-7 at halftime. There would be no Giants rally because
both the Cowboys' defense and Garrett had their games under
control.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, the Aikman injury and the defensive collapse had left
the Cowboys in a state of shock and uncertainty. Eight days later,
the same can be said for the Giants, defending champions of the NFC
East.
</P>
<P>
   A good game and a bad division did some Monday night wonders for
the Cowboys.

SANDERS, COWBOYS SURPRISE GIANTS, 31-7
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The biggest thing Cowboys coach Chan
Gailey feared was an injury to one of his players who had worked at
quarterback in place of Troy Aikman last week. And in the first
half last night against the New York Giants, the Cowboys' best hope
of winning lay flat on his back.
</P>
<P>
   This was Deion Sanders, not Jason Garrett, who needed medical
assistance. Sanders was tired, weak and dehydrated after
zig-zagging all over Giants Stadium with a 59-yard punt return for
a touchdown that broke a scoreless tie in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanders regained his health in the second half and knocked
out the Giants. Sanders completed his most dominating performance
in a Cowboys uniform, catching a 55-yard pass to set up one
touchdown and returning an interception 71 yards for another as the
Cowboys dominated the defending NFC East champion Giants, 31-7.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' performance took the pressure off Garrett, who was
making his first start in nearly four years while Aikman sits out
with a broken collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' victory ended a three-game losing streak to the
Giants, who suffered their first division loss since 1996. And
speaking of the division, the Cowboys (2-1) wake up this morning in
first place in the NFC East, sporting a one-game lead over the
Giants (1-2) and Arizona Cardinals (1-2).
</P>
<P>
   ``To come in here, against the defending champions, and play
with the emotion and focus that our team played with _ I was very
proud of them,'' Gailey said. ``A lot of times there were some
adverse situations, and I think we overcame them and made some big
plays. We had a lot of things that went well tonight, and I have to
give our players a lot of credit for the way they practiced and
prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will likely play three more games without Aikman.
But Garrett, in Aikman's place, showed last night that he can play
to not lose the game. He was not sacked and did not throw an
interception.
</P>
<P>
   And, nearly as important, Garrett made the big play when he had
to. After Sanders' punt-return touchdown, the Giants tied the score
on a 36-yard touchdown pass from Danny Kanell to Amani Toomer.
Sensing a change in momentum, the fans at Giants Stadium chanted
for defense. But Garrett quieted the crowd with an 80-yard
touchdown pass to Billy Davis. The play was made possible when
Davis beat Giants cornerback Phillipi Sparks on a slant route,
caught Garrett's ball at about the 35, and outran the rest of the
defenders the remaining 65 yards for the Cowboys' longest play from
scrimmage since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett was 12 of 28 for 222 yards on the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we asked Jason to do was make the throws he could make,''
Gailey said. ``I was impressed with the way that he handled the
ball. He did not make mistakes with the football or throw into
crowds. He threw deep when he had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Cowboys' defense shackled the Giants, limiting
Kanell and company to 252 total yards. The Cowboys' pass rush, a
point of contention all summer, came through with four sacks, one
each by Randall Godfrey, Omar Stoutmire, Leon Lett and Chad
Hennings.
</P>
<P>
   New York was held to 56 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, the Cowboys kept telling us, were not the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we handled stopping the run very well, especially
early in the ball game, and it allowed us to make some plays,''
Gailey said. ``Then we got those turnovers, and, when you get
those, you get the chance to put some points on the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders did the honors.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three years, since the Cowboys gave him the
richest signing bonus in league history, Sanders' dominance had
come quietly. On defense, quarterbacks refused to throw to his side
of the field. On offense, the Cowboys had given him the occasional
long pass. On special teams, he had returned a single punt for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanders' performance was loud last night. The punt return
for a touchdown and the interception return _ which gave the
Cowboys their final margin of victory, were his NFL career-leading
15th and 16th return touchdowns in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   His long reception set up Sherman Williams' 18-yard touchdown
run that gave the Cowboys a 24-7 lead in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an impressive display,'' Gailey said. ``He is really
an outstanding athlete, but the one thing that he said when we
walked into the dressing room was that this was a team victory.''

COWBOYS HAVE EXCUSES, BUT THE GIANTS NEED THEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Dallas Cowboys played the entire
game without their usual starting quarterback, Troy Aikman. They
played the second half without their best running back, Emmitt
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   At different times in Monday night's game against the Giants,
Deion Sanders, who scored two touchdowns in a virtuoso performance
as an offensive, defensive and punt-returning star, went to the
locker room because he was dehydrated. And Leon Lett, Dallas' best
defensive lineman, missed part of the game because of an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the Cowboys' excuses for playing poorly. But they
didn't need them.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who could use the excuses, played their worst game
since this time last year, when they opened the season by losing
three of their first four games.
</P>
<P>
   A dominating performance by the Cowboys Monday night in a 31-7
victory at Giants Stadium has temporarily shifted the balance of
power in the National Football Conference East.
</P>
<P>
   The defending champion Giants (1-2) have stumbled to an uneven,
skidding start. The Cowboys (2-1) have assumed the division lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first division loss for the Giants since 1996 and
ends a nine-game undefeated streak in the division. The Cowboys'
victory also makes them 6-0 against the Giants in Monday night
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' offense generated just 56 yards rushing while their
defense failed to create a turnover, or register a sack, and
allowed Dallas' quarterback, Jason Garrett, playing in place of the
injured Aikman, to complete 12 of 28 passes for 224 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' running attack, which the coaches had vowed to
improve this week, looked worse than ever. Fullback Charles Way was
the team's leading rusher with 26 yards on 9 carries.
</P>
<P>
   On third down, the Giants converted 4 of 16 attempts, continuing
their season-long struggle on third-down conversions.
</P>
<P>
   With 2 minutes and 25 seconds left in the fourth quarter,
Sanders intercepted Kanell and ran 71 yards for his second
touchdown of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell finished the game with 25 completions in 45 passing
attempts with 228 yards. He was intercepted twice.
</P>
<P>
   During the previous week of practice, the Cowboys worked on
including Sanders in the offense for the first time this season.
Sanders returned a punt for a touchdown in the second quarter, but
didn't have much impact from scrimmage offensively until the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After missing a portion of the second quarter because of
dehydration, Sanders, in one of the few times he was on the field
as a wide receiver, helped the Cowboys extend their 10-point
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders caught a 55-yard pass from Garrett, splitting the
Giants' defense as free safety Tito Wooten let Sanders get behind
him.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, running back Sherman Williams sliced through a
massive hole in the middle of the Giants' defense, dashing 18 yards
into the end zone for a 24-7 Dallas lead.
</P>
<P>
   All of the first-half scoring came in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, always dramatic, brought an end to a scoreless struggle
2:29 into the second quarter. His spectacular 59-yard punt return
for a touchdown gave the Cowboys a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders caught Brad Maynard's punt near the middle of the field
and initially broke left. Hemmed in by the Giants' pursuit, Sanders
reversed his field. He side-stepped in succession diving tackle
attempts by Greg Comella, Corey Widmer and Doug Colman.
</P>
<P>
   Turning the corner, Sanders received some good blocks from his
teammates as he headed up the sideline. Maynard was the last Giant
with a chance, though he was encircled by three Cowboys and never
got close to Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sanders' fourth punt return for a touchdown in the
National Football League and the 15th time he has scored on a
return of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   With 3:54 to play in the first half, the Giants finally showed
some life. A 36-yard touchdown pass from Kanell to Amani Toomer
tied the game and completed a nine-play Giants drive, their best of
the half.
</P>
<P>
   Twice on third down in this possession, the Giants kept their
drive alive _ Kanell finding Chris Calloway for a 14-yard pass
completion once and scrambling for 6 yards and a first down on
another third-down play.
</P>
<P>
   On the touchdown, Toomer burst past Dallas cornerback Kevin
Smith, making the catch at the goal line on a perfectly thrown pass
by Kanell. It was the high point of the Giants' night.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys regained the lead a little more than a minute later.
Garrett, playing for the injured Troy Aikman, threw the ball deep
down the middle of the field for wide receiver Billy Davis. As
Davis caught the football, Wooten flung himself at Davis' head and
shoulders in an attempt to make a tackle. Wooten missed Davis
entirely, but did knock two other Giants defenders, Percy Ellsworth
and Phillippi Sparks, out of the play.
</P>
<P>
   Free of the Giants' secondary, Davis sliced down the heart of
the playing field for an 80-yard touchdown and a 14-7 Dallas lead.
</P>
<P>
   A 40-yard Richie Cunningham field goal with 7 seconds left in
the first half gave the Cowboys a 17-7 lead at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham's kick was set up by a 19-yard pass interference
penalty on Sparks and a 10-yard completion from Garrett to Michael
Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, like the Oakland Raiders a week ago, seemed
prepared for most of the Giants' bread-and-butter plays _ the runs
inside to Charles Way and the short passes out of the backfield to
Way and Barber. And there was little unpredictable about the
Giants' early play-calling.
</P>
<P>
   There was the occasional new play _ like a reverse run for
Toomer, with Toomer lofting a pass over the head of Ike Hilliard
along the sideline. But too often, the Giants ran for small gains
and passed underneath the Cowboys' deep coverage for equally modest
pick-ups. &QL;

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
It won't become an issue until the season is over, but it's a
question everyone who cares anything about the Astros is dying to
have answered.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is Moises Alou staying or going?
</P>
<P>
   Because he was traded to the Astros after signing a multiyear
deal with the Florida Marlins, Alou has the right to demand a trade
at the end of the season. And if the Astros don't trade him, he
could become a free agent March 15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Rest easy, Astros fans. The team's star left fielder isn't
champing at the bit to get out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Dominican (Republic) gets a franchise, I'd demand a
trade for sure,'' Alou wisecracked about his native country. ``But
as of now, I just want to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   When last we checked, expanding into the Dominican was not on
baseball's agenda, so chances are good Alou will be sporting the
open-star logo on his cap next season. Nevertheless, his status
figures to be an issue after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something a lot of people have been asking me, and I
have to be real careful about what I say,'' said Alou, who leads
the Astros in home runs (38) and RBIs (122). ``Every day, I feel
different. The guys have treated me real well here, and I love
playing with these guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire the way they go about their business. It's really
been fun this year, and it's already September. It just seems like
two weeks ago when I was at the (horse racing) track in the
Dominican. Now, it's almost time to go back. That's the way it is
when you're having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   What's not to like? Alou has realistic expectations of being the
key player on a World Series championship team for the second year
in a row. Last year, he was voted Most Valuable Player of the
Florida Marlins, who defeated the Cleveland Indians in the Fall
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, Marlins owner H. Wayne Huizenga dismantled
the team for financial reasons. When Alou meets with Astros
management after this season, he will be looking for assurances
that owner Drayton McLane Jr. will continue to be committed to
putting a championship-caliber team on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. McLane is a lot nicer guy than Mr. Huizenga,'' Alou said.
``(McLane) loves to win. He wants to be a champion. I don't think
he will stop trying. I haven't known him for that long, but if he
wins, I think he would want to do it again. He wants to be a
champion so bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to talk after the season and see what happens. I
like it here, and I like it a lot. But we still have three weeks to
go _ more, hopefully _ and a lot of things can happen between now
and then. Winning is going to make a lot of difference in what I
do. If we win it all, I'll beg to come back to Houston. If we don't
(win it all), we'll talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see where this team is going. To me, it looks
pretty good. We have a new stadium coming, and I'm sure they would
like to go to the new stadium with a good team. Winning and having
a good team is something I'd like to see, if they want me to stay.
But I don't know if they're going to want me to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful the Astros would have traded pitching prospects
Oscar Henriquez, Manny Barrios and Mark Johnson if Alou weren't in
their long-range plans. The 32-year-old outfielder has three more
years and an additional $15 million on his contract, and the Astros
plan to see him patrolling left field in the new Ballpark at Union
Station, which is scheduled to open in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moises has been absolutely tremendous,'' general manager Gerry
Hunsicker said. ``We hope he will continue to be a part of this
ballclub. But now is not the time to comment on that situation,
because it's not an issue right now, certainly not on the eve of
the postseason. We're prepared to sit down after the postseason,
and if that situation presents itself, we'll address it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou and his family have found Houston to their liking, and he
said he would not look forward to playing for a fourth team in four
years, although early speculation has linked him to Los Angeles if
the Dodgers can lure his father, Felipe, away from Montreal as
their manager.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, that's pure speculation. Alou is contractually
bound to the Astros for another three years, and he realizes they
don't have to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my choice (to demand a trade),'' Alou said. ``But they
have a choice, too. They can do whatever they want with me. I don't
know if they like my personality here, but if they don't, I feel
like I can get a job somewhere next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou's personality seems to be more an issue for the fans and
media than for his teammates and employers, with whom he has gotten
along famously in his first Astros season. But those who make their
living thrusting notepads and cameras into Alou's face have done so
with mixed reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about that,'' Alou said. ``The press has to
understand that you're a human being and that sometimes you need
time to be alone and that you need time to be at your locker by
yourself. They need to understand that sometimes you didn't have a
good game, and there's no reason why you should be talking to the
press.
</P>
<P>
   ``That probably costs me a lot of (All-Star and MVP) votes, fans
and maybe even money. But my job here is to produce. If I'm doing a
good job, playing hard and we're winning, then I'm happy. I hate to
lose, and I hate it when we don't play the way we're supposed to
play. I hate when someone is scared to play or when someone doesn't
give 100 percent. I hate when we don't make the right moves.
There's a lot of things that I hate. No. 1 for me is my family.
After that, it's what I do here (on the baseball field). What
people think about me is way down there on the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a flashy guy. I may not be a press favorite because of
my personality, but one thing I know is how to play, how to win and
how to get along with these guys, and that's very important. There
are a lot of things more important to me than earning fans. I know
I'm a good guy, and I know I'm a friendly guy, but a lot of people
have a different perspective about my personality and the way I am.
If you ask around and ask people in the game, they'll say positive
things about me.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Alou has positive opinions about returning to Houston,
and the Astros hope that's the way it stays.

RANGERS THROTTLE ANGELS, 9-1, TAKE AL WEST LEAD

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Rangers manager Johnny Oates remains convinced
that pitching will determine the American League West title.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching, though, relies greatly on dependable defensive play.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, that facet _ one of Oates' greater sources of concern the
past 25 weeks _ was the essential element of the Rangers' 9-1
victory against the Angels last night at Edison International Field
of Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers played almost flawlessly in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, the vastly superior defensive unit for the past 25
weeks, did not.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, save one fifth-inning error by center fielder Tom
Goodwin, made every play behind right-hander Todd Stottlemyre, who
pitched seven scoreless innings for his fifth victory in nine
decisions since being acquired July 31.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth consecutive start of seven innings or more for
Stottlemyre, who improved his earned-run average to 2.10 in four
September appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Rangers will play the Angels tonight leading the
division by one game with six remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not change my stance: If we pitch well, we will win,''
Oates said. ``I've been saying that for six months now.''
</P>
<P>
   Superior defense cultivates well-pitched ballgames.
</P>
<P>
   Angels right-hander Steve Sparks (9-4) witnessed how detrimental
plays not made can be during his 32/3-inning appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, whose .984 fielding percentage ranked behind only
the Orioles and Devil Rays before yesterday, gift-wrapped two and
perhaps as many as five runs before Sparks' premature departure.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' woes in the field began with a first-inning ground
ball that second baseman Randy Velarde misplayed, and it resulted
in the first of two unearned runs charged against Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers second baseman Mark McLemore reached on Velarde's
one-out error and advanced to third and later scored on singles by
left fielder Rusty Greer and right fielder Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Chad Kreuter, whom the Angels acquired Saturday, joined
the defensive malaise in the second inning. Rangers first baseman
Lee Stevens led off the inning with a single and attempted to score
on a double to right-center field by third baseman Todd Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   The throw to the plate by Velarde appeared to be in time to
retire Stevens, but Kreuter failed to control the ball after
contact from the sliding runner. Zeile advanced to third as the
ball rolled away from Kreuter, and that proved costly. Sparks, who
relies on the knuckleball, issued a two-out wild pitch that allowed
Zeile to score the Rangers' second unearned run.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks contributed to the Angels' woes by failing to cover first
base on a poorly hit, fourth-inning ground ball by Zeile. Velarde
went into the hole to retrieve the ball, but Zeile beat the pitcher
to the bag for a one-out, infield single.
</P>
<P>
   The out not recorded was a significant contributor to the
Rangers' two-run fourth inning. Zeile advanced to third on a double
by shortstop Royce Clayton and scored on a sacrifice fly ball by
Goodwin that should have been the third out. Clayton scored on a
two-out single by Greer, and the Rangers never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   The victory ensures that the Rangers will leave Anaheim no worse
than one game behind the Angels before their four-game,
season-finale series against the Mariners.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ There are good times and bad times. There
is wartime and peacetime. There is big-time and small-time. There
is teatime and mealtime. But only one Prime Time. Praise the Lord.
</P>
<P>
   He has played both professional baseball and football. He has
partied like the devil from coast to coast and is now a helmeted,
traveling preacher in search of lost souls.
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders has found religion, and now he wants to show you
the path, whether you're searching or not.
</P>
<P>
   No more Neon Deion, he says. No more flocking to the bright
lights, only the one true light. Rather than challenge authority,
he now challenges all of us to make the same conversion. The former
wise guy who once allegedly tried to run down a parking-lot
security guard with a motorcycle now says he wants to be a role
model.
</P>
<P>
   You believe him or you don't. As with the presidential
deposition, there is no middle ground. You defend him or you detest
him, love him or loathe him. But you can never take your eyes off
him. Not when he's between the lines of any game he's playing.
</P>
<P>
   If Muhammad Ali was the one to introduce charisma and flash to
the world of sports, Prime Time is the leading practitioner of the
late 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   See him point a finger straight up to the sky before dropping
back deep to settle under his first punt of the night early in the
first quarter Monday. See him run like a crazed mouse through a
maze after gathering in another punt early in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   See Sanders start left and come almost nose-to-nose with a
couple of would-be tacklers. See him spin around on a dance step
niftier than Travolta and loop all the way to the right sideline.
See him make one, two, three men miss. See him cut back one more
time to the left and go all the way to the end zone, high-stepping
the final five yards of a 59-yard touchdown return.
</P>
<P>
   See Sanders step in front of a Danny Kanell pass intended for
David Patten with 2:25 left in the fourth quarter and take it back
71 yards for another TD.
</P>
<P>
   If this was Monday Night Football, then it was prime time. If
that was a flash of sheer brilliance, then it was Prime Time.
</P>
<P>
   His special-teams coach, Joe Avezzano, dropped his jaw in
amazement. The New York Giants simply dropped to the turf dead,
dead, dead.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when the Cowboys played the entire game without
starting quarterback Troy Aikman and the second half without
running back Emmitt Smith, they needed true inspiration, divine or
otherwise. And it was Sanders who gave it to them.
</P>
<P>
   The lightning rod for controversy was the crackling bolt who
split the game wide open like an old tree trunk and lifted the
Cowboys to a 31-7 victory.
</P>
<P>
   For a night, there was no need for the Cowboys to worry that
Aikman stood on the sidelines nursing a broken collarbone while
Jason Garrett made only his third start in the NFL. For a night,
the Cowboys could overlook the fact that Smith gained just 21 yards
on seven carries and had to retire at the half with a strained
right groin.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game that may not change the Cowboys' entire season,
but it kept them from slipping over the edge. Garrett did his job
and didn't lose it. Sanders did his magic and stole it.
</P>
<P>
   It was desperation time. It was Prime Time, Rev. Gold Chain, the
man of the hour. He returns punts, catches passes, defends the
corner and makes interceptions. He can probably sing, dance and
carry a refrigerator on his back, too. After all, we saw him carry
the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dreary contest of exchanged punts until Sanders grabbed
a line drive off the foot of Brad Maynard and went on a mad dash
through the minefield to give Dallas a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   He strutted, he celebrated, and then he staggered to the
sidelines dehydrated and promptly vomited. He went to the locker
room at halftime, got an intravenous replenishment and came back
for more. And more.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders barely appeared in training camp, recovering from ankle
surgery and then a fractured rib. But apostles apparently don't
need training.
</P>
<P>
   On the second possession of the third quarter, he lined up at
wide receiver and split Giants Carlton Gray and Tito Wooten to make
a 55-yard catch and set up the Cowboys' third touchdown. Then, for
good measure, he picked off Kanell and ran that one back, too.
</P>
<P>
   He has 16 return touchdowns in his career _ eight interceptions,
four punts, three kickoffs and one fumble _ and has also caught
three TD passes and rushed for another score.
</P>
<P>
   He is larger than life and faster than a hummingbird's pulse. On
this night, he was the Cowboys' heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Lifetime. Big-time. Prime Time.

   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts of the testimony of Monica
Lewinsky, who appeared before the grand jury convened by the
independent counsel on Aug. 6 and Aug. 20, the second time three
days after President Clinton had testified.
</P>
<P>
   REGARDING THE JURORS
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: Can you guys call me Monica? Are they allowed to
call me Monica instead of Ms. Lewinsky? I was just _ THE
FOREPERSON: If you say so. THE WITNESS:Okay
</P>
<P>
   EMMICK:
</P>
<P>
   Sure. THE WITNESS: I'm just 25. Please.  &LR; A JUROR: But you'll
always be Ms. Lewinsky, whether you're 25 or 28 or _ THE WITNESS:
Not if I get married.
</P>
<P>
   ROMANCE
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: OK. Your relationship with the president, did your
mother at any time try to discourage the relationship?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: Oh, yes.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: Well, what kept it going? I mean, what kept it _ you
keeping it active or whatever?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: I fell in love.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: I beg your pardon? I couldn't hear you.
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: I fell in love.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: When you look at it now, was it love or a sexual
obsession?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: More love with a little hit of obsession. But
definitely love.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: Did you think that the president was in love with you
also?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: There was an occasion when I left the White House
and I was pretty stunned at how I felt because I did think that.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: You did?
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL EMMICK (one of the Starr prosecutors): Do you remember
the date?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: It was July 4, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: Were you aware that he was having problems in his
marriage? Did this ever spill over in the times that you were
together? Did you get a feeling that something was not right, that
_
</P>
<P>
   (An exchange regarding her answer has been deleted by the house
judiciary committee.)
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: And today, Monica, do you still love the president?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: Before Monday, I would have said yea.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: So then it is no?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: I don't know how I feel right now.
</P>
<P>
   EMMICK: A question in the front?
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: I guess I would like to know what happened Monday to
make you just by Thursday change your mind so completely.
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: I don't think it's so much changed my mind. I think
_ it's _ it was very painful for me to watch his speech on Monday
night. I _ it's _ it's hard for me to feel that he has
characterized this relationship as a service contract and that that
was never something that I ever thought it was. And _
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: I'm sorry, you lost me already.
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's _ from my understanding
about what he testified to on Monday, not _ just from the press
accounts, is that this was a _ that this was a service contract,
that all I did was perform oral sex on him and that that's all that
this relationship was. And it was a lot more than that to me and I
thought it was a lot more than that.
</P>
<P>
   And I think I felt _ I was hurt that _ that he didn't even _
sort of acknowledge me in his remarks. And even also _ I mean, that
has to do with directly with me, but I thought he should have
acknowledged all the other people that have gone through a lot of
pain for seven months.
</P>
<P>
   I feel very responsible for a lot of what's happened, you know,
in the seven months, hut I tried _ I tried very hard to do what I
could to not _ to not hurt him. I'm still not answering your
question.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: Well, let's _ you said the relationship was more than
oral sex. I mean, it wasn't like you went out on dates or anything
like that like normal people, so what more was it?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: Oh, we spent hours on the phone talking. It was
emotional.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: Phone sex?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: Not always. On a few occasions. I mean, we were
talking. I mean, interacting. I mean, talking about what we were
thinking and feeling and doing and laughing.
</P>
<P>
   We were very affectionate, even when _ after he broke the
relationship off in May, I mean, when I'd go to visit with him,
we'd _ you know, we'd hug each other a lot. You know, he always
used to like to stroke my hair. He _ we'd hold hands. We'd smile a
lot. We discussed a variety _ you know, a wide range of things.
</P>
<P>
   So, I mean, it was _ there was a real component of a
relationship to it and I just _ I thought he had a beautiful soul.
I just thought he was just this incredible person and when I looked
at him I saw a little boy and _ I don't know what the truth is any
more.
</P>
<P>
   And that's, I think, what I took away on Monday, was that I
didn't know what the truth was. And so how could I know the truth
of my love for someone if it was based on him being an actor.
</P>
<P>
   HER MEMORY
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is it that you remember all the events in such detail
over really sort of what is a few years?
</P>
<P>
   A. I've always been a date-oriented person and I had a _
probably a habit of circling dates in my Filofax when I either
talked to the president _ or saw him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And did you provide those Filofax sheets to the Office of
Independent Counsel?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And did that assist you in remembering the dates?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, it did.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And were these encounters important to you?
</P>
<P>
   A. Very.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   LINDA TRIPP
</P>
<P>
   Q: OK. How much about your relationship with the president did
you tell Linda Tripp?
</P>
<P>
   A: A lot. Most everything.
</P>
<P>
   Q: OK. And did you tell her about the sexual encounters that you
had with him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yea.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you also tell her about the emotional encounters and the
gifts?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were you truthful about the relationship when you told Linda
Tripp about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most of the time, but sometimes _ there were occasions when I
wasn't truthful.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were you truthful about the sexual parts of the relationship
with her?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And what about the emotional component, when you would tell
her _ and why don't I say before December of 1997, were you
truthful about the emotional components of the relationship?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   HER MOTHER
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: Ms. Lewinsky, before you go into that, I just remember
you saying something with Linda Tripp, you know, what was not the
truth, OK? And I just remembered, was one of the things that you
told her, that you gave your mother the blue dress, one of the
untruths or was that true?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: I don't know if I ever told Linda I gave my mom the
blue dress. One of the things I did say was that I gave everything
to my mom, so that probably included that and that was not true. I
didn't give the evidence to my mom. My mom never hid the dress. She
didn't know it was in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: OK.
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: So she didn't know anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: I've got one of those questions that goes along with
what she just said.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: OK. Fine. That's that idea. That topic.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: How much did your mom really know?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: She knew _ she knew that I was having a
relationship with the president. She knew that _ she knew that I
was certainly emotional about it and that it made me miserable a
lot and that sometimes I was elated and sometimes I was miserable,
but I didn't _ you know, I _ I might have said something to her
like, ``We fooled around,'' but I _ not _ she didn't know as much
as I led Linda to believe she knew. Is that _
</P>
<P>
   PAULA JONES
</P>
<P>
   Q: At some point, did you talk with him about possibly settling
the Paula Jones case?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, I had _ I had had a thought and then had a conversation
with Linda about this and just a way that he could settle the case
and I suggested it it to him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And what was that way? Hot in a lot of detail, but _.
</P>
<P>
   A: The gist of it is, I thought that first Mrs. Clinton should
do something publicly, maybe on a TV. show or something, and talk
about how difficult the case had been for her and on her daughter
and that she just wished that he would settle it and it would go
away. And then the president should unannounced and unexpectedly go
into the briefing room, make a brief statement that he _ in an
effort to put this behind him, you know, against his attorneys'
advice, he was going to pay Ms. Jones whatever it was, however much
she wanted, and so that this case would be over with.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did the two of you talk about how much the settlement amount
would be or might be?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. I believe at some point I had mentioned that I had
recently read the _ I think she had lowered her _ the amount that
she wanted to $500,000 or something lower and he said, ``I thought
it was a million or two million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   And I thought that was Very strange, that he wouldn't know she
had _ you know, that her lawyers _ or his lawyers had not told him
that she had lowered her request for money. Or I don't know how you
say that legally, whatever it is that she did.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Right. Demand. probably.
</P>
<P>
   A: The demand was lower.
</P>
<P>
   VERNON JORDAN
</P>
<P>
   Q: I think you also said you feel some _ I don't know if this is
the reason you don't remember it, but you have expressed to us that
you feel some guilt about Vernon Jordan. Is that correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   Q: That's a yes?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: OK. Can you tell us why that is?
</P>
<P>
   A: He was the only person who did what he said he was going to
do for me and _ in getting me the job. And when I met with Linda on
the 13th, when she was wearing a wire, and even in subsequent or
previous conversations and subsequent conversations, I attributed
things to Mr. Jordan that weren't true because I knew that it had
leverage with Linda and that a lot of those things that I said got
him into a lot of trouble and I just _ he's a good person and _.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is one example of _ and then I'll leave this topic, is one
example of one of the things you told Linda that isn't true, ``I
told Vernon Jordan no job, no affidavit''? Something along those
lines?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Because Linda made me promise her that on the 9th.
</P>
<P>
   Q: OK. Of January?
</P>
<P>
   A: Of January.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: I'm a little confused. When you said that you said
certain things because you know Linda had the mike, right?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: Oh, I didn't know Linda had the mike. I now know
that she was wearing a wire.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: OK. But so why would you say these things about Mr.
Jordan that were not true? What was the reason?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: Because _ I had _ from some of my conversation with
Linda. I started to think that she was a little bit jealous that
Mr. Jordan was helping me get a job in New York and that I was
leaving the Pentagon and that _ she had remarked one time that _
that, you know. Mr. Jordan who is the most powerful, you know, man
in this city got me my attorney and she _ she thinks that she only
had _ you know, this dinky attorney or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   And I was _ I was so desperate for her to _ I was _ for her to
not reveal anything about this relationship that I used anything
and anybody that I could think of as leverage with her. I _ her,
the president, my mom, everybody. I mean, not her, but Mr. Jordan,
the president, my mom. Anybody that I thought would have any kind
of influence on her, I used.
</P>
<P>
   Does that answer your question?
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: Well, it doesn't. I guess what I'm trying to figure
out, OK, is what was that going to accomplish? Was that going to
make her _ what?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: Well, specifically, with the statement about I
won't sign the affidavit until I get the job, is that I had a
conversation with Linda, which we'll probably get to _.
</P>
<P>
   EMMICK: I hope.
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: Oh. On January 9th and in that conversation, she
had told me she had changed her mind. she was going to be vague on
the truth about Kathleen Willey and then she told me _ at that
point, I had told her I hadn't signed an affidavit when I had and I
told I didn't have a job yet and I knew I was probably going to be
getting a job that day.
</P>
<P>
   And she said, ``Monica, promise me you won't sign the affidavit
until you get the job. Tell Vernon you won't sign the affidavit
until you get the job because if you sign the affidavit before you
get the job, they're never going to give you the job.''
</P>
<P>
   And I didn't want her to think that I had gone ahead and done
anything without her and that I was leaving her in the dark. I
wanted her to feel that _ sort of Linda and myself against everyone
else because I felt like I needed to hold her hand through this in
order to try to get her to do what I wanted, essentially.

   `I WOULD ALWAYS DENY IT'
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: Ms. Lewinsky, did you ever discuss with the president
whether you should delete documents from your hard drive, either at
the office or at home?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: No.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: Nothing like that?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: No.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: Did you ever discuss with the president whether you
should deny the relationship if you were asked about it?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: I think I always offered that. I think I've always
_
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: In discussions with the president?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: In discussions _ I told him I would always _ I
would always deny it, I would always protect him.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: And what did he say when you said that? What kind of
response did you receive?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: I said that often. I _ in my head, I'm seeing him
smile and I'm hearing him saying ``That's good,'' or _ something
affirmative. You know. Not _ not _ ``Don't deny it.''
</P>
<P>
   SAFETY
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: Did you ever suggest to Linda Tripp that she delete
e-mails or anything like that from her computer? THE WITNESS: Yes,
I did. A JUROR: And did you tell her that you had done the same
thing? THE WITNESS: Yes, I believe so. A JUROR: And did anyone ever
suggest to you or tell you that you should do that? THE WITNESS:
No. -ynw &LR; A JUROR: Did you tell Linda Tripp that anyone had
suggested that to you? THE WITNESS: I don't think so. A JUROR:
Okay. Thank you. A JUROR: Any others? A JUROR: In that end of that
year timeframe, did you ever tell Linda Tripp that you felt
physically at risk? THE WITNESS: I think so. I think I told her
something about _ that _ that _ I said something about Mary Jo
what's-her-name. A JUROR: Kopechne. THE WITNESS: Kopechne. And so _
I really didn't feel threatened, but I was trying to use anything I
could to try to convince her not to tell. So that I thought that if
she thought I was threatened and that was part of the reason, then
she would maybe do the same. A JUROR: So you did not at any time
feel that your personal security was at risk from that White House
or anyone in the White House? THE WITNESS: No. I think that maybe
there _ there _ maybe once or twice it had crossed my mind in some
bizarre way because everybody's heard about the different _ you
know, sure, there's the Marilyn Monroe theory. And so it _ but it
was not _ it was not any factor of _ that related to my actions. A
JUROR: So any discussion that you had about the whole topic with
Linda Tripp would fall into what you were describing before as a
little bit of fabrication? THE WITNESS: Yes. Yes. BY EMMICK: Q: If
I could ask a follow-up on that, did your mother ever express any
concerns about your safety? A: I think she might have, but it was
sort of that _ I think it was more general. It might have been a
more general sense.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CONTACT IN PUBLIC
</P>
<P>
   EMMICK: There is a reference on page 5 to August 18th of '96, a
Sunday, ``Public function, president's 50th birthday party, limited
intimate contact.'' . . . What does that mean? THE WITNESS: It's
stupid. There was a cocktail reception for his _ he had this big
50th birthday party at Radio City Music Hall and there was a
cocktail reception and at the _ when he came to do the rope line
and he _ after he greeted me and talked to me, he was talking to a
whole bunch of people in and around my area and I had _ can I stand
up and show you?
</P>
<P>
   EMMICK: Sure. Sure. THE WITNESS: Okay. If this is the rope line
and here are all the people and the president's standing here, as
he started to talk to other people, I had my back to him and I just
kind of put _ put my hand behind me and touched him. This _ so _
MS. IMMERGUT: Q: Touched him in the crotch area? A: Yes. A JUROR: I
didn't hear that. MS. IMMERGUT: Touched him in the crotch area. A
JUROR: Oh. MS. IMMERGUT: And the response was yes. A JUROR: Okay.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: Did anybody see you?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: What? No. What's the question?
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: Did anybody see you?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: No.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: But there were people around. THE WITNESS: There were,
but it was _ he was talking _ everybody was enamored with him. I'm
sure everybody saw from Monday that _ and he was talking to
different people and he _ he was always very close to me when _
whenever he'd do these rope lines and would sort of make a point of
talking to me around _ you know, with other _ while other people
were there and he'd usually hold my hand _ you know, sort of
shaking hands and just _ would continue to just touch me somewhere.
I mean, not _ not intimately, not _

<P>
   ON TIES
</P>
<P>
   Q: You mentioned, obviously, that you've given the president
several gifts. Have you given him any ties? A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many ties have you given him, just approximately?
</P>
<P>
   A:Six.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you had any conversations with the president about
wearing your ties? A: Almost all of our conversations included
something about my ties.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you just briefly describe what things that you've said
to him and he to you about wearing the ties?
</P>
<P>
   A: I used to bug him about wearing one of my ties because then I
knew I was close to his heart. Q: And did he ever say anything
about _ after he had one of your ties or to alert you when he had
worn any of your ties?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, there were several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And what kind of thing would he say to you?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Did you see I wore your tie the other day?''
</P>
<P>
   Q: So was he aware based on things you had told him that you
would be looking out for when he would wear ties on various
occasions?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'd like to show you now what's marked as Grand Jury Exhibits
ML-8, 9 and 10. .. . Directing your attention first to ML-8, it's a
photograph of the president, obviously. Do you recognize the tie
that he's wearing in that photograph?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, I do. Q: Had you actually seen that on television on
June 24, 1998?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, I did.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you recall what that's in relation to or what event is
being depicted on that photograph?
</P>
<P>
   A: He was leaving for China.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And now directing your attention to Exhibit 9, do you know
what that's a photograph of? A: I don't know where it's from, but
it's the president wearing my tie. Q: And this one states it's
Monday, July 6, 1998. Do you remember watching any of the media on
that date? A: Yes, I do. Q: And do you remember seeing him wearing
your tie on that date?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, I do. Q: Do you remember what event was taking place on
that date that he was wearing your tie?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't, but I just saw it says ``Medicare costs,'' so _ Q:
Okay. And then finally. ML-10. Do you recognize what that's a
photograph of?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Q: And what is that? A:
</P>
<P>
   The president wearing the same tie. Q: And do you know what date
that is? A: Date? It was a few days after, he wore the tie when he
came back from China, so it's July 9th.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Okay. And what _ I guess _ did you reach any conclusions from
the fact that he was wearing your tie on those days? A: I _ I _ I
think _ the first time he wore the tie, I thought maybe it was a
coincidence, but I didn't really think so.
</P>
<P>
   COORDINATING SCHEDULES
</P>
<P>
   (During questioning of Lewinsky by prosecutors on 7/30/98, Ms.
Lewinsky said that she called Betty Currie to arrange a meeting
with the president on May 24, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors' notes show Lewinsky suggesting a deeper
involvement by Currie than she had supposed before:)
</P>
<P>
   ``Currie said that she had to check Mrs. Clinton's schedule and
said Mrs. Clinton was going to use the pool that day. This was the
only time that Lewinsky actually knew that Currie had factored in
the whereabouts of Mrs. Clinton with Lewinsky's visits to the
president. Mrs. Clinton never saw Lewinsky in the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SIGN-OFF
</P>
<P>
   THE FOREPERSON: Basically what we wanted to leave with, because
this will probably be your last visit to us, I hope, I hope I'm not
going to have to do this any more and I hope you won't have to come
here any more, but we wanted to offer you a bouquet of good wishes
that includes luck, success, happiness and blessings.
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: Thank you. (The witness begins to cry.) I
appreciate all of your understanding for this situation and your _
your ability to open your heart and your mind and _ and your soul.
I appreciate that.
</P>
<P>
   THE FOREPERSON: So if there's nothing else?
</P>
<P>
   EMMICK: Nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   THE FOREPERSON: We'd like to excuse you and thank you very much
for your testimony.

RENDON GRANTED RELEASE FROM USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC kicker Adam Rendon, who has been suspended
since the spring, has been granted his release and will transfer to
another school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked for his transfer request and it was granted,'' USC
coach Paul Hackett said Monday. ``We said he could go.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendon was suspended for poor academic performance and because
he had missed several study sessions last spring. ``In Adam's case,
he has not done the things he needed to do to get reinstated,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   The pair met after the start of the season, but Hackett made it
clear Rendon would probably never be brought back onto the team.
</P>
<P>
   Rendon, who is believed to be interested in transferring to a
Western Athletic Conference school, will have one year of
eligibility remaining. He handled kickoffs for the Trojans and was
0 for 2 on field goals last season.
</P>
<P>
   Harris in doubt: Tight end Antoine Harris, who has been bothered
by a recurring sprained ankle injury, will probably be ``limited''
against Florida State, according to Hackett. Harris, who injured
the ankle against San Diego State, did not play last week against
Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   Former quarterback John Fox will back up freshman Lonnie Ford if
Harris is unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Three other injured starters _ linebacker Mark Cusano, strong
safety Grant Pearsall and defensive end Lawrence Larry _ are
expected to play.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said centers Eric Denmon (sprained ankle) and Matt
McShane (strained knee) are probably out for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Colossal spread: USC is listed as a 17{-point underdog to
Florida State. It is believed to be the largest margin the Trojans
have opened as an underdog in at least 15 years. USC was a 17-point
underdog last year against Washington and was also a 17-point
underdog against the Huskies in 1991.

FLOJO DIDN'T KNOW MEANING OF CAN'T-DO
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Upon obliterating the world record in the 100
meters in 1988 in one of the more extraordinary sports performances
of the century, Florence Griffith Joyner said the secrets of her
startling success were ``vitamins, amino acids and water.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Griffith Joyner's close friend Jeanette Bolden let
slip one other secret the tireless sprinter had neglected to
mention:
</P>
<P>
   Norman Vincent Peale.
</P>
<P>
   Forget for a moment Griffith Joyner's flamboyant racing attire
and the legs that could have been sculpted by Michelangelo. What
Bolden would like for people to bear in mind as the world mourns
the passing of the Suzanne Lenglen of track and field is the extent
to which Griffith Joyner was powered by positive thinking
throughout her seven-year sojourn toward overnight success.
</P>
<P>
   Peale's 1974 self-help book, ``You Can If You Think You Can,''
was Griffith Joyner's road map as she made her way from a childhood
of poverty in Watts to world prominence. Peale's words were oxygen
for her soul. She consumed the lessons of chapters such as ``All
the Resources You Need Are in Your Mind.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how Bolden will remember Griffith Joyner, as a testament
to the power of the perseverance and repose and rapture that Peale
preached.
</P>
<P>
   Others may recall that during Griffith Joyner's star turn at the
1988 Summer Olympics, her stunning musculature raised rumors of
steroid use. The suspicions that shadowed Griffith Joyner in Seoul,
South Korea, as she became the first American woman in track and
field to win four Olympic medals are certain to resurface in the
wake of her untimely death Monday of a heart seizure at the age of
38.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner's world records in the 100 and 200 meters,
however magnificent, weren't meant to outlast her. We question what
we can't comprehend. She was supposed to pass the torch like an
invisible baton to Marion Jones, not succumb to something that
strikes superbly conditioned athletes and couch potatoes alike.
</P>
<P>
   In the race against time that engages us all, Griffith Joyner
had survived at least one false start. She was on a flight from
California to St. Louis two years ago when she suffered a seizure.
She was hospitalized one night and released and that was the last
anybody heard about that.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise there. Griffith Joyner lived her life the way she
ran her races, catapulting out of the blocks and never so much as
glancing back. She was 7 when she ran her first race as part of a
youth sports program spearheaded by Sugar Ray Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time it seemed the only things she couldn't outrun
were the bills. Griffith Joyner set school records in the sprints
and long jump at Jordan High, then enrolled at Cal State Northridge
where she befriended Bolden and came under the tutelage of Bob
Kersee.
</P>
<P>
   She later dropped out of CSUN and took a job as a bank teller,
her athletic dreams derailed by financial realities. Kersee
accepted a job at UCLA and found financial aid for Griffith Joyner
so she could join him.
</P>
<P>
   Bolden also followed Kersee to Westwood and became Griffith
Joyner's roommate and confidant.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always had the single-mindedness that nothing was going to
stand in her way,'' Bolden said. ``I remember our first year at
UCLA, she came back from the national (collegiate) championships
and said, `We need to have more endurance.' So the next week,
instead of running two laps, she'd do four. She just doubled all
the distances.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner's extra effort didn't go for naught. In 1984,
she made the U.S. Olympic team (as did Bolden) and won a silver
medal in the 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   By 1986, Griffith Joyner was wondering if that was as good as it
would get. Figuring it was time to get on with life, she took a job
as a bank secretary and settled into semi-retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Kersee came to the rescue, coaxing her back onto the
track. It helped that she could find triple-jumper Al Joyner there;
Joyner and the former Delorez Florence Griffith were wed on Oct.
10, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The following July, during the quarterfinals of the 100 meters
at the Olympic Trials in Indianapolis, Griffith Joyner lowered the
world record from 10.76 seconds to 10.49.
</P>
<P>
   To frame Griffith Joyner's masterpiece, people at the time were
projecting, based on past improvements, that no woman would run as
fast as 10.65 before the year 2000. Griffith Joyner didn't just
push the performance envelope, she pulverized it.
</P>
<P>
   In the final in Seoul, she exploded out of the blocks faster
than did the men's champion, Ben Johnson, and sailed to a
wind-aided 10.54. She set a world record of 21.34 in the 200 meters
and was a member of the winning 400 relay and the second-place
1,600 relay.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Games were over, Johnson, a Canadian, would be
stripped of his gold medal after testing positive for the anabolic
steroid stanozolol. Griffith Joyner came under a cloud of
suspicion, having earlier acknowledged adopting Johnson's
weight-training program in the year leading up to the Games, but
she passed every drug test.
</P>
<P>
   She retired soon thereafter, to the surprise of no one who had
seen all the baby clothes and toys she had collected over the years
in anticipation of starting a family. Her daughter Mary was born in
1992. The following year, Griffith Joyner was named to co-chair the
President's Council on Physical Fitness.
</P>
<P>
   In July of this past year, Griffith Joyner was informed she was
being replaced on the council by Jake Steinfeld (of Body by Jake
fame). Griffith Joyner, suspecting the move had something to do
with the $100,000 contribution Steinfeld had made to the Democratic
National Committee, refused to relinquish her post unless ordered
to do so by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As we now know, the president had other things on his mind.
Griffith Joyner stayed, and in doing so proved the soundness of
another Peale lesson: The Perseverance Principle. It's Always Too
Soon to Quit. &QL;

LIVING FOR THE MOMENT IN AL WEST

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Mark McGwire stayed home. Sammy Sosa had the day off.
Even Cal Ripken Jr. took a seat.
</P>
<P>
   And to clear the national stage completely, the New York Mets
and the Chicago Cubs took a one-night break from their second-place
race Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Warmup acts all, they knew it was time to step aside when this
season of magic and comedy shows finally presented a main event.
</P>
<P>
   In the year of the home run, the year of the runaway division
leader, the year of what Baseball Weekly mislabeled as ``Wildcard
Mania,'' the only thing missing was a game that really mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Angels and Texas Rangers played this one to break their
tie for first place in the American League West, and wouldn't Big
Mac have loved to be part of it?
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers won 9-1 on a pleasantly cool night when Todd
Stottlemyre smoked the Angels and Steve Sparks' knuckleball fooled
only catcher Chad Kreuter, giving Texas a one-game lead with two
games left in the showdown series and six games left in the season.
A blowout, demoralizing for the losers.
</P>
<P>
   But in the brief time it was a ballgame, there were nine innings
worth of sweet little baseball moments, each sensation heightened
by the stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Goodwin working Sparks to 3 and 2, as a leadoff hitter
should. Jim Edmonds running down Goodwin's opposite-alley drive a
step from the warning track. Randy Velarde kicking Mark McLemore's
grounder in an early sign of nerves. Rusty Greer's hit-and-run
grounder through the vacated shortstop hole. Juan Gonzalez's
grounder up the middle for his 155th RBI, breaking his
major-league-leading tie with Sosa. Darin Erstad's diving catch of
a Will Clark line drive, while partially screened by a runner,
saving at least one run.
</P>
<P>
   After all that, it was on to the bottom half of the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   The shame is that only 33,487 watched, nearly 10,000 short of
capacity at Edison Field, where walk-up ticket sales totaled an
embarrassing 1,579. If you've loved the summer of '98 but you
couldn't get worked up over this, it turns out you're a home-runs
fan, not a baseball fan.
</P>
<P>
   Worked up?
</P>
<P>
   Texas manager Johnny Oates called a team meeting, approximately
an annual event with him, to ``remind them to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a seven-game series to see who represents the AL West,''
Oates said. ``I wanted to tell them there's no execution Monday
morning if we don't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Worked up?
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Terry Collins was able to sleep for ``a couple of
hours'' Sunday night _ ``sporadically.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to break my pattern,'' Collins said with a weak
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Worked up?
</P>
<P>
   Erstad, the young Angels first baseman who was in the lineup
Monday for the second time since he aggravated a hamstring injury
three weeks ago, tried to remember the last time he played in a
game this big. He came up with the '95 Orange Bowl, when Nebraska
beat Miami for the national title, and Erstad was the Cornhuskers'
punter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In baseball?'' Erstad said. ``Probably never.''
</P>
<P>
   In baseball, a season is so full of sidebars and subplots,
sometimes it's hard to tell if they're the distractions or the
games are.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about analyzing yesterday's game and tomorrow's
matchup, getting over last week's injury and planning next week's
pitching rotation, erasing last year's disappointment and grooming
next year's rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Only once in a while is it all about !ital!today!off!.
</P>
<P>
   As it was Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been a lot of attention on this race,'' Collins
said in the dugout before the game. ``There's been attention on
McGwire, on Sammy, on Ripken. And that's as it should be. Those are
big stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``But guys (Angels) say, `We're overshadowed out here.' Well,
here's a great chance to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the insomnia, a manager's job actually gets easier
with the division on the line in the final week. He has only one
worry. Winning today.
</P>
<P>
   Why else was Erstad out there, a threat to reinjure himself?
</P>
<P>
   ``We need him in our lineup,'' Collins said. ``If I wait three
or four days to put him in there, we may not need him until next
March. Every day I've been thinking, `Should I save him for the
playoffs?' Well, if we don't have him, we might not make the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   At last, a baseball moment measured in runs, not in feet.
</P>
<P>
   When he covered baseball for the Daily News (he's now with the
Detroit Free Press), John Lowe said he loved Opening Day best of
all because it was the one afternoon he could write not about
yesterday, not about tomorrow, but about !ital!the game!off!.
</P>
<P>
   John was half right. Some years you get a second Opening Day.
The Angels and the Rangers, as even in the standings as they were
April 1, played a second Opening Day on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Now, can the Angels find midseason form in 20 hours? &QL;

HURRICANE BUFFETS PUERTO RICO AND THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS lead and early grafs for late evening update; new info. on
increased number of fatalities.)   (af)  
 By LARRY ROHTER

<P>
   SAN JUAN, P.R. _ Hurricane Georges roared into Puerto Rico and
the United States Virgin Islands on Monday, causing extensive
damage after leaving a trail of destruction in the smaller islands
of the northeastern Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 o'clock Monday night, the authorities were reporting that
two-thirds of Puerto Rico was without water and that fully half the
island had lost electrical power.
</P>
<P>
   A flash-flood warning was in effect throughout the island, home
to 3.8 million people, and there were reports of many building
collapses. Damage to buildings was extensive, particularly in San
Juan and elsewhere along the northeastern coast.
</P>
<P>
   The eye of the storm, which the National Hurricane Center in
Miami has classified as the most powerful and menacing of the
season, was just west-southwest of San Juan late Monday evening,
and The Associated Press reported that five people had been killed
by the storm in Puerto Rico, three in a landslide outside San Juan
and two who suffered heart attacks in shelters. A sixth person was
reported missing in a separate landslide near San Juan. The AP said
the storm killed a woman in St. Kitts.
</P>
<P>
   Since the weekend, the storm has been on a course that took it
diagonally across the full length of Puerto Rico. It has weakened
somewhat since Sunday morning, when it had maximum sustained winds
of 150 miles per hour, almost enough to make it a Category 5 storm,
the most dangerous on the Saffir-Simpson scale used to rank
hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday afternoon, its peak winds had diminished to 110 mph,
making it a Category 2 storm. But it strengthened once more this
evening, intensifying to Category 3.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours before the storm hit with all its fury, the
authorities here and in the Virgin Islands repeatedly warned
residents to remain indoors or, if their homes were in coastal
areas or made of flimsy material, to move to shelters. Twenty
thousand people took refuge in shelters here in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect there is going to be major damage, and some families
are going to have difficult days to come,'' Gov. Pedro Rossello
cautioned at midday as the first strong winds and rain were
beginning to be felt here.
</P>
<P>
   In the Virgin Islands, Gov. Roy Schneider had already imposed an
8 p.m. curfew and, like Rossello, asked President Clinton in
advance to declare a federal state of emergency so that disaster
relief could flow more rapidly once the storm passed. Advance teams
from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the American Red
Cross were in place in both American territories, and FEMA had
organized a 62-member search-and-rescue team in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday afternoon, Rossello said that both
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki had called him and
offered New York's help in any cleanup and reconstruction. Puerto
Ricans living in the continental United States have also inquired
about providing assistance, he said, adding that a decision whether
the aid will be needed would be made only after he had assessed the
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Leeward Islands, which suffered a direct hit by the
storm on Sunday night and early Monday, that process was already
under way. Initial reports said the islands hit the hardest
appeared to be Antigua and Barbados, St. Kitts and Nevis, both
independent countries; the British colony of Montserrat; and the
French overseas territory of Guadeloupe.
</P>
<P>
   On all those islands, the authorities reported that buildings
had been ripped apart and power lines damaged. But as of
midafternoon, no fatalities had been reported anywhere along the
storm's west-northwesterly path.
</P>
<P>
   After traversing Puerto Rico, the storm is expected to hit the
northern coast of the Dominican Republic and Haiti, where hurricane
warnings are already in effect.
</P>
<P>
   Once the storm reaches the eastern tip of Cuba, however, its
course becomes less predictable. It is too early, they say, for
anyone's guard to be lowered, even along the United States' Gulf
Coast.

<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The series opener between the Angels and Texas Rangers
on Monday night offered no drama, no tense moments, nothing
resembling a pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels couldn't blame their crowd, even though the
gathering was well short of capacity. For this one, they had to
take full responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers jumped out to a five-run lead in the fourth inning
and cruised behind the solid pitching of Todd Stottlemyre to a 9-1
victory before 33,487 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   It gave the Rangers a one-game lead in the American League West
with six to play, including two with the Angels _ tonight at
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre beat the Angels last Wednesday in Arlington, Texas,
allowing only one run in eight innings. The Angels said that seeing
him recently would help them Monday, but it didn't quite work out
that way. Stottlemyre (5-4) worked out of a first-inning jam and
pitched seven scoreless innings while allowing six hits. He struck
out seven and walked four.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Steve Sparks, pitching on three days' rest, lost
to Texas for the second time in less than a week.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels entered the game with some momentum, having beaten
the Mariners the past two nights while Texas was losing their
previous two to Oakland. ``We've played our butts off for 5{
months,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said before the game. ``To
get to this point, I'd sure like to keep it going and not have it
blow up in our face.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Rangers didn't hit bombs _ nine of their 13 hits were
singles and they didn't hit a home run _ they hit Sparks and three
relievers early and often.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks (9-4) was never able to find a rhythm with his
knuckleball, getting knocked out of the game after giving up five
runs (three earned) and seven hits in 32/3 innings. Then again, he
didn't get much help from the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Randy Velarde booted Mark McLemore's routine
grounder in the first inning, leading to an unearned run. In the
second inning, Todd Zeile doubled to right-center and Lee Stevens
tried to score from first.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde's relay throw to catcher Chad Kreuter was in time, but
Kreuter dropped the ball and Stevens was safe. Sparks appeared as
though he might get out of the inning with just the one run, but
his wild pitch with two out allowed Zeile to score and make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, a single by Zeile and a double by Royce Clayton
set up Tom Goodwin's sacrifice fly and Rusty Greer's RBI single for
a 5-0 Rangers lead that sent Sparks to the showers.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, who had pitched into the seventh inning in 13 of his
first 19 starts, has failed to get out of the fourth inning in his
past two, both against the Rangers. He gave up four runs and seven
hits in 12/3 innings in last Thursday's 7-6 loss at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers added three more runs off reliever Jeff Juden in the
seventh inning on RBI singles by Ivan Rodriguez and Goodwin, and a
bases-loaded walk issued to Royce Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   The closest look the Angels had at this game came in the first
inning when they loaded the bases with one out. But Stottlemyre got
out of it with a strikeout of Darin Erstad and a groundout by
Garret Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   In two starts against the Angels in the past week, Stottlemyre
has allowed only one run in 15 innings. That came on Gregg
Jefferies' solo homer last Wednesday in Arlington. &QL;

on Monday night offered no drama, no tense moments, nothing
resembling a pennant race.

   But the Angels couldn't blame their crowd, even though the

<P>
   It gave the Rangers a one-game lead in the American League West
with six to play, including two with the Angels _ tonight and
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels would do well to forget Monday's game, from their two
errors to their missed scoring opportunities to their poor
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst we've played in three months,'' Angels
manager Terry Collins said. ``We didn't do anything right. We've
got to swing the bats, make plays, pitch _ all the things you're
supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's 9-1 or 19-1, you've still got to come back
tomorrow. We've bounced back many times all year. We have to do it
again. We know we're better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said the Angels didn't wilt under the pressure of
playing in a big game. But center fielder Jim Edmonds had a
different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to relax,'' he said. ``We might have been too
geared up. I haven't seen this team play like this. We still need
to approach the game the same way. You can't overdo anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre beat the Angels last Wednesday in Arlington, Texas,
allowing only one run in eight innings. The Angels said that seeing
him recently would help them Monday, but it didn't quite work out
that way. Stottlemyre (5-4) worked out of a first-inning jam and
pitched seven scoreless innings while allowing six hits. He struck
out seven and walked four.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a veteran on the mound,'' Edmonds said. ``He sees
guys swinging at bad pitches, he's not going to throw you anything
to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Steve Sparks, pitching on three days' rest, lost
to Texas for the second time in less than a week.
</P>

   The closest look the Angels had at this game came in the first
inning when they loaded the bases with one out. But Stottlemyre got
out of it with a strikeout of Darin Erstad and a groundout by
Garret Anderson.

   ``I don't want to single anyone out,'' Edmonds said, ``but we
can't make mistakes. We can't not move runners over. We can't not
drive guys in from third with less than two out. You have to do the
little things in the playoffs. And this (begin ital)is(end ital) a
playoff game.''
</P>
<P>
   Can the Angels bounce back?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so,'' Edmonds said. ``Otherwise, we'll be on vacation
next Monday.'' &QL;

TAPE PROVIDES LITTLE AMMUNITION FOR CLINTON FOES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _ For a man whose defense rests on the proposition
that she had sex with him but he did not have sex with her, he
could hardly have sounded more credible.
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's four hours of videotaped interrogation
before a grand jury and 3,183 pages of documents, released Monday
to the world, may have provided a low moment for the presidency and
his own career. But it did not provide the smoking gun his critics
hoped would turn the nation against him.
</P>
<P>
   He did not turn purple with rage. His nose did not grow longer.
In fact, the four-hour exercise seemed to reinforce the notion
promoted by the White House that the crisis that has gripped the
nation's capital for the past eight months is about little more
than sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen this four-year, $40 million investigation come
down to parsing the definition of sex,'' Clinton declared after
prosecutors tried repeatedly and futilely to get him to explain how
he could acknowledge ``inappropriate intimate contacts'' with
Lewinsky and yet deny ``sexual relations.''
</P>
<P>
   A quarter century ago, the release of White House tapes led
directly to the resignation of President Richard Nixon. Monday's
spectacle is unlikely to do anything but further polarize the
partisan debate in Congress over the appropriate course of action
and further darken the public's dim view of the political process.
</P>
<P>
   Those who watched television Monday saw an unfamiliar view of
the president. He rarely smiled. He coughed. He scratched his ears.
His makeup wore off, and the perspiration glistened on his forehead
and upper lip. He blinked uncomfortably as he alternately sipped
Diet Coke and ginger ale, and at times he appeared to be holding
back a seething rage.
</P>
<P>
   His answers were often evasive. He offered a definition of
``sexual relations'' that relied on who was doing the touching. He
explained away apparent inconsistencies with statements like ``it
depends on what the meaning of the word `is' is,'' and ``it depends
on how you define `alone.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But there was little to convince Americans that the president
had endeavored to obstruct justice, abused his constitutional
authority or tampered with witnesses, as independent counsel
Kenneth Starr charged in his report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, those who watched the full 243 minutes of testimony saw
the most detailed, and perhaps most innocent-sounding explanation
yet from Clinton of why he lied to the American people for seven
months about his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an embarrassing and personally painful thing, the truth
about my relationship with Ms. Lewinsky,'' he said, sounding like
any spouse caught in a web of adultery.
</P>
<P>
   As prosecutors off camera repeatedly pestered him about how he
could have sought to deceive, Clinton repeatedly stated the
obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I want this to come out? No. Was I embarrassed about it?
Yes. Did I ask her to lie about it? No.''
</P>
<P>
   In dozens of questions, Clinton insisted that he did not perjure
himself January 17 when, during a deposition in the Paula Jones
litigation, he stated under oath that he did not have sexual
relations with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Jones' attorneys knew they had a ``bogus'' case,
and ``the real reason they were zeroing in on (Lewinsky) was . . .
no matter how uninvolved with Paula Jones, no matter how uninvolved
with sexual harassment, was so they could hurt me politically. . .
. They just thought they could take a wrecking ball to me and see
if they could do some damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing my best to be truthful,'' he said, asserting that
kissing and oral sex are not covered by the definition provided to
him by Jones' attorneys. ``I was not trying to be particularly
helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   There were many moments of awkwardness and humiliation for the
president, some of which could provide devastating footage for GOP
television commercials this fall. But during four hours of
questions from off-camera interrogators, it is prosecutors who come
across as clueless about the working of an illicit affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tried, in fact, not to let anyone else know about this
relationship?'' a prosecutor asked accusingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, of course,'' said the president. ``I did what people do
when they do the wrong thing. I tried to do it where nobody else
was looking.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean he excluded his secretary, Betty Currie, and
others from intimate moments with Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to be an exhibitionist not to have tried to exclude
everyone else,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the secrecy that surrounded the testimony last month,
Clinton was clearly aware that his words would not remain private
for long. He repeatedly refused to detail the nature of his sexual
activity with Lewinsky, at one point alluding to the camera, and
saying that ``I am right to answer all the questions about perjury,
but not to say things which will be forever in the historic annals
of the United States because of this unprecedented videotape
(which) may be leaked at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's artful performance is unlikely to appease his
detractors, who will be able to seize on several tortured
explanations of his previous testimony. For example, prosecutors
referred to his attorney's statement during last January's
deposition in which he stated: ``Counsel is fully aware that Ms.
Lewinsky has filed, has an affidavit . . . saying that there is
absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or form, with
President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked on the videotape whether that statement was true, Clinton
said: ``It depends on what the meaning of the word `is' is.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean, prosecutors persisted, that because he was not
engaged in sexual activity with Lewinsky during the deposition,
that his attorney's statement was literally true.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Clinton said, ``I mean that at the time of the
deposition, it . . . was well beyond any point of improper contact.
So that anyone generally speaking in the present tense, saying
there is not an improper relationship, would be telling the truth
if that person said there was not, in the present tense, the
present tense encompassing many months.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' he said, concluding an explanation that may take
linguists _ let alone lawmakers _ weeks to dissect, ``is what I
meant by that.''

<P>
   Prostate cancer is the most diagnosed serious cancer in America;
it is the No. 2 cancer-killer of men; it kills African-American men
at nearly twice the rate for Caucasian men.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its lethality, prostate cancer gets far less federal
research funding than does AIDS or breast cancer. One reason is
that well-organized lobby groups push for funding for AIDS and
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer, on the other hand, has been surrounded by an
aura of awkward embarrassment, its victims hushed into silence by
the biologic reality that the prostate gland is at the center of
male sexuality. The veil of reticence is starting to lift, thanks
to the courageous efforts of famous prostate cancer patients like
Bob Dole and Norman Schwarzkopf, who have made it their personal
campaigns to alert the American public about this disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Hearst News Service and the San Antonio Express-News have
prepared a package of stories, photos and graphics examining
prostate cancer from the point of view of patients, physicians,
researchers and government funders.
</P>
<P>
   This package is for release Sept. 27, 28 and 29. The photos and
graphics are available on the Wieck Database.
</P>
<P>
   The key to surviving prostate cancer is early detection because
once the cancer spreads beyond the prostate gland _ a
golf-ball-sized organ located underneath the bladder _ a cure
becomes difficult, if not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Although detection tests are simple, many men don't get tested
or wait until it is too late.
</P>
<P>
   The following budget outlines a three-day series about the
disease. Our stories deal with the treatments, the sexual side
effects of treatments, the screening procedures, the plight of
African American men, the politics in Washington that stymie
prostate cancer research budgets and other elements of this deadly
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The principal writer for the series was Eric Rosenberg of the
Washington bureau of the Hearst Newspapers; Don Finley and David
Uhler of The Express-News also contributed stories.

   PROSTATE-RDP: Prostate cancer is the second-leading
cancer-killer of men, behind lung cancer, and the most common
non-skin cancer diagnosed in the United States today.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society estimates 184,500 men will be
diagnosed this year and 39,200 will die of the disease, a little
less than the number of deaths from breast cancer but about twice
as many deaths from AIDs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its toll and the prominence of some of its sufferers
(Bob Dole, Arnold Palmer, Michael Milken, Andy Grove), prostate
cancer has received little public attention or political focus. One
reason: Men don't like to talk about the disease, which often
affects sexual function and bladder control.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that although prostate cancer kills more people
than AIDs, research on prostate cancer gets only a fraction of the
federal research funding that goes to AIDS. This may be changing as
a result of an emerging grassroots lobbying effort coordinated by a
new private organization. By ERIC ROSENBERG.

PROSTATE CANCER: THE MAN-KILLER THAT PEOPLE DON'T TALK ABOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 27)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For Ralph Valle, the first clue came when he
started waking up several times during the night to urinate.
</P>
<P>
   He went to his physician who, after an exam, referred him to a
specialist. Several tests later, Valle got the bad news that
explained his problem: He had prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had a prostate, but I wasn't even sure what it did,''
Valle said, recalling his reaction back in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   After learning his options, Valle elected to have the cancerous
gland surgically removed. But during surgery, it became apparent to
the doctors that the malignancy had already spread.
</P>
<P>
   So Valle took the most drastic step possible to stop the cancer
from spreading. He had himself surgically castrated to halt the
production of testosterone, which is produced by the testes,
because that male hormone fuels prostate cancer growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to shock men. I tell them, `If you don't pay attention
to this disease early on, these are the things that can happen,'''
said Valle, 65, of Phoenix, Ariz., a Cuban-born manufacturing
executive.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 184,500 American men will get the news that they have
prostate cancer. Many will need to choose a treatment that may
lengthen their lives but that also may end their sexual function
and cause urinary incontinence.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of these newly diagnosed prostate cancer victims will
be over 65 years old. Most of the others will be in their 50s and
early 60s, at the peak of their working careers. A minority will be
in their 40s, although some major medical institutions are
reporting a spike in the number of younger men with prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we are seeing more younger patients with
aggressive disease in their 40s and 50s,'' said Dr. Howard Scher,
chief of genito-urinary oncology at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   This year, some 39,200 American men, many in hospices or at home
and attached to morphine pumps, will die from a cancer that began
in a gland a little larger than a golf ball. The prostate gland,
nestled under the bladder adjacent to the rectum, produces the
seminal fluid that carries sperm.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer contained in the gland itself isn't fatal. Death
comes if the cancer spreads beyond the prostate to bone, lungs,
liver or brain.
</P>
<P>
   Next to highly curable forms of skin cancer, carcinoma of the
prostate will be the most diagnosed cancer in the United States
this year, according to the American Cancer Society. Nearly one in
six men will get the disease sometime in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas alone, an estimated 11,900 men this year will learn
that they have prostate cancer, according to American Cancer
Society statistics, and 2,500 will die from it. Like the national
trend, prostate cancer is expected to be the most diagnosed
malignancy in Texas in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Most patients will die with the disease rather than from it
because prostate cancer usually is slow growing. Nonetheless, it is
the second leading cancer-killer of men after lung cancer, killing
in 1995 about 24.9 percent of men who got it, a death rate similar
to breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   For mysterious reasons, there is a perplexing racial element to
the cancer. Mortality rates for black Americans with prostate
cancer are more than twice as high as those for whites. Researchers
speculate that this may be caused by a combination of genetics,
diet and a reluctance to get medical checkups.
</P>
<P>
   According to statistics compiled by the National Cancer
Institute, 150.3 non-Hispanic white men per 100,000 and 104.4
Hispanic men per 100,000 developed prostate cancer from 1990
through 1995 compared with 224.3 black men per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, 55 African American men per 100,000 died
from the cancer, while the disease claimed the lives of 24.1
non-Hispanic whites per 100,000 and 16.8 Hispanics per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the number of prostate cancer diagnoses has skyrocketed
over the last 20 years. Medical scientists say the main reason is
the growing use of a new diagnostic tool known as the prostate
specific antigen (PSA) blood test.
</P>
<P>
   A contributing factor is that men are living longer _ and
prostate cancer afflicts older men more than younger men.
</P>
<P>
   The average life expectancy of a non-Hispanic white American
male is almost 80 years, and the average diagnosis of prostate
cancer is around 65 years. As a result, men are now being diagnosed
15 to 20 years before their life expectancy is up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are around longer for the cancer to develop and spread,''
said Dr. William Catalona, director of urologic surgery at
Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of better early detection and longer life
expectancy has made prostate cancer ``a very significant
health-care problem,'' said Catalona.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer rates have more than doubled between 1973 and
1995 _ from 64.2 men per 100,000 to 137.2 men per 100,000,
according to the National Cancer Institute. The mortality rate
during the same period has shot up more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the PSA test, about 58 percent of new cases this year
will be caught in the early stages when the disease hasn't spread
beyond the prostate and the men are potentially curable. However, a
cure is not certain even under the best conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The most favorable scenario for a newly diagnosed patient is
that the disease is confined to the prostate, which is then either
surgically removed or radiated. Both treatments commonly result in
impotence or reduced sexual potency and urinary incontinence.
</P>
<P>
   However, in about 20 percent to 30 percent of cases where a
cancerous prostate gland is surgically removed, it later turns out
that cancer cells had escaped into the body before the surgery. The
result: The surgeon who ``got it all'' actually didn't _ and the
patient later develops the cancer elsewhere in the body.
</P>
<P>
   This stubbornness is why prostate cancer victims swapping
treatment experiences in Internet chat rooms have nicknamed the
disease ``the beast.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MORE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not grow as fast as breast cancer, but it is
relentless,'' said Dr. Michael Manyak, chief of urology at George
Washington University in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that when confined to the prostate and treated,
five-year survival statistics are 100 percent. And over the past 20
years, the survival rate for all stages of the cancer combined has
risen from 67 percent to 89 percent, thanks to early detection and
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Survival starts to fall off after five years. According to the
American Cancer Society's most recent data, 67 percent of all men
diagnosed with the cancer survive 10 years while 50 percent survive
15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Early detection is imperative. By the time symptoms appear _
like Ralph Valle's frequent urination during the night, painful
urination or pelvic pain _ the cancer may have already spread
outside the gland, making it difficult, if not impossible, to cure.
If the disease spreads to the bones, death usually results within
18 months to two years.
</P>
<P>
   And death does not come peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prostate cancer has the tragic distinction of being a death
often protracted, always associated with severe pain, debilitation
and psychological distress, and a death for which no effective
intervention now exists,'' wrote Drs. Andrew Von Eschenbach and
Christopher Wood of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, two
top prostate cancer researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no cure for prostate cancer, once systemic
progression beyond the gland has occurred,'' they said in a 17-page
``Agenda for Prostate Cancer Research.''
</P>
<P>
   Men have been famously reluctant to talk about prostate cancer,
mainly because the disease and its treatments often curtail sexual
and urinary function. It's simply too embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go to a support group for guys, men say, `What's your
PSA ... and how about those Mets?' There's no feelings or concerns
expressed,'' said Jerry Donohue, a prostate cancer patient from
Long Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   That's beginning to change, thanks to publicity campaigns by
well-known prostate cancer patients. People like Bob Dole, Norman
Schwarzkopf, Andy Grove and Michael Milken have told the public
about their own experiences with the disease in an effort to
encourage more men to get tested.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and Randy
``Duke'' Cunningham, R-Calif., who in August had his cancerous
prostate removed, held a press conference in front of the U.S.
Capitol to urge men to get tested for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as breast cancer is something every woman should know
about ... similarly, men I think should learn from Sen. Dole and
from Congressman Cunningham, that if you will take the preventive
steps, if you will do the screening, if you will worry about
wellness, you will live longer, and you will live healthier,''
Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   One result of the touchy reticence surrounding the disease is
that men have been absent from the political wars that determine
federal funding for cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men have not been organized into groups like the women have
been,'' said Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, the chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee and a prostate cancer survivor.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Federal funding for prostate cancer research has
been dramatically less than funding for such other killers as AIDS
or breast cancer. Breast cancer kills about the same number of
American women annually as prostate cancer kills of American men.
</P>
<P>
   From this flows the reality that, compared to other major killer
diseases, less is known about prostate cancer. As a result, medical
practitioners disagree over such basic issues as which treatment is
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breast cancer is a pretty clean shot _ there is pretty much a
consensus about how to treat it,'' said Dr. Harold Freeman,
President Clinton's top cancer adviser. ``Prostate cancer is not
the same. You get diagnosed and can get treated in very different
ways according to which way you decide to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Because prostate cancer often is slow-growing _ a man who is
diagnosed today may not face a life-threatening predicament for
years, if ever _ doctors may recommend that elderly patients do
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   This approach _ known as ``watchful waiting'' _ means monitoring
the disease until it becomes dangerous. Quite often, the patient
will die of something else.
</P>
<P>
   The general rule of thumb among prostate specialists is that if
the man has a life expectancy of at least 10 years at diagnosis and
the cancer is suspected of being organ-confined, physicians will
try to cure the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Lurking in the background will be such effects as impotence,
incontinence and scarring of the rectum.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Mark Litwin, of the UCLA Medical Center, puts it: ``Once
prostate cancer is diagnosed and treated, the patient's life is
necessarily and permanently altered.''
</P>
<P>
   The message from patients like Valle is that men should seek out
as much information as possible about their disease and the side
effects of treatments so they can make the best treatment
decisions. Valle regularly swaps information with other patients in
Internet discussion groups dedicated to prostate cancer. Each case
is different, each cancer has its own unique complexities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that my survival is directly proportional to my
involvement in learning what the hell is happening inside me,''
said Valle. ``You are going to make decisions critical to your life
and you need all the tools.''

WHO IS AT RISK FOR PROSTATE CANCER? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 27)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While medical researchers haven't identified the causes of
prostate cancer, statistics show two groups of men face high risks
of getting the disease: men over 65 years and African-American men.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are studying other possible risk factors as well.
Here is a rundown:
</P>
<P>
   _ Age.
</P>
<P>
   Age is the most important risk factor for prostate cancer. Men
over 65 are at the biggest risk. By the time he reaches 50, a man
has a 30 percent chance of having the cancer. The risk increases
exponentially with age. But not all prostate cancer turns lethal
and not all prostate cancer requires medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Race.
</P>
<P>
   African Americans have the highest prostate cancer mortality
rates of any ethnic group in the world. Researchers believe this
may result from a combination of factors, including diet and a
greater likelihood of carrying an inherited strain of the cancer
carried through the Hereditary Prostate Cancer gene, or HPC-1.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Family history.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies indicate that men with a strong family history of
the disease are twice or three times more likely to get prostate
cancer than are men without such a history.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have located the first gene associated with
hereditary forms of prostate cancer. The gene is known as HPC-1.
About 10 percent of new cases may be the result of inherited
factors, according to the National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Geography.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is common throughout North America and Northwestern
Europe but is rare in Asia, parts of Africa and South America.
Norway and Switzerland have the highest prostate cancer death
rates, while the United States is ranked No. 11. Japan,
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are among the lowest.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Diet.
</P>
<P>
   Diet is a major suspected risk factor. A diet high in animal fat
may nearly double the risk of prostate cancer, while consumption of
lycopene, an anti-oxidant found in tomato products, may decrease
the risks, according to studies in the Journal of the National
Cancer Institute and the Annals of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a recent medical study from Harvard University has
determined that the mineral selenium may help prevent advanced
prostate cancer. Small amounts of selenium are found in meats,
fish, grains, dairy products and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Heavy metal exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Overexposure to the element cadmium may promote prostate cancer
in some men. Cadmium inhibits the metabolism of zinc, which is a
fundamental requirement for normal cell division. The prostate
contains the highest levels of zinc of all the organs in the body,
and cancerous prostates contain less zinc than healthy ones.
</P>
<P>
   Men who work in making batteries, paint and cigarettes, among
other industries, risk cadmium overexposure.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists know for certain that the male hormone testosterone
fuels the cancer once it is sparked. But whether testosterone
actually ignites the disease is still an open question and is
currently under study.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Sexually transmitted virus.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers believe that the human papillomavirus, the same
disease that has been linked to cervical and penis cancer, plays a
role in prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Cigarette smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston suspect
that smoking may make prostate cancer tumors behave more
aggressively causing them to spread and turn lethal.

AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN HAVE THE HIGHEST RISK OF PROSTATE CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 27)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Harry Harris, a retired federal government worker
from Silver Spring, Md., was diagnosed eight years ago with
prostate cancer at age 69.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, a blood test detected the cancer in its early stages
and Harris _ an African American _ opted for surgery to remove the
gland. The procedure left him with curtailed sexual function, a
common side effect of surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still alive today, but I know a lot of people who had the
cancer and are dead,'' said Harris, who is beating the terrible
odds that African-American men face when it comes to prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   For mysterious and complex reasons, African-American men have
the highest rate of prostate cancer of any ethnic or racial group
anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are bleak.
</P>
<P>
   According to statistics compiled by the National Cancer
Institute, 150.3 non-Hispanic white men per 100,000 and 104.4
Hispanic men per 100,000 developed prostate cancer from 1990
through 1995. By comparison, 224.3 black men per 100,000 developed
the disease in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Over the period, 55 African-American men per 100,000 died from
the cancer, while the disease claimed the lives of 24.1
non-Hispanic whites per 100,000 and 16.8 Hispanics per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Korean-American men had the lowest rates of the disease _ 24.2
per 100,000, while Chinese-American men had the lowest mortality
rates _ 6.6 deaths per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers baffle cancer researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Could the differences be explained by factors such as diet,
behavior or environment? Or on a biological level, is prostate
cancer more aggressive in African American men?
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists focused on the possibility that African-American
men have poorer health care and thus might not have their prostate
cancers detected in a timely way.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of equal access to health care has long been suspected as a
contributing factor to high cancer rates among African American men
and women.
</P>
<P>
   An American Medical Association report released in the early
1990s continues to reverberate today. ``Access to basic medical
care for all of our inhabitants is still not a reality in this
country,'' the report found. ``There are many reasons for this, not
the least of which is long-standing, systematic, institutionalized
racial discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   The AMA found access to be lacking particularly among African
Americans and Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   To test the access theory, Dr. Judd Moul, a urologist and
director of the U.S. military's Center for Prostate Disease
Research, studied the records of active duty and retired military
men, all of whom were eligible for the same level of medical
attention through the military. He found the same huge gap between
African-American men and non-blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Moul sums up the mystery: ``So why are blacks affected so much?
Is it biology, behavior or a combination of both?''
</P>
<P>
   He speculates that a piece of the puzzle centers around
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though black men may have equal access to health care,
they might not have been availing themselves of it,'' Moul said.
``It could be behavioral, even among black military beneficiaries
who might not want to go to a doctor for a check up.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Isaac Powell, an African-American urologist at Wayne State
University, found evidence supporting a behavioral link; many black
men he studied in the Detroit area were reluctant to undergo the
digital rectal exam, a frontline test used to detect prostate
tumors.
</P>
<P>
   The men had a mistrust of the medical establishment that
curtailed the frequency of medical check ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some differences in attitudes towards the health
care system in African Americans that may be more of a barrier than
in Caucasians,'' said Powell, who had his own cancerous prostate
removed last year. ``One of those happens to be concerns about
getting the kind of care their white counterparts would get.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell believes several factors are at the root of the prostate
cancer statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think some are biological, some may be genetic, some may be
environmental factors impacting on the genes, such as a high-fat
diet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Powell and a team of mainly African-American researchers are
zeroing in on hereditary factors.
</P>
<P>
   Inherited prostate cancer _ prostate cancer that strikes
numerous members in the same family _ accounts for about 1 in 10
cases, according to the National Cancer Institute. Alterations in
what is known as the HPC-1 gene are suspected of causing one-third
of these.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have determined that African Americans are twice as
likely to carry the HPC-1 gene, the first known hereditary prostate
cancer gene.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, scientists discovered a chemical signpost for the gene
along the long arm of chromosome No. 1 that they believe resides
very close to HPC-1. Powell and his group are trying to determine
the exact location of the gene.
</P>
<P>
   Once identified, the gene will provide insight into the
progression of prostate cancer and help doctors determine who is
more likely to develop aggressive strains.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have families that have a hereditary component, the
men are more likely to die from it'' because hereditary prostate
cancer usually is very aggressive, said Sally Weinrich, a professor
of nursing and a prostate cancer researcher at the University of
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Powell is studying black families with four or more family
members who have prostate cancer. The study _ focused in Detroit,
Chicago, Washington, D.C., New York City, Houston, Atlanta and the
state of South Carolina _ is funded by the National Human Genome
Research Institute, Howard University and the National Cancer
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the HPC-1 gene, blacks may also have another
genetic risk. Scientists at Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
are focusing on the androgen receptor gene _ a gene closely
connected with testosterone, the male sex hormone that fuels the
growth of both healthy and cancerous prostate cells.
</P>
<P>
   The gene directs cells within the prostate to make a protein,
which in turn stimulates cells to grow and divide when testosterone
attaches to the protein.
</P>
<P>
   All men have this gene, but for some inexplicable reason, black
men have shorter versions of a key component called the CAG
repeats. The letters stand for the nucleic-acid bases cytosine,
adenine and guanine.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter variation of the CAG repeats is associated with more
aggressive prostate cancer and malignancy at a younger age.
</P>
<P>
   While researchers continue to seek the biologic reasons for the
sharply higher risks facing African-American men, the American
Cancer Society is urging black men to seek prostate cancer
screening starting at age 40, 10 years sooner than for other men.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to lowering the age for more intensive testing, Moul
thinks physicians should lower the threshold in black men for
acceptable levels of prostate specific antigen, a protein that can
signal the presence of cancer. The protein is measured in the blood
by the widely used prostate specific antigen test (PSA).
</P>
<P>
   For example, a PSA test showing more than 4 nanograms of the
protein per milliliter of blood of a man 40 to 50 years old would
make many doctors suspicious. They might then perform a biopsy of
the prostate, the next level of diagnostic procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Moul believes black men with PSA readings of 2 or more nanograms
should get a biopsy.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's top cancer adviser says more aggressive
screening of black men is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern in the black community, in particular the poor
community, is that people will get screened and not be properly
counseled about the possible risks and benefits of having different
kinds of treatments,'' said Dr. Harold Freeman, chairman of the
president's cancer advisory panel and director of surgery at New
York City's Harlem Hospital Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``For affluent Americans who get prostate cancer, most would
receive proper counseling and learn about all approaches. They
wouldn't just jump into surgery,'' Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the worrisome statistics for black men, there are
success stories if the cancer is caught in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a death sentence if you act on it in a timely
fashion,'' said Harry Harris. His advice to black men: ``Do
something about it. Don't wait.''

IS THERE A LINK BETWEEN SEX AND PROSTATE CANCER? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 27)     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's a cruel, frightening scientific fact: The male
sex hormone testosterone that fuels sexual desire also fuels
prostate cancer cells and nurtures them into a life-threatening
malignancy.
</P>
<P>
   Eunuchs _ men who lack testes and thus cannot produce
testosterone _ don't get prostate cancer. In fact, castration is a
common treatment to slow the march of prostate cancer by shutting
down the production of testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very much a hormonally dependent cancer, at least in
the beginning,'' said Dr. Wael Sakr, associate professor of
pathology at Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   While scientists agree that testosterone helps the cancer grow,
there is no proof that the hormone causes the disease in the first
place, according to Sakr and Dr. Gabriel Haas, chairman of the
department of urology at the State University of New York Health
Science Center in Syracuse, N.Y..
</P>
<P>
   While clear medical sleuths have established clear associations
between prostate cancer and such demographic factors as age or
race, the precise causes of prostate cancer continue to elude
detection;
</P>
<P>
   Haas is exploring one controversial theory about a cause of
prostate cancer. This theory holds that a common sexually
transmitted disease _ the human papillomavirus (HPV) _ infects
prostate cells and in some men ignites the disease, which is then
fueled by the hormone.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, known as HPV, already has been linked to cervical and
penis cancer and may play a role in ovarian cancer and in prostate
cancer, said Haas, who has spent nearly 15 years exploring the
origins of prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Haas says the HPV theory also helps explain why eunuchs don't
get prostate cancer. These men would have no exposure to the virus
because they are impotent.
</P>
<P>
   It may also explain why another study found that men with
vasectomies have a higher risk of developing the cancer. Once they
are sterile, these men may have unprotected sex and thus a greater
chance of contracting the virus, Haas said.
</P>
<P>
   The HPV theory was strengthened last year when a National Cancer
Institute study found that men infected with HPV in their youth
were five times more likely to develop prostate cancer in their 50s
and 60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``HPV may start a chain of events that later translates into
prostate cancer,'' said Dr. Charles Rabkin, an NCI epidemiologist
who led the study.
</P>
<P>
   A separate study published last spring by Swedish-led
researchers found more evidence of a possible link. The study of
Finnish men found that those infected with the virus were 2.6 times
more likely to get prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers who subscribe to the HPV theory caution that not all
men who carry the virus get prostate cancer, and not all men who
have prostate cancer have the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The virus data is tantalizing, but I would not expect it to be
associated with all cases of prostate cancer,'' said Rabkin.
</P>
<P>
   According to the theory, the virus inserts its deadly genetic
material into the chromosomes of healthy prostate cells. In many
cases, the body's immune system will kill the infected cells or the
cells will die naturally or will repair themselves and become
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   But if some infected cells survive, they could turn into
prostate cancer, said Haas. ``Those cells will grow and proliferate
and develop into what we regard as a malignancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Once triggered, prostate cancer cells, like healthy prostate
cells, require male sex hormones to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really need both _ the virus to initiate the (start of the
cancer) and you need testosterone to keep those virus-infected
cells alive and proliferating,'' said Haas.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers will continue to study the virus over the next few
years, hoping to prove a conclusive link.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important area of research because if we can
get a handle on it, we will be able to start good preventative
measures,'' said Haas.

THE PSA TEST HAS REVOLUTIONIZED PROSTATE MEDICINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 27)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A simple blood test has revolutionized prostate
medicine by diagnosing thousands of new cases of prostate cancer
every year in men who have few, if any, outward symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Before the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test came into
widespread use in the early 1990s, an examining physician would
rely on a finger exam _ a digital rectal examination (DRE) _ to
feel for prostate tumors through the wall of the rectum. This
technique meant that most men were diagnosed in the later stages of
the disease when a cure is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The PSA test makes it possible to detect tumors before they grow
so large that they can be felt during a DRE.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 million PSA blood tests are performed annually,
according to Dr. William Catalona, director of urologic surgery at
Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and one of
the inventors of the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now seeing earlier and earlier tumors,'' said Catalona.
</P>
<P>
   The test measures a protein produced by epithelial cells within
the prostate. A healthy man should have virtually undetectable
levels of the protein. However, more of these cells are produced
when the body is fighting off a prostate infection, thereby
increasing the protein level. Similarly, the protein level may
shoot up if the epithelial cells turn malignant and, as cancers do,
multiply out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elevated PSA is related to an abnormal proliferation of
certain prostate cells, epithelial only, whether benign or
malignant,'' said Dr. Michael Manyak, chairman of the urology
department at George Washington University Medical Center in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The protein seeps into the blood and thus can be detected in a
blood test.
</P>
<P>
   Results under 4 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) are considered
normal, while those over 10 ng/ml suggest a problem. Values between
4 and 10 are borderline.
</P>
<P>
   If the test result is 10 or higher and the patient is not
elderly, doctors will recommend more sophisticated diagnostic
tests, including a six-needle biopsy of the prostate. Urologists
may recommend biopsies for borderline PSA readings, depending on
the results of the DRE, what an ultrasound scan of the gland
reveals, how fast the PSA level is rising and the patient's age.
</P>
<P>
   The PSA test misses about 25 percent of cancers, so a normal PSA
can give false reassurance that cancer is not present. The test
also may provide high readings for such non-cancerous conditions as
enlargement of the prostate or a common prostate infection known as
prostatitis.
</P>
<P>
   Because the PSA test can't distinguish between cancer and benign
afflictions, many men with a high PSA will not have cancer when
biopsied. The PSA also can't distinguish between slow-growing and
fast-moving cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, researchers are developing more accurate tests.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Food and Drug Administration in March approved a new test
for patients with abnormal PSA readings.
</P>
<P>
   While the traditional PSA test measures the protein when it is
bound chemically to the compound alpa1-antichymotrypsin or
alpha2-macroglobulin, the new test measures levels of ``free'' PSA,
not bound to these substances.
</P>
<P>
   Men with prostate cancer have less ``free PSA'' than men who
have benign conditions. The lower the percentage of free PSA, the
higher the likelihood of cancer. The test's manufacturers claim it
could eliminate 120,000 needless biopsies a year.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Pacific Northwest Cancer Foundation in Seattle is
developing a blood test based on the PSA that will help determine
whether a cancer is aggressive and life threatening or only growing
slowly.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the Howard
Hughes Medical Institute in New York are researching whether the
presence of a certain protein in the blood called p27 signals
aggressive cancer.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., is working on a new test
that measures a protein similar to PSA called human glandular
kallikrein 2, or HK2. Researchers believe that HK2 measurements
will tell doctors which men with borderline PSA values actually
have cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Catalona said that in the near future doctors routinely will use
several blood tests to help diagnose cancer.
</P>
<P>
   When it was first introduced in 1986, the PSA test was designed
to help doctors monitor patients already battling the cancer
because a climbing PSA typically signals resurgent disease and the
need to change treatments.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, doctors were using the test, along with a
DRE, to diagnose new prostate cancer cases, and by 1994 the Food
and Drug Administration gave its official stamp of approval.
</P>
<P>
   The test was developed by scientists led by Catalona and Dr.
Gerald Murphy of the Pacific Northwest Cancer Foundation. At the
time, both were working at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in
Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Managed health care plans such as health maintenance
organizations usually will cover the $80 blood test if the patient
is over age 50, or a member of a high-risk group, such as an
African American, or has a strong family history of prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't always been this way.
</P>
<P>
   A prostate cancer advocacy organization, the Baltimore-based
American Foundation for Urologic Disease, is going state-by-state
asking lawmakers to enact legislation requiring health-care
providers to pay for PSA tests and DRE exams.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, only three states had such a requirement. Now
15 states do and more are on the way. In contrast, nearly all
states require providers to pay for annual mammograms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken us one state at a time,'' said M. Brooke Moran, the
foundation's director of government affairs. ``We are doing this
because some men are having difficulty getting the tests. What we
want is for men not to have to push for it.''

PROSTATE CANCER VICTIMS FACE CONFUSING TREATMENT OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, Sept. 28)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prostate cancer victims face a confusing array of
treatment options, all carrying the risk of such side effects as
impotence or incontinence.
</P>
<P>
   Patients complain that it's often difficult getting an objective
recommendation from medical experts because each physician tends to
champion his or her own speciality.
</P>
<P>
   A urologist might urge surgical removal of the gland; a
radiologist might promote radiation or radioactive ``seed''
implants; and an oncologist might prefer drugs to shut off hormones
feeding the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Choices are becoming even more complex as doctors refine new
treatments such as cryosurgery (freezing of the prostate gland) and
various combinations of treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Medical practioners are trying to determine which treatment is
best, but each new medical study seems to raise more questions.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, a study published this month in the Journal of
the American Medical Association found that patients with
fast-moving prostate cancer lived longer when treated with either
surgery or traditional radiation, rather than seed implants _ an
increasingly popular treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The same study found that men with early-stage cancer fared well
regardless of which treatment they received.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the information out there is very confusing,'' said
Derek Durst, a 50-year-old real estate agent and teacher from San
Francisco, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer in February.
</P>
<P>
   Durst wants to avoid surgical removal of his prostate _ a
radical prostatectomy _ but he's uncertain whether to select
radioactive seed implants or several treatments in sequence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I do a combination of hormonal blockade, then seeds and
then radiation?'' he wonders. ``It's very difficult to make a
choice. You have to become your own case manager.''
</P>
<P>
   David Evans, a retired diplomat in Washington, D.C., said that
soon after he was diagnosed in 1992 at age 56, ``I quickly found
out that in prostate cancer the patient bears an overwhelming
responsibility for deciding on his treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marc Garnick, an oncologist and internist on the faculty at
the Harvard Medical School, said some cases are ``absolutely black
and white about what needs to get done. The rest of the patients
fit into the bulk of the bell-shaped curve where any one of a
variety of treatment options is appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Shipley, the head of genito-urinary radiation
oncology at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, advises
patients to interview experienced physicians and learn all they can
about the disease and its treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men should hear various points of view from credible sources,
particularly about the side effects, and get a fair story of the
success rates and then select what suits them best,'' Shipley said.
</P>
<P>
   The bed-rock principles guiding physicians and patients are that
a man can be cured if the disease is caught early and is confined
to the prostate; if not, a cure is less likely, though the disease
may be kept at bay for several years.
</P>
<P>
   For many older men, a cure may not be necessary because they
will die of other causes before the prostate cancer turns lethal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes it complicated,'' said Dr. Howard Scher,
chief of genito-urinary oncology at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center in New York. ``The major issue is to determine what
the risk of the disease is for the individual patient.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cure'' is a word prostate specialists use cautiously. Some
contend that a successful treatment strategy is to keep the cancer
under control for long periods. In other words, to manage it like a
chronic illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two clocks ticking: your prostate clock and your
life clock,'' said Dr. Alan Partin, a urologist at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore. ``If I can keep your prostate clock just
behind your life clock, we've cured you, and it may not involve
cutting the prostate out in all men.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A cure in prostate cancer means that we are going to allow you
to get to be a very old man and die of something other than
prostate cancer,'' Partin said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, prostate cancer is discovered through a digital
rectal exam and a blood test that measures the amount of prostate
specific antigen (PSA).
</P>
<P>
   For most men who are not elderly, a PSA reading above 10
nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) will lead the physician to
recommend more sophisticated and expensive diagnostic procedures.
Depending on the man's age and the doctor's policy, a PSA reading
in the borderline zone of 4 to 10 ng/ml also may trigger additional
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Those tests typically include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A six-needle biopsy of the prostate. This will confirm whether
cancer is present in the gland. If it is, the biopsy is graded by a
pathologist on a scale known as the Gleason score. In general,
Gleason scores of 2 to 4 indicate less dangerous tumors in their
early stages, while scores of 8 to 10 indicate aggressive cancers.
Values of 5 to 7 are borderline.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MORE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Ultrasound and MRI scans of the prostate, and a CT scan of the
surrounding pelvic area;
</P>
<P>
   _ A nuclear medicine bone scan to determine if the cancer has
spread to the skeleton, a favorite resting ground for prostate
cancer outside the gland.
</P>
<P>
   _ Surgery to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the gland
to nearby pelvic lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
   _ A DNA ploidy analysis that helps assess how fast prostate
cells are growing.
</P>
<P>
   Based on these tests, the physician computes the probability
that the disease is confined to the organ and assigns a code to the
results. A T1 or T2 cancer means the doctor believes the disease is
confined to the prostate, while a T3 or T4 cancer means the cancer
has spread to surrounding tissue.
</P>
<P>
   An N+ tumor means the cancer has spread beyond the gland to
lymph nodes and an M+ cancer, the most advanced stage, indicates
that the cancer has migrated to bones or distant organs.
</P>
<P>
   This ``staging'' of the cancer is not 100 percent accurate,
Shipley points out. Many men who are believed to have
organ-confined disease actually have cancer that has spread outside
the gland.
</P>
<P>
   If the cancer is confined to the gland, surgery or some form of
radiation are the most common treatments and can effectively cure
the patient. Both treatments are particularly effective against
small tumors with Gleason scores of 6 or less and PSA values under
10 ng/ml.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to surgery or radiation, doctors may use drugs to
temporarily halt the body's production of testosterone in order to
shrink the tumors, a procedure known as neoadjuvant hormonal
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   If the cancer has escaped the prostate and migrated into
surrounding tissue, lymph nodes, seminal vesicles or bone, surgery
typically is ruled out because it doesn't do any good to remove the
gland.
</P>
<P>
   About 29 percent of all prostate cancer cases each year are
diagnosed in these more advanced stages when a cure is less likely
and treatment options more ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see a 45-year-old man with a very aggressive tumor, and
I know from the first day I meet him that he will not be curable by
surgery or radiation and will need an alternative,'' said Scher.
</P>
<P>
   For these men, depending upon the spread of the disease,
radiation may be aimed at the gland and the surrounding area, not
as a cure but because radiation can kick the tumor into remission.
</P>
<P>
   Men with advanced disease often are treated to shut down their
testosterone, the cancer's main fuel supply. But cutting off the
hormone supply is a temporary measure. Eventually, when it enters
the most lethal stage the cancer transforms from a disease
dependent on male sex hormones for growth to a cancer that will
grow even when hormones are not present.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, further down the treatment trail is chemotherapy;
in the past toxins haven't been very effective in knocking out
prostate cancer but new progress is being reported.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the major treatment options facing the prostate cancer
patient:

<P>
   &UR; --- &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; --- &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY:
</P>
<P>
   The surgical removal of the prostate, a radical prostatectomy,
is the most common treatment for early-stage prostate cancer. The
patient must weigh his chance for a cure against incontinence and
impotence.
</P>
<P>
   The operation usually requires several days in the hospital and
weeks of recuperation.
</P>
<P>
   Patients have varying experiences.
</P>
<P>
   J. William Gadzuk, of Potomac, Md., a physicist for the National
Institute of Standards and Technology, had the operation nearly
four years ago at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, one of the
pioneering institutions for prostate surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole surgical thing was remarkably unremarkable,'' Gadzuk
said. ``I didn't have a lot of discomfort or a lot of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Gadzuk said he was left with sexual dysfunction, even
though Johns Hopkins surgeons have developed a technique to protect
the erection nerves located near the gland.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has not been as successful as one might have gathered
from the hype,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Author Michael Koorda in his book ``Man to Man'' described a
difficult and often painful recovery after surgery at the same
institution.
</P>
<P>
   Urologists say a patient is a good surgical candidate if he is
under age 70, in good health, with the cancer confined to his gland
and if he can deal with the possible side effects.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; --- &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; --- &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RADIATION:
</P>
<P>
   There is little or no pain associated with radiation. However,
impotence, incontinence and even bowel scarring are possible side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Another downside is that there are limits to how much radiation
can be focused on the same area. Too much radiation can kill
healthy tissue by damaging blood flow.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer patient Carl Silverstein, of Monticello, N.Y.,
opted for radiation over surgery when he was diagnosed in 1995. A
semi-retired lawyer for the Sullivan County legal aid society,
Silverstein, 69, felt his chances of avoiding incontinence and
impotence were better with radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein underwent 37 radiation sessions, each lasting 5 to
10 minutes, over seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they didn't tell me I was having radiation, I'd think it
was a fraud. It was painless,'' Silverstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, in Silverstein's case, the radiation didn't kill
the cancer. After his PSA started to climb again indicating
resurgent cancer, doctors put him on drugs to eliminate his body's
testosterone production.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MORE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Stephenson, of Chestnut Hill, Mass., a retired executive
with Dupont Co., is a radiation success story. He was diagnosed 14
years ago at age 69 and underwent about the same number of sessions
as Silverstein. His cancer, however, has been in remission ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't say that I'm cured, but I've been extremely
fortunate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; --- &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; --- &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BRACHYTHERAPY OR SEED IMPLANTS:
</P>
<P>
   Tiny radioactive implants, no bigger than a rye seed and
injected directly into the prostate through the perineum, are an
increasingly popular treatment for early-stage cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure was tried since the 1950s without much success.
</P>
<P>
   After being refined in recent years, seed therapy is coming back
strong. Patient survival statistics are promising, and some doctors
believe it will soon become as common as surgery or beam radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds, which remain permanently embedded, deliver a
radioactive dose inside the gland for up to a year, burning out the
prostate, and, hopefully, the cancer with it. A major benefit is
that seed implants are much less invasive than surgery, requiring
perhaps an overnight stay in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   As with traditional radiation and surgery, the seeds may impair
a man's continence and potency. Some patients require corrective
surgery to the rectum or urethra after treatment.
</P>
<P>
   If the seeds irritate the urethra, which carries urine from the
bladder to the penis and runs through the prostate gland, the
patient often feels the need to urinate.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Marfyaic, from Gettysburg, Pa., a former government worker,
was 59 when he was diagnosed six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I selected seeds because it was much less invasive and was a
relatively new treatment,'' he said. ``It still has drawbacks. The
urgency to urinate becomes part of your life. You start planning
your activities around where the nearest bathroom is.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; --- &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; --- &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HORMONE THERAPY:
</P>
<P>
   If prostate cancer spreads beyond the gland, a man usually is
considered incurable. In order to slow the disease, doctors focus
on therapies to rob the cancer of testosterone, which fuels cancer
growth.
</P>
<P>
   This can be done through surgical castration to remove the
testes _ which produce testosterone _ or through chemical
castration by using powerful drugs to block hormone production.
</P>
<P>
   Shutting down testosterone doesn't keep the cancer at bay
forever because the disease eventually finds other substances in
the body to feed it.
</P>
<P>
   David Evans, the retired diplomat, initially had radiation, but
the cancer returned two years later and doctors said castration was
essential for survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was more difficult than the first diagnosis,'' Evans
said. ``Once it's out of the prostate, then you know it's incurable
and you're facing a really serious fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans chose chemical castration over surgical removal of his
testicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least there is a hope that if a magic bullet is found, I
can go back. It's reversible. That's a big psychological
difference,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Valle, of Phoenix, Ariz., opted for surgical castration,
known as an orchiectomy, after the cancer spread. Valle and his
wife were concerned that chemical castration might not be as
effective in blocking hormone production.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put everything down on paper, and I went through a decision-
making process,'' said Valle, a manufacturing executive who was
diagnosed six years ago at age 59. ``I concluded that I am fighting
for my life here. `Right or wrong,' I said, `I'm going with the
orchiectomy.' It was very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The side effects from either treatment can be extreme, including
total loss of sexual desire, facial hair loss, weight gain,
emotional swings and hot flashes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; --- &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; --- &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CRYOSURGERY:
</P>
<P>
   While not yet in widespread use, this procedure injects liquid
nitrogen, chilled to temperatures minus-320 degrees Fahrenheit,
into the prostate to freeze cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   Budson Ellsworth, from Downey, Calif., chose cryosurgery over
other treatments after he was diagnosed in 1993 at age 55 with
extensive prostate cancer because he felt it offered more hope and
less risk.
</P>
<P>
   In the procedure, a doctor was guided by a rectal ultrasound
probe as he injected the liquid nitrogen through the perineum,
turning Ellsworth's prostate into an ice ball.
</P>
<P>
   Cryosurgery is much less invasive than a radical prostatectomy,
but the side effects in Ellsworth's case were just as severe. He
ended up impotent because the entire gland had to be frozen due to
the extent of the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, the cancer spread to his pelvic lymph nodes and he
began hormone therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say that in cases where the tumors are small, the
procedure produces minimal side effects. While there is a limit to
the amount of radiation a person can withstand, cryosurgery
patients can be re-treated if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; --- &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; --- &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHEMOTHERAPY:
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, chemical toxins were the last-resort defense
against prostate cancer because chemotherapy had little effect
shrinking tumors or extending life.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors now are having better results using chemotherapy in new
combinations, with hormone blocking drugs and with other compounds
when other treatments fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, for a patient with advanced disease, they'd
give him hormonal treatments and then he'd die. Now there are
numerous strategies,'' said Dr. Kenneth Pienta, director of
genito-urinary oncology at the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In one such strategy, four drugs _ Adriamycin, Ketoconazole,
Vinblastine, and Estramustine _ are administered during a two-month
period. Compared with traditional chemo, the combinations are
better able to target and kill prostate cancer cells while
minimizing damage to healthy cells.
</P>
<P>
   Pienta says some patients survive up to two years on the
combined chemotherapies. ``The potential for the prostate cancer
death rate to go down a lot over the next five years is quite
high,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also are examining the use of new chemotherapy
combinations as a frontline treatment for early-stage prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   While researchers are trying to make the drugs more tolerable,
the side effects can be severe, including hair loss, vomiting and
lowered blood counts that make the body vulnerable to infection.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; --- &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; --- &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WATCHFUL WAITING:
</P>
<P>
   Because prostate cancer is often slow-growing, some physicians
may advise elderly men or those with a life expectancy of less than
10 years due to other illnesses to do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption here is that the patient won't be cured of the
disease and will likely die with it rather than from it. Under the
``watchful waiting'' approach, the physician may recommend
non-curative treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to these men, usually in their upper 70s, `Look, you've
got prostate cancer. But it's not time yet to pull the trigger. Why
bother with the side effects of treatments?''' said Shipley.
</P>
<P>
   Watchful waiting is not advisable for men under 65 with
non-aggressive tumors that are potentially curable.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Marfyaic chose to wait two and one-half years after being
diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer. He then settled on
radioactive seed therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was slow growing and I figured I had time to make a
decision'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Garnick believes watchful waiting is risky for men like
Marfyaic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that such patients should be treated with curative
intent rather than observed. The latter practice potentially allows
the cancer to grow, metastasize and become incurable,'' Garnick
said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The operation to remove the patient's prostate
gland gets underway in Operating Room No. 11 at Walter Reed Army
Medical Center at 8:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeons make a vertical incision about five inches long
from below the man's navel to the base of his penis. Then, they
slowly dissect down into the abdomen, cutting through layers of
skin, fat and muscle. Retractors on each side of the abdominal wall
expand the field of vision to reveal the goal nestled beneath the
bladder and next to the rectum: a cancerous prostate.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David McLeod, 63, an Army colonel, wants to remove the gland
in an effort to cure the man of a disease that will kill 39,200
American men this year.
</P>
<P>
   The patient, a 51-year-old non-commissioned Army officer, is
under anesthesia and connected to the gadgetry of modern medical
technology. His lungs rise and fall to the clicking of a respirator
while a web of tubes carry fluids to the veins in his arms.
</P>
<P>
   One tube, red with blood, sucks liquid from the abdominal cavity
into a container to the side of the operating table. A blue linen
divider shields the patient's head from the heat of the surgical
lamps and provides the anesthesiologist with a separate work area.
The divider also blocks the surgeons' view of the patient's face.
</P>
<P>
   McLeod estimates he has performed over 1,000 of these operations
in his 14 years as chief of urology at Walter Reed, one of the
military's top medical centers. He has removed the cancerous
prostates of former Sen. Bob Dole and retired Gen. Norman
Schwarzkopf, among other Washington notables.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney as well as a surgeon, McLeod, 63, is a Civil War
buff when he's not taking out prostates. A biography of the
Confederate general Stonewall Jackson sits on his desk near an
anatomical model of the gland.
</P>
<P>
   The mood in the operating room is intense, as McLeod directs his
team with a surgical shorthand born of experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You reduce the odds of getting in trouble if you stay
focused,'' he tells a reporter. ``I like to approach it like I'm
going to make a parachute jump. It is stressful. I don't rest easy
until the prostate is over there,'' pointing to a stainless steel
table nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, the former GOP presidential nominee and Kansas senator,
chose McLeod for his prostatectomy, even though some top civilian
surgeons had invited him to be their patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Dr. McLeod and that he'd done a lot of operations, from
privates, to sergeants, to colonels, generals and foreign
dignitaries. I decided that he had the skills and he was interested
in me as a person, not just as a patient,'' Dole said recently,
recalling his Walter Reed surgery in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The surgical removal of the prostate _ a radical prostatectomy _
is the most common treatment for early-stage prostate cancer, but
not all men with cancerous prostates choose that remedy.
</P>
<P>
   If the Army patient didn't want surgery, he might have chosen
radiation, either external beam radiation or radioactive ``seeds''
implanted directly in the gland.
</P>
<P>
   This patient is a good surgical candidate. He is young and
generally healthy. Furthermore, McLeod believes the disease is
confined to the gland, though he won't know until pathologists
examine slices of the gland under a microscope.
</P>
<P>
   The man was diagnosed by the PSA blood test and a finger exam of
the prostate through the rectum wall. Because the PSA was high, the
gland was biopsied by inserting needles through the rectum wall.
The biopsy showed cancer.
</P>
<P>
   To remove the prostate, surgeons have the choice of two routes,
either through the abdomen, known as a retropubic approach, or
through the perineum, the area between the anus and scrotum.
</P>
<P>
   The choice depends on which method the surgeon is most
comfortable with and whether the surgeon wants to remove pelvic
lymph nodes so they can be checked to find out if the cancer has
spread. The nodes are not taken out in the perineum method.
</P>
<P>
   McLeod, who does both procedures, chose the retropubic approach
for this operation because he wants to remove the lymph nodes for
study.
</P>
<P>
   In either operation, the patient's sexual potency is placed at
risk because the nerves controlling erections run in layers of
tissue alongside the prostate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do all we can to save those nerves,'' McLeod
says.
</P>
<P>
   To remove the prostate, the erection nerves must be carefully
peeled back. But sometimes they are severed, either accidentally or
deliberately. The surgeon would cut into the nerves if he or she
determines that the cancer has spread beyond the gland and that it
would be best for the patient's overall survival to remove them.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible side effect is urinary incontinence. To remove
the prostate, the urethra _ a tube which carries urine from the
bladder through the prostate and to the penis _ must be snipped and
then reattached.
</P>
<P>
   A pale blue catheter inserted into the patient's penis and
extending toward the bladder helps McLeod, assisting surgeon Dr.
Pierce Irby and Dr. George Stackhouse, the chief urologic resident,
locate the urethra and trace it to the prostate.
</P>
<P>
   Because Walter Reed is a teaching hospital, a medical student
stands alongside Irby and observes the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   As McLeod reaches into the abdominal cavity, his entire gloved
hand seems lost inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a small prostate,'' he tells the team, feeling the
normally smooth and rubbery organ for bumps that might indicate the
extent of disease.
</P>
<P>
   Though the gland is in reach, more than an hour is spent tying
off surrounding blood vessels to reduce blood loss. The surgeon
then teases back the tissue that contains the nerve bundles. At
times, as many as three pairs of hands are working in the cavity
that occasionally has to be cleared of oozing blood with a suction
tube and gauze pads.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few years ago, a prostatectomy would have been much
bloodier because surgeons lacked a full understanding of the blood
vessel anatomy in the pelvic region. A patient would donate blood
before the procedure for use in any transfusion to make up for
blood loss.
</P>
<P>
   McLeod manipulates the catheter and snips the urethra at one end
of the prostate. He carefully teases back more tissue and then
snips the urethra at the other end where it joins the bladder. He
then places a segment of the blue catheter through the holes in the
gland where the urethra entered and exited and clamps the ends
together. The gland _ now attached only to the back of the pelvic
wall _ looks like a bead on a string.
</P>
<P>
   The tubing allows him to move the prostate in several directions
as he separates it on all sides from tissue and blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours after the operation began, the prostate is out.
Also removed are the seminal vesicles, glands that produce some of
the seminal fluid, which are attached to the gland.
</P>
<P>
   McLeod examines the roundish red-purple organ, about two inches
across, under the glare of the operating room's lights. He's
optimistic the disease is confined to the gland, however he won't
know for sure until a pathologist later examines slivers of the
prostate under a microscope.
</P>
<P>
   If the pathologist determines that the cancer microscopically
extends through the wall of the gland, the cancer may have spread,
making the patient's long-term prognosis less hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't appear to be outside the prostate,'' he says.
``We've probably made this man disease-free. I don't like to use
the word `cure' because there is no guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   McLeod says he has saved the erection nerve bundles, though he
concedes the operation most likely will take a toll on the
patient's sexual potency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many men never make it back to 100 percent. It's more like 70
percent,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   By noon the patient's urethra is reattached, the cavity is
irrigated with water and drained, and the medical assistants do one
more count to make sure all the equipment is accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   The man's abdominal muscles are sewn up and the skin's incision
stapled shut. A catheter to carry urine from the bladder is
inserted and will remain for several days until the urethra heals,
while a tube is inserted in a tiny incision in the pelvic cavity to
drain blood.
</P>
<P>
   The anesthesia is reduced and the patient is transferred to a
recovery room.
</P>
<P>
   Irby checks into an adjoining operating room where he is
scheduled for another operation. McLeod is off to meet a patient
and discuss the pros and cons of Viagra, the impotence drug.

SEXUAL PROBLEMS ARE A COMMON SIDE-EFFECT OF TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, Sept. 28)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The most common treatments for early-stage prostate
cancer _ surgery or radiation _ will likely reduce a man's sexual
potency.
</P>
<P>
   The treatments can pose a daunting choice between normal sexual
function and a potential cancer cure, between chances for a longer
life and the quality of that life.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Howard Waage, an insurance inspector from La
Selva Beach, Calif., who was diagnosed with prostate cancer two
years ago at age 49. He recalled being overwhelmed at learning how
many men had lost sexual function after they sought treatment. He
was shocked that some of those patients were considering penile
implants and impotence medication to restore at least some sexual
function.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first support meeting I went to they brought out vacuum
pumps and the like,'' Waage said. ``It just scared the heck out of
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatments for prostate cancer tinker with an uniquely male
reproductive organ and the surrounding nerve clusters that control
erections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything vital to a man is down in that area,'' said Waage.
</P>
<P>
   Surgical removal of the prostate, a radical prostatectomy, is
the most common treatment for early stage cancer that has not
spread beyond the gland. The use of the procedure has increased
almost six-fold between 1984 and 1990, in part due to surgical
advances designed to protect the nerves surrounding the gland,
according to the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the improved ``nerve-sparing'' techniques, at least some
damage to the two nerve bundles controlling erections is common.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very seldom do I see a patient who says, `My erections are as
good as they were before surgery,''' said Dr. David McLeod, a
surgeon and chief of urology at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   McLeod has removed the cancerous prostates of several U.S.
lawmakers, including then-Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kans., and Sens. Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska, and Richard Shelby, R-Ala., as well as that of
retired Army Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf.
</P>
<P>
   To show how easily the nerves can be damaged, McLeod moistened a
piece of toilet paper and placed it like a shroud around his
outstretched fist. The clinging tissue represented the nerve-rich
tissue and the fist represented the gland.
</P>
<P>
   The nerve bundles are not clearly defined cables, easily pushed
aside to gain access to the prostate. Rather, they are meshed
within the adjacent tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you want to do, in order to preserve the nerve bundles,
is you have to carefully peel the tissue off,'' McLeod said, gently
teasing back the wet toilet tissue from his fist.
</P>
<P>
   The nerves often are bruised in the process, which will not
cause permanent impotence. But if a surgeon believes the cancer may
have spread into surrounding tissue, one or two bundles may be
removed along with the cancerous gland.
</P>
<P>
   A man can retain some normal sexual function with one bundle
severed, but not when both are lost.
</P>
<P>
   Many men elect not to have this surgery because of the
potentially serious side effects.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Derek Durst, a 50-year-old real estate agent and
teacher from San Francisco, who was diagnosed with the cancer in
February, said he didn't want the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``A radical prostatectomy is out,'' said Durst. ``I think of it
as butchery. I'm just not convinced the nerve-sparing technique
even works that well.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Marfyaic, a former government worker from Gettysburg, Pa.,
was 59 years-old when he was diagnosed six years ago. But he turned
down surgery because he had recently remarried and didn't want to
impair his sexual function.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, I'm not ready to give up my sex life yet and I sure
don't want to wear a diaper,'' said Marfyaic, referring to urinary
incontinence, another possible side effect of surgery or radiation.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the younger the patient, the better the odds of
preserving sexual potency. However, doctors report varying success
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patrick Walsh, the chairman of the urology department at
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, has reported some of the
best results: 91 percent of his patients under 50 years of age
remained potent after prostate removal, as did 75 percent of men 50
to 60 years-old and 25 percent of men over age 70. Walsh is one of
the developers of the nerve-sparing surgical technique.
</P>
<P>
   But a study by the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston
reported far worse outcomes. Only 25 percent of patients there
claimed sexual potency one year following nerve-sparing surgery.
What's more, only 7 percent said they had erections that they
consider adequate for intercourse, according to the study published
in January in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts General doctors contend that their study is a
more honest examination of patient outcomes because it wasn't
conducted by the doctors treating the patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have observed patient reluctance to report problems to
their physicians,'' the study said. ``As a result, reports from
providers that accurately reflect what patients tell them may
document substantially fewer problems than patients report to
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Another possible explanation is that patients in the
Massachusetts General study simply may have had more advanced
disease or worse pre-treatment erection function than patients at
Johns Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the question of surgical skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people weren't treated by doctors who were as expert in
doing the operations,'' Dr. Alan Partin, a urologist at Johns
Hopkins, said of the Mass General study. ``I do about 150 to 200
operations a year. In general, you've got to get a little better
doing that many.''
</P>
<P>
   External beam radiation to the prostate _ another common therapy
_ also can destroy the same erection nerves.
</P>
<P>
   About 67 percent of men treated at Massachusetts General
Hospital with radiation reported sexual potency after one year
following treatments, but only 33 percent said their erections were
sufficient for intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   Marfyiac, who shares his experiences with men trying to make
treatment decisions, said the bottom line is this:
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what treatment a man selects, there is a potential
side effect,'' he said. ``I can't guarantee that you'll have the
same functional ability that you had before. Life will change.''

 &HT;    Graphite man falters -- why?
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI, Ohio _ On the clubhouse television, Baltimore's Cal
Ripken, Jr., sat in front of a camera, his sea-blue eyes flashing
under his receding gray hairline.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Orioles uniform off and somebody might ask, ``Who's
that, Mark McGwire's high school principal?''
</P>
<P>
   No, it's The Graphite Man. Iron Man? Ripken far surpassed the
iron age with his unfathomable run of 2,632 straight appearances on
a baseball field. Not even a robot could play in 2,632 straight
baseball games without blowing a circuit and getting an arm knocked
off on a slide.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati shortstop Barry Larkin watched the television as he
dressed for a recent game, a game in which he wouldn't play due to
a sore ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what is more significant, what McGwire and Sammy Sosa are
doing to the home-run record, or what Ripken did over the course of
the past 16 baseball seasons, Larkin pointed to the television set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely what that man did,'' Larkin said. ``Not to slight
what the other boys are doing, but you can't even do what Ripken
did on Nintendo. You can hit 65 home runs on Nintendo.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Eddie Taubensee, who has started only one of the last
six games because he is exhausted after catching in a career-high
127 games, smiled as he watched Ripken and said, ``He and I have
one thing in common. Neither one of us has ever been on the
disabled list. I've never been on the DL, not even in the minors.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an amazing accomplishment for a catcher, but Taubensee
realizes it doesn't come close to Ripken's streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat out Sunday's game because Cal sat out,'' Taubensee said
with a laugh. ``Hey, 2,632 straight games? He deserves a day off. I
can't imagine that. On our team we see Barry Larkin and Bret Boone
try to play every day . . . but every day for 16 years? Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone leads the Reds by playing in 151 games this season and had
played in all until August. He realizes the difficulty of playing
every game in one year, not to even consider 16 years of never
missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even imagine that,'' he said. ``At one time, about
three or four years ago, I thought I could play every day of my
life. No way and good luck. There are times you just hit the wall
and you have to take a day off . . . and that doesn't even take
into consideration getting hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jack McKeon says it will never happen again. That's what
they said, too, when Lou Gehrig played 2,130 games. But times have
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long-term contracts, bad advice from other people . . .
players these days who are just hanging on want out of the
lineup,'' McKeon said. ``They won't play hurt. A lot of days Ripken
had to be hurt, a sore ankle or something. It's a tribute to him
that he set an example for young players on how to play the game.
Hurt? Tired? You persevere and play the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of self-determination, discipline and desire to
do that,'' McKeon added. ``Somebody do it again? Never. Not even
close. You have to be tough, real tough and be a gamer who wants to
come to the park and be ready to play every day. I don't see that
these days . . . and he'll probably be in the Hall of Fame because
he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The leader now is Albert Belle of the Chicago White Sox, 327
games, and he burst out laughing (and Belle never laughs) when
asked about somebody playing 2,633 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one record Ripken doesn't have to worry about anyone
breaking,'' Belle said. ``That's one record I 've never thought
about. That's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least.

PROSTATE CANCER ADVOCATES COMPLAIN THAT U.S. SKIMPS RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Tuesday, Sept. 29)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Jerry Donohue, prostate cancer patient, is spending
what time he has left collecting signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue, 62, of Bellmore, N.Y., leads an effort on Long Island
aimed at building grass-roots pressure on Congress to spend more
money for prostate cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   He's in a hurry because there's no treatment for him and
thousands like him. The cancer has invaded his bones where blood is
produced. His PSA, which measures a substance produced by prostate
cells, has risen to 2,700; a normal PSA reading is 4 or less.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue, who is married with three grown children, takes a daily
dose of morphine to numb his pain. If his health permits, he plans
to start experimental chemotherapy, a treatment in part made
possible by federal research dollars.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Donohue, an environmental engineer with a consulting
firm, has helped collect nearly 15,000 signatures on a petition
that asks President Clinton and Congress ``to commit to eradicating
prostate cancer, the leading form of cancer in men, by increasing
funding for research and making prostate cancer a national
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been at it for two years, standing at shopping malls,
chatting up his auto mechanic, his electrician, the plumber and
barber, going to cancer support groups, bending the ears of anyone
who will listen, sign the petition and pass it on.
</P>
<P>
   Many people consider the topic too embarrassing to discuss, much
less sign a petition demanding more government help fighting it.
</P>
<P>
   Men generally don't like to talk about the cancer and its
treatments, which can diminish sexual function and bladder control.
Donohue recalls with disbelief the reluctance even of men suffering
from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys say, `No, I don't want my name on anything. I don't
want to get involved,''' said Donohue. ``I say, `Let me get this
straight _ you've got prostate cancer and you don't want to sign?'
It's just unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Waage, a prostate cancer patient from La Selva Beach,
Calif., who attends several support groups prostate cancer victims,
agrees about the male inability to talk about such personal
matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women can talk about stuff, but men have a hard time talking
about sexuality,'' said Waage.
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassed _ and silent _ patient group is one explanation
for the relatively small federal investment in prostate cancer
research, even though the disease is the second leading cause of
cancer deaths among American men.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress hands out research money, cash flows to the
projects demanded by the loudest and best organized health lobby
groups. The result: Federal research spending on breast cancer and
AIDS far exceeds spending on prostate cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just not vocal enough,'' said Rep. Michael Bilirakis,
R-Fla., the chairman of the House Commerce health subcommittee,
referring to the prostate cancer lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason there is so much money spent on breast cancer is
that there is a tremendous breast cancer lobby,'' said Dr. Kenneth
Pienta, director of genito-urinary oncology at the University of
Michigan, one of the nation's top cancer research centers. ``The
AIDS people also have a great lobby and they receive a lot of
funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Breast cancer and prostate cancer killed about the same number
of Americans in 1997 _ 43,900 women and 41,800 men, respectively _
while about 14,000 people died from AIDs-related illnesses last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health (which includes the National
Cancer Institute) spent about $107,214 in AIDS research for every
AIDS-related death that year; $9,362 in breast cancer research for
every breast cancer death; and $2,512 in prostate cancer research
for every prostate cancer death.
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 through 1997, the National Cancer Institute spent $371
million on prostate cancer research. By comparison, NCI spent
nearly $1.67 billion for breast cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers have steered away from investigating prostate
cancer because money is more plentiful for other kinds of work.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Cowan, a scientist at Technica Inc., a small Orlando,
Fla., start-up company developing a new generation of radiation
machinery, said he would like to do additional work on prostate
cancer partly because of a personal interest: His own cancerous
prostate was removed several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Cowan instead is focusing on breast cancer ``because there
is more money out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pienta makes the same point. ``We chase dollars as well as
anybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal money makes a difference.
</P>
<P>
   By subsidizing research or sponsoring clinical trials, the money
often translates into life-saving or life-extending therapies. Two
examples are the drug AZT for AIDs patients and new chemotherapies
for women with aggressive strains of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of prostate cancer cases is expected to continue to
rise faster than any other cancer during the remainder of this
decade, further increasing costs in an already stressed health care
system,'' warned the American Association for Cancer Research,
which represents 14,000 cancer researchers and publishes four
scientific journals.

   What it's about: A loud-mouthed, self-centered, skirt-chasing
opera star (Nathan Lane) loses his voice and returns to his
family-owned winery in Napa Valley.
</P>
<P>
   How is it? It bombs. Now we know why NBC hid this awful sitcom
from the press this summer. Even the talented Lane and a top-notch
cast (Glenne Headly and Joan Plowright) can't save this
embarrassingly unfunny comedy. What's so shocking is that Encore!
Encore! was created by the same team behind Frasier. Well, they
obviously save all the funny stuff for Kelsey Grammer. Lane (left)
mightily chews the sitcom scenery as a boorish, pompous jerk who
does wacky stuff like pick up fast women and drink mai tais with
his teenage nephew. The problem is, Lane's not a lovable, or even
likable jerk. Just a very obnoxious one.

 &HT;    CONSUMER COLUMN: You'll see in 3-D for years to come
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have a game that requires 3-D glasses. The cheap, paper
ones that came with it are almost ruined. Do you know who sells
high-quality 3-D glasses?
</P>
<P>
   _Keith McLaughlin
</P>
<P>
   A: For 3-D glasses (one blue lens, one red lens) in a plastic or
rubber frame, contact Rainbow Symphony at (800) 821-5122 or Reel
3-D Enterprises at (310) 837-2368. Reel 3-D also sells clip-ons for
customers with prescription eyewear.
</P>
<P>
   Need a fast pair of paper 3-D glasses? Send $1 in a stamped,
self-addressed envelope to Dimension 3, 256 S. Robertson Blvd.,
Beverly Hills, Calif. 90211. This promotion is offered to help
people enjoy the company's 3-D Web site at www.dimension3d.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The builder for my house is using finger-jointed wood and I
am not happy with that. I asked if this is inferior to the normal
wood and they said it's actually better.
</P>
<P>
   In my opinion, the reason for using finger-jointed wood is to
save money, not for structural superiority. What is your advice?
</P>
<P>
   _Teo Giang
</P>
<P>
   A:As the consumer, you may specify what materials are used in
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Some contractors prefer finger-jointed wood (shorter sections of
wood united by a curved joint) because it warps less and is
straighter than some stud lumber. Prices are similar. You are more
likely to see finger-jointed wood used in trim pieces that are to
be painted. Paint-grade, finger-jointed trim costs less than
stain-grade, plain lumber. (I have some at my house.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true there is an office or headquarters in Texas for
UFO followers or for people to get information on UFOs ?
</P>
<P>
   _Rudy Salazar
</P>
<P>
   A:You are looking for MUFON, the Mutual UFO Network, 103
Oldtowne Road, Seguin 78155-4099. This organization has been in
Seguin for 23 years as part of an international network of those
interested in unidentified flying objects.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Recently I visited a friend in a wealthy Austin area. All the
parking spots in front of his house were taken, so I parked in
front of his neighbor's house _ making sure it was not blocking
anything. There weren't any ``No Parking'' signs, nor was the house
on the corner.
</P>
<P>
   When I returned I found a note: ``Please DO NOT park your car in
front of OUR house.''
</P>
<P>
   Was I wrong, or was the neighbor out of line? My car is not an
eyesore. What are city rules regarding this matter?
</P>
<P>
   _S. Pratap
</P>
<P>
   A:Out of line, not to mention just plain rude (well, they did
say ``please'').
</P>
<P>
   Not blocking the driveway or sidewalk? No other place to park?
Absent ``No Parking'' signs? Not parking all-day, every day? The
note was uncalled for _ just be glad this is not your neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   The resident does not own the street in front of the house.
``Parking on a public street cannot be restricted by homeowners,''
says Austin Police Department's Lolita Slagle.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Driving through a lightning storm, I saw a blinding flash to
my right and left. At the same instant, bands of hair on the top of
my head and my left arm were briefly drawn upward. I thought my car
was struck by lightning, but there was no thunderclap. Did I not
hear the thunder since I was at the point of origin for the sound
waves? Can you verify this effect?
</P>
<P>
   _Mike Keyes
</P>
<P>
   A:Lucky guy. A car is one of the safest places to be in a
lightning storm (metal, not fiberglass _ garage the Vette or the
ragtop if a storm brews).
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kithil, founder of the National Lightning Safety
Institute, says the thunder could have been too far away or been
dimmed by your radio or closed windows. Thunder is the ``acoustical
shock wave of the electrical event,'' Kithil said.
</P>
<P>
   You may not remember the thunder. Short-term memory loss is
characteristic of lightning victims (as is the hair-raising and
involuntary muscle spasm). The car's metal conducted the
electricity around you, although some was conveyed through the
steering wheel. It is a myth that the rubber tires ground you.
</P>
<P>
   For a copy of Personal Lightning Safety Tips, check
austin360.com under my name, see the Safety Institute's Web site at
www.lightningsafety.com or send me a stamped, self-addressed
envelope.Q: I'm going to be Special Agent Dana Scully (from ``The
X-Files'') for Halloween. I'm a perfectionist, so I need an FBI
wallet ID and FBI ID tag. Can I find them in a costume shop?
</P>
<P>
   I'll also need a nice, reasonably priced dress suit. My mom
suggested Goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   _R.N.
</P>
<P>
   A:Your mom is right. Pick up a Scully suit at a thrift shop;
Goodwill, Sacks II or the Junior League Thrift Shop come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Costume shops sell rather than rent accessories. Lucy in
Disguise sells badges for less than $10. For the Real McCoy, try
places supplying public safety professionals, such as Gall's Inc.
at (800) 477-7766. Locally, visit GT Distributors, 5426 Guadalupe
St. or (800) 443-6283, which sells ID holders and wallets. Both
limit items sold to nonprofessionals.
</P>
<P>
   Q:I watch educational programs on archaeology. Many of these
programs are entertaining and informative. However, something
bothers me a bit about watching people and their artifacts being
dug up. So, when does grave robbery stop being desecration and
start being archaeology?
</P>
<P>
   _Scott Lewis
</P>
<P>
   A:Next time send me a controversial question _ like creationism
vs. evolution ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Grave robbing has nothing to do with archaeology,'' says UT
professor and director of the Texas Archaeological Research Lab Tom
Hester. In Texas, most excavations are done as salvage efforts _ a
highway coming through, land development, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Laws governing archeological digs vary from country to country
and, in the United States, from state to state. Attitudes also vary
from culture to culture. Here, for example, federal laws protect
the remains of Native Americans on federal or tribal lands.Although
the study of burial sites is controversial, Hester maintains
prehistoric bones have a story to tell (diet, disease, environment)
that cannot be otherwise obtained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digging up sites without scientific methods and goals is not
archaeology,'' continues Hester. ``Texas is plagued by those
digging up archaeological and burial sites for profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Suspect such activity? Contact the State Archaeologist, Patricia
Mercado-Allinger, at 463-6090.
</P>
<P>
   Q:In all my years I must have been told this but it went over my
head. Who buried the men who were killed at the Alamo? When and
where?
</P>
<P>
   _Louis Pabor
</P>
<P>
   A:The bodies of the Alamo defenders were burned, not buried, by
the Mexican army. One defender, Gregorio Esparza, was buried by his
brother Francisco, a member of Santa Anna's army who was not part
of the Alamo assault.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Mexican dead were buried; some corpses were put in
the San Antonio River, according to T.R. FehrenbachQ: My
grandfather was recently widowed and needs help.
</P>
<P>
   He and grandmother had a joint will, in which the survivor is
the sole heir.
</P>
<P>
   Does he need to file the will with the court house? I suggested
he ask the attorney who handled the will, but he says the attorney
will charge a fee to answer that question. Sounds strange, but
Granddaddy has very little money.
</P>
<P>
   _P.M.
</P>
<P>
   A:Attorney Lee Vanderburg of Barton and Vanderburg, P.C. says,
``Probate in Texas is simple and relatively inexpensive.'' It costs
$79 to file a will for probate in Titus County.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Titus County Clerk's office, the judge
presiding in probate matters allows individuals to come to court
pro se (without a lawyer) to probate a will if you have all the
necessary papers (an attorney can prepare the papers for a nominal
fee).
</P>
<P>
   If the only asset is a joint checking account with the right of
survivorship, then probate is not necessary, Vanderburg says. But
if your grandmother owned an interest in real property (a house?
land?) then a probated will provides a clean title trail for heirs
when your grandfather dies.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors: Did your grandmother have separate property
acquired before marriage? Descendants from a prior marriage?
</P>
<P>
   Your grandparents elected to draw up a will with an attorney.
Seems one more call would be worth it to put affairs in order.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Has Vince McMahon ever said, `` ... lllllet's get ready to
rrrrrumble'' on the television? If not, who says this?
</P>
<P>
   _S.R.S.
</P>
<P>
   A:Beefy wrestling promoter McMahon may have said it, but the man
behind the oft-quoted phrase is Philadelphia ring announcer Michael
Buffer. Buffer's trademark began about 15 years ago in the boxing
ring and has won him 15 minutes of bow-tied, golden-throated fame.
Q: We deposited $800 in cash after 3 p.m. on a Friday at
NationsBank and expected it would be processed and credited the
next business day, Monday. But the cash was not credited until
midnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Three checks came in on Monday and bounced. We were charged. At
another bank, deposits are credited the next day, before checks are
subtracted, and this wouldn't have occurred. Can NationsBank
``hold'' cash deposits? Is there an agency to contact about this
apparent injustice?
</P>
<P>
   _C. T.
</P>
<P>
   A:Cutting it close. ``The bank is entirely within regulatory
standards,'' says Texas Bankers Association's Dawn Duplantier. No
law governs the order in which a bank must process deposits or
checks. NationsBanks regional executive Andy Elliott urges you to
contact the bank and see about recouping the bounced check fees.
Banking is a competitive industry, so shop around.
</P>
<P>
   To complain about nationally chartered banks, write to
Comptroller of the Currency, 1600 Lincoln Plaza, 500 N. Akard St.,
Dallas 75201-3394; for state-chartered banks, Department of
Banking, State of Texas, 2601 N. Lamar Blvd., Austin, 78705-4294.
</P>
<P>
   Q:When I was in New York, I read about repelling silverfish. You
place gum, still wrapped, in areas where you find silverfish. It
really worked. I can't remember what kind of gum. It was one of the
Wrigleys.
</P>
<P>
   _Gloria Eckstrom

<P>
   A:Spearmint.
</P>
<P>
   The Wrigley's folks have no data on this particular use.
(Wrigley's Spearmint was introduced in 1893.) But Joey Green, in
``Paint Your House with Powdered Milk,'' suggests that, when placed
near open packages of pasta, this flavor repels pests. Keep me
posted.
</P>
<P>
   Are you a twin by any chance? Wrigley's ad agency hires the
talent for the famous Doublemint commercials: BBDO/Chicago, 410
North Michigan Ave., Chicago, Ill. 60611. It's worth a shot!Q: I am
about to graduate with a degree in international relations and am
interested in a diplomatic service job. I am looking for the
addresses of Amnesty International and the United Nations to send
my resume.
</P>
<P>
   _Melee Morgan-Powell
</P>
<P>
   A:Here are some addresses _ electronic and otherwise _ for the
job hunt. Amnesty International recruits by country. To begin in
the United States, contact the organization by e-mail at
admin-us(at)aiusa.org or write to the regional office: 131 Ponce De
Leon Ave., NE, Suite 220, Atlanta, Ga. 30308.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is you are interested in the junior professional level
at the United Nations. Send your inquiry to: United Nations,
Examinations and Tests Section, Division for Staff Development and
Performance, Policy and Specialist Services, Office of Human
Resources Management, Room S-2590 , New York, N.Y. 10017.

   What reads like a bill and looks like a bill but may not be a
bill? Some mailings readers have received from Time magazine. These
``bills'' or ``invoices'' are really subscription solicitations.
Last year the magazine agreed not to send such solicitations to
Texans. Send a copy of suspicious mailings to Assistant Attorney
General Arthur Weiss, Consumer Protection Division, P.O. Box 12548,
Austin 78711.

<P>
   Readers are always on the lookout for new ways to add meaning to
a wedding or a funeral service. How about releasing butterflies _
either individually or by the cage? Painted ladies and monarchs are
two of the species available (all native to Texas) from Traveling
Naturalists (474-9181). Individual butterflies come packaged in
envelopes with the honorees' names _ ready for release. (Before
long someone will want to release Barton Springs salamanders!)

 WASHINGTON:scientific journals.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Therefore, increased funding today for prostate cancer
research would be a wise investment,'' the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sheldon Marks, a urologist in Tucson, Ariz., and author of
the book ``Prostate &AMP; Cancer,'' angrily declares: ``Look at how
breast cancer devastates this country and look at the dollars spent
in research. And then look at prostate cancer and how it devastates
_ (but) it gets only a fraction of the money.''
</P>
<P>
   There are signs the federal government is awakening to the
problem, the most public of which is a new commemorative
first-class postage stamp to raise prostate cancer awareness.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is a growing willingness by prominent prostate cancer
victims to speak out about their disease.
</P>
<P>
   Public testimonials about the need for men to get tested have
come from such well-known prostate cancer survivors as former Sen.
Bob Dole, retired Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, Sens. Richard Shelby,
R-Ala., and Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, golfing great Arnold Palmer, NFL
legend Len Dawson, Intel founder Andy Grove, and Michael Milken,
the junk bond king.
</P>
<P>
   The funding plight has now caught the attention of the White
House. Earlier this year, President Clinton devoted his weekly
radio address to prostate cancer and pledged more federal research
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``For far too long, too little was known about prostate cancer.
Too little was said about it, out of embarrassment and fear.
Because of this, too little was done about it, as precious research
dollars were spent on other problems,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Senate lawmakers are seeking to boost NIH's
annual prostate cancer budget to about $175 million, from this
year's $114 million. Prostate cancer research proponents also are
trying to get at least $40 million from the Pentagon's annual
budget, which funds over $100 million each year for breast cancer
research.
</P>
<P>
   But the task won't be easy. In the House, Speaker Newt Gingrich,
R-Ga., has expressed concern about what he views as the
politicization of cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am opposed to getting into political health research, where
every group shows up with their banner, and their slogan, and their
calculations,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very politics that led AIDS to become a politically
desirable thing to do research in is wrong. It distorts the
research process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The prostate funding levels likely won't be decided until later
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to boost federal research and raise the profile of
prostate cancer, a new lobbying group, the National Prostate Cancer
Coalition, opened its doors about two miles from the Capitol last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Hedlund, the group's president, said government funding
barely makes a dent in what the organization thinks could be
fruitful research. With the help of top cancer researchers, the
group has identified $250 million in promising prostate cancer
research projects that the government and private industry turned
away last year because of a lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by money from pharmaceutical companies, the American
Cancer Society and Michael Milken, the group has hired Vin Weber, a
former Republican congressman from Minnesota, as its chief
lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   One of Weber's first duties was to help train 50 activists from
key congressional districts around the country on how to get
Congress to take note of the toll the disease takes on men.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing for us to tell a member of Congress to do more
on prostate cancer,'' said Hedlund. ``But it's another thing for a
member to go back home and hear somebody say, `Why the hell aren't
you doing more on this?''
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer activists point to 1997 as a fateful year that
reinforced the need for a Washington presence when Congress voted
to delay until 2000 Medicare coverage for prostate cancer
screening.
</P>
<P>
   The delay comes with a price: As many as 24,000 men might die
who otherwise would have received screening and subsequent
treatment, according to the Baltimore-based American Urologic
Disease Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is unfair,'' said Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., who has
introduced legislation to cover screening starting this year.
</P>
<P>
   The convergence of politics and disease advocacy worries
President Clinton's top cancer adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something that's not quite right about developing
armies of people who are fighting for one disease,'' said Dr.
Harold Freeman, chairman of Clinton's cancer advisory panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are good things about political pressure, but on the
other hand, it would be better if the scientific world could move
in its own logical direction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A cure for prostate cancer may come from other scientific
disciplines, such as molecular biology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But men like Jerry Donohue don't have time to wait and see if
Freeman is right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make long-term plans,'' Donohue said. ``I take it as
it comes.''

 &HT;    Commentary: Cleaning closets an exercise in self-awareness
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have been cleaning closets. It's a late-summer ritual for me,
but this time I've taken on this daunting task with a new
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine inspired me in my closet cleaning duties. She
told me of a technique passed on to her by a friend. You remove
every single item from your closet and then put back only those
things you truly love or that look exceptionally good on you or
that fit perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, you go through each piece of clothing: the tight,
slinky skirt you bought four years ago after losing 15 pounds that
you've worn exactly twice; the heavy wool sweater that you keep
hanging onto just in case Texas experiences sub-zero temperatures
for an extended period; the three pairs of khaki slacks you somehow
ended up with.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is analyzed. The fat clothes, the skinny clothes and
all the in-between clothes. How long are you really going to keep
that size 8 dress when you haven't seen a size 8 since your young
niece came to visit? On the other side of the zipper, do I really
have to keep that pair of size 16 slacks as a warning to myself to
never gain weight again?
</P>
<P>
   I discovered that cleaning my closet in such a disciplined way
was a lot like forcing myself to grow up. As I packed up a Goodwill
box of the clothes that symbolized my insecurities and some false
hopes, I also began doing an inventory of my mental closet.
</P>
<P>
   What am I holding onto in my memory bank that no longer serves
me well, that no longer fits me anymore? Resentments, insecurities,
anger? What seemed perfect to wear for a season now seems outdated
and childish. Am I ready to let it go, pack it up and send it on
its way?
</P>
<P>
   What about some of my beliefs and convictions? Do I believe
today as I did 20 years ago? Isn't it time to put that tie-dyed
dogma and that hip-hugging hype away? They're not my style anymore
and I need to clean the remnants of them out of my system.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the items I discarded because they just weren't
comfortable anymore. Like three-inch spike heels, they were an
image I tried to force myself into only to teeter precariously.
What am I trying to prove with that image? Do I really care about
that issue anymore? Who am I fooling?
</P>
<P>
   Other ``clothes'' I discarded because they no longer allowed me
to breathe. Any belief or ideology that constricted or limited me,
I unbuckled, unzipped and unbuttoned. I'm too old to hold my
breath. I need space in which to inhale great gasping gulps of
wisdom and knowledge, as much as I possibly can.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning out closets is a tiresome task usually. It confronts
you with your excess and calls you to be a better steward of your
possessions. With my friend's method of closet cleaning, you must
decide what you truly love and need. That can be an amazing
exercise in self-awareness.
</P>
<P>
   There is a story Sue Bender relates in her book Everyday Sacred
about an earnest young student who seeks out a Zen monk for wisdom.
The monk asks the student to pour him a cup of tea and he will tell
the student when to stop. The student does so and the cup quickly
overflows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't you see the cup is full? It can hold no more!'' the
student exclaims.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so it is with you,'' the teacher answers. ``Your mind is
full of too many things. Only when you are empty will there be room
for more knowledge to come in.''

 &HT;    ``Laugh meter'' isn't so funny, all of a sudden
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ I have an idea for a television game show.
I'll call it, ``Can You Top This?''
</P>
<P>
   The name is not new, I confess. It's stolen from an old radio
show I used to listen to when I was a kid. I loved it. Four or five
funny guys would get together once a week and tell jokes. One would
tell a story and then dare the others to tell a funnier one.
Winners were determined by audience response which was measured on
something called a ``laugh meter.''
</P>
<P>
   My show will be just as funny as ``Can You Top This?'' even
though the contestants won't be joking. Participants will be
limited to political candidates wishing to get a head start on the
campaign trail by artlessly confessing all of their past sins
before their opponents can dig up something on them. Great idea,
huh?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and gentlemen,'' the moderator will begin, ``our first
guest tonight is running for
</P>
<P>
   office in Ogden, Utah. Let's welcome Lewis Lackluster.''
Applause as Lewis adjusts his
</P>
<P>
   hangdog look and shambles into the bulletproof glass booth.
``All right, Lewis,'' the unctuous emcee will drone, ``it's
confession time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My fellow Americans,'' Lewie begins, pulling a well-fingered
list from his breast pocket,
</P>
<P>
   ``I have 38 sins to confess - 29 more than my opponent who would
have you believe he's
</P>
<P>
   the biggest sinner in the county. Why folks, I was sinning
before that boy was born. I wasn't hardly out of knee pants before
I was pilfering penny candy from the corner store. By the time I
was twelve, I was drinking beer, and smoking behind the barn....''
Lewie babbles on, each successive sin a little more lurid than the
one before until finally the audience interrupts with an audible
groan, indicating they're unable to endure any more.
</P>
<P>
   The moderator signals Lewie that his time is up. ``Great job,
Lewie,'' he exults. Your audience gross-out time is a near record.
Now you have 30 seconds for contrition.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously a drained and broken man, Lewie manages to squeeze out
a tear as he promises that if folks will vote for him they have his
word he'll go and sin no more.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the possibilities here. No ugly surprises ten or twelve
years down the road. Past
</P>
<P>
   sins in all of their disgusting detail will have been publicly
atoned for in advance, thereby
</P>
<P>
   precluding the need for special prosecutors, costly
inquisitions, and nose jobs.
</P>
<P>
   And for all of the wannabes who find themselves a little light
on the tote board of sins, the show's producers will supply a
listing of the top two hundred in order to provide contestants with
a multiple choice situation wherein they can order sin like Chinese
food _ one from column A and two from column B.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Maybe we could even work a deal for future sins _
lame duck specials for
</P>
<P>
   the guy on the way out. Three adulteries and two perjuries, with
residuals going to the
</P>
<P>
   officeholder-elect.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Americans, I'm sick of what's going on in Washington.
I'm up to here with lies and deception, particularly when I wasn't
particularly concerned with our president's moral dilemma in the
first place. My feelings were: Okay, he's in, but soon he'll be out
and it'll all be over. Let history deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   But the beat goes on and now Americans are being held captive in
a world of contrition,
</P>
<P>
   confession, and rampant speculation. I don't know how you feel
about it, but my ``laugh meter'' is just about pegged out. Worst of
all, I hate watching Newt Gingrich pretend he isn't loving every
minute of it.

 &HT;    Sports night
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it debuts: Tuesday, 9:30 p.m., ABC.
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: A behind-the-scenes look at a show that looks a
lot like ESPN's SportsCenter.
</P>
<P>
   How is it? Tries too hard to ape The Larry Sanders Show's witty
and deliciously sarcastic style, but fails. C'mon . . . doesn't
everybody know that sportscasters wear shorts under the desk? More
annoying is Sports Night's schizophrenia. Is it a comedy or is it a
drama? Should we laugh? Or cry? Walking that tightrope isn't wise
since viewers will ultimately get sick of trying to figure it out
and just turn it off. Robert Guillaume, who plays the show's gruff
executive producer, sums up Sports Night best. ``I think this whole
show is going to hell in a hand basket.'' While he was talking
about his fictitious cable show, he could've just as easily been
referring to this witless ABC series.

 &HT;    Using Web term papers nets students bad grades
 &HT;    By Kevin Tankersley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's midnight, and that research paper is due at 8 a.m. Yes, it
was assigned a month ago, but there just hasn't been time to work
on it much. Not with football games and volleyball matches and
church and work. And no, there's no way to do research, take notes
and write the thing in eight hours. Hmmm, let's see what can be
found on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Do a search for ``term paper'' and ``research paper.'' Well,
there are several sites that charge money for an already-written
paper. But look here. Site after site after site offering up papers
. . . for free! That'll work. Let's see, download, clean it up a
little, fill in the pertinent info: Name, date, class, prof's name.
All set now, and with a few hours to spare.
</P>
<P>
   So what's wrong with this picture?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is already an F,'' Baylor University lecturer Robert
Darden said as he marked the second page of a seven-page paper
titled ``Three Important Qualities of Christ's Life.'' The paper
was downloaded from a Web site dubbed Phree School. Darden's
comments in the margin of the paper suggested problems with it from
the first sentence: ``Ever since Jesus was born, he has always been
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Specifics?'' Darden questioned, and wrote notes asking about
attribution for the statement. Another sentence _ ``He had flesh
which is matter'' _ was marked ``unclear'' by Darden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not follow research paper format,'' Darden said.
``It's filled with high school (type) errors.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, ads have run in the back of Rolling Stone and other
magazines geared toward the young, offering ``Term Paper
Assistance'' and ``Research Help.'' Send in $15 or $20 and in a few
days you could receive a research paper. Of course, those papers
are ``for research purposes only,'' the companies always state.
</P>
<P>
   Those advertisements are still in place, but like most every
other industry, it also has a presence on the Internet. A search
effort will bring forth dozens of sites, some from students and
other scholars who have posted papers on personal Web sites. Not
for anyone else to copy, print and turn in but to show what sort of
work they are doing in their particular fields.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites, however, are loaded with papers to be downloaded,
once again for ``research purposes only,'' most sites read. But for
a student waiting until the last minute to begin work on a project,
the temptation to turn the paper in as one's own could be strong.
But according to some local educators, that would not be a bright
idea.
</P>
<P>
   A notice at the Phree School site
(http://members.aol.com/dagunman/ phree.html) says the
administrator of the site takes ``no responsibility for your use of
any information posted on this page.''
</P>
<P>
   E-mail interview requests for this article to Web masters of a
couple of term-paper related sites were ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Darden, who said he teaches his students the mechanics of
researching a paper, more so than the grammar aspect of writing,
was not impressed with the sample paper's research or writing
style. Darden knows of what he speaks in doing research. He has
written 25 books, one of which _ Berdache, a horror novel set in
East Texas _ took seven years of research.
</P>
<P>
   Students in Darden's classes are free to use either traditional
library sources or the Internet as resources for writing papers.
But finding already-written papers to download would be a near
impossibility. Darden assigns topics of research papers _ ``They're
not going to come to me with a topic,'' he said _ that are fairly
obscure, such as religious beliefs of the indigenous tribes of
Vietnam, or the role of correspondents for Harper's Weekly during
the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   The process of research also precludes students from coming to
class with a completed paper on the due date. Students must turn in
work along the way, such as an outline and thesis statement,
materials typically not available on the free papers floating about
the Net.
</P>
<P>
   The process is much the same for the research papers that Pat
Waterman's students write in advanced placement English classes at
Midway High School, though her students have a bit more leeway in
subject selection.
</P>
<P>
   Waterman, who is in her 13th year at Midway, creates a graph
with a timeline down the left side and suggested topic areas along
the top. Students then are free to choose a topic, such as
politics, crime, fine arts or sports, from a particular era and
write about that. All sources for Midway papers must be from the
school library, which is not connected to the Internet, which rules
that out as a source.
</P>
<P>
   Waterman said students are limited to using library sources so
teachers can find cited works if a question arises when the paper
is being graded.
</P>
<P>
   Waterman gives her students a calendar listing dates that
certain materials pertaining to the paper are due. The papers are
researched over a three-week period. Students pick a broad topic
during the first week. In the second week, they narrow down the
topic and present 15 note cards or pieces of photocopied
information that will be used in the paper. The final paper is due
at the end of the third week. Just as in Darden's class at Baylor,
there are deadlines along the way; handing in a completed paper
with no supporting material is out of the question. Not that
students haven't tried to bluff their way through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspected one student three or four years ago,'' Waterman
said. ``She had not met any of the deadlines but showed up with a
paper.''
</P>
<P>
   That student received a zero on the paper, which is typically
about 25 percent of the student's grade during a six-week grading
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``That can make 'em or break 'em,'' Waterman said.
</P>
<P>
   While for Midway students the 'Net is verboten _ especially
those sites with papers ready to download _ Dr. Lynn Waller shows
off those sites to his students at McLennan Community College.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take them to SchoolSucks (www.schoolsucks.com) and let them
know I'm aware of those resources that are out there,'' said
Waller, who teaches freshman composition and technical
communications at the school. ``I show them how they could easily
cheat, and the legal reasons'' they shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Those legal ramifications could include the involvement of the
FBI if interstate telephone lines are used for the transmission of
bogus term papers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides legal problems, students caught turning in papers that
are not their own work face disciplinary action, from receiving no
credit for the paper to expulsion from the school, Waller said.
</P>
<P>
   Waller critiqued a three-page paper on Charles Dickens' A Tale
of Two Cities, and said it was ``poorly written,'' and would not be
considered college-level material. The paper came from CyberEssays
(www.cyberessays.com).
</P>
<P>
   Midway's Waterman said the content of the same report ``looks
like someone paraphrased the Cliffs Notes'' of the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no thesis statement,'' she said. ``It's just a summary
of the novel.''
</P>
<P>
   But Waller is not against using the 'Net for classwork. This
semester he is teaching an Internet-based English composition
class, where students never meet in a traditional classroom, but do
all of the work via e-mail and Internet chat rooms created for the
class. While some of Waller's students use the computers on the MCC
campus, one student is taking the class from Hong Kong, with
intentions of transferring the credit hours to Baylor.

 &HT;    Maddux, Braves looking beatable
 &HT;    By Dan Graziano
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Greg Maddux is missing his targets by inches. To the Atlanta
Braves, he might as well be missing by a mile.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' ace has struggled since the All-Star break, making a
typically nerve-wracking September even more unsettling for
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who begin a quick two-game series tonight at Pro
Player Stadium against the Florida Marlins, have won their division
in each of the past seven seasons, including this one. But they've
won the World Series only once (1995).
</P>
<P>
   If they're to win it this year, they'll need their pitching
staff _ and especially Maddux _ at full strength. Since the break,
Maddux is 5-7 with a 3.28 ERA and there are whispers around
baseball that something is wrong with his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux says he knows what's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been inconsistent with my location, and that's my whole
game,'' he said. ``My arm feels fine, and I'm throwing all my
pitches fine, just not always in the right spots.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the key. What makes Maddux dominant is his ability to
throw high-80-mph fastballs on the corners with good movement.
Lately, the pitches that for years have tailed away from hitters
and nicked the outside corners are staying over the plate and
becoming hittable. And the pitches that used to tail in on hitters
and catch the slightest bit of the plate at the last possible
moment have been staying out of the strike zone, becoming walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been fine mechanically, just a little bit off,'' Braves
pitching coach Leo Mazzone said. ``With Greg, it's not something
that can't be corrected. As long as we get it figured out in time
for the playoffs, he'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves in general have some things to figure out heading
into the playoffs _ like can they live up to another 100-win season
by not collapsing. They've been beaten in the post-season by teams
good enough to compete with them and driven enough to beat them.
The Phillies in 1993. The Yankees in 1996. The Marlins in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't throw the switch on in the playoffs,'' Braves
infielder Ozzie Guillen said. ``In the playoffs, we're going to
have 2-1 games, 3-2 games, close games. We've got to do the little
things to win those.''
</P>
<P>
   But right now, some pretty big things are looking troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   _ Right-hander John Smoltz is 11-1 with a 2.41 ERA since the
All-Star break, but he's got a nagging elbow problem and won't make
another start until the playoffs because he ``doesn't want to risk
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Atlanta's bench and bullpen, traditional post-season Achilles'
heels, are no better than last year, when the Marlins beat the
Braves late in NLCS games, or the year before when the Yankees did
the same in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   _ And there's Maddux. Even if there's nothing wrong with his
arm, problems with his location won't get him or his team far if
he's matched against Randy Johnson and the Houston Astros in a
crucial game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on pure talent, this team is the best team I've ever
been on,'' said Tom Glavine, whose 20 wins lead the major leagues.
``Sometimes, since it's such a long season, you can start taking
things lightly, start not feeling any urgency. We need to realize
we won't always just be able to turn it on because we want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially against Houston and San Diego, division champions
with regular-season credentials as solid as Atlanta's.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, there was maybe one other team along with us,''
Glavine said. ``Now, all three division winners are about even.
It's going to be a tough road, but if we play the way we played in
April, not many teams will be able to beat us.''

ANTI-BALDNESS DRUG IS STUDIED FOR USE AGAINST PROSTATE CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Tuesday, Sept. 29)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DON FINLEY  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Almost 25 years ago, doctors published an account
of a rare genetic disorder among some children in the Dominican
Republic. The children were born sexually ``ambiguous,'' but
developed as normal males after puberty.
</P>
<P>
   The Dominican Republic research ``eventually led to the
discovery that the prostate actually is present in male and female
fetuses early in development, but it requires androgen stimulation
for it to develop,'' said Dr. Ian Thompson, chief of surgery at
Brooks Air Force Base and clinical director of the national study.
</P>
<P>
   That observation led to the understanding that 5
alpha-reductase, a metabolite of testosterone, the male sex
hormone, leads to the development of the prostate in males.
</P>
<P>
   Even as adults, the men with the genetic disorder could not
properly make 5 alpha-reductase. They had a small prostate gland
throughout life, did not develop benign prostate enlargement or
prostate cancer. Nor did they develop male pattern baldness or
acne.
</P>
<P>
   Research into that phenomenon eventually led to the drug
Proscar, used to treat prostate disease and male-pattern baldness.
The drug also is being studied in more than 1,500 healthy San
Antonio men to see if it will prevent prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial is a seven-year study of
18,882 men across the country. San Antonio has the largest pool of
volunteers, with the Brooke Army Medical Center and Wilford Hall
Medical Center participating.
</P>
<P>
   If the drug is shown to prevent prostate cancer with minimum
side effects, it will provide doctors and patients with a powerful
tool against the second deadliest cancer killer of men.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio researchers also are looking for the genes
responsible for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio familial prostate cancer study has enrolled 28
families, each with two or more members with early onset of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The study was originally designed to focus on Mexican-American
families, but only two have enrolled, said Dr. Rosemarie Plaetke,
assistant professor of cellular and structural biology at the
University of Texas Health Science Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often we have Mexican-American prostate cancer patients who
want to participate. However, willingness of relatives to be
enrolled in the study is low,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers are working on developing new therapies _ or
improving existing ones _ for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Sarosdy, a local urologist, is looking at an
alternative drug for patients after they've undergone primary
treatment for their cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Sarosdy is exploring whether high doses of a single drug,
Casodex, can be effective with fewer side effects such as muscle
wasting, loss of muscle mass and bone demineralization.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other drugs, Casodex doesn't interfere with the
production of the male hormone testosterone, but blocks it from
interacting with cancer cells within the prostate, Sarosdy said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is also trying to determine whether interrupting
long-term hormone therapy might actually improve outcome for
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you need hormonal therapy you start it and it continues
forever with metastatic disease,'' Thompson said. ``There are side
effects from that _ osteoporosis, anemia, mood changes. My old
professor told me it takes the wind out of your sails.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have evidence that you don't need to do it continuously,
that it can be intermittent. It may have all sorts of benefits to
the patient in terms of side effects of treatment. And there are
some data that suggests it may be actually beneficial at reducing
the development of hormone-resistant prostate cancer.''

 &HT;    Designs, materials tips on caring for a deck
 &HT;    By Christi Mays
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The deck is just another ``room'' of the house at the Linthicum
residence.
</P>
<P>
   Gary and Janet Linthicum of Woodway and their four children
spend hours outside ``living'' on their deck. At 700 square feet it
is larger than many small apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good place to be,'' Janet said. ``When it is cooler, we
spend from the time we get home from work until it's time to go to
bed out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Made of redwood lumber, the deck features an upper section with
zigzag edges and several steps leading to a lower oval-shaped
section with built-in benches and handrails.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons the deck is special to the family is
because Gary and Janet built it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a whole lot cheaper,'' explained Gary, who had built
several decks in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The Linthicums' brick home, which was finished early last year,
was designed to have a deck in the back. They began working on the
deck about four months after they moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Before building the deck, the couple planned what they wanted
and got a friend to sketch a picture. They built the deck in
stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to dig some of the dirt off the lot _ about 10 feet of
dirt _ to get down to the original dirt,'' Gary said. He wanted the
yard to slope in the back.
</P>
<P>
   The couple built the 400-square-foot upper deck first. Working
on the deck in their spare time, the project took about five weeks
to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Gary decided on built-in benches on the lower deck and decided
against stationary planters.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a stationary planter, you'll be watering all the time and
getting dirt and stuff on the deck,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The large deck is ideal for entertaining. The family had its
first get-together on the deck about three weeks ago. There was no
shortage of space, even though about 35 people attended the party,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   When homeowners build their own decks, Linthicum said they
should try a little creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just build a big old flat deck, 20-by-20, it's going to
be a big, old flat deck, 20-by-20,'' he said. ``Give it some
character and bust it up and make different arrangements.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Evans, owner of Redwood Inc., said ideas on shapes and
sizes can be found in books and magazines on building d ources
provide lots of design and building ideas and are available at
bookstores, hardware stores and the library.
</P>
<P>
   ``A deck is something that is relatively easy to construct,''
Evans said. ``Lots of people do them themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   He can show someone how to build a deck in about 15 minutes,
provided they know a few things about building, including how to
use a tape measure, post hole digger, hand or skill saw and a
hammer.
</P>
<P>
   One important thing to keep in mind is foundation design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well over half of the people will under-design or over-design
a deck,'' he said. ``They'll either build it where it feels like a
trampoline when you walk across it or build it strong enough to
raise a herd of elephants on.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither way is the right way to build it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building it past its optimum strength is not going to extend
its life one day, but building it well below the optimum strength
will shorten its life,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   In the construction process, one of the most important things is
the use of proper fasteners, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We constantly run across people who have built decks
themselves and they went out and bought $2,000 worth of materials,
then tried to save $15 or $20 on the nails they use,'' he said.
``By doing this, you've dropped the life of the deck from 20 years
down to three to five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Galvanized or coated nails are the best. Steel nails will rust
and stain the wood.
</P>
<P>
   And since nails represent only 2 to 3 percent of the cost of the
deck, it's foolish to skimp, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the deck's overall design, it's limited only by the
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Linthicum even made a mistake when putting in an outer post, but
managed to work it into the whole scheme of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put that post an inch inside from (where it should be),
which is very wrong,'' he said. He boxed it off and put in an extra
board and now it's practically unnoticeable.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one will ever see it,'' he said. ``You can't do anything
actually wrong.'' CARING FOR YOUR DECK
</P>
<P>
   Keep leaves off. If leaves accumulate, the deck will stay wet,
and that's not good, says Charles Evans, owner of Redwood Inc.
</P>
<P>
   He said to also take care that the deck isn't being doused
regularly with water from a sprinkler system or with chemical
fertilizers from fertilizer spreaders. All of those things will
shorten the deck's life span, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Keep a regular maintenance schedule. This includes a thorough
cleaning every spring and fall, then thoroughly hosing down the
entire deck once or twice a month, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   A likely place the deck will begin to deteriorate is between the
boards. So hose between them well to rinse away dirt and residue.
</P>
<P>
   Place planters on risers or wheels to prevent discoloration and
prevent mildew and algae from forming on the wood, advises Country
Sampler's Decorating Ideas. If mildew and algae do appear on the
wood, remove the stains with a solution of one-part bleach with
four parts water.
</P>
<P>
   Use rubber protectors on the bottoms of metal furniture to
prevent rust and gouges.
</P>
<P>
   Place mats under grills to protect a deck from spills or grease.
If grease has been spilled on the wood, use an automotive degreaser
or carburetor cleaner to clean it. Do not use these products in
direct sunlight.

 &HT;    Distractive Worrell attracts Panthers fans
 &HT;    By Brian Biggane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's an unlikely scenario, but if the Florida Panthers ever
decide to assign right winger Peter Worrell to an East Coast Hockey
League team, fans of the Pensacola Sky Pilots would love to have
him.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 4,194 that watched the Panthers battle the
expansion Nashville Predators to a 4-4 tie at the Pensacola Civic
Center on a recent night grew increasingly enamored of the
6-foot-7, 225-pound enforcer as the game went on, chanting
``Worr-ell, Worr-ell,'' cheering every time he took the ice and
booing every time he departed.
</P>
<P>
   Worrell gained their affection by playing his usual aggressive
game, pounding Predators tough guy Dennis Lambert in a pair of
fights and generally distracting his opponents with crushing hits
at every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter did a good job,'' Florida coach Terry Murray said after
Worrell's tactics had helped the Panthers take over the game in the
third period and rally to tie. ``If we got that kind of game from
him on a game-to-game basis, we couldn't ask for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very intense, he's good in the locker room and he brings
energy. He played smart at the end. They took some runs at him and
paid for it with a couple of penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the Panthers (0-1-1), who have yet to work on special teams
in training camp, had any real success on their power play _ they
finished just 2-of-14 _ they could have gained a split of the
weekend series.
</P>
<P>
   Worrell, 21, understands his role. After amassing 462 minutes in
penalties last season _ including 153 in his 19 games with Florida
_ he knows that the more he can get opponents to focus on him
instead of their game, the more successful he becomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they're more worried about trying to get back at me, that
gives us a chance to get back in the game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Worrell felt he had played poorly in Florida's 4-2 loss to the
Predators a night earlier in Huntsville, Ala., and was determined
to redeem himself. After spending the final month of the season
with the Panthers last spring, he's hoping to stick around from the
start this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to show I deserve to be here, and to get more ice
time,'' he said. His skating, which has always been a shortcoming,
is much improved, though his stick work and lateral mobility remain
below par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rate my camp as so-so so far. I haven't been bad, but I
haven't been at my best either. Hopefully this will get me back on
track.''
</P>
<P>
   Difference of opinion: Goaltender Kirk McLean didn't think his
performance Sunday _ in which he gave up four goals on 23 shots _
was as disappointing as Murray did.
</P>
<P>
   All four goals came from long range and two or three of them
seemed preventable, prompting Murray to say, ``Kirk has got to stop
those.''
</P>
<P>
   McLean's response: ``I felt pretty good; they were pretty good
shots. . . . For the first time out, I felt pretty strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy: Right winger Dino Ciccarelli sprained his ankle
Monday, the first on-ice injury of training camp. He is expected to
miss 1-2 weeks. . . . The Panthers assigned 10 players to
minor-league affiliates, leaving 36 players in camp. Forwards
Andrew Long, Curtis Doell, Herbert Vasiljevs, Tero Lehtera, Dave
Duerden, Mike Brown and Craig Ferguson, defensemen Lance Ward and
Joey Teterenko and goaltender Denis Khloptonov.

 &HT;    End of an era: Last downtown auto dealership packs up for the
suburbs
 &HT;    By R. Michelle Breyer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Before there was a Motor Mile, back when U.S.
183 was considered in the far reaches of Austin, before Austinites
had ever heard of a car named KIA, downtown was the place to car
shop.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1900s, East Fifth Street, Texas, was lined with
dealers that sold Cadillacs and Chandlers, Indiana Trucks and
Studebakers. In recent years, downtown was home to such dealers as
McMorris Ford, Covert Buick and Capitol Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they've all but disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   After 47 years at 501 N. Lamar Blvd., Capitol moved its sales
lot to a new 26-acre dealership last month on the south end of the
Motor Mile on Interstate 35 near William Cannon Drive. Capitol's
service department will move this week and the parts department
will follow in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   Although Land Rover Austin opened a dealership on West Fifth
Street last fall several blocks west of the city's central business
district, and a few other used car dealers are still downtown,
Capitol was the last dealership in the city's urban core.
</P>
<P>
   In Capitol's place will be Austin Marketplace, a 425,000
square-foot retail, entertainment and office complex. Developers
are hoping to break ground on the project by mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Capitol signals the end of an era _ a time when
families drove in rather than out of Austin's central city to look
at shiny new cars.
</P>
<P>
   Austin is like downtowns around the United States _ cities in
the midst of revitalization. Car dealers are moving away from the
central city, faced with skyrocketing downtown land values and the
lure of the growing suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   It is a trend that excites downtown boosters who think
pedestrian-filled streets and fancy shops are better than car lots
when it comes to revitalizing the city's core.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, auto dealerships have been replaced by some of the most
celebrated additions to the southwest edge of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Whole Foods Market and Book People at Sixth Street and Lamar
Boulevard took the place of Capitol's truck sales lot. Advertising
company GSD&AMP;M headquarters next door used to be McMorris Ford.
Developer Whit Hanks has converted Capitol Chevrolet's body shop on
the northwest corner of West Fifth Street and North Lamar Boulevard
into high-end stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``These projects are going to be a big plus for downtown,''
Charles Betts, executive director of the Downtown Austin Alliance,
said of Austin Marketplace and the office project.
</P>
<P>
   Betts said the changing downtown landscape is a natural
progression. While land in the suburbs can be purchased for less
than $10 a square foot, downtown costs can run $40 a square foot,
Betts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As property values have risen, it justifies more intense
development downtown,'' Betts said. ``It's a matter of economics.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first auto dealers to leave Austin's downtown was
Henna Chevrolet, which moved to Interstate 35 more than 30 years
ago. Dodge, Pontiac and Cadillac-Oldsmobile dealerships left
downtown soon afterward for large lots along U.S. 183.
</P>
<P>
   When real estate prices north of downtown rose in the early
1980s, South Austin's Motor Mile gained popularity, with pioneers
like Hendrix GMC Trucks, Leif Johnson's trucks and John Roberts
Subaru. By 1986, it had been joined by dealerships selling Honda,
Pontiac, Audi-Porsche, Volkswageon, Dodge, BMW and Hyundai.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-September, Covert's Buick, Saturn and Isuzu dealers
completed its move from West Fifth Street to 11750 Research Blvd.
in North Austin. An Austin developer plans to build an office
complex in its place.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hadn't vacated the land, our tax bill would have forced
us to,'' said William Cromwell, president and general manager of
Capitol Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   The property tax on the land rose nearly 70 percent during the
past year, he said. He estimated that the land's valuation has
risen by 500 percent in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't economically feasible for us to be there anymore,''
Cromwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the dealership's downtown service business was still
good, sales had fallen off _ a trend Cromwell attributes to the
traffic congestion of the area and the allure of clusters of
dealerships along I-35 and U.S. 183. Downtown, he said, just wasn't
convenient anymore for most people. ``It was time to move,''
Cromwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Betts said he is excited about the new projects slated
for downtown, he says he will miss the convenience of dropping his
two Chevrolets at Capitol to be serviced. He could walk six blocks
from the dealership to his downtown office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Capitol will have a good shuttle service,'' he said.

 &HT;    Thorndale students apologize to victim
 &HT;    By Dylan Rivera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMERON _ Four Thorndale High School students admitted in
juvenile court recently that they attacked a classmate in a
football hazing ritual last October that divided a small town and
fed a growing feud over the prosecutor's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The students confessed in court that they used a plastic
soda-type bottle to commit an act of ``physical brutality'' against
a classmate that ``subjected him to shame, humiliation and extreme
mental stress. . .for the purpose of being initiated into junior
varsity football.'' The attack occurred in an athletics weight
room.
</P>
<P>
   As a condition of a plea bargain, each of the teens _ Paul
Bernstein, Cole Chapman, R. J. Sandoval and Jerry Young, all 15, _
stood and apologized publicly to Joshua Bonney, the student they
had attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really didn't mean to hurt you,'' Bernstein said in court.
``We hope you can move past this. We all feel sorry about this.''
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the boys stood nervously and made similar
statements. ``I'm sorry for what we did and we didn't mean to hurt
you,'' Sandoval said.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Bonney, the 15-year-old victim, said in an interview
after the hearing that he had been through ``hell'' at the hands of
high school bullies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think that because they're bigger than everybody on the
football team that they think they're going to have privileges,''
Joshua Bonney said. He said the attack was not hazing: ``It doesn't
happen to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonney said he was happy that the case was settled but would
have preferred a harsher penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the defendants nor their attorneys would comment after
the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The final charge was a compromise that stopped short of accusing
the teens of sodomizing Bonney and reduced a felony to a
misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   While the four teens, all of whom have been high school football
players, were originally charged with sexual assault, they admitted
to a Class B misdemeanor charge of hazing in a plea bargain that
was negotiated all weekend and until the last minute Monday
morning. They each will perform 80 hours of community service,
serve one year of probation, and pay the victim's counseling fees
up to $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   They are also required to refrain from contact with Bonney and
not have any adverse contact with two other teens who were to be
witnesses in a trial.
</P>
<P>
   If the teens violate the probation, Lance could sentence them to
incarceration in a Texas Youth Commission facility until they turn
21.
</P>
<P>
   Lance sternly lectured the boys, threatening harsher punishment
if they violate their probations.
</P>
<P>
   The judge told the youths it would have been better if they had
broken the victim's legs ``because dignity and self-respect are a
lot slower in the healing process.''
</P>
<P>
   It was originally alleged that another teen was the victim of an
attempted sexual assault, but that issue did not come up Monday.
Lewis said later that the second victim declined to prosecute
because testifying would have caused too much distress.
</P>
<P>
   The Thorndale case landed in and was fodder for a bitter feud
over control of the courthouse in Milam County. State District
Judge Charles Lance, who presided in the case, and juvenile
officials who were investigating it publicly criticized County and
District Attorney Hollis Lewis Jr. for the 10-month delay before
charges were filed in August. One probation officer cited the
Thorndale case among several allegations in a removal suit he filed
against Lewis in June.
</P>
<P>
   In previous court cases, Lance had found that Lewis lied to the
court and committed other misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis denies those charges and says he is being run out of the
county on exaggerated and false accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, there were no outward signs of conflict between Lance
and Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Myra Bonney, Joshua's mother, said she was glad to have closure
in the case. She said she wanted to seek a conviction of sexual
assault, but after seeing her son try to practice his testimony in
the courtroom this weekend, she was convinced the lesser charge
would be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was willing to stand up and say what happened to him in
front of everyone but we came up here a couple times and I saw what
he was going through and I'm not going to do that,'' Myra Bonney
said. ``He's been through enough. We had to relocate; my kids are
in another school now. These kids have no idea what they've done to
my family.'' Joshua now attends Granger High School.
</P>
<P>
   Thorndale Superintendent Wayne Calhoun said Monday's actions
would provide needed closure to a community that had been shocked
by the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the community's reaction to the allegations, Calhoun
said, ``While it's possible they could have understood or believed
boys doing hazing, the sexual assault seemed to outrageous that it
was difficult for them to believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun said the community and school district have been
unfairly criticized for their handling of the case. In the wake of
the incident last year, school officials studied their disciplinary
procedures, called for closer supervision of students in
non-classroom settings and encouraged other students to come
forward with complaints, Calhoun said.
</P>
<P>
   Myra Bonney said she hoped that both sets of teens would be able
to go on with their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lot of pain here and on the other side and
hopefully they've learned their lesson,'' Myra Bonney said.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Dillenberger, the chief Milam County juvenile probation
officer who had criticized Lewis in writing for delays in the case,
said Monday that the plea bargain could be helpful for all
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like it's important for them to apologize because it
helps them understand that they did do something wrong and for the
victim to hear that in court, I think it's very healing,''
Dillenberger said.

 &HT;    Was Clinton tape good TV? Only for insomniacs
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It had to be one of the most surreal moments television has ever
produced.
</P>
<P>
   A visibly angry, finger-waving President Clinton answering
intimate _ and sometimes salacious _ grand jury questions about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Here was the usually unflappable Clinton swallowing hard after
pointed questions or downing water and Diet Coke like a near-dying
man lost in the Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   ABC commentator and former White House communications director
George Stephanopoulos admitted the president looked ``scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow ABC analyst Cokie Roberts remarked she felt sorry for a
beleaguered Clinton, adding that, ``You feel like he's a little boy
before the principal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was,'' said ABC's Sam Donaldson, ``breathtaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Really, Sam? I'd say it was more of a Bore. All those racy
inquiries were sandwiched in between mostly insomnia-curing
legalese.
</P>
<P>
   If viewers were smart, they skipped the four-hour inquisition
and waited for CNN's highlights.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at 9:25 a.m., ABC, CBS, NBC and C-SPAN began airing
Clinton's videotaped testimony.
</P>
<P>
   While the big three networks (ABC, CBS, NBC) took pains to tell
viewers that much of the testimony was sexually graphic, only NBC
had the guts to cut away when those moments actually arrived.
Instead, NBC showed interviews and a portion of Clinton's speech
before the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   CBS switched from airing the testimony live to a 10-second
delay.
</P>
<P>
   ABC used a five-second delay to give producers time to stop
before airing inappropriate language. But in the first 2 1/2 hours,
it ran the testimony unedited.
</P>
<P>
   CNN periodically ran a graphic on the screen under Clinton:
``Warning: Testimony may contain explicit details.'' The other
networks used similar warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, only WPTV-Channel 5 didn't air Clinton's entire
testimony. The station cut away to air its regularly scheduled noon
newscast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got pretty graphic,'' explains Todd Woolman, Channel 5's
news director. ``Our network was cutting away because they felt it
was too graphic, so we felt we might as well put on our local
news.''
</P>
<P>
   WPEC-Channel 12, however, chose to stick with Clinton's entire
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those things where once you're in it, you almost
have an obligation to stay in it,'' said Don Colee, Channel 12's
programming director. ``At that point, to go in and selectively
censor, I don't think that would've been a good thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as expected, local TV stations received a number of
calls from angry viewers complaining the testimony didn't belong on
TV. Parents and Jewish viewers were especially irked because Monday
was Rosh Hashana and kids were off from school.
</P>
<P>
   As of 1 p.m., Colee said Channel 12 received close to 70 calls
from angry viewers. Woolman said Channel 5 got a similar number of
calls. But I bet many of those same people who complained about the
testimony, were probably watching it.
</P>
<P>
   People mostly wanted to know if their favorite daytime soaps
were going to be pre-empted and why the stations were airing
Clinton's testimony in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were saying, `Take this stupid stuff off TV,' '' Colee
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wanted to escape into fantasy with their soaps,'' said
one Channel 5 staffer.
</P>
<P>
   Soaps?
</P>
<P>
   Who needs soaps when you have a clearly embarrassed president
talking about a steamy affair with a young, misguided intern?
</P>
<P>
   But that's one real-life TV soap I _ and the rest of the country
_ don't ever want to see again.

 &HT;    Next goal for Horns: beat Owls, win state
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With Rice up next and the meat of the Big 12
South schedule looming ahead, the push starts now toward the Texas
Longhorns' primary goal.
</P>
<P>
   Win state.
</P>
<P>
   If that's in terms that the Horns' defense can easily
understand, it's only a coincidence, although it's no surprise,
with the two-deep littered with players only a year or two out of
high school and getting younger every week.
</P>
<P>
   At his weekly press conference Monday, Coach Mack Brown praised
two freshmen _ end Jermain Anderson and cornerback Ervis Hill _ and
indicated they will compete for starting spots this week in
practice. Brown also said backup tight end Mike Jones, a redshirt
freshman who has not caught a pass this season, will start working
at defensive end as the Horns continue to search for answers at
their most problematic spot in the front seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play people according to how they do in practice,'' Brown
said. ``Whoever produces more will play more. We'll make changes,
if we need to make them, on Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   The part-time move of Jones, who will continue to play offense
in short-yardage and two-tight end sets, was the only change Brown
spelled out Monday, but he hinted at others.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, he said the Horns may work in some of the younger
players to improve performance. Clearly he's speaking of the
offensive line, where sophomore Leonard Davis played much of the
second half at both tackles, freshman Mike Williams came in on the
last series at tackle and Antwan Kirk-Hughes would have seen more
action had he not been weakened by a throat problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't give Ricky Williams a chance,'' Brown said of the
lack of running room for the Horns' Heisman Trophy candidate.
According to UT statistics, Williams gained 69 yards after contact
_ 26 of those just getting back to the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, undersized at 6-foot-3-inches, 218 pounds, sacked
Kansas State quarterback Michael Bishop once, had two tackles for
loss and picked off a shovel pass that was inexplicably ruled an
incompletion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made plays that guys who've been out there a lot longer did
not make,'' said Brown, who indicated that Anderson's lack of size
is one of the reasons he hasn't cracked the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he liked the position Hill had on Wildcats receiver
Darnell McDonald's touchdown catches, and lauded the diminutive
freshman for blocking a point-after attempt late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hill will battle sophomore Joe Walker, who was frequently
victimized in the KSU game before being taken out and targeted for
confidence rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think Joe's trying too hard,'' Brown said. ``I really
think he's pressing. We took him out to let him relax. Joe's a good
football player and we need to get him back out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones follows in the footsteps of J.J. Kelly, who was the backup
tight end last year before being moved in the spring to defensive
end, where he's starting on the right side.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 6-5, 250 and can run,'' Brown said. ``Derek Lewis is
playing so well at tight end, (Jones) isn't getting any snaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the Horns will deal with Jones' move by using
redshirt freshman Chad Irwin as Lewis' backup or utilizing more
three-wide receiver sets.

 &HT;    Johnson: No mirrors this time
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ This is different.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the fool's gold that glittered after fast starts in
Jimmy Johnson's first two years as the Miami Dolphins' head coach.
</P>
<P>
   This stuff _ a shiny 3-0 mined from a muddy 21-0 victory against
the Pittsburgh Steelers _ is real.
</P>
<P>
   That was Johnson's analysis after having a day to examine the
three-game gem he now holds in his hands _ and will continue to
hold for two weeks until the Dolphins resume play against the New
York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the high assessment?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing things that win games offensively,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bother re-reading that sentence. Yes, he said offensively.
Never mind that the Dolphins are 3-0 primarily because they have
given up an NFL-best average of 7.3 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Johnson feels that this start won't fade like it did
in his first two years _ in 1996, 3-0 turned into 8-8; in 1997, 2-0
turned into 9-7 _ is because of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy and optimistic and on and on,'' Johnson said of
his first two years. ``But I've said all along, I never have been
comfortable with our approach offensively. . . . I thought there
were going to be games when we were going to have interceptions. I
thought there were going to be games when we were going to have bad
weather. And I thought there were going to be games when we were
not on target with the passing game.''
</P>
<P>
   This season the offense has hardly been productive. In fact, the
defense has scored two of Miami's seven touchdowns _ interception
returns by cornerback Terrell Buckley and linebacker Zach Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it has done what Johnson wanted most. It has avoided
mistakes. It has run time off the clock with a lead.
</P>
<P>
   Take Dan Marino's numbers. Most of the attention has been on how
Marino has thrown for only 407 yards _ the lowest three-game total
of his 16-year career.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins point out that for the first time in Marino's
career, he has not thrown an interception in the first three games
of a season. And Johnson has referred repeatedly to Marino's
quarterback rating, which now is nearly 26 points higher than after
three games last season (87.0-61.3).
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, I think we're on schedule,'' Johnson said.
``We're nowhere close to where we're going to be in the next few
weeks. But we are doing some critical things in that we are
protecting the passer, we are protecting the football and we are
running the football.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins have averaged 121 yards rushing. And, perhaps more
importantly, they have been able to run in the fourth quarter. Of
35 offensive plays in three fourth quarters, only seven were
passes.
</P>
<P>
   Against Pittsburgh, the Dolphins walked onto the field after
half time, looked at the scoreboard (14-0) and the sky (rain) and
went on to pass only three times in the final two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions and the score dictated that,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what would have happened if the conditions and score
dictated that last year, Johnson said, ``We wouldn't have made any
first downs.''
</P>
<P>
   That, Johnson said, is the beauty of a game built on the run: It
has a better shot at surviving late-season games in snow and nasty
weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can run the ball; I don't care what kind of weather it
is,'' he said. ``That wind can blow as hard as it wants to blow.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson added several times that the offense has a long way to
go. His point, though, was that he doesn't believe the offense is
this weak link that will drag down this season. To the contrary, he
believes it will help win games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's going to get better,'' he said. ``There are going
be some games we're going to have a tough time running the ball and
we're going to throw for a lot of yards. I know that.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, he can savor that his team is 3-0 _ and that he
doesn't have that nagging feeling that it's only a matter of time
before people start uncovering blemishes in the gem.

 &HT;    Johnson: More media, more pressure
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ Jimmy Johnson plopped down in a chair for his
day-after meeting with the newspaper reporters who cover the Miami
Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ready for the weekly grilling,'' he said with a laugh.
``What've we got?''
</P>
<P>
   Before taking any questions, the unusually relaxed Johnson
(being 3-0 heading into a bye week will do that) steered the
conversation toward the pressure of being an NFL head coach in 1998
and how, because of increased media coverage, it is different than
when he took charge of the Dallas Cowboys in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media is so competitive now, there is so much
visibility,'' he said. ``Even though we understand that's what pays
our salary and that's what creates interest and that's why the
stadiums are full, there is so much abuse on every decision, on
every head coach in this league. There is pressure on 30 guys.
Doesn't make any difference if you're 3-0 or 0-3.''
</P>
<P>
   After rattling off some of the changes that have made the
coverage even more intense _ from the growth of talk radio to
nightly NFL segments on ESPN to the Internet _ Johnson made an
admission.
</P>
<P>
   He said that coaches do indeed pay attention to what is being
said and written about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a coach pays attention to the media _ which most of us do,
and the ones who say they don't are lying _ it's going to create
some pressure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, of course, spent two years on the other side of the
camera, working for Fox as a studio analyst before taking the
Dolphins job.
</P>
<P>
   Has that helped him deal with the pressure?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' he said. ``But everybody likes to be patted on the
back. Everybody likes to have people saying they've done wonderful
things. Nobody likes to be criticized when it's incorrect. That's
the one that really gets to you.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused and laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, even if they're right, sometimes you don't like to be
criticized there, either,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This season, despite the 3-0 start, Johnson has had to deal with
plenty of second-guessing. About the new offense. About the
decision to use the first-round pick to draft a running back. About
the way he has pushed injured players to be on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We accept it,'' Johnson said of the pressure. ``We know if we
didn't have this we wouldn't be paid the money we're paid. We
wouldn't have the ratings on TV we have. . . . But when you look at
the role of the head coach, it's a lot different than it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Another quarterback in the mix: The Dolphins plan to work out a
quarterback today for the practice squad. Although Johnson wouldn't
disclose who the player is, he did give the reason for the
potential addition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may need another arm the next couple weeks,'' he said.
``We'd like to rest some of the arms we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Erickson, who was expected to be the Dolphins' backup
quarterback this season, has been bothered by pain in his right
elbow since early in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Game ball for the boss: Johnson gave Dolphins owner Wayne
Huizenga a game ball after the victory against the Steelers ``just
because of the support he's given us.'' He also gave a belated game
ball to linebacker Zach Thomas. Thomas wasn't among those handed a
ball in the locker room after the game, but by Monday Johnson had
decided he deserved one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He completely dominated the third quarter and the start of the
fourth quarter,'' he said. ``He made play after play. He had one of
the better games he's had here. I think Zach is playing better
right now than he's ever played as a pro.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who received game balls: The entire defensive coaching
staff; offensive linemen Mark Dixon and Richmond Webb; cornerback
Sam Madison, receiver O.J. McDuffie; and Nate Jacquet and Bernie
Parmalee for special teams.

 &HT;    Law professors give Clinton ``B'' on testimony
 &HT;    By John Keilman and Steve Bennish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the halls of academe, President Clinton's performance before
the Kenneth Starr grand jury rated less than an A but better than
an F.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he came off that bad,'' said Susan Brenner, a
University of Dayton law professor and author of the legal text,
``Federal Grand Jury.'' Overall, she said, the president's civil
tone will probably impress much of the public, but it's likely his
lawyerly jousting over definitions of what constitutes sex will
continue to be a turn-off.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in law and communications were analyzing the president's
responses to questions about his sex life, and even his body
language as he fenced with prosecutors. Like much of the public,
they came away with a mixed review of the president's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Funso Oluyitan, a communications professor at Wilberforce
University, had one of his classes watch part of the testimony
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   His view: The tape's strongest contribution to the mountain of
evidence before Congress is to reveal Clinton's palpable
embarrassment. Oluyitan noticed the president blushing on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great sympathy for him,'' the professor said. ``It is
very serious to see a man of such power ... quizzed in front of a
jury like that.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton's evasive manner roused Oluyitan's suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some questions (to which) he probably knows the
answers, but he cannot give them,'' he said. ``On many occasions, I
noticed how he went into this lapse of memory.''
</P>
<P>
   After a classroom discussion, though, Oluyitan said the tape
didn't seem to change many students' minds. Those who thought
Clinton should remain in office kept their opinions.
</P>
<P>
   While many have called the Monica Lewinsky scandal a national
embarrassment, Oluyitan, originally from Nigeria, said it actually
offers proof of America's strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire the freedom that allows the system to put the
president on the spot,'' he said. ``This is the kind of thing you
might never find in the developing countries.''
</P>
<P>
   James Sayer, chairman of Wright State University's
Communications Department, watched about two hours of Clinton's
testimony, and pronounced it an entertaining spectacle not to the
president's advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exchanges between the president and the special prosecutor
and others over what constituted sexual relations bordered on the
absurd,'' he said. ``It was funny...No one looks good in that kind
of exchange. And the president looked horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, though, that he does not expect the tape's release to
change public opinion a great deal. Those who already dislike the
president will likely watch a great deal of the testimony, he said,
while those who support him will watch very little.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably one of the best shows ever seen in a premiere
week,'' he said, ``...(but) I hope to hell there's not a sequel.''

 &HT;    Media calls nation to unwilling jury duty
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The media are taking a lashing from a large part of the American
public for its long-running and uncomfortably detailed coverage of
the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. But newspapers, TV networks and cable
news stations have no choice but to call the nation to an unwilling
jury duty, according to media ethicists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's entirely appropriate that Congress and the media be
putting this information out there, because in any event, the
public will be the ultimate judge in this case,'' said Richard
Noyes, political studies director for the Center for Media and
Public Affairs, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media watchdog based in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Noyes said he believes most of the media have acted responsibly
in their coverage, even though the lurid details and sheer volume
of the coverage have unleashed a media backlash. About 40 percent
of readers and viewers feel there has been excessive coverage, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cindi Hughes, a freelance writer in Austin, Texas, is one of
them. She recently dispatched e-mails to friends and relatives all
over the country, urging them to cancel their newspaper
subscriptions and boycott TV for the duration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just gone too far,'' she said by phone Monday. ``It's
almost like the media have become this propaganda machine for
people who want to see Clinton go.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN reported receiving hundreds of calls Monday about its
broadcast of the president's grand jury testimony ``with reactions
all across the map,'' CNN spokesman Steve Hayworth said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said CNN polls show that many viewers are conflicted
about the coverage. Although nearly half the public said it would
watch the grand jury testimony, only 37 percent said that Congress
should release it.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Daily News received a handful of angry calls and
letters after it printed a special section last week with excerpts
from the Starr report, editor Jeff Bruce said. The decision to run
the excerpts, which were heavily edited for offensive content, was
a tough one even though it was in the best interest of readers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say it caused me concern as a parent,'' he said. The
graphic nature of the allegations against the president have forced
newspapers ``to address issues today that normally wouldn't find
their way into a family business. It's a tricky business.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Steele, director of ethics for the Poynter Institute for
Media Studies in Florida, said he thinks the media overall have
done a poor job of explaining the rationale of its coverage to
readers and viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we are not very good at is explaining the
how and why of what we do,'' he said. ``We should be much better at
that, not to cover our bets, but to be accountable and open to the
public. If we do that, I think people will disagree with us
respectfully.''

 &HT;    Students' reactions to testimony mixed
 &HT;    By Margo Rutledge Kissell, Bob Batz, Benjamin Kline, Brandon
Peterson and Scott Elliott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   While some Miami Valley TV viewers ignored the airing of
President Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony, others who
were curious about the historic event tuned in from a variety of
places.
</P>
<P>
   On at least one Miami Valley college campus, TV viewers were
riveted to the screen. About two dozen people gathered in the lobby
of Wright State University's Allyn Hall and quietly watched the
four-hour testimony.
</P>
<P>
   WSU student Jason Lansdale, 21, of Kettering,who worked for
Clinton's Ohio campaign in 1992 and 1996 was among those gathered
in Allyn Hall. Lansdale, a senior majoring in political science,
said the president appeared defensive and very nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone would be under that kind of pressure,''
Lansdale said, adding he believes Clinton will survive this
``Republican smear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He always does well at his worse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sears store in the Dayton Mall, a trickle of shoppers
passing through the electronics department stopped just briefly to
watch Clinton before moving along.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Hockwalt, who sells televisions, has seen large crowds
drawn to the TVs like moths to light when the O.J. Simpson verdict
was read and for coverage of Princess Diana's death. But Clinton's
testimony did not attract that same level of interest, Hockwalt
said. In fact, several shoppers remarked they were tired of
watching it.
</P>
<P>
   Hockwalt, who voted for Bob Dole in 1996, said ``from what I
heard on TV, I didn't see he handled himself badly at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Beavercreek resident Amir Guirguis said, after watching the
Clinton testimony on television on Monday, he's holding onto his
convictions about the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a liar,'' Guirguis said. ``The video shows that he is
trying to play with words and if he is a man, he will step down as
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the seven TV sets at Fricker's in Kettering was
tuned to the Clinton testimony at lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a guy watching that set asked us if it was OK to change
the channel, we said 'sure' and when he did, nobody complained,'' a
waitress said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tickets Pub and Eatery in Fairborn, David Bloomfield, 38,
struggled to view the testimony on an elevated television screen
behind the table where he ate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's handling himself the best he can. You can see
he's aggravated and frustrated with it. You can see that very
clearly on his face,'' said Boomfield, a Chillicothe resident who
commutes 160 miles daily to his job at Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomfield called the Independent Counsel's probe ``a waste of
our money'' and an invasion into the president's private life.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas D. Williams, 42, of Bellefontaine, who dined at Damon's
in Fairborn for lunch said Congressional efforts to regulate sexual
content on the Internet were weakened by lawmakers' decision s to
release the Starr report and Clinton's videotaped testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody would open their closet doors, everybody would be
out of job,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Senior citizens at Heartland of Kettering on Wilmington Pike
were unimpressed by the televised Clinton testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Heartland resident Phyllis Blake, 75, said she was upset that
she missed her favorite morning show, Sally Jessy Raphael , but she
left her television set on and watched the videotaped testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded like the same old questions, worded a different
way,'' Blake said. ``I think (Clinton) is all right. I think he has
done a good job for the country. As for this (sex scandal), I think
he's about the same as any other man.''
</P>
<P>
   Resident Lorean Whaley, 80, said she began watching her
television set at 7 a.m. waiting to be shocked by Clinton's
testimony, but she wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded like it was going to be much worse than it was,''
the retired nurse said of the taped testimony. ``I was just glued
to the TV. I wanted to know what they were going to say. But I
think (Ken) Starr is just trying to murder Clinton politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Lois Pendegrass, who classifies herself as a ``die-hard black
Democrat,'' said she thinks Clinton is guilty but didn't think the
video needed to be released.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grown up folks already know what happened. . .he's guilty and
we didn't need a video to show that,'' Pendegrass said. ``This
turned into a political game.''
</P>
<P>
   Angulic Wallace, of Morrow, has heard enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew what he was going to say,'' said Wallace, who was
unloading her groceries at the Kroger in Lebanon. ``I'm tired of
hearing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace and her father, Don, had watched some of the tapes
Monday morning. She believes that if Hillary Clinton can accept the
president's actions, the rest of the country ought to do likewise.
If investigators find Clinton committed perjury, then prosecute
him. Otherwise, leave him alone, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Noah Robbins, retired pastor of the Bethel AME Church in
Lebanon, said he was surprised officials decided to televise the
videotaped testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, who had not watched the tapes, doesn't believe it was
right to televise the testimony because of the message it sends to
young people.
</P>
<P>
   He also looks for the maelstrom of controversy around the
Clinton-Lewinsky affair to harm Democrats at all levels of
government. Clinton ought to resign rather than risk impeachment,
Robbins said.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins does, however, see a positive side to the conflict. He
thinks Clinton's experience will encourage other people struggling
with temptation in their own lives to seek spiritual guidance
instead of giving in to it.
</P>
<P>
   Internet chat rooms also were hopping with commentary Monday
afternoon asjury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the president's backers said the tape showed prosecutors
were out to embarrass Clinton, while supporters said the tape
showed the president lied about his involvement with Monica
Lewinsky.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Scientists are developing an array of new therapies
for patients who fail frontline prostate cancer treatments such as
surgery, radiation, hormonal blockade and chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   The National Cancer Institute's database identifies nearly 40
clinical trials underway for patients with recurrent prostate
cancer or prostate cancer that has spread beyond the gland.
</P>
<P>
   Each clinical trial has its own unique requirements. Some demand
that the patient have undergone only certain treatments prior to
receiving the experimental drug. Others won't allow men to
participate if they've had standard treatments within a certain
timeframe.
</P>
<P>
   Experimental treatments are not without risks. There is no
guarantee that they will work in humans, even though they have
shown promise in animals. And the treatments may have harmful side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Following are some new prostate cancer treatments under study
along with contact phone numbers. For a more complete listing,
check the Internet web address for the National Cancer Institute's
clinical trials division (http://cancertrials.nih.nci.gov) or
CapCure, Michael Milken's prostate cancer research organization
(http://www.capcure.org).
</P>
<P>
   Before considering a new treatment that has not been FDA
approved, consult your physician.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cancer cell destruction vaccine: Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center in New York is developing a vaccine that will induce
prostate cancer cells to commit the cellular equivalent of suicide.
</P>
<P>
   For information, call 800-525-2225.
</P>
<P>
   _ Immunotherapy: The Pacific Northwest Cancer Foundation in
Seattle is developing a vaccine to jump-start the body's immune
system to attack prostate cancer cells. Researchers take a sampling
of a patient's blood, then isolate and multiply immune system foot
soldiers known as dendritic cells.
</P>
<P>
   These are injected back into the patient where they spark the
production of cancer-killing cells, which then travel throughout
the body hunting down prostate cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   For information, call 1-800-MED-INFO.
</P>
<P>
   _ Starving the cancer: The University of California at San
Francisco is developing an antibody to disrupt blood vessel flow to
prostate cancer cells. The idea is that lacking blood, the
malignancy will slow or stop growing.
</P>
<P>
   For information call 415-885-7331.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gene Therapy: Researchers at George Washington University in
Washington, D.C., have discovered that prostate cells lacking the
uteroglobin protein are likely to have a rapidly advancing cancer.
Still about 18 months away from human trials, scientists are
devising a treatment to inject the protein back into cells in an
effort to slow the spread.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cancer-Killing Virus: Researchers at the University of
California at San Francisco and John Hopkins University in
Baltimore are creating a new kind of genetically altered virus to
seek out and kill prostate cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   For information call UCSF at 415-885-7331 or Johns Hopkins at
410-955-8964.
</P>
<P>
   _ Metastatic treatments: When it spreads and enters the lethal
stages, prostate cancer typically travels to bone where it grows
and kills the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Wisconsin (608-263-7107),
University of Virginia (804-243-6188) and M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center in Houston (800-392-1611) are developing treatments to halt
this deadly migratory pattern.
</P>
<P>
   _ New chemotherapies: Chemotherapy is a last resort because
prostate cancer usually doesn't respond to toxins. But scientists
are making strides combining toxins, hormonal blockade drugs and
other compounds. Compared with traditional chemo, the combination
is better able to target and kill prostate cancer cells while
minimizing damage to healthy cells.
</P>
<P>
   Several institutions are spearheading the new treatments,
including M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (800-392-1611), the
University of Michigan (800-865-1125) and Memorial Sloan Kettering
(800-525-2225).
</P>
<P>
   _ Alternative remedies: PC Spes, a mixture of chemical compounds
extracted from several Chinese herbs, is one of the most
talked-about alternative treatments for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment, which is designed to cause prostate cancer cells
to self-destruct, is receiving serious attention at the University
of California at San Francisco, which is scheduled to begin a
clinical trial on it.
</P>
<P>
   For more information call the treatment's Brea, Calif.-based
distributor, Botanic Lab, at 800-242-5555.

 &HT;    Joyner's track shoes sit still
 &HT;    By Dave Lance
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the height of her popularity, former track star Florence
Griffith Joyner commanded the attention of everyone in her
presence.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask LaVonna Martin-Floreal, 31, a 1984 Trotwood-Madison
graduate. Martin-Floreal, who won the silver medal in the 100-meter
hurdles in the 1992 Olympics, remembered everyone marvelling at
Griffth Joyner as she entered a welcoming party for Olympians in
Japan, shortly before the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was wearing a Kimono (Japanese dress),'' said
Martin-Floreal, a 1988 Olympian. ``As soon as she walked in the
door, everybody stopped. They were just captivated by her.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin-Floreal was reminiscing about Griffith Joyner after
finding out she had died of an apparent heart seizure September 21
in Mission Viejo, Calif., at the age of 38. Griffith Joyner won
three gold medals in the '88 Olympics - in the 400-meter relay, 100
meters and 200 meters. She holds the world records in the 100 and
200.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two decades, Martin-Floreal and her parents Lefty
and Brenda Martin had formed a casual friendship with Griffith
Joyner after first meeting her at the 1984 Olympic Trials in
Indianapolis. All of them agreed her athletic ability was matched
by her graciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very sad for me,'' Brenda Martin said. ``She was a
very nice person and easy to talk to. She sent me a shirt in 1990
that said, ``To Mrs. Martin, love, Florence Griffith Joyner.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thankful and grateful that she took the time to think
about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lefty Martin, the University of Dayton track coach, said
Griffith Joyner leaves a legacy that will be hard to match.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that she won three gold medals, is a Hall of Famer
and is the fastest woman in history, her legacy is she leaves
everyone trying to better what she did,'' he said. ``She set the
standard for women in sprints.''
</P>
<P>
   As a sprinter at UCLA in the early '80s, she wasn't quite the
runner she would become in the late '80s. But it wasn't through
lack of effort, said Morehouse athletic director Josh Culbreath.
</P>
<P>
   Culbreath - Central State University's track coach from 88-96 -
remembers watching Griffith Joyner workout at UCLA and in Santa
Monica. He also saw her at functions for the Jesse Owens
Foundation, for which Culbreath is a board member.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched her when she was an average runner and she trained
so hard and I watched her grow,'' Culbreath said. ``She was such a
dedicated individual, it's such a great loss.''

THE MILITARY IS BUILDING A REPUTATION IN PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Tuesday, Sept. 29)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ The U.S. military is developing a one-of-a-kind
tool in the war on prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Department of Defense's Center for Prostate
Disease Research are building the nation's most complete computer
database of prostate cancer tissue and blood samples culled from a
wide variety of men.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, nobody in the private sector has really been able to
put together a nationwide, multi-center database with a
standardized system to collect tissues,'' said Dr. Judd Moul, a
urologist and director of the center.
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1994, the database will be filled with donated samples
of tissue and blood collected from men at 10 Army, Air Force and
Navy hospitals in San Antonio, San Diego and Dayton, Ohio, and
other cities.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers hope to collect samples from more than 30,000
men over the next five years. Currently, information on 7,000
patients, mainly military retirees with an average age of 66 years,
has been entered in the database.
</P>
<P>
   Tissue samples from cancerous prostates are shipped to
Washington, D.C., where they are catalogued by scientists at the
Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. The samples then are sent
here, about 20 minutes away, for genetic study.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers plan to track the patients for 20 years, assess the
survival benefits of various prostate cancer treatments _ surgery,
radiation, hormonal blockade or others _ and record such side
effects as impotence or urinary incontinence. The military assures
confidentiality for the men.
</P>
<P>
   Its size, broad representation of minority men and its national
focus likely will make the database the leading American collection
of information on prostate cancer when completed.
</P>
<P>
   This database may help researchers get to the bottom of a vexing
problem: Why do black men have a much greater chance of getting and
dying from the disease? It will enable researchers to compare the
size and grade of tumors in the prostate glands of black and white
men.
</P>
<P>
   With an annual budget of about $1 million, the center also is
developing a comprehensive prostate cancer care clinic 20 minutes
away at Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington, D.C., that will
serve as a model throughout the military health-care system. The
facility will be completed by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a prototype, and we would like to emulate it at San
Antonio for the middle of the country, and one at San Diego for the
West Coast,'' Moul said.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone eligible for military health care can go to the centers
for a second opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The center's 30 researchers, working at a laboratory at the
Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences in suburban
Washington, believe they have located a new gene linked to prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very prostate-specific gene. This is something that
is very new,'' said Dr. Shiv Srivastava, a molecular biologist and
the military center's lead researcher.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists are focusing on other areas of research. For
example, they are trying to understand at the genetic level the
deadly metamorphosis of the disease once it escapes the prostate
gland _ from a cancer dependent for growth on male sex hormones to
a cancer that will grow and kill its host even when a man's hormone
production is stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The center, which was created by Congress and opened its doors
five years ago to manage cooperative research efforts in the
military, is drawing praise from civilian doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are perpetually working,'' said Dr. Sheldon Marks, a
urologist in Tucson, Ariz., and author of the book ``Prostate &AMP;
Cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where a lot of the new research is going to come
from,'' Marks said.

   CNN-MITCHELL _ ATLANTA _ Pat Mitchell's itinerary calls for her
to spend six whole days at home this month. The president of CNN
Productions is always on the go, from the Sundance Festival to
Castro's office. She's capping a bizarrely eclectic career as a
college teacher, talk show host, ``Today'' substitute for Jane
Pauley, and documentary filmmaker. We catch up with her as her

   TVREVIEW-SPORTS _ When it debuts: Tuesday, 9:30 p.m., ABC. What

and waited for CNN's highlights. (Thompson, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

STARR REPORT VIOLATES `HARMFUL TO MINORS' LEGISLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the

Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

   On Sept. 17, Republican members of the U.S. House began fiddling
around with another version of the unconstitutional Communications
Decency Act _ call it ``Son of CDA.'' The bill (HR 3783) would make
it illegal to post material that is ``harmful to minors'' on the
Internet. The legislators didn't seem to notice their
inconsistency: Only days before, these same House GOP members voted
to put Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr's graphic sex report on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A person who violates ``Son of CDA'' can be fined $50,000 and
spend six months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Any Web site that carries advertising or charges for access is
subject to this law. Most online newspapers carry advertising, as
do a vast number of other Web pages. Many of the Web sites that
posted the Starr report carry advertising. A few specialized sites
charge for access.
</P>
<P>
   According to HR 3783, ``The term `material that is harmful to
minors' means any communication, picture, image, graphic image
file, article, recording, writing, or other matter of any kind that
(ii) depicts, describes, or represents, in a patently offensive way
with respect to what is suitable for minors, an actual or simulated
sexual act or sexual contact, actual or simulated normal or
perverted sexual acts, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals ...''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's sex report certainly fits that definition. If ``Son of
CDA'' were already the law, members of the U.S. House who voted for
posting the report on the Internet could be brought up on charges
of trafficking in material that is harmful to minors.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the House reflect America's hypocritical notions
about sex _ my sexual behavior is right and good, yours is
perverse.
</P>
<P>
   According to the bill, it depends upon who is putting the
material on the World Wide Web and for what reason. HR 3783
contains an exception: The material isn't considered harmful if _
it has political value for minors.
</P>
<P>
   So if 10-year-old Jane clicks on the Starr report, obviously its
political value far outweighs its sleazy obsession with sex.
</P>
<P>
   Would an ordinary citizen be immune to prosecution if he were to
post snapshots and descriptions of Rep. Helen Chenoweth, R-Idaho,
in her former adulterous relationship? Or details of the affair
involving Republican Rep. Dan Burton of Indiana? Or motel photos of
Illinois Republican Rep. Henry Hyde and his ``friend'' during their
four-year liaison? Would the political value outweigh the sleaze?
</P>
<P>
   Barry Steinhardt, president of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, is quoted in a Sept. 17 email release stating that the
Starr report ``has been blocked by most filtering programs and that
several Internet service providers have ordered their users to take
down mirror sites of the report.'' Steinhardt argues that although
the Starr report is important, the fact that it is being blocked by
filtering software programs indicates that it ``would not pass the
legislation's `harmful to minors' test.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Starr report with its lascivious details should
doom any sweeping legislation aimed at prohibiting sexual speech on
the Internet. Congress can't have it both ways. If Congress is
allowed to post patently offensive sexual materials, so is the
ordinary citizen.
</P>
<P>
   HR 3783 would criminalize speech that is protected by the First
Amendment. It has the same problem that the Communications Decency
Act did. Most Web sites are accessible to anyone on the Internet
without a charge and without age verification necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The technology for verifying the age of someone who wants to
access a Web site is extraordinarily expensive. If the Internet
were limited to only those sites which could afford verifying
technology, most of the best sites on the World Wide Web would
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   In Reno vs. ACLU, a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court struck CDA down
as unconstitutional because it prohibited the protected speech of
adults.
</P>
<P>
   The court said that the government cannot require speakers on
the Internet to distinguish between adults and minors.
</P>
<P>
   HR 3783 will fail for the same reasons that CDA did.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress passes this law, it will cost civil liberties
organizations more than $1 million to challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, and the bill's 58 other co-sponsors
should have to repay these legal costs out of their own pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that would drive the Supreme Court's decision home: The
government cannot limit adult speech to that of a child's _ anymore
than Starr could have written his report on Clinton at a child's
level of language and understanding.

MCDOWELL PLAYS THE DARK SIDE OF FANTASY ISLAND  
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's Hollywood Stars
feature.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448, or

 World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 With color slide and black and white photo of Malcolm McDowell in
``Fantasy Island.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``It's a very interesting part _ rather dark with great
emotional variety. I get to do it every week. I get paid for it and
we're shooting it in Hawaii. What the hell else is there to talk
about, really?''
 &HT;    What indeed?
 &HT;    Malcolm McDowell, the young English rebel of such classic films
as ``A Clockwork Orange'' (1971), ``If'' (1968), ``O Lucky Man''
(1973) and ``Britannia Hospital'' (1982) is 55 now. Silver haired,
slim, just right to step into the white shoes of ``Fantasy
Island'''s Mr. Roarke. The show debuts on ABC Sept. 26.
 &HT;    Remember Roarke (Ricardo Montalban) in the l978-l984 series
welcoming guests to his tropical island with his sidekick Tattoo
(Herve Villechaize)?
 &HT;    Well they're reviving the concept but with a few differences,
starting with Roarke. When McDowell's Roarke is getting dressed,
riffling through a wardrobe full of white suits, he selects the
only black one. This is not the smiling, charming, benevolent
Montalban version anymore.
 &HT;    ``He's much darker and edgier,'' grins McDowell, ``not
saccharine, not pontificating.''
 &HT;    McDowell says his first reaction to stepping onto the new island
was one of horror and he had to be persuaded to look at a script.
``I took the part because it was dark. I liked the producer's sort
of 'Men in Black' approach to it.''
 &HT;    Travelers to this ``Fantasy Island'' will first pass through a
mysterious travel agency run by a couple of veteran actors _
``Picket Fences''' Fyvush Finkel and movie great Sylvia Sydney.
Then on to the island where their fantasies will be fulfilled
though they may not always like it.
 &HT;    The old Roarke made sure his guests had a pleasant time.
McDowell's Roarke believes firmly in the old saying: ``Be careful
what you wish for _ you may get it.''
 &HT;    He's attended by a strange concierge and a bellhop played by
Louis Lombardi (``Natural Born Killers'') and ``Frasier'''s Edward
Hibbert, both of whom keep dropping clues that they are on the
island to pay for their sins. Their female colleague Ariel played
by ``Twin Peak'''s Madchen Amick can morph into any female form to
fulfill any fantasy.
 &HT;    Is the island really the afterlife, as some think?
 &HT;    ``We're all dead, yeah,'' laughs McDowell collapsing in an easy
chair in a bungalow suite at in the Pasadena Ritz. ``But they make
the afterlife seem quite palatable, with these gorgeous babes
coming out of the water waving at the camera.''
 &HT;    But do Roarke and his crew inhabit heaven or hell? ``When I show
it to friends in Europe,'' says McDowell, ``they see Roarke as God.
When I show it to Americans they think he's the Devil. What do you
think that says about the two cultures?''
 &HT;    Married to his third wife Kelly, McDowell has two teenage
children from his marriage to Mary Steenburgen, now Mrs. Ted
Danson. He lives in homes in Los Angeles, the Ojai Valley (50 miles
north of L.A.) and in Tuscany.
 &HT;    A slightly sinister air is notably absent in person but has
served him well in his long career. He's made over 70 movies, some
of them among the greatest British movies ever made. And he's been
kept busier than most of the screen's nice guys.
 &HT;    Just by casting him as Roarke the producers are sending a
message about the kind of show this will be. ``Of course this
Roarke is malevolent,'' says McDowell, ``There are no boundaries
and so many layers to him. Somewhere there is a glimmer of
something, but God knows how deep or locked away it is. He is
all-knowing, all-seeing. He is this Machiavellian character.''
 &HT;    The original ``Fantasy Island'' was made cheaply in and around
Los Angeles, but this one is first cabin all the way. The pilot was
shot on three Hawaiian Islands. Not a bad place to go to work every
day.
 &HT;    And if McDowell ever gets to fulfill his own fantasy, the actor
has one all lined up and ready to fly:
 &HT;    ``When I was in my early teens, I lived near a race track in
England. And they had the British Grand Prix. My heroes were
drivers like Stirling Moss and Mike Hawthorne. So my fantasy would
be to be in a 1950s race car in a race with those great champions
and beat them.''

A PROVERB SAVED ... IS A PROVERB REWRITTEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there is one fault with old sayings, it's that they're, well
... old.
</P>
<P>
   While modernization is not always an improvement, one has to
admire the courage of an unidentified first-grade teacher who asked
her students to rewrite the second half of the following well-known
proverbs:
</P>
<P>
   As You Shall Make Your Bed, So Shall You ... Mess It Up
</P>
<P>
   Undeniably true, and a possible explanation as to why
first-graders are so reluctant to make their beds in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Better To Be Safe Than ... To Punch A Fifth Grader
</P>
<P>
   Also undeniably true. Better to hire a sixth-grader to do it for
you.
</P>
<P>
   Strike While The ... Bug Is Close
</P>
<P>
   The heel of a shoe would probably suffice for all except Florida
bugs, which require something heavier, like an anvil.
</P>
<P>
   You Can Lead A Horse To Water But ... How?
</P>
<P>
   Good question. But a better question might be, Why? Given the
temperamental nature of horses, it's probably best to let them find
water on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Don't Bite The Hand That ... Looks Dirty
</P>
<P>
   Nor the foot, knee, elbow or head, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   No News Is ... Impossible
</P>
<P>
   Brother, isn't that the truth. In fact, the problem with the
news nowadays is that the impossible has become commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   You Can't Teach An Old Dog ... New Math
</P>
<P>
   Nor would it be wise to try, in my opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Love All, Trust ... Me
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's epitaph, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   The Pen Is Mightier Than The ... Pigs
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about this one, especially if the pigs have been
elected to high office. Time will tell, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   An Idle Mind Is ... The Best Way To Relax
</P>
<P>
   I can certainly vouch for that, but we'd probably better not let
this get around as we already have too many idle minds as it is.
</P>
<P>
   It's Always Darkest Before ... Daylight Savings Time
</P>
<P>
   The best argument I've heard yet for year-'round Daylight
Savings Time.
</P>
<P>
   A Miss Is As Good As A ... Mr.
</P>
<P>
   Feminism knows no age limits, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   Never Underestimate The Power Of ... Termites
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that this first-grader's dad owns a pest control
company? Either that or the kid has a great future in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   A Penny Saved Is ... Not Much
</P>
<P>
   But save 1,000 pennies and ... well, you still don't have much.
</P>
<P>
   Laugh And The Whole World Laughs With You, Cry And ... You Have
To Blow Your Nose
</P>
<P>
   Which could cause the world to laugh even harder. Either way,
it's a good argument for carrying a handkerchief with you at all
times.
</P>
<P>
   Where There's Smoke, There's ... Pollution
</P>
<P>
   Is the EPA aware of this?
</P>
<P>
   Children Should Be Seen And Not ... Spanked Or Grounded
</P>
<P>
   Or deprived of sugary cereals, electronic video games, Nike
footwear and designer jeans.
</P>
<P>
   You Get Out Of Something What You ... See Pictured On The Box
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes not even that.
</P>
<P>
   If You Lie Down With The Dogs, You'll ... Stink In The Morning
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, probably, but think about the poor dogs.
</P>
<P>
   There Is No Fool Like ... Aunt Eddie
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Uncle Bob's no bright light, either.
</P>
<P>
   When The Blind Leadeth The Blind ... Get Out Of The Way
</P>
<P>
   The most astute commentary on American politics I have read in a
long time.
</P>

   God bless the United States of America, and God bless
television.
</P>
<P>
   At about 10:30 a.m. CST on one of the saddest and strangest
mornings in this country's history, I had a presidential
picture-in-picture thing happening on my TV. Not since O.J.'s white
Bronco chase and the NBA Finals in the summer of 1994 have we seen
such a bizarre juxtaposition.
</P>
<P>
   The main image Monday, courtesy of about a dozen different
channels: Bill Clinton on videotape, perspiring to a nervous sheen
and swigging from a can of Diet Coke, while answering questions
about Monica Lewinsky losing her temper upon learning the president
was alone in the Oval Office with Eleanor Mondale.
</P>
<P>
   The inset image, carried solely on C-SPAN2, the network of the
nerds: Clinton live at the United Nations, talking about the threat
of international terrorism, telling the assembled leaders, ``Each
time an innocent man or woman or child is killed, it makes the
future more hazardous for the rest of us ...''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the videotaped testimony took place very recently _
on Aug. 17 of this year _ Live Billy looked about three years older
than Videotaped Billy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's been a rough month for the president _ and for
the country.
</P>
<P>
   It would be stretching it to say the whole country was watching
Clinton's videotaped testimony Monday, but most of us did have
access to the one-camera spectacle, either through our TVs or via
surreptitious Internet webcasts on our computers at work.
</P>
<P>
   With the camera never swiveling to show us anything other than
the president as he played with his reading glasses, quaffed
copious amounts of soda and water, and used sweeping hand gestures
to make his points, it was almost like watching one of those
websites devoted to chronicling one person's life. Call it
www.prezcam.com or some such thing.
</P>
<P>
   What we saw was alternately riveting and revolting _ that is,
when it wasn't boring beyond belief.
</P>
<P>
   The questions about neckties and dresses and boxes of cherry
chocolates, the graphic discussions about the definition of sexual
contact, the sometimes testy exchanges between Clinton and various
henchmen for Starr _ these discussions were already bizarre and
chilling and ridiculous and unnecessary when we read about them.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the dialogue play out on TV didn't do much to enlighten
or inform _ nor was it even all that titillating, considering that
during various segments of the testimony, all you had to do was
click around the dial and you'd find, among other not-for-children
offerings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Sally Jesse Raphael doing a show called ``Gorgeous Women Who
Love Fat Men,'' featuring overweight gentlemen in bikini briefs
pawing at their relatively tiny significant others.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jenny Jones chipping in with, ``You Think You're So Hot, But a
Model You're Not,'' a show with bosomy, scantily clad, tattooed
women parading around while the audience rated their looks.
</P>
<P>
   _ And the great Jerry Springer weighing in with ``I Confess, I
Cheated!''
</P>
<P>
   You wonder how Tom Brokaw could keep a straight face while
telling viewers much of Clinton's testimony ``will be inappropriate
for younger children. You may want to decide whether or not they
should be in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Or even in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Clinton did look like a character in a ``Saturday
Night Live'' skit as he put on his reading glasses to deliver that
prepared statement about his ``inappropriate behavior'' with Ms.
Lewinsky. Perhaps a few unsupervised children across the country
found him on TV and thought, ``Oh goody, it's Story Hour with the
president!''
</P>
<P>
   Dirty talk notwithstanding, I'm not sure how many adults, let
alone children, stayed with the broadcast for the duration. Like
most courtroom testimony, Clinton's appearance was stultifying for
long stretches, as he rambled on and parsed away, often providing
much more information than was required by a specific question. I
would think millions of viewers gave up at some point, figuring
they could see all the highlights on the inevitable orgy of network
specials and expanded newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   For the record: There were no questions about Whitewater, no
questions about fundraising, no questions about the White House
travel office. It was all sex and gossip, all the time.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day _ as the talking heads like to say _ did
this videotape change anyone's mind about whether Clinton should
resign or be impeached, or if we should move as quickly as possible
to close the door on this sordid and shameful witch-hunt?
</P>
<P>
   I doubt it. My hunch is that those who think Clinton is a lying
criminal who should get on the helicopter to Arkansas pronto will
still believe that, while those of us who believe Kenneth Starr's
investigation of Whitewater has mutated into an insane and ugly
monster will continue to wonder when the madness will end.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NOTE: Full-length article (8,700 words) available on request  
 &HT;     (NOTE: Editors _ This is Part I in a four-part series.)
 &HT;    ........................................................
 &HT;    When Kenneth Starr was chosen to investigate Whitewater in 1994,
the White House counsel, Abner Mikva, assured the Clintons that
this was a fine selection.
 &HT;    Mikva and Starr had known each other for years. During the
1980s, the two men served together on the Federal Appeals Court in
Washington, and though they were on opposite ends of the political
spectrum, the liberal Mikva and the conservative Starr were
friends.
 &HT;    Mikva and Starr socialized at each other's homes, dined out
together with their wives. When Mikva thought of Starr, words such
as ``ethical,'' ``fair,'' ``decent'' came to mind.
 &HT;    If Mikva saw a fault in the younger judge, it was that Starr was
a little too much of an egghead, too pedantic, just not
street-smart. This was brought home to Mikva one day during a near
fistfight at the federal courthouse. Starr, Mikva and Laurence
Silberman were on a three-judge panel and, when they retired to the
conference room, it turned out that Silberman was furious with
Mikva over the case they had just heard.
 &HT;    ``Silberman said to me, 'If you were 10 years younger, I'd punch
you out!' ``Mikva recalls. ``I look over, and there was Ken,
looking at the ceiling, wishing he was not there. He never said a
word. I attributed it to the gentle son of a minister who didn't
like controversy.''
 &HT;    And so, in August 1994, Mikva assured the Clintons: ``Ken and I
had good relations on the court and I'm sure it will continue.''
 &HT;    Twice during 1995, Starr wanted to question both the president
and the first lady in connection with the Arkansas inquiries, and
each time arranged it with Mikva.
 &HT;    ``The milieu could not have been more pleasant or cooperative,''
Mikva says. ``Upstairs in the White House residence, both times on
a Saturday. He arrived discreetly through the back entrance. He
later issued a short statement. There was no commenting or leaking
to the press.''
 &HT;    Mikva walked Starr out after one session and thanked him. ``I
said: 'I realize it was not done for this president. I appreciate
your concern for the presidency.' He said: 'I would not have it any
other way. The Republicans will elect a president again and I want
the presidency to be there.'''
 &HT;    Starr was considered too bland in those days to have political
enemies, and if he did, they would probably have been conservative
Republicans. In 1981, as an aide to Attorney General William French
Smith, Starr shepherded Sandra Day O'Connor's Supreme Court
nomination through the Senate and was attacked by conservatives for
having covered up O'Connor's pro-choice views.
 &HT;    After President Bush appointed him solicitor general in 1989,
Starr showed his independence on his first controversial case,
defying the president by siding with a group of whistle-blowers
against defense contractors.
 &HT;    Even after Starr took a million-dollar-a-year corporate law job
at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis in 1993, he was viewed by the Washington
establishment as the perfect man for handling delicate public
matters. When the congressional committee investigating
sexual-harassment charges against Sen. Bob Packwood needed someone
to review the most intimate secrets in Packwood's diaries, Starr
was hired.
 &HT;    His law partners watched him rushing about, installing a lock on
his door, setting aside a special table as the only place the
diaries could be reviewed and declaring that only the office
administrator could carry the diaries in and out of a special
vault.
 &HT;    In October 1995, Mikva left the White House, still on good terms
with Starr. But what happened a few months later radically changed
Mikva's feelings and embarrassed him in front of the Clintons, who
were by then referring to the independent counsel as ``your friend
Ken Starr.''
 &HT;    ``I was shocked when Mrs. Clinton was called before the grand
jury and he made her go to the courthouse,'' Mikva says. ``He could
have taken her testimony under oath at the White House. He knew
there was no back stairway at that courthouse, that she'd have to
walk right in front of the barrage of cameras. Ken knew that
courthouse better than anyone.
 &HT;    ``When he and I were on the bench there in the 1980s, there was
a U.S. attorney, Jay Stephens, who constantly used the press _ he'd
call press conferences in front of the courthouse to announce an
indictment and then haul in the defendant in front of the cameras.
Ken and I used to stand together at an upstairs window looking
down. We agreed that using the press as a prosecutorial tool was
not something an ethical prosecutor did.
 &HT;    ``The Judge Starr I knew was cautious, deliberate, careful, not
zealous and reckless. The Ken Starr I see now is not the Ken Starr
I knew.''
 &HT;    Is it true? Is there really a new Ken Starr? Rusty Hardin thinks
so too, although he draws a very different conclusion. Hardin, a
lawyer in the independent counsel's office at the start of the
Whitewater investigation, says that Starr needed to learn to think
like a prosecutor. He had never been one, had never even been a
trial lawyer, had spent his career in the high-altitude world of
appellate law.
 &HT;    ``Appellate lawyers don't stand up before the Court of Appeals
and call each other (expletive) _ they don't question each other's
motives,'' Hardin says. ``Prosecutors live with that.''
 &HT;    The reserved Starr drove his assistant prosecutors mad,
endlessly weighing and deliberating every matter. ``Starr was more
concerned with what people thought of him,'' Hardin says. ``But the
more the White House stonewalled, the more he hunkered down.''
 &HT;    Over time, his assistants began to glimpse a new fire in
Prosecutor Starr. Frustrated by Gov. Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas's
legal challenges to the independent counsel's jurisdiction, Starr
argued the appeal himself. The moment that decision came down from
the Eighth Circuit, Eric Jaso, an assistant in Little Rock,
informed Starr that they had won on every point.
 &HT;    ``Ken let out a yell,'' Jaso recalls. ``He yelled, 'Total and
complete victory!' I wrote it on my screen saver _ 'Total and
Complete Victory!' Ken said, 'This is fantastic!' He was excited,
breathless with exhilaration.''
 &HT;    What drives Starr onward? Who is this minister's son in such
relentless pursuit that he forced the president to admit his sins
on national television?
 &HT;    Very soon, this man the public knows so little about will
command the nation's undivided attention. After spending more than
four years and an estimated $40 million investigating Whitewater,
Filegate, Travelgate, Vincent Foster's death and the Lewinsky
matter, Starr is expected to deliver his final report to Congress
in the coming weeks.
 &HT;    For the first time, the public will get Starr's full view of the
president's wrongdoing; the report will also tell us a good deal
about its author and about the quality and scope of the
investigation. Then we will all have to decide: Should the matter
have been dropped long ago? Did Starr lose all sense of proportion?
Or does he make the case for a criminal cover-up worthy of
impeachment?
 &HT;    For his part, Starr is not talking, and has never talked much
publicly about himself. He has granted few on-the-record interviews
in the last four years to reporters writing profiles of him and has
refused repeated requests over a four-month period to be
interviewed for this article.
 &HT;    The only on-the-record interview he has done on any subject
recently _ conducted in April by Steven Brill for his media
magazine, Brill's Content _ landed Starr in trouble with a federal
judge over leaking information to the press about the
investigation. And so, morning after morning, TV crews camp out in
front of his McLean, Va., home at dawn, shooting fresh video of the
man walking to his car with his Starbucks coffee, trying to prod
him into a sound bite.
 &HT;    Nor was Starr willing to permit an interview with his wife,
Alice, although she made the single-most-telling comment about what
their lives are like these days, during an hourlong profile of
Starr shown by the A&AMP;E network in June. ``Sometimes,'' Alice Starr
said, ``it seems like a nightmare that won't ever go away, and I
always think to myself, `It can't get worse than this.' And it
does. Every day it seems to get worse and worse.''
 &HT;    Of course, it didn't have to go on this long. A different
independent counsel might have ended things a lot sooner. In 1987,
James McKay, a Democrat, began investigating Attorney General Edwin
Meese III, a Republican. After a year, McKay concluded that Meese
had broken the law by accepting favors from a defense contractor
and could be convicted by a jury.
 &HT;    Meese's behavior was so troubling that two of his top aides at
the Justice Department, William Weld and Arnold Burns, fellow
Republicans, resigned in protest. But that independent counsel
decided against taking the case to trial; McKay thought the scope
of Meese's wrongdoing was not worth the political trauma that would
be caused by putting the nation's top law-enforcement officer on
trial.
 &HT;    McKay says he feels the same way about the Lewinsky matter, that
Starr has gone ``so far afield'': ``We could have gone off on
things with Meese, but I said no. It makes your blood run cold, the
idea of looking into a case about sexual affairs.''

 &HT;    ........................................................
 &HT;    When Kenneth Starr was chosen to investigate Whitewater in 1994,
the White House counsel, Abner Mikva, assured the Clintons that
this was a fine selection.
 &HT;    Mikva and Starr had known each other for years. During the
1980s, the two men served together on the Federal Appeals Court in
Washington, and though they were on opposite ends of the political
spectrum, the liberal Mikva and the conservative Starr were
friends.
 &HT;    Mikva and Starr socialized at each other's homes, dined out
together with their wives. When Mikva thought of Starr, words such
as ``ethical,'' ``fair,'' ``decent'' came to mind.
 &HT;    If Mikva saw a fault in the younger judge, it was that Starr was
a little too much of an egghead, too pedantic, just not
street-smart. This was brought home to Mikva one day during a near
fistfight at the federal courthouse. Starr, Mikva and Laurence
Silberman were on a three-judge panel and, when they retired to the
conference room, it turned out that Silberman was furious with
Mikva over the case they had just heard.
 &HT;    ``Silberman said to me, 'If you were 10 years younger, I'd punch
you out!' ``Mikva recalls. ``I look over, and there was Ken,
looking at the ceiling, wishing he was not there. He never said a
word. I attributed it to the gentle son of a minister who didn't
like controversy.''
 &HT;    And so, in August 1994, Mikva assured the Clintons: ``Ken and I
had good relations on the court and I'm sure it will continue.''
 &HT;    Twice during 1995, Starr wanted to question both the president
and the first lady in connection with the Arkansas inquiries, and
each time arranged it with Mikva.
 &HT;    ``The milieu could not have been more pleasant or cooperative,''
Mikva says. ``Upstairs in the White House residence, both times on
a Saturday. He arrived discreetly through the back entrance. He
later issued a short statement. There was no commenting or leaking
to the press.''
 &HT;    Mikva walked Starr out after one session and thanked him. ``I
said: 'I realize it was not done for this president. I appreciate
your concern for the presidency.' He said: 'I would not have it any
other way. The Republicans will elect a president again and I want
the presidency to be there.'''
 &HT;    Starr was considered too bland in those days to have political
enemies, and if he did, they would probably have been conservative
Republicans. In 1981, as an aide to Attorney General William French
Smith, Starr shepherded Sandra Day O'Connor's Supreme Court
nomination through the Senate and was attacked by conservatives for
having covered up O'Connor's pro-choice views.
 &HT;    After President Bush appointed him solicitor general in 1989,
Starr showed his independence on his first controversial case,
defying the president by siding with a group of whistle-blowers
against defense contractors.
 &HT;    Even after Starr took a million-dollar-a-year corporate law job
at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis in 1993, he was viewed by the Washington
establishment as the perfect man for handling delicate public
matters. When the congressional committee investigating
sexual-harassment charges against Sen. Bob Packwood needed someone
to review the most intimate secrets in Packwood's diaries, Starr
was hired.
 &HT;    His law partners watched him rushing about, installing a lock on
his door, setting aside a special table as the only place the
diaries could be reviewed and declaring that only the office
administrator could carry the diaries in and out of a special
vault.
 &HT;    In October 1995, Mikva left the White House, still on good terms
with Starr. But what happened a few months later radically changed
Mikva's feelings and embarrassed him in front of the Clintons, who
were by then referring to the independent counsel as ``your friend
Ken Starr.''
 &HT;    ``I was shocked when Mrs. Clinton was called before the grand
jury and he made her go to the courthouse,'' Mikva says. ``He could
have taken her testimony under oath at the White House. He knew
there was no back stairway at that courthouse, that she'd have to
walk right in front of the barrage of cameras. Ken knew that
courthouse better than anyone.
 &HT;    ``When he and I were on the bench there in the 1980s, there was
a U.S. attorney, Jay Stephens, who constantly used the press _ he'd
call press conferences in front of the courthouse to announce an
indictment and then haul in the defendant in front of the cameras.
Ken and I used to stand together at an upstairs window looking
down. We agreed that using the press as a prosecutorial tool was
not something an ethical prosecutor did.
 &HT;    ``The Judge Starr I knew was cautious, deliberate, careful, not
zealous and reckless. The Ken Starr I see now is not the Ken Starr
I knew.''
 &HT;    Is it true? Is there really a new Ken Starr? Rusty Hardin thinks
so too, although he draws a very different conclusion. Hardin, a
lawyer in the independent counsel's office at the start of the
Whitewater investigation, says that Starr needed to learn to think
like a prosecutor. He had never been one, had never even been a
trial lawyer, had spent his career in the high-altitude world of
appellate law.
 &HT;    ``Appellate lawyers don't stand up before the Court of Appeals
and call each other (expletive) _ they don't question each other's
motives,'' Hardin says. ``Prosecutors live with that.''
 &HT;    The reserved Starr drove his assistant prosecutors mad,
endlessly weighing and deliberating every matter. ``Starr was more
concerned with what people thought of him,'' Hardin says. ``But the
more the White House stonewalled, the more he hunkered down.''
 &HT;    Over time, his assistants began to glimpse a new fire in
Prosecutor Starr. Frustrated by Gov. Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas's
legal challenges to the independent counsel's jurisdiction, Starr
argued the appeal himself. The moment that decision came down from
the Eighth Circuit, Eric Jaso, an assistant in Little Rock,
informed Starr that they had won on every point.
 &HT;    ``Ken let out a yell,'' Jaso recalls. ``He yelled, 'Total and
complete victory!' I wrote it on my screen saver _ 'Total and
Complete Victory!' Ken said, 'This is fantastic!' He was excited,
breathless with exhilaration.''
 &HT;    What drives Starr onward? Who is this minister's son in such
relentless pursuit that he forced the president to admit his sins

 &HT;     (NOTE: Editors _ This is Part II in a four-part series.)
 &HT;    .......................................................
 &HT;    Kenneth Winston Starr was born July 21, 1946, in Vernon, Texas,
the youngest of three children. His father, Willie Douglas Starr, a
fundamentalist minister and a barber, put in long, hard hours to
support the family. From the beginning, religion was central to the
boy's life.
 &HT;    ``He's gone to church ever since he was 2 weeks old and never
known any different,'' says his mother, Vannie, who is 91. ``We
just started him from babyhood to know right from wrong.''
 &HT;    When Kenneth was in fifth grade, the Starrs moved to a white
frame house shaded by ash and pecan trees in a working-class
section of San Antonio, where Vannie Starr still lives.
 &HT;    Starr's friends from his teen-age days remember him as bright,
bookish, religious, a little nerdy, totally unathletic but popular,
mature and focused beyond his years. Sam Millsap, who went to
junior high with Starr, lived nearby and, like Starr, was raised in
the Church of Christ. There was no drinking, smoking, dancing, no
musical instruments in church, but a lot of Bible verse.
 &HT;    ``If it was fun, you couldn't do it,'' Millsap says. ``We were
told _ Sunday morning, Sunday night, Wednesday night _ almost
everything fun was wrong and we were going to hell because we were
sinners.'' Millsap, who went on to become the district attorney of
San Antonio, says, ``When I got older I switched to the Methodist
Church so I'd have a shot at heaven.'' Starr attends an evangelical
Bible church.
 &HT;    ``In retrospect,'' Millsap says, ``as I piece together Starr,
the thing at the core of everything is his church faith. Ken was
always independent and sure of himself, his ability and his beliefs
of what's right and what's wrong. He was following his own light _
he didn't give a hoot about the group. When we were in church as
kids, we knew we were out of step with the mainstream, because we
believed what others didn't and we understood we could be subject
to persecution _ it was part of the yoke that made us special.''
 &HT;    The other thing that school friends such as Gary O. Smith
remember was Starr's passion for politics. At Sam Houston High,
besides being a member of the drama club and the yearbook and
newspaper staffs, Starr was president of the junior and senior
classes. As a ninth grader in 1960, he passed out campaign
literature for Richard Nixon; as a senior, for Barry Goldwater.
After graduating, he spent two years at Harding College, a Church
of Christ school in Arkansas, selling Bibles door to door to help
pay his tuition.
 &HT;    But if there is one thing that has struck people who have known
Starr well, both in Texas and Washington, it is his ability to
grow. He wanted an Eastern education. He wanted to see how he
stacked up against different people. He wanted to see how far he
could go.
 &HT;    For his junior year, he transferred to George Washington
University. He did stick out a little there; while classmates were
protesting the Vietnam War in tie-dyed shirts, Starr wore a tie to
lectures. But like most of his classmates, he did not go to
Vietnam, classified 4-F thanks to a case of psoriasis.
 &HT;    The summer he graduated, he met Alice Mendell, a Jewish girl
from Mamaroneck, N.Y., and Skidmore College. They were wed by a
Church of Christ minister and have been married 28 years. It was
Alice, friends say, who taught the minister's son to dance.
 &HT;    After getting a law degree at Duke, Starr was selected in the
mid-1970s for a clerkship with Chief Justice Warren Burger. It was
the first of many times he would advance his career by ably serving
an older, conservative Republican.
 &HT;    In 1982, when Starr was Attorney General William French Smith's
chief of staff, a profile in American Lawyer magazine described the
35-year-old Starr as the perfect assistant, ``deferential without
being obsequious, intelligent without being intimidating ...
anything but one of those arrogant aides who strut the corridors of
Washington.''
 &HT;    Indeed, Jacob Stein, one of Monica Lewinsky's lawyers, noticed
some of those same traits during his negotiations with Starr over
which sexual acts his client might testify to. ``Ken Starr has the
manners of a Southern gentleman,'' says the 73-year-old Stein,
``beautiful manners.''
 &HT;    He is also a workaholic of mythic proportions, even by
Washington standards. ``Ken's smart, but he's not a genius,'' says
Tex Lezar, a former colleague in the Reagan Justice Department.
``He's not this person with a 195 IQ. He got where he is by working
very, very hard.''
 &HT;    Henry Habicht, another Reagan-era colleague, remembers that at
the Justice Department in the early '80s he would be in Starr's
office at 8:30 p.m. discussing an issue as Starr changed into a
tuxedo for a black-tie event. ``He'd come back to the office after
the affair,'' Habicht says, ``pick up work to take home, then be in
at 7 the next day.''
 &HT;    Often Starr had to learn as he went. He became an Appeals Court
judge in 1983, though he had never been a lower court judge; the
solicitor general _ the government's lawyer to the Supreme Court _
in 1989, though he had never argued before the Supreme Court; the
independent counsel in 1994, though he had never been a prosecutor.
 &HT;    An interviewer once asked Alice Starr what she and her husband
did for fun and she said that on Sundays they took car rides in the
country: She drove while he read.
 &HT;    He has put in the same endless hours juggling the independent
counsel's job with private practice. Starr was so busy flying
around the country for those two jobs, plus making speeches and
teaching a course at New York University, that when John Bates, a
deputy prosecutor from 1995 to 1997, wanted to discuss the Clinton
investigation, he sometimes had to ride with Starr in a taxi to the
airport.
 &HT;    Most profiles have portrayed Starr as a career man who still
manages to coach his daughter's softball team and teach Sunday
school, although friends say it has been years since he has been
able to do those things. ``He's a good father for a workaholic,''
one friend says.
 &HT;    It is Alice who is ``so brilliant about organizing their lives
so he has family time,'' Bates says. At an ABA breakfast appearance
in August, as Starr shook every hand in sight, Alice slipped off,
filled a plate with food, quietly set it on the table in front of
his chair, then went back to get him juice. She is also an
executive in a real-estate firm.
 &HT;    While McLean is an upscale suburb, the Starrs live in the same
four-bedroom brick-and-frame house they bought 21 years ago when he
was a young lawyer, a comfortable home but not lavish. They are
known as gracious hosts.
 &HT;    In his most recent financial-disclosure statement, filed for
1996, Starr lists a salary of $1.14 million and assets of $3.8
million to $7.9 million. (Federal forms are vague, requiring that
assets be listed as a range, and it is possible that his worth is
higher, since one trust is in the top category of ``over $1
million.'')
 &HT;    His three children are used to having his work life mixed into
their family time. When Eric Jaso applied for a job as a prosecutor
in Starr's office three years ago, Starr suggested that they meet
for an interview in Princeton, where Jaso was working on a case.
 &HT;    ``I'm waiting in a hotel lobby,'' Jaso remembers, ``and all of a
sudden this man rushes up and says: 'Eric? Ken Starr. Sorry I'm
late, but we're in the middle of a tour of the campus. Come join
us.' And we go out front and there's this wood-paneled minivan and
inside are his two daughters, his son'' _ the prospective freshman
_ ``his wife, plus two Princeton undergrads conducting the tour,
and he says, 'Hop in,' and I sit in the back near his littlest
daughter.''
 &HT;    Jaso took the walking tour of the Princeton campus with the
entire Starr family. ``He and I hung back so he could interview
me,'' Jaso says. ''And then all of us went to lunch.''
 &HT;    Two years ago, Starr's wife gave him a 50th birthday party, and
one of the speakers roasting him was their son, Randall, the oldest
child, who recalled how his father tortured them on family trips by
playing tapes of famous historical speeches.
 &HT;    Habicht remembers Starr testing Carolyn, the middle child, when
she was 5 or 6 to see if she could name the presidents in order.
Today, Randall is an undergraduate at Duke and Carolyn is beginning
her freshman year at Stanford, a year behind Chelsea Clinton.
 &HT;    Even as a young man, Starr ``carried himself very much in a
judicial manner,'' says Bob McConnell, another lawyer in the Reagan
Justice Department. ``I kidded him. He was always trying to be
thoughtful, deliberate.''
 &HT;    All along, friends say, it was perfectly clear Starr didn't want
to be just a Supreme Court justice; he wanted to be chief justice.
 &HT;    In January 1989, President Bush asked Starr to be solicitor
general. It was an honor _ and, for someone whose goal was to be on
the Supreme Court, a political minefield. For days, he spent long
stretches in his office, door closed, on the phone to friends. ``He
was very conflicted,'' Lezar recalls.
 &HT;    Starr had watched Reagan's first solicitor general, Rex Lee,
attacked from the right for not being aggressive enough in
challenging Roe vs. Wade and from the left for being too
aggressive.
 &HT;    ``Ken recognized if he took it, there was a good chance he'd
never get back to the appellate bench, never make it to the Supreme
Court because he'd make too many political enemies,'' Lezar says.
``But he understood that reaching the Supreme Court is kind of like
lightning striking, it's out of your control.''
 &HT;    Starr was trapped. If he said no, he risked alienating the very
president who would select the next justice. But in taking the job,
Lezar says, Starr still hoped the call would come someday. ``I
don't think he ever completely gave it up. It's like a senator who
wants to be president. At some point, time passes you by and you
know intellectually that it won't happen, but in your heart you
don't give up.''
 &HT;    A good solicitor general strikes a delicate balance, primarily
arguing the agenda of the president who nominated him but, when the
law demands, saying no to the president. Starr's predecessor as
solicitor general, Charles Fried, is widely regarded as having been
too much a political lackey of the Reagan administration; Starr is
credited with restoring a proper balance.
 &HT;    On his first tough case, a request from the White House to write
an amicus brief for military contractors in a dispute with
whistle-blowers, Starr sided with the whistle-blowers and against
Bush.
 &HT;    ``He held endless meetings with all the parties involved,'' says
Thomas Merrill, one of Starr's former deputies. ``Starr sat there
like a judge, hearing everyone out, very courtly _ if anything,
excessively judicious. I kept wishing he'd throw everyone out of
his office and decide. He took so long making up his mind to do the
right thing _ but he did.''
 &HT;    Starr argued several cases involving moral issues _ including a
Bush administration challenge to Roe vs. Wade _ but, his deputies
say, he did not discuss his religious or moral views. Prosecutors
in the independent counsel's office say the same. Although he sings
hymns on his morning jog and keeps a calendar with daily Scripture
verses at his private residence, he did not bring his religion into
the workplace, they say.
 &HT;    The main criticism of Starr as solicitor general was also
expressed later at the independent counsel's office: He was
involved in too many outside activities, spread too thin,
constantly touring the country, advancing his name in legal
circles.
 &HT;    Merrill says that Starr could be gone a couple of days a week,
``off delivering some ridiculous speech to a bar association in
Tucson.'' He would send back legal briefs for his deputies, full of
little yellow stickers they called Ken-grams.
 &HT;    ``I questioned these road shows,'' Merrill says. ``He'd make
some dry legal speech and then go around the room meeting and
greeting as many lawyers as he could. I don't know why he bothered
_ maybe he felt like he was building a base for the Supreme
Court.'' Starr's assistants could tell that possibility was never

 &HT;    .......................................................
 &HT;    Kenneth Winston Starr was born July 21, 1946, in Vernon, Texas,
the youngest of three children. His father, Willie Douglas Starr, a
fundamentalist minister and a barber, put in long, hard hours to
support the family. From the beginning, religion was central to the
boy's life.
 &HT;    ``He's gone to church ever since he was 2 weeks old and never
known any different,'' says his mother, Vannie, who is 91. ``We
just started him from babyhood to know right from wrong.''
 &HT;    When Kenneth was in fifth grade, the Starrs moved to a white
frame house shaded by ash and pecan trees in a working-class
section of San Antonio, where Vannie Starr still lives.
 &HT;    Starr's friends from his teen-age days remember him as bright,
bookish, religious, a little nerdy, totally unathletic but popular,
mature and focused beyond his years. Sam Millsap, who went to
junior high with Starr, lived nearby and, like Starr, was raised in
the Church of Christ. There was no drinking, smoking, dancing, no
musical instruments in church, but a lot of Bible verse.
 &HT;    ``If it was fun, you couldn't do it,'' Millsap says. ``We were
told _ Sunday morning, Sunday night, Wednesday night _ almost
everything fun was wrong and we were going to hell because we were
sinners.'' Millsap, who went on to become the district attorney of
San Antonio, says, ``When I got older I switched to the Methodist
Church so I'd have a shot at heaven.'' Starr attends an evangelical
Bible church.
 &HT;    ``In retrospect,'' Millsap says, ``as I piece together Starr,
the thing at the core of everything is his church faith. Ken was
always independent and sure of himself, his ability and his beliefs
of what's right and what's wrong. He was following his own light _
he didn't give a hoot about the group. When we were in church as
kids, we knew we were out of step with the mainstream, because we
believed what others didn't and we understood we could be subject
to persecution _ it was part of the yoke that made us special.''
 &HT;    The other thing that school friends such as Gary O. Smith
remember was Starr's passion for politics. At Sam Houston High,
besides being a member of the drama club and the yearbook and
newspaper staffs, Starr was president of the junior and senior
classes. As a ninth grader in 1960, he passed out campaign
literature for Richard Nixon; as a senior, for Barry Goldwater.
After graduating, he spent two years at Harding College, a Church
of Christ school in Arkansas, selling Bibles door to door to help
pay his tuition.
 &HT;    But if there is one thing that has struck people who have known
Starr well, both in Texas and Washington, it is his ability to
grow. He wanted an Eastern education. He wanted to see how he
stacked up against different people. He wanted to see how far he
could go.
 &HT;    For his junior year, he transferred to George Washington
University. He did stick out a little there; while classmates were
protesting the Vietnam War in tie-dyed shirts, Starr wore a tie to
lectures. But like most of his classmates, he did not go to
Vietnam, classified 4-F thanks to a case of psoriasis.
 &HT;    The summer he graduated, he met Alice Mendell, a Jewish girl
from Mamaroneck, N.Y., and Skidmore College. They were wed by a
Church of Christ minister and have been married 28 years. It was
Alice, friends say, who taught the minister's son to dance.
 &HT;    After getting a law degree at Duke, Starr was selected in the
mid-1970s for a clerkship with Chief Justice Warren Burger. It was
the first of many times he would advance his career by ably serving
an older, conservative Republican.
 &HT;    In 1982, when Starr was Attorney General William French Smith's
chief of staff, a profile in American Lawyer magazine described the
35-year-old Starr as the perfect assistant, ``deferential without
being obsequious, intelligent without being intimidating ...
anything but one of those arrogant aides who strut the corridors of
Washington.''
 &HT;    Indeed, Jacob Stein, one of Monica Lewinsky's lawyers, noticed
some of those same traits during his negotiations with Starr over
which sexual acts his client might testify to. ``Ken Starr has the
manners of a Southern gentleman,'' says the 73-year-old Stein,
``beautiful manners.''
 &HT;    He is also a workaholic of mythic proportions, even by
Washington standards. ``Ken's smart, but he's not a genius,'' says
Tex Lezar, a former colleague in the Reagan Justice Department.
``He's not this person with a 195 IQ. He got where he is by working
very, very hard.''
 &HT;    Henry Habicht, another Reagan-era colleague, remembers that at
the Justice Department in the early '80s he would be in Starr's
office at 8:30 p.m. discussing an issue as Starr changed into a
tuxedo for a black-tie event. ``He'd come back to the office after
the affair,'' Habicht says, ``pick up work to take home, then be in
at 7 the next day.''
 &HT;    Often Starr had to learn as he went. He became an Appeals Court
judge in 1983, though he had never been a lower court judge; the
solicitor general _ the government's lawyer to the Supreme Court _
in 1989, though he had never argued before the Supreme Court; the
independent counsel in 1994, though he had never been a prosecutor.
 &HT;    An interviewer once asked Alice Starr what she and her husband
did for fun and she said that on Sundays they took car rides in the
country: She drove while he read.
 &HT;    He has put in the same endless hours juggling the independent
counsel's job with private practice. Starr was so busy flying
around the country for those two jobs, plus making speeches and
teaching a course at New York University, that when John Bates, a
deputy prosecutor from 1995 to 1997, wanted to discuss the Clinton
investigation, he sometimes had to ride with Starr in a taxi to the
airport.
 &HT;    Most profiles have portrayed Starr as a career man who still
manages to coach his daughter's softball team and teach Sunday
school, although friends say it has been years since he has been
able to do those things. ``He's a good father for a workaholic,''
one friend says.
 &HT;    It is Alice who is ``so brilliant about organizing their lives
so he has family time,'' Bates says. At an ABA breakfast appearance
in August, as Starr shook every hand in sight, Alice slipped off,
filled a plate with food, quietly set it on the table in front of
his chair, then went back to get him juice. She is also an
executive in a real-estate firm.
 &HT;    While McLean is an upscale suburb, the Starrs live in the same
four-bedroom brick-and-frame house they bought 21 years ago when he
was a young lawyer, a comfortable home but not lavish. They are
known as gracious hosts.
 &HT;    In his most recent financial-disclosure statement, filed for
1996, Starr lists a salary of $1.14 million and assets of $3.8
million to $7.9 million. (Federal forms are vague, requiring that
assets be listed as a range, and it is possible that his worth is
higher, since one trust is in the top category of ``over $1
million.'')
 &HT;    His three children are used to having his work life mixed into
their family time. When Eric Jaso applied for a job as a prosecutor
in Starr's office three years ago, Starr suggested that they meet
for an interview in Princeton, where Jaso was working on a case.
 &HT;    ``I'm waiting in a hotel lobby,'' Jaso remembers, ``and all of a
sudden this man rushes up and says: 'Eric? Ken Starr. Sorry I'm
late, but we're in the middle of a tour of the campus. Come join
us.' And we go out front and there's this wood-paneled minivan and
inside are his two daughters, his son'' _ the prospective freshman
_ ``his wife, plus two Princeton undergrads conducting the tour,
and he says, 'Hop in,' and I sit in the back near his littlest
daughter.''
 &HT;    Jaso took the walking tour of the Princeton campus with the
entire Starr family. ``He and I hung back so he could interview
me,'' Jaso says. ''And then all of us went to lunch.''
 &HT;    Two years ago, Starr's wife gave him a 50th birthday party, and
one of the speakers roasting him was their son, Randall, the oldest
child, who recalled how his father tortured them on family trips by
playing tapes of famous historical speeches.
 &HT;    Habicht remembers Starr testing Carolyn, the middle child, when
she was 5 or 6 to see if she could name the presidents in order.
Today, Randall is an undergraduate at Duke and Carolyn is beginning
her freshman year at Stanford, a year behind Chelsea Clinton.
 &HT;    Even as a young man, Starr ``carried himself very much in a
judicial manner,'' says Bob McConnell, another lawyer in the Reagan
Justice Department. ``I kidded him. He was always trying to be
thoughtful, deliberate.''
 &HT;    All along, friends say, it was perfectly clear Starr didn't want
to be just a Supreme Court justice; he wanted to be chief justice.
 &HT;    In January 1989, President Bush asked Starr to be solicitor
general. It was an honor _ and, for someone whose goal was to be on
the Supreme Court, a political minefield. For days, he spent long
stretches in his office, door closed, on the phone to friends. ``He
was very conflicted,'' Lezar recalls.
 &HT;    Starr had watched Reagan's first solicitor general, Rex Lee,
attacked from the right for not being aggressive enough in
challenging Roe vs. Wade and from the left for being too
aggressive.
 &HT;    ``Ken recognized if he took it, there was a good chance he'd
never get back to the appellate bench, never make it to the Supreme
Court because he'd make too many political enemies,'' Lezar says.
``But he understood that reaching the Supreme Court is kind of like
lightning striking, it's out of your control.''
 &HT;    Starr was trapped. If he said no, he risked alienating the very
president who would select the next justice. But in taking the job,
Lezar says, Starr still hoped the call would come someday. ``I
don't think he ever completely gave it up. It's like a senator who
wants to be president. At some point, time passes you by and you
know intellectually that it won't happen, but in your heart you
don't give up.''
 &HT;    A good solicitor general strikes a delicate balance, primarily
arguing the agenda of the president who nominated him but, when the
law demands, saying no to the president. Starr's predecessor as
solicitor general, Charles Fried, is widely regarded as having been
too much a political lackey of the Reagan administration; Starr is
credited with restoring a proper balance.
 &HT;    On his first tough case, a request from the White House to write
an amicus brief for military contractors in a dispute with
whistle-blowers, Starr sided with the whistle-blowers and against
Bush.
 &HT;    ``He held endless meetings with all the parties involved,'' says
Thomas Merrill, one of Starr's former deputies. ``Starr sat there
like a judge, hearing everyone out, very courtly _ if anything,
excessively judicious. I kept wishing he'd throw everyone out of
his office and decide. He took so long making up his mind to do the
right thing _ but he did.''
 &HT;    Starr argued several cases involving moral issues _ including a
Bush administration challenge to Roe vs. Wade _ but, his deputies
say, he did not discuss his religious or moral views. Prosecutors
in the independent counsel's office say the same. Although he sings
hymns on his morning jog and keeps a calendar with daily Scripture
verses at his private residence, he did not bring his religion into
the workplace, they say.
 &HT;    The main criticism of Starr as solicitor general was also
expressed later at the independent counsel's office: He was
involved in too many outside activities, spread too thin,
constantly touring the country, advancing his name in legal
circles.
 &HT;    Merrill says that Starr could be gone a couple of days a week,
``off delivering some ridiculous speech to a bar association in
Tucson.'' He would send back legal briefs for his deputies, full of
little yellow stickers they called Ken-grams.
 &HT;    ``I questioned these road shows,'' Merrill says. ``He'd make
some dry legal speech and then go around the room meeting and
greeting as many lawyers as he could. I don't know why he bothered
_ maybe he felt like he was building a base for the Supreme
Court.'' Starr's assistants could tell that possibility was never
too far out of his mind. If they were working a controversial case,
he'd joke, ``This will do me in for the Supreme Court for sure.''
 &HT;    In July 1990, Justice William Brennan announced his retirement.
Press reports said that Starr was on the short list of nominees.
But by then, as he feared, he had alienated too many
constituencies. The Bush White House was upset about the
whistle-blower case. Senate liberals felt he had been too
aggressive arguing a challenge to Roe vs. Wade.
 &HT;    Robert Shapiro, a deputy solicitor general, was with Starr in
his office when they heard the news. ``The announcement that it was
Souter came on TV over CNN,'' Shapiro says. ``I looked at his face
for signs of disappointment. We all knew how he felt. There was
nothing. Nothing. Not a single indication of any emotion. Not
one.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NOTE: Full-length article (8,700 words) available on request  
 &HT;     (NOTE: Editors: this is Part III in a four-part series.) 
 &HT;    .......................................................
 &HT;    Everyone has a theory on Kenneth Starr. After the Monica
Lewinsky story broke, Hillary Clinton called Starr ``a politically
motivated prosecutor who is allied with the right-wing opponents of
my husband.''
 &HT;    Harold Ickes, the former deputy White House chief of staff, says
he sees Starr as a dangerous moralist who views the Clintons ``like
Sodom and Gomorrah and is hellbent on running them out of
Washington.''
 &HT;    Who is Starr that he sees his mission so differently from
earlier independent prosecutors?
 &HT;    In hopes of any insight, I followed him to Toronto in early
August for the speech he delivers every year at the American Bar
Association convention reviewing recent Supreme Court decisions.
 &HT;    He spoke on ``the new textualism.'' Reporters' pens barely
moved. Still, hungry people will take what crumbs they can, and
afterward a dean of a major law school told me that it was a
blatantly political speech, an effort to butter up the Supreme
Court, particularly the Democrat-appointed justices, so they would
be happy to see Starr the next time he argued before them.
 &HT;    ``Did you see all the nice things he said about Breyer and
Ginsburg?'' the dean asked.
 &HT;    Had I missed it? Was Starr sending coded messages to Supreme
Court justices via C-Span 2? Who knew? In time, I learned that
tracking Starr was like following Chauncey Gardiner around in
``Being There'' _ you could read into him almost whatever you
wanted.
 &HT;    I pored over Starr's past speeches but found they offered little
insight into the human being behind the ideas. At Duke University's
1995 commencement, he talked about ``accountability''; at a 1996
meeting of the Economics Club of Detroit, he spoke of ``civic
virtue.'' (He was in favor of both.)
 &HT;    In May at a Charlotte, N.C., bar association meeting, he urged
lawyers to take ``the moral high ground of Atticus Finch,'' the
brave country lawyer in ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' Harper Lee's
novel, ``who strove to find the truth while defending a black man
wrongly accused.''
 &HT;    In terms of content, the speech was one of Starr's best,
discussing the balance a lawyer must maintain between defending a
client and serving the truth.
 &HT;    But in tone, it was a disaster and widely ridiculed. Starr, the
million-dollar corporate lawyer who represents tobacco companies,
was urging his fellow lawyers to be more like Atticus Finch? Didn't
he know what this would sound like? How much perspective on Ken
Starr did Ken Starr have?
 &HT;    Mostly what Starr talks about these days in his rare public
moments is his search for truth. In the Atticus Finch speech, he
used the word ``truth'' 25 times. In his TV sound bites, he comes
across as some Old World prophet, but instead of wandering the
desert he is rushing in and out of courthouses, hurrying up and
down his driveway.
 &HT;    ``Our job is to get at the truth, and the truth will speak for
itself,'' he says. Or, ``My commitment is to the people and to the
pursuit of the truth.'' Or, in his most famous variation, analyzed
and reanalyzed for its religious overtones: ``There's no room for
white lies. There's no room for shading. You cannot defile the
temple of justice.''
 &HT;    He has also compared himself to Sgt. Joe Friday. (ital.) Just
the facts, ma'am. (end ital.) Frequently, his spokesman, Charles
Bakaly III, warns reporters, ``We're the only ones who have all the
facts.''
 &HT;    But in Washington, other perceptions of Starr also persist. If
you say ``tin ear,'' people instantly understand that you're
talking ``Ken Starr'' and his lapses of political common sense.
This tin ear is partly a matter of being more book smart than
streetwise. In 1989, after his confirmation hearing to be solicitor
general in the Bush administration, Starr called Bob McConnell, a
friend who'd worked with him in the Reagan Justice Department in
the early '80s, to ask how he had come across.
 &HT;    ``I said, 'Everything's going to be fine,''' remembers
McConnell, who was impressed. ``Ken said: 'Really? I watched myself
on CNN and I must tell you, I thought I sounded pedantic.'''
 &HT;    ``Ken, you ARE pedantic,'' McConnell said.
 &HT;    ``I am?''
 &HT;    ``Of course you are,'' McConnell said.
 &HT;    While solicitor general, Starr organized a half-day seminar in
the Justice Department's Great Hall commemorating the 100th
anniversary of William Howard Taft's appointment as solicitor
general. Starr was quite excited, had programs printed, arranged
for several speeches in praise of Taft, contacted Taft family
members.
 &HT;    ``Among the lawyers on the staff, this was a subject of immense
lunchroom talk,'' says Thomas Merrill, one of Starr's former
deputies. To some it seemed a too-obvious sign of his ambition:
Starr paying homage to the former solicitor general who went on to
be president and then chief justice of the Supreme Court. To others
it just seemed goofy: William Howard Taft Day?
 &HT;    In short, Starr has never had a great sense of how he appears to
others. It has been one of the harshest criticisms of him as
independent counsel. Rather than acting as an (ital)independent(end
ital) counsel, he has repeatedly entangled himself with
anti-Clinton forces, making himself appear highly partisan.
 &HT;    One example among many: Starr's public appearance a month before
the 1996 presidential election with Pat Robertson, the
Christian-right leader and vicious Clinton critic, at a celebration
of the 10th anniversary of the founding of Robertson's law school.
 &HT;    Why didn't Starr see his own potential conflicts of interest?
His assistant prosecutors did. Several told me they wish that when
he became independent counsel he had taken a leave from his law
firm and from representing clients such as tobacco companies, which
had a stake in seeing the president weakened politically. But
Starr's aides didn't tell him this. ``He doesn't take criticism of
his motives well,'' one colleague says.
 &HT;    Friends say Starr is so sure he's a fair person, and works such
backbreaking hours to come to the right answers, that he can't
conceive of people questioning his ethics. ``He expects everyone to
apply a legal standard to things,'' says Thomas Yannucci, a senior
partner at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, where Starr began working in 1993.
 &HT;    For Starr, the fact that his speech at Pat Robertson's law
school had nothing to do with the investigation was the crucial
point, not the appearance of his honoring Robertson the
Clinton-hater. (Indeed, Starr's speech, on the future of the
judiciary, was so dull and academic that reporters had trouble
finding a usable quote.)
 &HT;    ``He thinks, `Why should he be deprived of the right to speak at
Pat Robertson's university?''' Yannucci says. ``He sees it like a
First Amendment issue. He thinks, 'I speak at all kinds of places.'
And intellectually what he thinks is correct, but politically it
does not always wash.''
 &HT;    But even Starr's best friends were caught off guard when he took
the independent counsel's job in 1994 and are not sure why he
wanted it. In 1981, as an aide to Attorney General William French
Smith, Starr had been united with his young colleagues in their
disdain for the independent counsel's law. Starr helped prepare a
legal brief arguing that it was unconstitutional, placing too much
unchecked power in one person.
 &HT;    ``When I heard Ken had taken the job,'' McConnell says, ``I sent
him a note: 'I guess if someone has to do an unconstitutional deed,
it has to be you.'''
 &HT;    Starr's other friends from the Reagan Justice Department had
different theories on why he accepted. Theodore Olson, who is now a
prominent Washington lawyer, saw it as a personality thing: ``Ken
has a hard time saying no to people.'' Henry Habicht thought
religion was a factor: ``Reading between the lines, I think Ken
believed that since God had put him in all these lofty posts, he
had a duty to use his experience when a public-service challenge
arose.''
 &HT;    Still others saw Starr's choice as a career decision by a man
who had lost some of his taste for corporate law. Some say he
wanted to be back in the public spotlight. Anyone who has seen
Starr work a room would swear he's running for something.
 &HT;    At the ABA convention in Toronto, he attended a prayer breakfast
in addition to delivering his speech, and at each event he roved
the banquet hall, shaking hundreds of hands, hugging women, signing
autographs, posing for photos.
 &HT;    ``He's really eating this up, isn't he?'' one ABA staff member
said. After Elizabeth Dole's speech at the prayer breakfast,
several people came up to Starr and said, ``God bless you _ keep up
the good work.''
 &HT;    There is probably some truth in a variety of motivations _ that
Starr had no love for Clinton, felt a civic and religious duty, was
bored in his law job, wanted more attention, had trouble saying no.
Yet no single explanation seems sufficient. If he was part of a
vast right-wing conspiracy devoted to nailing the president, why
did he try to leave the independent counsel's job in 1997 to be a
dean at Pepperdine University?
 &HT;    Rusty Hardin, a prosecutor in the independent counsel's office
at the start of the Whitewater investigation, says that in 1994,
Starr did not have a clue what he was taking on.
 &HT;    ``He thought he could parachute in, do it in a year or two, not
consume his whole life and get out. He misjudged. He'd never been
in the national spotlight. He still thought like an appellate
lawyer _ that cases would be decided on their merits.''

 &HT;    .......................................................
 &HT;    Everyone has a theory on Kenneth Starr. After the Monica
Lewinsky story broke, Hillary Clinton called Starr ``a politically
motivated prosecutor who is allied with the right-wing opponents of
my husband.''
 &HT;    Harold Ickes, the former deputy White House chief of staff, says
he sees Starr as a dangerous moralist who views the Clintons ``like
Sodom and Gomorrah and is hellbent on running them out of
Washington.''
 &HT;    Who is Starr that he sees his mission so differently from
earlier independent prosecutors?
 &HT;    In hopes of any insight, I followed him to Toronto in early
August for the speech he delivers every year at the American Bar
Association convention reviewing recent Supreme Court decisions.
 &HT;    He spoke on ``the new textualism.'' Reporters' pens barely
moved. Still, hungry people will take what crumbs they can, and
afterward a dean of a major law school told me that it was a
blatantly political speech, an effort to butter up the Supreme
Court, particularly the Democrat-appointed justices, so they would
be happy to see Starr the next time he argued before them.
 &HT;    ``Did you see all the nice things he said about Breyer and
Ginsburg?'' the dean asked.
 &HT;    Had I missed it? Was Starr sending coded messages to Supreme
Court justices via C-Span 2? Who knew? In time, I learned that
tracking Starr was like following Chauncey Gardiner around in
``Being There'' _ you could read into him almost whatever you
wanted.
 &HT;    I pored over Starr's past speeches but found they offered little
insight into the human being behind the ideas. At Duke University's
1995 commencement, he talked about ``accountability''; at a 1996
meeting of the Economics Club of Detroit, he spoke of ``civic
virtue.'' (He was in favor of both.)
 &HT;    In May at a Charlotte, N.C., bar association meeting, he urged
lawyers to take ``the moral high ground of Atticus Finch,'' the
brave country lawyer in ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' Harper Lee's
novel, ``who strove to find the truth while defending a black man
wrongly accused.''
 &HT;    In terms of content, the speech was one of Starr's best,
discussing the balance a lawyer must maintain between defending a
client and serving the truth.
 &HT;    But in tone, it was a disaster and widely ridiculed. Starr, the
million-dollar corporate lawyer who represents tobacco companies,
was urging his fellow lawyers to be more like Atticus Finch? Didn't
he know what this would sound like? How much perspective on Ken
Starr did Ken Starr have?
 &HT;    Mostly what Starr talks about these days in his rare public
moments is his search for truth. In the Atticus Finch speech, he
used the word ``truth'' 25 times. In his TV sound bites, he comes
across as some Old World prophet, but instead of wandering the
desert he is rushing in and out of courthouses, hurrying up and
down his driveway.
 &HT;    ``Our job is to get at the truth, and the truth will speak for
itself,'' he says. Or, ``My commitment is to the people and to the
pursuit of the truth.'' Or, in his most famous variation, analyzed
and reanalyzed for its religious overtones: ``There's no room for
white lies. There's no room for shading. You cannot defile the
temple of justice.''
 &HT;    He has also compared himself to Sgt. Joe Friday. (ital.) Just
the facts, ma'am. (end ital.) Frequently, his spokesman, Charles
Bakaly III, warns reporters, ``We're the only ones who have all the
facts.''
 &HT;    But in Washington, other perceptions of Starr also persist. If
you say ``tin ear,'' people instantly understand that you're
talking ``Ken Starr'' and his lapses of political common sense.
This tin ear is partly a matter of being more book smart than
streetwise. In 1989, after his confirmation hearing to be solicitor
general in the Bush administration, Starr called Bob McConnell, a
friend who'd worked with him in the Reagan Justice Department in
the early '80s, to ask how he had come across.
 &HT;    ``I said, 'Everything's going to be fine,''' remembers
McConnell, who was impressed. ``Ken said: 'Really? I watched myself
on CNN and I must tell you, I thought I sounded pedantic.'''
 &HT;    ``Ken, you ARE pedantic,'' McConnell said.
 &HT;    ``I am?''
 &HT;    ``Of course you are,'' McConnell said.
 &HT;    While solicitor general, Starr organized a half-day seminar in
the Justice Department's Great Hall commemorating the 100th
anniversary of William Howard Taft's appointment as solicitor
general. Starr was quite excited, had programs printed, arranged
for several speeches in praise of Taft, contacted Taft family
members.
 &HT;    ``Among the lawyers on the staff, this was a subject of immense
lunchroom talk,'' says Thomas Merrill, one of Starr's former
deputies. To some it seemed a too-obvious sign of his ambition:
Starr paying homage to the former solicitor general who went on to
be president and then chief justice of the Supreme Court. To others
it just seemed goofy: William Howard Taft Day?
 &HT;    In short, Starr has never had a great sense of how he appears to
others. It has been one of the harshest criticisms of him as
independent counsel. Rather than acting as an (ital)independent(end
ital) counsel, he has repeatedly entangled himself with
anti-Clinton forces, making himself appear highly partisan.
 &HT;    One example among many: Starr's public appearance a month before
the 1996 presidential election with Pat Robertson, the
Christian-right leader and vicious Clinton critic, at a celebration
of the 10th anniversary of the founding of Robertson's law school.
 &HT;    Why didn't Starr see his own potential conflicts of interest?
His assistant prosecutors did. Several told me they wish that when
he became independent counsel he had taken a leave from his law
firm and from representing clients such as tobacco companies, which
had a stake in seeing the president weakened politically. But
Starr's aides didn't tell him this. ``He doesn't take criticism of
his motives well,'' one colleague says.
 &HT;    Friends say Starr is so sure he's a fair person, and works such
backbreaking hours to come to the right answers, that he can't
conceive of people questioning his ethics. ``He expects everyone to
apply a legal standard to things,'' says Thomas Yannucci, a senior
partner at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, where Starr began working in 1993.
 &HT;    For Starr, the fact that his speech at Pat Robertson's law
school had nothing to do with the investigation was the crucial
point, not the appearance of his honoring Robertson the
Clinton-hater. (Indeed, Starr's speech, on the future of the
judiciary, was so dull and academic that reporters had trouble
finding a usable quote.)
 &HT;    ``He thinks, `Why should he be deprived of the right to speak at
Pat Robertson's university?''' Yannucci says. ``He sees it like a
First Amendment issue. He thinks, 'I speak at all kinds of places.'
And intellectually what he thinks is correct, but politically it
does not always wash.''
 &HT;    But even Starr's best friends were caught off guard when he took
the independent counsel's job in 1994 and are not sure why he
wanted it. In 1981, as an aide to Attorney General William French
Smith, Starr had been united with his young colleagues in their
disdain for the independent counsel's law. Starr helped prepare a
legal brief arguing that it was unconstitutional, placing too much
unchecked power in one person.
 &HT;    ``When I heard Ken had taken the job,'' McConnell says, ``I sent
him a note: 'I guess if someone has to do an unconstitutional deed,
it has to be you.'''
 &HT;    Starr's other friends from the Reagan Justice Department had
different theories on why he accepted. Theodore Olson, who is now a
prominent Washington lawyer, saw it as a personality thing: ``Ken
has a hard time saying no to people.'' Henry Habicht thought
religion was a factor: ``Reading between the lines, I think Ken
believed that since God had put him in all these lofty posts, he
had a duty to use his experience when a public-service challenge
arose.''
 &HT;    Still others saw Starr's choice as a career decision by a man
who had lost some of his taste for corporate law. Some say he
wanted to be back in the public spotlight. Anyone who has seen
Starr work a room would swear he's running for something.
 &HT;    At the ABA convention in Toronto, he attended a prayer breakfast
in addition to delivering his speech, and at each event he roved
the banquet hall, shaking hundreds of hands, hugging women, signing
autographs, posing for photos.
 &HT;    ``He's really eating this up, isn't he?'' one ABA staff member
said. After Elizabeth Dole's speech at the prayer breakfast,
several people came up to Starr and said, ``God bless you _ keep up
the good work.''
 &HT;    There is probably some truth in a variety of motivations _ that
Starr had no love for Clinton, felt a civic and religious duty, was
bored in his law job, wanted more attention, had trouble saying no.
Yet no single explanation seems sufficient. If he was part of a
vast right-wing conspiracy devoted to nailing the president, why
did he try to leave the independent counsel's job in 1997 to be a
dean at Pepperdine University?
 &HT;    Rusty Hardin, a prosecutor in the independent counsel's office
at the start of the Whitewater investigation, says that in 1994,
Starr did not have a clue what he was taking on.
 &HT;    ``He thought he could parachute in, do it in a year or two, not
consume his whole life and get out. He misjudged. He'd never been
in the national spotlight. He still thought like an appellate
lawyer _ that cases would be decided on their merits.''

 &HT;    .............................................
 &HT;    Another prosecutor might have formed a different perspective on
an American president who lied about sex in a dismissed civil suit.
 &HT;    Another prosecutor could have ended the Monica Lewinsky inquiry
long ago.
 &HT;    James McKay, the Democratic independent counsel who in 1987
began investigating Republican Attorney General Meese III _ and
opted to avoid the political trauma of a trial for the nation's top
law-enforcement officer _ says that not prosecuting is one of the
hardest decisions a prosecutor makes.
 &HT;    Even within Starr's own office, there was dissent among seasoned
prosecutors over how hard to pursue the Lewinsky investigation. Two
of Starr's assistants, Michael Emmick and Bruce Udolf, argued for
accepting Lewinsky's first proffer in January, then running a swift
investigation and turning a report over to Congress in 60 days.
 &HT;    In typical Starr fashion, these issues were debated endlessly.
Over time, Starr sided with other assistants _ two of his deputies,
Robert Bittman, whom Starr affectionately calls Bulldog, and Jackie
Bennett, known among fellow prosecutors as the office expert on the
president's sex life long before anyone had heard of Lewinsky.
Ultimately, Starr opted for an investigation that would turn up
every last fact.
 &HT;    He fought up to the Supreme Court to get Clinton's Secret
Service guards to testify, up to the Supreme Court trying to get
hold of the notes of the lawyer for the late Vince Foster. Starr
pushed normal prosecutorial practices to the limit by calling
Lewinsky's mother before the grand jury.
 &HT;    It all reflected a big change in Starr. At some point, the
reserved appellate lawyer decided he would do whatever it took
within the limits of the law to squeeze people for his
investigations. He had come to realize that the White House was
going to do what defense lawyers almost always do during criminal
investigations: delay, stall, buy time.
 &HT;    What was the turning point for Starr? His assistant prosecutors
cannot pinpoint it, and who knows if even Starr can. This much is
clear: By the time Lewinsky appeared on the scene, he was poised
for an all-out assault. As to whether he was overzealous and
irresponsible or was simply ``becoming a prosecutor,'' as Rusty
Hardin, his former colleague at the beginning of the Whitewater
investigation believes _ that will depend on what is in his final
report.
 &HT;    What we do know is that Starr was willing to drive on when so
many other prosecutors would have stopped.
 &HT;    Part of the reason is Starr's legal temperament. All his
professional life, before reaching a decision, he has doggedly
pursued every last fact. His friends say it over and over: ``Ken is
determined that no one will defeat him by outworking him.''
 &HT;    As solicitor general in the Bush administration, the first case
he argued before the Supreme Court was an old-fashioned
civil-rights matter left over from the Carter era that forced the
City of Yonkers to remedy past discrimination by racially balancing
its public housing and schools. That couldn't have been a case
Starr had much political sympathy for, and yet his aides remember
his exhaustive preparation.
 &HT;    When he lost, says Robert Shapiro, a former deputy solicitor
general, ``Ken took it very hard.'' He hates to lose.
 &HT;    Starr also has a scholarly, at times pedantic, love for the law
and is genuinely offended that anyone, let alone the president of
the United States, would denigrate it. In his May ``Atticus Finch''
speech at the Charlotte, N.C., bar association, invoking the
beloved character in ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' Starr warned that
the single biggest problem facing lawyers today is ``loss of
respect for the truth.''
 &HT;    While Starr wants to be liked, he was also raised to have
confidence in his beliefs even if most people don't agree. A detail
such as a 19 percent approval rating in the polls isn't going to
deter Starr.
 &HT;    As for his career, he had little at stake anymore. When he tried
to leave the independent counsel's job in 1997 to be a dean at
Pepperdine University, he changed his mind a few days after the
announcement due to an uproar from the press and his prosecutors;
he couldn't escape. His great dream, the Supreme Court, had long
passed. His next most likely steps _ academia and corporate law _
are assured no matter how this investigation turns out.
 &HT;    Indeed, a senior partner at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, Thomas Yannucci,
who is close to him, says that Starr, despite taking an unpaid
leave of absence from the firm in July, plans to return when this
is all over. In what may be the understatement of the year,
Yannucci says, ``Now that he's taken on his public duty, I don't
think he has the same view of public service.''
 &HT;    Did Starr come to hate the president _ did that drive him too?
The answer is probably yes, although not at first, and not until he
felt that the White House was stonewalling. I asked John Bates, a
deputy prosecutor from 1995 to 1997, whether Starr hates Clinton.
 &HT;    Bates was quiet a long time and then gave an answer so
convoluted that I stopped taking notes. I asked again, Did Starr
hate Clinton? ``I think Ken is very upset at how personal and
political the attacks on him, the office and others in the office
have become,'' he said.
 &HT;    Did moral outrage at Clinton's sexual escapades also fuel
Starr's investigation? Lawyers who have sat with him at meetings
when these details were discussed say they could tell that Starr
was offended.
 &HT;    But when asked for a single example, a single comment or
outburst, they could not provide one. They answered that it was
subtle, in the wrinkle of an eyebrow or a quiet grimace. They had
heard his deputies make lewd remarks, but not Starr; he was too
professional for that.
 &HT;    We do know that Starr was raised to take a hard line against
such behavior. When his mother was asked for this article what she
wanted Americans to think of her son, she answered, ``I want them
to think of a man who believes in doing right and a man who does
not cheat on his wife, like Clinton has on his wife.''
 &HT;    All this said, in the end Starr's motives no longer matter. That
is his victory, his measure of vindication. It no longer matters if
malicious right-wingers consorted with his office to lay a trap for
the president, if prudishness or ambition or even radio waves from
outer space drove Ken Starr. The president has admitted misleading
the American public. He lied. Through Starr's doggedness, his
relentless effort to amass every last fact, he has succeeded in
making his investigation about Bill Clinton, not about Ken Starr.
 &HT;    All Clinton's life, the man from Hope has relied on his brains,
his charm, his boyishness, his uncanny political instincts, his
superhuman energy to squeeze through tight spots. Not this time.
This time Starr built such a wall of facts that Clinton had no
place to go. On Aug. 17, 1998, at 10 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time,
Clinton hit that wall. It was not a pretty sight.
 &HT;    Which is not to say that Starr has scored his total and complete
victory. This may or may not turn out to be about obstructing
justice, but regardless, it is lots and lots about sex, and no one
wins when such private matters are made public.
 &HT;    All who became embroiled in the Lewinsky case _ the White House,
the press and the prosecutors, too _ dirtied themselves. When Starr
needed someone to show the American public that he was acting
fairly, he hired the Watergate hero Sam Dash as his ethics adviser.
Within Starr's office, Dash is referred to as ``our secret
weapon.''
 &HT;    A generation from now, if there is another president who needs
investigating, will the special prosecutor of that era hire Starr
as his secret weapon? Not likely.
 &HT;    Once Starr drops his report at Congress's door, the nation's
attention will be riveted on Clinton. It'll be (ital)just the
facts(end ital). People laughed at Starr when he once compared
himself to Sgt. Joe Friday, but it turns out he was right, he did
have something in common with the ``Dragnet'' cop.
 &HT;    In making the decision on what should be done with Bill Clinton
_ drop the matter? censure? impeachment? _ some in Congress will
choose along partisan lines, a few will look into their own
personal lives, but most will stick their fingers into the wind and
check the public-opinion polls. The citizenry will decide. Starr
has forced Americans to confront every last prurient fact, right
down to the presidential DNA.
 &HT;    There are those who will say that half the marriages in America
end in divorce, that if every spouse who lied about sex had to
confess on TV, the testimony would fill 500 cable channels for 500
years, that this is a matter between the Clintons and that what
Bill Clinton has already publicly admitted to is more than we would
ask of any other human being.
 &HT;    And there are those who will say it is shameful for a president
with Clinton's history to be arrogant enough to carry on a sexual
affair with a 21-year-old right in the White House, lie about it
and then take advantage of his good friends and aides by using them
to clean up his mess and cover his tracks.
 &HT;    Both conclusions are right, of course, and thanks to Starr,
during this era of relative peace and prosperity, some very painful
divisions will fracture the body politic before the matter is put
to rest.

heard his deputies make lewd remarks, but not Starr; he was too
professional for that.
 &HT;    We do know that Starr was raised to take a hard line against
such behavior. When his mother was asked for this article what she
wanted Americans to think of her son, she answered, ``I want them
to think of a man who believes in doing right and a man who does
not cheat on his wife, like Clinton has on his wife.''
 &HT;    All this said, in the end Starr's motives no longer matter. That
is his victory, his measure of vindication. It no longer matters if
malicious right-wingers consorted with his office to lay a trap for
the president, if prudishness or ambition or even radio waves from
outer space drove Ken Starr. The president has admitted misleading
the American public. He lied. Through Starr's doggedness, his
relentless effort to amass every last fact, he has succeeded in
making his investigation about Bill Clinton, not about Ken Starr.
 &HT;    All Clinton's life, the man from Hope has relied on his brains,
his charm, his boyishness, his uncanny political instincts, his
superhuman energy to squeeze through tight spots. Not this time.
This time Starr built such a wall of facts that Clinton had no
place to go. On Aug. 17, 1998, at 10 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time,
Clinton hit that wall. It was not a pretty sight.
 &HT;    Which is not to say that Starr has scored his total and complete
victory. This may or may not turn out to be about obstructing
justice, but regardless, it is lots and lots about sex, and no one
wins when such private matters are made public.
 &HT;    All who became embroiled in the Lewinsky case _ the White House,
the press and the prosecutors, too _ dirtied themselves. When Starr
needed someone to show the American public that he was acting
fairly, he hired the Watergate hero Sam Dash as his ethics adviser.
Within Starr's office, Dash is referred to as ``our secret
weapon.''
 &HT;    A generation from now, if there is another president who needs
investigating, will the special prosecutor of that era hire Starr
as his secret weapon? Not likely.
 &HT;    Once Starr drops his report at Congress's door, the nation's
attention will be riveted on Clinton. It'll be (ital)just the
facts(end ital). People laughed at Starr when he once compared
himself to Sgt. Joe Friday, but it turns out he was right, he did
have something in common with the ``Dragnet'' cop.
 &HT;    In making the decision on what should be done with Bill Clinton
_ drop the matter? censure? impeachment? _ some in Congress will
choose along partisan lines, a few will look into their own
personal lives, but most will stick their fingers into the wind and
check the public-opinion polls. The citizenry will decide. Starr
has forced Americans to confront every last prurient fact, right
down to the presidential DNA.
 &HT;    There are those who will say that half the marriages in America
end in divorce, that if every spouse who lied about sex had to
confess on TV, the testimony would fill 500 cable channels for 500
years, that this is a matter between the Clintons and that what
Bill Clinton has already publicly admitted to is more than we would
ask of any other human being.
 &HT;    And there are those who will say it is shameful for a president
with Clinton's history to be arrogant enough to carry on a sexual
affair with a 21-year-old right in the White House, lie about it
and then take advantage of his good friends and aides by using them
to clean up his mess and cover his tracks.
 &HT;    Both conclusions are right, of course, and thanks to Starr,
during this era of relative peace and prosperity, some very painful
divisions will fracture the body politic before the matter is put
to rest.

 By JAMES TRAUB  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It's 3 p.m., Monday, Aug. 17. President Clinton is in the White
House Map Room, testifying, and Chris Matthews, the flaxen-haired,
pink-faced, know-it-all and occasionally unhinged host of
``Hardball With Chris Matthews,'' is sitting in his office in the
Washington quarters of CNBC, scarfing a basket of Wendy's fried
chicken.
 &HT;    For Matthews, this is the Day of Days _ to be equaled later, of
course, by Sept. 11, the day of the Starr report's release _ and in
his excitement he's spraying bits of biscuit on his tie.
 &HT;    ``Hardball'' is one of a half-dozen shows, mostly on cable, that
for the past seven months have been Monicamonicamonica. There's
``Rivera Live,'' also on CNBC; ``The Big Show'' and ``The News With
Brian Williams'' on MSNBC, and ``Hannity &AMP; Colmes'' and ``The Crier
Report'' on Fox News.
 &HT;    It's a Darwinian world out there, and in this jungle of passion
and diatribe, Chris Matthews is not about to end up as anybody's
lunch.
 &HT;    He calls Bill Clinton a liar about a hundred times a night, and
he mows down the defenders of the president foolish or desperate or
brave enough to appear on the show. There's an almost Rabelaisian
zest about Matthews: He lays about him with such indiscriminate
excitement that he flattens friend and foe alike. ``Hardball'' is
the most fervent of a fervent lot; it's also probably the most
entertaining.
 &HT;    Matthews, 52, is a political junkie of classic lineage. A
streetwise Catholic kid who grew up in Philadelphia, he was trained
by the Jesuit fathers at Holy Cross, served in the Peace Corps
(rather than Vietnam) and worked as a speech writer for Jimmy
Carter and as an aide and quotemeister for House Speaker Tip
O'Neill.
 &HT;    He now writes a newspaper column for The San Francisco Examiner
and has written a book about Capitol Hill (also called
``Hardball'') and a perfectly creditable book about the
relationship between Nixon and the Kennedys. He is a pol, a
moralist and a philosopher.
 &HT;    He has more theories than a Yale English professor; he has a
theory about why he talks fast, a theory about why he yells and, of
course, a theory about our obsessional interest in the president's
sex life. Matthews tends to keep talking until he's interrupted
(and beyond), so his theory is rather involved. It goes, in part,
as follows:
 &HT;    ``The great defining circus of our time was the Cold War, which
was the great gladiatorial spectacle, Us against Them, Us at home
against Us. Every great gladiatorial contest was part of this
wonderful, unbelievably stark, Manichaean struggle. And that went
away. The bad guys are gone. Now you have bread; you have bread
like you've never had it. Bill Clinton thought it was just about
bread, he was convinced it was bread _ give these people their
market, give them their Dow, give them their unemployment rate down
to 4, 3-1/2. Bread! But there's something missing, something we
need to have in our life, something gladiatorial, something
Kulturkampf, the big question, who we are, who's in, who's out,
who's right, who's wrong. Hey, O.J. came along. And Lady Di came
along for working women. That stunned me. That story was a Roman
candle: It only lasted a week and a half or two, but it was really
hot. Why do we have these things? We want to be tested. Think about
the Roman Empire, about the circuses of Nero. Think about a circus
as establishing a society's tests _ who's in, who's out, who's part
of us, who's not part of us, what kind of country do we want to
live in? I haven't figured this out yet, obviously. It's a great
metaphor.''
 &HT;    Or, possibly, it's an appalling metaphor that makes for great
TV. I asked Matthews if maybe the reason most Americans say they
want to hear less, not more, about Monica is that they don't want
their politics to be a circus.
 &HT;    ``Yeah,'' he conceded, with the air of a man accepting a premise
to rebut an inference. ``That's the way some people look at it.''
 &HT;    Several journalists who have appeared on the show told me that
they believe Matthews' assault on the president is dictated
strictly by ratings, not belief.
 &HT;    Matthews angrily denies this. Though he remains at least a
semi-chastened liberal, he also describes himself as something of a
William Bennett conservative who considers nonchalance toward the
president's sexual behavior to be a sign of loose cultural
moorings.
 &HT;    And yet, one of the great oddities of the Lewinsky affair is
that elites in the media and politics _ the very class that people
like Matthews accuse of waging a war against traditional American
values _ have been far more exercised about it than the citizens
whose views they claim to represent.
 &HT;    So if ordinary Americans are not clamoring for more Monica, who
is the ``we'' who need a Kulturkampf? Perhaps it's the media _ that
is, perhaps ``Hardball'' creates Monica, rather than the other way
around. The Cold War didn't need ``Meet the Press'' to grab the
nation's attention; but O.J. needed Geraldo, and Geraldo,
obviously, needed O.J.
 &HT;    The nexus between mega-event and talk show has grown ever
tighter since the hostage crisis created ``Nightline.'' Now it
seems naive to speak of such events as existing independently of
their coverage. The shows live from event to event, circus to
circus.
 &HT;    When Matthews' program was first shown in 1994, on the
short-lived America's Talking channel, it was called ``In-Depth,''
a name that already sounds quaint. In this feverish new world,
Monica was a godsend. No matter what Matthews says about ratings,
it was the scandal that persuaded CNBC to expand ``Hardball'' from
half an hour to an hour in March.
 &HT;    And after Monica? We'll have to have something else _ a new
cliffhanger, a new personal drama inflated to apocalyptic
proportions.
 &HT;    Talk about ``wonderful'' _ on the day of Days, CNBC decided to
air ``Hardball'' live rather than taped, in two segments, before
and after the president's 10 p.m. speech. Waiting to go on before
the speech, Matthews sat in his office, furiously scribbling
questions on blue cards.
 &HT;    A TV set in the corner showed a fixed image of the White House
entrance through which prosecutors were expected to exit _ tedium
laced with tension.
 &HT;    Matthews felt history floating in the atmosphere; he wanted to
be equal to the moment.
 &HT;    ``My goal for tonight,'' he told his staff, ``is three different
levels. We treat the moral, the legal and the political, and we ask
ourselves the right questions, as Roger Mudd did back in '74,''
during Mudd's post-mortem analysis of Richard Nixon's resignation
speech.
 &HT;    At 20 minutes till 8, Matthews took the elevator down to the
studio and seated himself at a crescent-shaped table. His guests
for the first hour included Stuart Taylor, the respected legal
journalist and a harsh critic of the president; Ron Nessen, the
former White House spokesman (for Gerald Ford); Marcia Clark, the
former O.J. prosecutor; and Elizabeth Holtzman and Dennis
DeConcini, former members of Congress.
 &HT;    The Monica shows have been a tremendous boon to former
everythings. The cable programs have so much air time to fill _
Matthews alone runs through 50 guests a week _ that they often have
to rely on people with only the kind of hypothetical expertise
conferred by resumes.
 &HT;    Matthews opened solemnly. The ultimate question, he said, was,
``Can the chief law-enforcement agent of the nation play with the
truth and still lead the nation?'' Then, with the magic words,
``Let's play hardball!'' the circus began.
 &HT;    Taylor said reports indicated that the president would admit in
his speech to ``some sort of sexual relationship'' with Lewinsky,
and that he had not been ``completely candid about it.''
 &HT;    Matthews jumped on him. ``Why do you use terms like 'some sort
of' and 'completely?'''
 &HT;    Taylor was on Matthews' side, but he had made the mistake of
stating the case in neutral terms. On ``Hardball'' there is no
middle. If you have trouble with that, you don't get invited back.
 &HT;    ``He lied,'' Taylor said, dropping the legalistic phrase. ``We
all know he lied.''
 &HT;    The gladiatorial combat that gives ``Hardball'' its faintly
sadistic appeal is not, interestingly, between the guests but
between the host and his guests. Matthews is a gleeful warrior, by
turns mocking, witty, high-minded and bullying. Even if he doesn't
know more than his guests, he can generally out-argue them; and
when he can't do that, he can just talk them into the ground.
 &HT;    Now he turned to Marcia Clark, in Los Angeles, and said, ``He's
now saying that the kind of sex he had with Monica Lewinsky did not
constitute sexual relations, and it seems to me by that definition,
Hugh Grant should be exonerated for what happened to him on the
Sunset Strip several months back, and every hooker that's picked up
on Broadway tonight for selling sex should be exonerated.''
 &HT;    Clark had battled wits with Johnnie Cochran, but Matthews
reduced her to an equivocal stammer.
 &HT;    By now, Matthews didn't need his guests at all. He turned to the
camera and shouted: ``I'd like to suggest that in every household
and every car pool and every barroom in America, and every party
you've been to in the past seven months, there's been somebody
who's spoken up for the president and said, 'I believe he didn't
have this relationship.' All of those people are part of the
recruited, commissioned and put-in-the-field army of Clinton liars.
He has made them all into liars ... and tonight he better come on
and apologize to those people.''
 &HT;    It was a majestic outburst, at least if you hate Clinton. If you
didn't, it was just plain menacing.
 &HT;    Then he cut to Elizabeth Holtzman in New York, a staunch
presidential defender, and reduced her to waving her hands and
saying, ``Chris ... Chris ... Chris'' as he buried her beneath a
torrent of words.
 &HT;    Afterwards, back in his office, Matthews looked out the window
and said: ``I got too emotional. What happened out there?''
 &HT;    What happened to restraint _ the whole rising-to-the-moment
thing? Matthews genuinely would like to give off light as well as
heat, but some combination of intellectual vanity, lack of table
manners and sheer passion does him in every time.
 &HT;    Of course, that's why he's on the air. If you want depth, you
can read a book.

 By JAMES TRAUB  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It's 3 p.m., Monday, Aug. 17. President Clinton is in the White
House Map Room, testifying, and Chris Matthews, the flaxen-haired,
pink-faced, know-it-all and occasionally unhinged host of
``Hardball With Chris Matthews,'' is sitting in his office in the
Washington quarters of CNBC, scarfing a basket of Wendy's fried
chicken.
 &HT;    For Matthews, this is the Day of Days _ to be equaled later, of
course, by Sept. 11, the day of the Starr report's release _ and in
his excitement he's spraying bits of biscuit on his tie.
 &HT;    ``Hardball'' is one of a half-dozen shows, mostly on cable, that
for the past seven months have been Monicamonicamonica. There's
``Rivera Live,'' also on CNBC; ``The Big Show'' and ``The News With
Brian Williams'' on MSNBC, and ``Hannity &AMP; Colmes'' and ``The Crier
Report'' on Fox News.
 &HT;    It's a Darwinian world out there, and in this jungle of passion
and diatribe, Chris Matthews is not about to end up as anybody's
lunch.
 &HT;    He calls Bill Clinton a liar about a hundred times a night, and
he mows down the defenders of the president foolish or desperate or
brave enough to appear on the show. There's an almost Rabelaisian
zest about Matthews: He lays about him with such indiscriminate
excitement that he flattens friend and foe alike. ``Hardball'' is
the most fervent of a fervent lot; it's also probably the most
entertaining.
 &HT;    Matthews, 52, is a political junkie of classic lineage. A
streetwise Catholic kid who grew up in Philadelphia, he was trained
by the Jesuit fathers at Holy Cross, served in the Peace Corps
(rather than Vietnam) and worked as a speech writer for Jimmy
Carter and as an aide and quotemeister for House Speaker Tip
O'Neill.
 &HT;    He now writes a newspaper column for The San Francisco Examiner
and has written a book about Capitol Hill (also called
``Hardball'') and a perfectly creditable book about the
relationship between Nixon and the Kennedys. He is a pol, a
moralist and a philosopher.
 &HT;    He has more theories than a Yale English professor; he has a
theory about why he talks fast, a theory about why he yells and, of
course, a theory about our obsessional interest in the president's
sex life. Matthews tends to keep talking until he's interrupted
(and beyond), so his theory is rather involved. It goes, in part,
as follows:
 &HT;    ``The great defining circus of our time was the Cold War, which
was the great gladiatorial spectacle, Us against Them, Us at home
against Us. Every great gladiatorial contest was part of this
wonderful, unbelievably stark, Manichaean struggle. And that went
away. The bad guys are gone. Now you have bread; you have bread
like you've never had it. Bill Clinton thought it was just about
bread, he was convinced it was bread _ give these people their
market, give them their Dow, give them their unemployment rate down
to 4, 3-1/2. Bread! But there's something missing, something we
need to have in our life, something gladiatorial, something
Kulturkampf, the big question, who we are, who's in, who's out,
who's right, who's wrong. Hey, O.J. came along. And Lady Di came
along for working women. That stunned me. That story was a Roman
candle: It only lasted a week and a half or two, but it was really
hot. Why do we have these things? We want to be tested. Think about
the Roman Empire, about the circuses of Nero. Think about a circus
as establishing a society's tests _ who's in, who's out, who's part
of us, who's not part of us, what kind of country do we want to
live in? I haven't figured this out yet, obviously. It's a great
metaphor.''
 &HT;    Or, possibly, it's an appalling metaphor that makes for great
TV. I asked Matthews if maybe the reason most Americans say they
want to hear less, not more, about Monica is that they don't want
their politics to be a circus.
 &HT;    ``Yeah,'' he conceded, with the air of a man accepting a premise
to rebut an inference. ``That's the way some people look at it.''
 &HT;    Several journalists who have appeared on the show told me that
they believe Matthews' assault on the president is dictated
strictly by ratings, not belief.
 &HT;    Matthews angrily denies this. Though he remains at least a
semi-chastened liberal, he also describes himself as something of a
William Bennett conservative who considers nonchalance toward the
president's sexual behavior to be a sign of loose cultural
moorings.
 &HT;    And yet, one of the great oddities of the Lewinsky affair is
that elites in the media and politics _ the very class that people
like Matthews accuse of waging a war against traditional American
values _ have been far more exercised about it than the citizens
whose views they claim to represent.
 &HT;    So if ordinary Americans are not clamoring for more Monica, who
is the ``we'' who need a Kulturkampf? Perhaps it's the media _ that
is, perhaps ``Hardball'' creates Monica, rather than the other way
around. The Cold War didn't need ``Meet the Press'' to grab the
nation's attention; but O.J. needed Geraldo, and Geraldo,
obviously, needed O.J.
 &HT;    The nexus between mega-event and talk show has grown ever
tighter since the hostage crisis created ``Nightline.'' Now it
seems naive to speak of such events as existing independently of
their coverage. The shows live from event to event, circus to
circus.
 &HT;    When Matthews' program was first shown in 1994, on the
short-lived America's Talking channel, it was called ``In-Depth,''
a name that already sounds quaint. In this feverish new world,
Monica was a godsend. No matter what Matthews says about ratings,
it was the scandal that persuaded CNBC to expand ``Hardball'' from
half an hour to an hour in March.
 &HT;    And after Monica? We'll have to have something else _ a new
cliffhanger, a new personal drama inflated to apocalyptic
proportions.
 &HT;    Talk about ``wonderful'' _ on the day of Days, CNBC decided to
air ``Hardball'' live rather than taped, in two segments, before
and after the president's 10 p.m. speech. Waiting to go on before
the speech, Matthews sat in his office, furiously scribbling
questions on blue cards.
 &HT;    A TV set in the corner showed a fixed image of the White House
entrance through which prosecutors were expected to exit _ tedium
laced with tension.
 &HT;    Matthews felt history floating in the atmosphere; he wanted to
be equal to the moment.
 &HT;    ``My goal for tonight,'' he told his staff, ``is three different
levels. We treat the moral, the legal and the political, and we ask
ourselves the right questions, as Roger Mudd did back in '74,''
during Mudd's post-mortem analysis of Richard Nixon's resignation
speech.
 &HT;    At 20 minutes till 8, Matthews took the elevator down to the
studio and seated himself at a crescent-shaped table. His guests
for the first hour included Stuart Taylor, the respected legal
journalist and a harsh critic of the president; Ron Nessen, the
former White House spokesman (for Gerald Ford); Marcia Clark, the
former O.J. prosecutor; and Elizabeth Holtzman and Dennis
DeConcini, former members of Congress.
 &HT;    The Monica shows have been a tremendous boon to former
everythings. The cable programs have so much air time to fill _
Matthews alone runs through 50 guests a week _ that they often have
to rely on people with only the kind of hypothetical expertise
conferred by resumes.
 &HT;    Matthews opened solemnly. The ultimate question, he said, was,
``Can the chief law-enforcement agent of the nation play with the
truth and still lead the nation?'' Then, with the magic words,
``Let's play hardball!'' the circus began.
 &HT;    Taylor said reports indicated that the president would admit in
his speech to ``some sort of sexual relationship'' with Lewinsky,
and that he had not been ``completely candid about it.''
 &HT;    Matthews jumped on him. ``Why do you use terms like 'some sort
of' and 'completely?'''
 &HT;    Taylor was on Matthews' side, but he had made the mistake of
stating the case in neutral terms. On ``Hardball'' there is no
middle. If you have trouble with that, you don't get invited back.
 &HT;    ``He lied,'' Taylor said, dropping the legalistic phrase. ``We
all know he lied.''
 &HT;    The gladiatorial combat that gives ``Hardball'' its faintly
sadistic appeal is not, interestingly, between the guests but
between the host and his guests. Matthews is a gleeful warrior, by
turns mocking, witty, high-minded and bullying. Even if he doesn't
know more than his guests, he can generally out-argue them; and
when he can't do that, he can just talk them into the ground.
 &HT;    Now he turned to Marcia Clark, in Los Angeles, and said, ``He's
now saying that the kind of sex he had with Monica Lewinsky did not
constitute sexual relations, and it seems to me by that definition,
Hugh Grant should be exonerated for what happened to him on the
Sunset Strip several months back, and every hooker that's picked up
on Broadway tonight for selling sex should be exonerated.''
 &HT;    Clark had battled wits with Johnnie Cochran, but Matthews
reduced her to an equivocal stammer.
 &HT;    By now, Matthews didn't need his guests at all. He turned to the
camera and shouted: ``I'd like to suggest that in every household
and every car pool and every barroom in America, and every party

 &HT;    Of course, that's why he's on the air. If you want depth, you

   ``BILLY BREAKS OUT.'' From W magazine. One color slide. Sex,
tragedy and an Olympic athlete with major babe potential: It's no
wonder Hollywood is smitten with handsome sports idol Steve
Prefontaine, who died in a 1975 car accident at the age of 24. So
smitten, in fact, that two films have been made about the legendary
long-distance runner in the last two years. The first tanked, and
now actor Billy Crudup finds himself in the nerve-racking position
of starring in the second, titled ``Without Limits.'' In this
interview from W magazine, Crudup talks to writer Dana Wood about
his portrayal of Prefontaine, his fear of attending the premieres
of his films and his stage work.

   ``BILLY BREAKS OUT.'' From W magazine. One color slide. Sex,
tragedy and an Olympic athlete with major babe potential: It's no
wonder Hollywood is smitten with handsome sports idol Steve
Prefontaine, who died in a 1975 car accident at the age of 24. So
smitten, in fact, that two films have been made about the legendary
long-distance runner in the last two years. The first tanked, and
now actor Billy Crudup finds himself in the nerve-racking position
of starring in the second, titled ``Without Limits.'' In this
interview from W magazine, Crudup talks to writer Dana Wood about
his portrayal of Prefontaine, his fear of attending the premieres
of his films and his stage work.

 By CATHERINE DOLD 
 c.1998 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Five years ago, while visiting his native Korea, physicist
Zang-Hee Cho took a tumble down a hiking trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the mountains for a picnic, and my shoes were not
quite correct,'' recalls the 62-year-old professor from the
University of California at Irvine. ``I was thinking, as usual, and
I fell down. It was like a flight, like a big jump down the
mountain. The next day I returned to California and tried to stand
up after 12 hours on the plane. I couldn't stand up. I said,
'Uh-oh, big trouble.'''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before Cho began to look for some relief from the
pain in his back. Relatives suggested he try acupuncture. Though he
initially scoffed at the idea _ as an educated person, he says, he
didn't believe in acupuncture _ he tried it. And much to his
surprise, it worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``After about 10 minutes I felt the pain melting away.''
</P>
<P>
   Cho's unexpected relief prodded his professional curiosity. As a
physicist working in radiology, Cho develops ways to image the
complex inner workings of the body. One of his inventions was a
prototype PET scanner around 1975.
</P>
<P>
   How, he wondered, could inserting needles into seemingly random
points on the body possibly affect human health?
</P>
<P>
   He decided to take a closer look, and what he found astounded
him. While sticking needles into a few student volunteers, he took
pictures of their brains and discovered that by stimulating an
acupuncture point said to be associated with vision _ but that is
nowhere near anything known to be connected to the eyes _ he could
indeed trigger activity in the very part of the brain that controls
vision.
</P>
<P>
   There just might be something to this acupuncture thing, he
figured.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture and other forms of traditional Chinese medicine have
been around for more than 4,000 years. Yet the explanation for how
acupuncture _ and Chinese medicine as a whole _ works has long been
a mystery, if not an object of mockery, for most Western doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The basic theory is outlined in a text from 200 B.C., attributed
to the Yellow Emperor (a mythical ruler). In brief, it recognizes
in people and in nature a vital energy or life force known as qi
(pronounced CHEE).
</P>
<P>
   Qi is the source of movements ranging from voluntary muscle
action to blood flow; it protects the body from external
influences, and it generates warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Qi flows through the body and to the organs by way of an
extensive system of channels known as meridians. If the flow of the
force is disturbed, the theory goes, the resulting deficiency,
excess or stagnation of qi causes bodily malfunction and thus
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture, in which needles are inserted into specific points
along the meridians and manipulated, is said to restore the proper
flow of qi and thereby return the body to health.
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners recognize some 1,500 acupoints, most of which have
no obvious relationship to their intended targets. For example, a
point on the second toe is used to treat headaches and toothaches,
while a point near the elbow enhances the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Another integral concept is the tension between two
ever-present, complementary forces of nature, yin and yang. When
their balance is disturbed, the theory goes, people get sick.
</P>
<P>
   Yin conditions reflect a lack of qi: pale face, cold
extremities, slow pulse, depression. Yang conditions result from an
excess of qi: red face, fever, fast pulse, agitation.
</P>
<P>
   What those researchers have been able to measure is a flow of
acupuncture induced endorphins. According to neuroscientist Bruce
Pomeranz, of the University of Toronto, numerous studies over the
past 20 years have shown that inserting needles into acupoints
stimulates nerves in the underlying muscles.
</P>
<P>
   That stimulation, researchers believe, sends impulses up the
spinal cord to a relatively primitive part of the brain known as
the limbic system, as well as to the midbrain and the pituitary
gland.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow that signaling leads to the release of endorphins and
monoamines, chemicals that block pain signals in the spinal cord
and the brain. The result: A well-documented generalized
``acupuncture analgesia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The endorphin story is really nailed down,'' Pomeranz says.
``It looks like it's nerves to the brain. The acupoints that have
been mapped over thousands of years are likely the spots where
nerves are concentrated.''
</P>
<P>
   But the endorphin story ``doesn't explain many of the other
claims of acupuncture,'' he continues. ``There have been a number
of clinical trials showing that acupuncture is extremely useful for
the nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and early pregnancy.
That's not the endorphin system. Nobody knows how that works.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the endorphin story explain what Cho found when
exploring acupoints that are traditionally used to treat vision
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Designated by Cho as VA1, VA2, VA3 and VA8, they are not found
near the eyes but on the outside of the foot, running from the
little toe to the ankle. The ``VA'' in Cho's designation is for
``vision-related acupoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncturists say that these points are on the urinary bladder
meridian and refer to them as BL67, BL66, BL65 and BL60,
respectively. And they hold that stimulation of these points with
needles will affect the eyes via the system of meridians rather
than through the central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   To test that premise, Cho strapped student volunteers into an
fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) machine.
</P>
<P>
   While standard MRI provides static cross-sectional pictures of
structures in the body, functional MRI goes further to reveal how
those structures are working. It measures minute changes in the
amount of oxygen carried in the blood, which is presumably a rough
measure of glucose uptake by various tissues and thus a good
indicator of which tissues are active. The results can be viewed as
colorful fMRI brain activation maps.
</P>
<P>
   Cho first stimulated the eyes of the volunteers by flashing a
light in front of them. The resulting images, as expected, showed a
concentration of color _ an increase in activity _ in the visual
cortex, the portion of the brain that is known to be involved in
eye function.
</P>
<P>
   Then Cho had an acupuncturist stimulate the acupoint VA1. In one
person after another, the very same region of the brain _ the
visual cortex _ lit up on the fMRI image.
</P>
<P>
   Cho noticed something else. When the activation data were
graphed to show the intensity of the response over time, he saw
that there were two distinct reactions among the dozen volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   During the acupuncture phase, some showed an increase in
activity, while others showed a decrease. In other words, in some
people, oxygen consumption in that brain region increased, while in
others, it decreased.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the acupuncturists mentioned, 'Oh, yes, it's yin and
yang,''' Cho says.
</P>
<P>
   Cho asked him which subjects were yin and which were yang, and
without seeing the data, the practitioner correctly pointed out who
had shown an increase in activity (yang) and who had had a decrease
(yin) in 11 of 12 cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to explain it,'' Cho says.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Like many preliminary scientific reports, Cho's small study
raises more questions than it answers. Still, he has demonstrated
new functional effects of acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Classically, acupuncture was the ultimate in experimentation;
people collected data for thousands of years,'' says Joie Jones,
professor of radiological sciences at the University of California
at Irvine and coauthor of the study. ``They noticed that when you
applied a needle in one position, it would have an effect in
another part of the body. But the connection through the brain was
never made. With these studies, we've demonstrated that for at
least some acupuncture points it goes through the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if it does go through the brain, how does stimulating a
specific point on the foot trigger activity in the part of the
brain that controls vision?
</P>
<P>
   There is no explanation for that either, Cho says, although he
suspects that the path is along the nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   If that proves to be true, it's probably not the same pathway by
which acupuncture causes the release of endorphins, Pomeranz says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That endorphins are released by stimulating certain types of
nerves in fibers anywhere in the body, that's understood. But that
there is a specific connection between your toe and your visual
system is really bizarre. That's really mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Cho hopes to push the scientific frontier a little further by
using fMRI and other imaging systems to explore connections between
acupoints and the brain.
</P>
<P>
   He also plans to study how acupuncture might be used to increase
blood flow to the visual cortex in people who have suffered vision
impairment after a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of studies by other researchers have, in fact, already
found that acupuncture treatments can help stroke patients improve
their range of movement.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture imaging studies, Cho says, are ``opening a new door
for neuroscience.''

<P>
   Five years ago, while visiting his native Korea, physicist
Zang-Hee Cho took a tumble down a hiking trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the mountains for a picnic, and my shoes were not
quite correct,'' recalls the 62-year-old professor from the
University of California at Irvine. ``I was thinking, as usual, and
I fell down. It was like a flight, like a big jump down the
mountain. The next day I returned to California and tried to stand
up after 12 hours on the plane. I couldn't stand up. I said,
'Uh-oh, big trouble.'''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before Cho began to look for some relief from the
pain in his back. Relatives suggested he try acupuncture. Though he
initially scoffed at the idea _ as an educated person, he says, he
didn't believe in acupuncture _ he tried it. And much to his
surprise, it worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``After about 10 minutes I felt the pain melting away.''
</P>
<P>
   Cho's unexpected relief prodded his professional curiosity. As a
physicist working in radiology, Cho develops ways to image the
complex inner workings of the body. One of his inventions was a
prototype PET scanner around 1975.
</P>
<P>
   How, he wondered, could inserting needles into seemingly random
points on the body possibly affect human health?
</P>
<P>
   He decided to take a closer look, and what he found astounded
him. While sticking needles into a few student volunteers, he took
pictures of their brains and discovered that by stimulating an
acupuncture point said to be associated with vision _ but that is
nowhere near anything known to be connected to the eyes _ he could
indeed trigger activity in the very part of the brain that controls
vision.
</P>
<P>
   There just might be something to this acupuncture thing, he
figured.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture and other forms of traditional Chinese medicine have
been around for more than 4,000 years. Yet the explanation for how
acupuncture _ and Chinese medicine as a whole _ works has long been
a mystery, if not an object of mockery, for most Western doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The basic theory is outlined in a text from 200 B.C., attributed
to the Yellow Emperor (a mythical ruler). In brief, it recognizes
in people and in nature a vital energy or life force known as qi
(pronounced CHEE).
</P>
<P>
   Qi is the source of movements ranging from voluntary muscle
action to blood flow; it protects the body from external
influences, and it generates warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Qi flows through the body and to the organs by way of an
extensive system of channels known as meridians. If the flow of the
force is disturbed, the theory goes, the resulting deficiency,
excess or stagnation of qi causes bodily malfunction and thus
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture, in which needles are inserted into specific points
along the meridians and manipulated, is said to restore the proper
flow of qi and thereby return the body to health.
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners recognize some 1,500 acupoints, most of which have
no obvious relationship to their intended targets. For example, a
point on the second toe is used to treat headaches and toothaches,
while a point near the elbow enhances the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Another integral concept is the tension between two
ever-present, complementary forces of nature, yin and yang. When
their balance is disturbed, the theory goes, people get sick.
</P>
<P>
   Yin conditions reflect a lack of qi: pale face, cold
extremities, slow pulse, depression. Yang conditions result from an
excess of qi: red face, fever, fast pulse, agitation.
</P>
<P>
   What those researchers have been able to measure is a flow of
acupuncture induced endorphins. According to neuroscientist Bruce
Pomeranz, of the University of Toronto, numerous studies over the
past 20 years have shown that inserting needles into acupoints
stimulates nerves in the underlying muscles.
</P>
<P>
   That stimulation, researchers believe, sends impulses up the
spinal cord to a relatively primitive part of the brain known as
the limbic system, as well as to the midbrain and the pituitary
gland.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow that signaling leads to the release of endorphins and
monoamines, chemicals that block pain signals in the spinal cord
and the brain. The result: A well-documented generalized
``acupuncture analgesia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The endorphin story is really nailed down,'' Pomeranz says.
``It looks like it's nerves to the brain. The acupoints that have
been mapped over thousands of years are likely the spots where
nerves are concentrated.''
</P>
<P>
   But the endorphin story ``doesn't explain many of the other
claims of acupuncture,'' he continues. ``There have been a number
of clinical trials showing that acupuncture is extremely useful for
the nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and early pregnancy.
That's not the endorphin system. Nobody knows how that works.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the endorphin story explain what Cho found when
exploring acupoints that are traditionally used to treat vision
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Designated by Cho as VA1, VA2, VA3 and VA8, they are not found
near the eyes but on the outside of the foot, running from the
little toe to the ankle. The ``VA'' in Cho's designation is for
``vision-related acupoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncturists say that these points are on the urinary bladder
meridian and refer to them as BL67, BL66, BL65 and BL60,
respectively. And they hold that stimulation of these points with
needles will affect the eyes via the system of meridians rather
than through the central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   To test that premise, Cho strapped student volunteers into an
fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) machine.
</P>
<P>
   While standard MRI provides static cross-sectional pictures of
structures in the body, functional MRI goes further to reveal how
those structures are working. It measures minute changes in the
amount of oxygen carried in the blood, which is presumably a rough
measure of glucose uptake by various tissues and thus a good
indicator of which tissues are active. The results can be viewed as
colorful fMRI brain activation maps.
</P>
<P>
   Cho first stimulated the eyes of the volunteers by flashing a
light in front of them. The resulting images, as expected, showed a
concentration of color _ an increase in activity _ in the visual
cortex, the portion of the brain that is known to be involved in
eye function.
</P>
<P>
   Then Cho had an acupuncturist stimulate the acupoint VA1. In one
person after another, the very same region of the brain _ the
visual cortex _ lit up on the fMRI image.
</P>
<P>
   Cho noticed something else. When the activation data were
graphed to show the intensity of the response over time, he saw
that there were two distinct reactions among the dozen volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   During the acupuncture phase, some showed an increase in
activity, while others showed a decrease. In other words, in some
people, oxygen consumption in that brain region increased, while in
others, it decreased.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the acupuncturists mentioned, 'Oh, yes, it's yin and

</P>
<P>
   Cho asked him which subjects were yin and which were yang, and
without seeing the data, the practitioner correctly pointed out who
had shown an increase in activity (yang) and who had had a decrease
(yin) in 11 of 12 cases.

<P>
   For about two years the space probe Galileo has been gathering
ever more evidence that a large ocean lies hidden beneath the
frozen, fractured surface of Jupiter's moon Europa.
</P>
<P>
   Now the spacecraft has found the most convincing signs yet for a
Europan sea, in the form of salt deposits on the moon's icy
surface. The salts very likely come from a briny ocean many miles
below the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence also suggests that Europa's ocean is highly
carbonated. Pressure from that seltzerlike sea may be responsible
for ejecting what appear to be sprays of debris visible on the
moon's face.
</P>
<P>
   The telltale signature of the salts was picked up by an
instrument on board Galileo called the Near Infrared Mapping
Spectrometer, which measures the absorption and reflection of
various wavelengths of sunlight by Europa's surface.
</P>
<P>
   Each material absorbs and reflects different, characteristic
wavelengths of light. The wavelengths measured by Galileo's
spectrometer _ from deep red in the visible spectrum out to longer
infrared wavelengths _ can thus reveal the chemical makeup of
Europa's surface.
</P>
<P>
   When the spectrometer focused on the areas of Europa that
appeared in photographs to consist of pure ice, it indeed measured
the characteristic spectrum of water ice _ no surprise there.
</P>
<P>
   But when the instrument examined features like the many dark
lines that crisscross the moon's surface, it obtained several
distorted spectra that each looked similar to ice.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McCord, a geophysicist at the University of Hawaii who is
studying the Galileo data, recognized that the spectra were
produced by light reflecting off water-impregnated salty minerals,
including natron and Epsom salts. Such salts, McCord says, form
only in the presence of liquid water.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first evidence that Europa's ocean is briny,''
McCord says.
</P>
<P>
   The circulating currents of a salty sea would explain the
unusual magnetic readings that other Galileo instruments have
recorded. Those currents may create a magnetic field for the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Galileo found that the salts have the same composition at
different sites scattered about the moon, evidence that the sea is
extensive and well mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The composition of the salts, McCord says, gives some hints
about the chemistry of Europa's ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of sodium carbonates means that carbon dioxide is
probably dissolved in the water.
</P>
<P>
   On Earth, volcanoes and submarine hydrothermal vents release
carbon dioxide, ``so it is reasonable to think that carbon dioxide
gas would be coming out of Europa's mantle and into the ocean,''
McCord says. ``The ice cap would seal the ocean most of the time,
so the carbon dioxide would build up and become like seltzer
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Raise the pressure of that carbon dioxide high enough and it
could erupt through the ice to the surface. (This could explain the
origin of volcano-like features on Europa.)
</P>
<P>
   Once exposed to the near vacuum that exists at the moon's
surface, the briny water would quickly evaporate, leaving the salts
behind.
</P>
<P>
   As yet, there is no evidence that Europa has hydrothermal vents
on its ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if there is an ocean, there has to be heat coming out of
the mantle,'' McCord says, ``so there almost have to be
hydrothermal vents.''
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly no reason that hydrothermal vents couldn't
exist in oceans on worlds other than our own. In fact, the Mars
Global Surveyor mission recently found signs of a large deposit of
hematite _ a mineral often formed by hydrothermal activity _ near
Mars' equator.
</P>
<P>
   If the hematite deposit does indeed mark the site of a large
ancient body of hot water, it would be an ideal place to search for
past life on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   A briny Europan sea might also contain evidence of past life.
But unlike Mars, Europa may still harbor some kind of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is felt that carbon dioxide in the ocean created a fertile
environment for the formation of life on Earth,'' McCord says.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonates create a less acidic environment, one more favorable
for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we have, perhaps, a carbon dioxide-rich ocean. It's one
more thing that suggests that the ocean could be a habitat for
life.''

spectrometer _ from deep red in the visible spectrum out to longer
infrared wavelengths _ can thus reveal the chemical makeup of
Europa's surface.
</P>
<P>
   When the spectrometer focused on the areas of Europa that
appeared in photographs to consist of pure ice, it indeed measured
the characteristic spectrum of water ice _ no surprise there.
</P>
<P>
   But when the instrument examined features like the many dark
lines that crisscross the moon's surface, it obtained several
distorted spectra that each looked similar to ice.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McCord, a geophysicist at the University of Hawaii who is
studying the Galileo data, recognized that the spectra were
produced by light reflecting off water-impregnated salty minerals,
including natron and Epsom salts. Such salts, McCord says, form
only in the presence of liquid water.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first evidence that Europa's ocean is briny,''
McCord says.
</P>
<P>
   The circulating currents of a salty sea would explain the
unusual magnetic readings that other Galileo instruments have
recorded. Those currents may create a magnetic field for the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Galileo found that the salts have the same composition at
different sites scattered about the moon, evidence that the sea is
extensive and well mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The composition of the salts, McCord says, gives some hints
about the chemistry of Europa's ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of sodium carbonates means that carbon dioxide is
probably dissolved in the water.
</P>
<P>
   On Earth, volcanoes and submarine hydrothermal vents release
carbon dioxide, ``so it is reasonable to think that carbon dioxide
gas would be coming out of Europa's mantle and into the ocean,''
McCord says. ``The ice cap would seal the ocean most of the time,
so the carbon dioxide would build up and become like seltzer
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Raise the pressure of that carbon dioxide high enough and it
could erupt through the ice to the surface. (This could explain the
origin of volcano-like features on Europa.)
</P>
<P>
   Once exposed to the near vacuum that exists at the moon's
surface, the briny water would quickly evaporate, leaving the salts
behind.
</P>
<P>
   As yet, there is no evidence that Europa has hydrothermal vents
on its ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if there is an ocean, there has to be heat coming out of
the mantle,'' McCord says, ``so there almost have to be
hydrothermal vents.''
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly no reason that hydrothermal vents couldn't
exist in oceans on worlds other than our own. In fact, the Mars
Global Surveyor mission recently found signs of a large deposit of
hematite _ a mineral often formed by hydrothermal activity _ near
Mars' equator.
</P>
<P>
   If the hematite deposit does indeed mark the site of a large
ancient body of hot water, it would be an ideal place to search for
past life on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   A briny Europan sea might also contain evidence of past life.
But unlike Mars, Europa may still harbor some kind of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is felt that carbon dioxide in the ocean created a fertile
environment for the formation of life on Earth,'' McCord says.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonates create a less acidic environment, one more favorable
for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we have, perhaps, a carbon dioxide-rich ocean. It's one
more thing that suggests that the ocean could be a habitat for
life.''

BORDER CHILD MUSES ABOUT HIS MIXED HERI TAGE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
NOBODY'S SON: NOTES FROM AN AMERICAN LIFE 
Luis Alberto Urrea (University of Arizona Press; $19.95) 
 
 By GRACIELA SEVILLA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They say that home is where the heart is. But for those of us
who grew up on the border, easing back and forth between countries,
cultures and languages, the heart is often divided.
</P>
<P>
   Called by two directions, we are children of a blended world.
Our homes and hearts are defined by contrasts, clashes and separate
words that jumble together in a mixed identity overflowing border
limits.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Alberto Urrea, author of ``Nobody's Son: Notes from an
American Life,'' is such a border child. He writes about the border
running through him, ``a barbed wire fence neatly bisecting my
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Tijuana of an Anglo-American mother and a Mexican
father, Urrea was 3 when the family moved across the border to San
Diego. In his book, Urrea brings to life childhood memories and
sharp observations about his multiethnic identity in a collection
of essays, some previously published, that is powerful and
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Part-memoir, part-satire and part-essay, Urrea's book is as
undefinable as his transborder identity. In quick-bite, unconnected
chapters, he skips back and forth across the border to paint
colorful narratives of family history, boyhood vignettes and social
comentary that are at once funny, sad, tough and tender.
</P>
<P>
   His section on language sizzles. Satirizing the English-only
purists, Urrea points out the heavy borrowing of foreign words in
English:
</P>
<P>
   ``How will we get rid of all those pesky foreign words
debilitating the United States?'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Turkish words (like coffee). Those French words (like
maroon). Those Greek words (like cedar). Those Italian words (like
marinate). Those African words (like marimba).
</P>
<P>
   ``English! It's made up of all these untidy words, man . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I love words so much. Thank God so many people lent us theirs
or we'd be forced to point and grunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Other parts of the book recount the joys and conflicts of
Urrea's divided household. He sifts through the cultural clashes in
vivid stories that sparkle with passion, wit and poetry.
</P>
<P>
   For Urrea, the conflict over identity and ethnicity began in his
own family. ``Why can't you be called Louis instead of Luis?'' his
mother, Phyllis, rants. ``Speak Spanish, pendejo!'' his father,
Alberto, shouts at the future Harvard professor of creative writing
who now is writer-in-residence at the University of Louisiana at
Lafeyette. The word loosely translates as ``good-for-nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most comic and beautiful chapters is about the home
of Urrea's surrogate parents, Mama Chayo and Abelino, his father's
tuna cannery co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   Urrea's recounting of the wonder and everyday magic of this
immigrant household is filled with delicious detail that lets a
reader savor the sights, sounds and smells as if watching the
stories unfold.
</P>
<P>
   For a book filled with delightful surprises, Urrea's final
chapter is anti-climactic. After eloquently painting scenes from
his divided upbringing, he ends without offering resolution for the
turbulence. The outcome, he implies, remains to be discovered and
defined.
</P>
<P>
   As close as he gets to tidying up is to paraphrase Thomas
Wolfe's ``You can't go home again.'' Urrea twist: ``Sometimes you
can't escape from home, no matter how far you go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's Son'' is the last book in a border trilogy that
begins with ``Across the Wire: Life and Hard Times on the Mexican
Border'' (1993), for which Urrea won the Christopher award. The
second book is ``By the Lake of Sleeping Children'' (1996). &QL;

FORMER ATTORNEY SEES `NO SAFE PLACE' FICTION BECOME POLITICAL
REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before Richard North Patterson set out to write his latest
novel, he asked some political consultants to help him solve a
dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them OK, imagine that you've got this problem,''
Patterson says. ``Your candidate is running for his party's
nomination for president of the United States. There are seven days
left to go in the California primary. Suddenly, you find out that a
national news magazine is attempting to verify that two years
before, while still married, your candidate had an affair with a
reporter who has now been assigned to cover him. How do you kill
the story for the next seven days, and then what do you do?''
</P>
<P>
   He received some surprising responses. Do not, one of the
consultants told him, let the magazine's reporters near your guy
until the primary is over, and then make a firm denial. Find a
graceful way to lose the primary, another said, and your guy can
run again in four years when things have quieted down.
</P>
<P>
   These were some of the best political minds in the country, and
they were taking part in the political education of Patterson. They
were so honest with him _ because, he says, he wasn't a reporter
and they knew he wouldn't quote them _ that when sex and politics
made the real headlines more than a year later, Patterson felt as
if he could have written the script for what followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It surprised me how completely (begin itals) unsurprised (end
itals) I was by the performance of the Clinton spin machine and the
media around Lewinsky,'' he says. ``It went just about exactly as I
would have thought it would go. And before I undertook to write
``No Safe Place,'' I would have been absolutely astonished by it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No Safe Place'' (Knopf, $25.95) is a departure for Patterson,
51, an ex-attorney known for his legal thrillers (he quit his job
as a securities lawyer after his 1993 book, ``Degree of Guilt,''
made the bestseller lists). The plot, invented before Monica
Lewinsky ever set foot in the White House, is built around the
situation he took to the political wizards: In 2000, a decent but
flawed man named Kerry Kilcannon runs for the presidency and is
faced with a possible media frenzy over his one-time affair with a
reporter, a woman he still loves.
</P>
<P>
   Around the love story, Patterson builds an often unflattering
picture of politics today. There are Kilcannon's advisers, who meet
for blunt, no-holds-barred discussions on political strategy and
damage control. There is the press corps, a cadre of bored but
savvy people whose cynical humor and competitive sniping helps pass
the time between campaign stops. And there are the issues _ in this
case the big one is abortion, and all of the emotional arguments
that surround it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't shrink at all from writing about it,'' Patterson
says. ``It would be gutless to write a novel about politics and not
try to deal with some of the most emotional issues. It's so
partisan that no one in politics feels safe admitting the moral
complexity of abortion as an issue. I wanted people to think about
how debased our dialogue around it has become. I expect to get
mail, and some of it will be angry. That's OK with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson says he has been interested in politics since he read
Allen Drury's ``Advise and Consent'' more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a majestic exploration of politics at the highest
level, with all its moral ambiguities,'' he says. ``I wanted to
write about what the world of high-stakes presidential politics was
like 40 years after Drury wrote that book. The environment has
changed entirely since then. It's much more savage, a much less
collegial world.''
</P>
<P>
   To write his book, Patterson needed entry to a culture that
seemed off-limits to a novelist with no political connections.
Then, out of the blue, he received a fan letter from former
President Bush, who wrote to say how much he had enjoyed ``Degree
of Guilt.'' Patterson seized the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that I was in touch with one of the four men in
America who'd had the remarkable experience of running for
president and winning,'' he says. ``To me, it's the most
excruciating, challenging, exhausting thing an American can do.
Candidates face endless invasions of privacy, constant scrutiny.
One mistake can wipe out years of effort in five minutes. Your
success and failure is all about (begin itals) you.'' (end itals)
</P>
<P>
   Patterson asked for Bush's help, and the former president put
him in touch with political strategists and helped him gain access
to the 1996 election campaign. He traveled in California with Bob
Dole, and met John McCain, whom Patterson calls ``one of the finest
people I know.'' He also at tended the Republican National
Convention, mingled with the press corps and tried to experience
every aspect of political campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   It was heady stuff for a writer of courtroom thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I write a book about the law, I know what I'm doing,'' he
says. ``I have a set of tools to work with, and I know how big the
project will be. But this one just kept getting bigger and bigger.
I finally decided just to go with it. I didn't plan to go to the
convention, but I had the chance so I went. I didn't know I was
going to get to travel with the campaigns, but I did. I didn't know
I would get access to the Secret Service, but I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was finally time to write, I had a huge organizational
problem. I cross-referenced a million things. I had an outline that
was probably two inches thick. It's the hardest I've ever worked on
a book.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a challenge to portray a politician's life and still
make his book entertaining, if not entirely realistic. By the time
he runs for president, Kerry Kilcannon has seen enough drama to
fill several lives _ he has survived an abusive father, a shooting
by the husband of one of his law clients, the assassination of his
brother (also a politician), and a bad marriage. Now, he is being
stalked by an anti-abortion zealot who holds a secret from
Kilcannon's past.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson does not apologize for any of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a school of fiction a while ago,'' he says. ``I call
it `New Yorker' fiction. The premise of a short story would be
something like guy gets up, guy brushes his teeth, guy tries to
figure out whether or not to leave the apartment, guy decides he
doesn't want to, and that's the end of the story. Bored my head
off. I like to write about people who want something, who engage
with the world. And things happen to those people.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson says he was not disillusioned by his political
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I distinguish between the good people in politics who strive
to remain good, and the system that works against them,'' he says.
``Same thing with the press. I think, however, that their world is
getting nastier and more brutish, and that the competition between
the proliferating media outlets means there will be a degradation
of standards. There's going to be more scandal reported on less
basis than ever before. I'm worried about that, and I think the
good people in the press are worried about it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about the irreverent press corps he portrays in ``No
Safe Place''? Did he really see a frustrated reporter scribble a
question on a grapefruit and roll it up the aisle of a plane to the
evasive candidate secluded behind the first-class curtain?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I didn't see it but I heard about it,'' Patterson says.
``I did, however, see people butt-surfing up the aisle on plastic
food trays. And I saw plenty of food fights.'' &QL;

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; ANNE FRANK &QL; 
 &UR; Melissa Muller (Metropolitan, $23)
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to resist this biography before you begin to read,
on the grounds that Anne Frank has told her own story,
sufficiently, eloquently and in her own way. But after a few pages
of Muller's book, you won't want to stop. She begins with the
arrest of the Frank family and the others who had hidden in a
warehouse annex for two years. In the surreal calm of that horrific
day, it's clear that Muller's chilling, omniscient narrative does
not compete with Anne's diary but enhances it. Later chapters
dealing with the more mundane elements of biography are no less
effective. Muller paraphrases entries that were omitted from
published versions of Anne's diary by Anne's father, who did not
want his unhappy marriage subjected to public scrutiny. That a
conflicted Otto Frank managed to keep them secret for so long is
another poignant element to Anne's story. As Muller points out, the
easiest way for Frank to hide the entries was to destroy them, but
he couldn't bring himself to do it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; SAVING CHILDHOOD &QL; 
 &UR; Michael and Diane Medved (HarperCollins, $24)
</P>
<P>
   We should thank Ken Starr for turning in his Clinton/Lewinsky
opus (begin itals) after (end itals) the Medveds finished their
book. If he hadn't, they would have added it to their litany of
crimes against childhood, and the truth is that we just couldn't
take any more, not another word. The Medveds are disgusted _
drippingly, indignantly disgusted _ by everything from pushy
parents (as in the case of Jessica Dubroff, the girl who died in a
plane crash while trying to become the world's youngest
cross-country pilot, or of JonBenet Ramsey, not because she was
murdered but because she was in beauty pagents), to the media, to
kids' books (they even find fault with the ``Junior Girl Scout
Handbook''), to schools, to families that are anything but nuclear,
to peers who will lead your kids astray. They alternate these
tirades with anecdotes about their own ``precious'' children, who
seem to be the only ones in America being raised right. Do they
live on an island? In a convent? With this message _ that innocence
is under attack _ you'd think the authors would be preaching to the
converted. Instead, they spit venom, and make us run for cover.
We're glad they don't live next door. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; RENAISSANCE &QL; 
 &UR; Ruth Forman (Beacon, $18)
</P>
<P>
   Read only a few of Ruth Forman's poems and you'll hear the voice
that is behind all of them _ simple but wise, grave but joyous,
alive with language and, most of all, welcoming. She is young and
African-American, but her poems speak to universal things. Her
first book was ``We Are the Young Magicians.'' Forman will read her
work Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. at the YMCA of downtown Phoenix, 350 N.
First Ave., Phoenix. Her appearance is sponsored by The Writer's
Voice, which recently moved from its longtime location at the
Scottsdale/Paradise Valley YMCA in order to be more accessible to
most of its membership. The reading is open to the public. For
information, call 528-5543. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; REPORTING VIETNAM: AMERICAN JOURNALISM 1959-1975 &QL; 
 &UR; (Library of America, two volumes, $35 each)
</P>
<P>
   ``The guerrilla wore little, perhaps a simple peasant pajama
suit, perhaps only shorts. He was slim and wiry, and his face would
remind you of your interpreter or of that taxi driver who drove you
to My Tho. Only the haircut was different, very thin along the
sides, and very long on top and in front. It was a bad haircut, and
like the frailness of the uniform and the thin wallet with perhaps
only a few pictures of some peasant woman, it made the enemy
human.'' It was 1963, and David Halberstam was reporting from
Vietnam for The New York Times. This is a superb collection of
writing on American involvement there, by many of the journalists
who covered the war and events that led up to it, by others who
observed the tumult at home, and by some of the soldiers who
fought. Included are contributions by Peter Arnett, Tom Wolfe, Ward
S. Just, Neil Sheehan, Walter Cronkite, Seymour Hersh, Gloria
Emerson, Tom Buckley, Sydney Schanberg, Rudolph Rauch, Fox
Butterfield, Philip Caputo and many others. Daniel Lang's book
``Casualties of War'' is included in full, as is Michael Herr's
``Dispatches.'' Also here are John McCain's account of his years as
a prisoner of war, and letters written by pilot Jerry Shank to his
family until two days before he was killed in combat in March of
1964. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; N.C. WYETH &QL; 
 &UR; David Michaelis (Knopf, $40)
</P>
<P>
   ``A picture,'' said Newell Convers Wyeth, ``is the briefest
method known to communicate an idea to the human mind.'' As a child
he never read most of the stories that he would later illustrate _
``Robinson Crusoe,'' ``Treasure Island,'' ``Last of the Mohicans''
_ but he came to them soon enough. A teacher at an art school in
Boston evaluated the young Wyeth's drawing of a fox's head and
suggested that he might have a talent for illustration, at that
time a booming trade. ``I jumped at the straw,'' Wyeth later
remembered. He would ultimately call himself a failure, however,
for never achieving the career in fine art that would bless his
son, Andy, and grandson, Jamie. This first-rate biography has a big
price for the best of reasons: It includes color reproductions of
many of Wyeth's illustrations. But it also deals with the dark side
of Wyeth's life _ his compulsiveness, his depressions, his
relationship with his volatile daughter-in-law, Caroline, who was
32 years his junior. Michaelis bases his book on materials in the
Wyeth family archive and on extensive conversations with Jamie,
Betsy and Andrew Wyeth. &QL;

WHAT WE KEEP 
Elizabeth Berg, (Random House, $23) 
 
 By AMY CARLILE  
 THE ARIZONA REPUBLIC  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever had a conversation like this with your mother? You:
``Remember when I bought those green platform shoes for the prom in
1978 and you said they were ugly?'' Her response: ``No. I never
liked those shoes but I wouldn't have said they were ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Both of you go on laughing about the styles of '70s and how they
are coming back into fashion, but in your mind you're sure she said
those shoes were ugly back in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   It's your perspective. Perspective is what we hold on to, what
we keep and use to form our lives. Having Mom call shoes ``ugly''
may be no big deal, especially 20 years later, but for whatever
reason it stuck in your brain. It's an occurrence that colors your
memory of the event and it's as valid as Mom's recollection.
</P>
<P>
   In her newest novel, ``What We Keep,'' Elizabeth Berg has deftly
captured the idea of perspective and how it shapes memory and
action. Plus, she's been brave enough to tackle perspective in the
most tender of relationships, the one between mothers and
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Every daughter knows the weight of a mother's influence. Every
mother knows the risk of having her words or glances taken out of
context. Each sidesteps the other in efforts to get along. The
beauty of Berg's story is that the issue of differing perspectives
is painfully real, but the pain is one of relief that the conflict
is finally acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Ginny, the younger of two sisters, narrates the story of how she
and her sister, Sharla, ``lost'' their mother in the summer of
1958. As she flies across the country to meet up with Sharla and
reunite with their mother after not speaking to her in 35 years,
Ginny searches for clues as to why and how events happened.
</P>
<P>
   Berg sets up the family (there is a dad, too) as a very typical
'50s clan with all the stereotypes we want to believe about the
decade. Mom stays at home, Dad works. Kids hang out and watch grass
grow all summer. Life should be idyllic.
</P>
<P>
   But Mom is not quite Donna Reed. She's a good, attentive woman
who loves her husband and kids and goes through all the right
motions. She's also artistic, with an extraordinary talent for
drawing. On the negative side, the girls sense their mother is
uncomfortable in her role.
</P>
<P>
   That's the perspective of the girls, and, like most young
teenagers, they think they've got Mom all figured out. It's a
perspective that shapes the rest of the story as we learn of mom's
growing relationship and extended vacation with her new best
friend, next-door neighbor Jasmine.
</P>
<P>
   Then she divorces her husband and leaves her girls to develop a
separate life and nurture her artistic talents. To deal with this
huge blow, the girls refuse to accept any continuing relationship
with their mother. Eventually she stops trying.
</P>
<P>
   The girls weave a web around their hearts that protects them
from the memory of their mother. It also allows them to not forgive
her.
</P>
<P>
   Only decades later does Ginny allow herself to go back and see
life as it actually happened.
</P>
<P>
   In ``What We Keep,'' Berg allows us to acknowledge tough
questions about the mother/daughter relationship. What is it that
we ask of our mothers? What do they owe us? What do we owe them?
Why do we hold each other to such impossible standards?
</P>
<P>
   Her insight to this relationship is uncanny and her ability to
articulate the conflict without sounding whiny or caustic is to be
admired. &QL;

THE WEB OF LIES BEHIND STARR'S SMEAR CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- While would-be drama critics dispute the value of
actually seeing and hearing President Clinton's grand jury
testimony yesterday, those who sift through real evidence can spend
much more rewarding hours.
</P>
<P>
   Just for example, three things are crystal clear from material
now on the public record as well as from halfhearted admissions and
omissions from independent counsel Kenneth Starr's argumentative
referral to the House of Representatives:
</P>
<P>
   _Starr's office smeared prominent attorney and presidential
friend Vernon E. Jordan Jr. to hoodwink Attorney General Janet Reno
into getting his jurisdiction expanded to include the Monica
Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   _Starr's office then smeared Jordan, along with the first
Lewinsky lawyer, Francis D. Carter, in order to give his
investigation juice with the press.
</P>
<P>
   _And while he has backed away from both those lawyers because
his investigation yielded not a credible shred of evidence against
these men (in fact, it produced the opposite), Starr's office
continues to use the smear to avoid owning up to an unconscionable
act of defamation.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the evidence as compiled and released so far
shows how Starr's office created the blatantly false impression of
a broad and deep conspiracy to suborn perjury and obstruct justice
to provide a legitimate-appearing cover for a grubby tale of a
president fooling around with a 21-year-old White House intern and
then trying to keep his conduct from his family and the country.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's pitch to Reno was that he should get the Lewinsky case
because the intimations of coverup from Lewinsky's rantings on the
famous Linda Tripp tape recordings were similar to his ongoing
probe of onetime Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell and
that there was an ``overlap'' with ``potential subjects and
witnesses,'' specifically Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Baloney. Starr called a zillion people before grand juries here
and in Little Rock. Hubbell had become a cooperating witness after
pleading guilty to defrauding his onetime Little Rock law partners,
and Starr didn't like what Hubbell told him. So he minutely
examined the Clintonites (Jordan was one of them) who helped
Hubbell find work during the period when he was protesting his
innocence to the world and who ceased helping him after he
confessed. Not one witness statement or document ever indicated
that the job search was anything more than well-connected friends
helping a false friend.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, didn't stop Starr from insinuating otherwise and
then using unchecked babble by Lewinsky on some of the Tripp tapes
to double the smear via the press.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, when the Lewinsky story broke in January, Starr's
office, with extra help from onetime Tripp literary agent Lucianne
Goldberg, put out investigative material to the effect that
Lewinsky was heard on the tapes telling Tripp that Jordan had
``instructed her to lie'' (ABC News) and that she discussed perjury
in his car on the way to meet her lawyer, Frank Carter (The
Washington Post). In subsequent leaks, stories were floated that
she had made sure her affidavit denying a sexual relationship with
President Clinton was not officially filed until after Jordan had
arranged a job for her with Revlon in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It took months, but those ugly clouds of insinuation were blown
away by the facts. For starters, Lewinsky's grand jury testimony is
radically different from what is known about her statements to
Linda Tripp. Involving Jordan in her famous job search turns out to
have been her own idea, long before she was on the Jones case's
horizon. She lied both to Jordan and to Carter about her
relationship with the president (just as Clinton technically lied
to Jordan). And Carter's timing in filing the Lewinsky affidavit
turns out to have had nothing to do with her Revlon job.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the facts, Starr's referral to the House continues the
smear. Sometimes using selected quotes from the obviously
discredited Tripp tapes, sometimes throwing in gratuitous or
unrebutted remarks from Lewinsky's grand jury testimony to
insinuate what he doesn't dare allege. Most of the sourcing in his
so-called ``narrative'' wouldn't pass editorial muster at a
supermarket tabloid.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the yearlong smears of good men with impeccable
standing around here, Starr's misbehavior in just this one element
of the case illustrates what a minefield a genuine impeachment
inquiry could become.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to stimulate press accounts and talk show
shouting matches. It is something else again to make a credible
case worthy of a constitutional process about anything more than
inexcusable, reckless sexual activity and an effort to keep it
secret that included lying.

   ``It's more of a morale booster, in some respects,'' he says. He
paraphrases the typical one- or two-paragraph e-mail letter he
sends his wife: ```The weather here has been nice, Adam got two
hits last night and made a great play behind the plate. But they
lost.' Then, a few little tidbits about what's coming up for
tomorrow, and I'll tell her when a good time to call would be.'' He
gets the same kind of e-mail in return, since ``she's incredibly
busy,'' says Lorang. ```Got your note, hotter than hell here but
then again I haven't been out long enough. Thanks for the e-mail
and tell Adam better luck at the game next time.'''

   Couples say e-marriage correspondence tends to fall into one of
three general categories, representing a hierarchy of communication
needs. At the lowest level is domestic business. (As in: Have you
paid the mortgage, when are you coming home, have you fed the dog?)
At the next level is news exchange (itals)(``Tonight I am having 6
people over for dinner. Naturally, I have made spaghetti sauce, my
standard,''(unitals) as Maggie Huff-Rousselle wrote one day to her
husband.)
</P>
<P>
   At the deepest level is intimate, emotional e-mail communication
that, ideally, sustains the fabric of the relationship.

   Helen Palmer to husband Joshua Rifkin:
</P>
<P>
   Hi _ as you know I'm a klutz and incompetent when it comes to
technology _ but I really wanted to let you know that I'm thinking
of you as I sit at my desk. This office is frigid _ 65F _ though I
have the thermostat up to 85!

   Joshua Rifkin to Helen Palmer:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; One good greeting deserves another. It's now 5.13 in the
morning on Thursday. Monday, still on English time, I also woke up
at about this time. Have fun reading this in the privacy of your
cold office, which I hope these words can warm up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But e-mail can be fraught with pitfalls, couples say. It is hard
to distinguish brevity from irritation. It's difficult, in e-mail,
to convey inflection.
</P>
<P>
   And without the reassurance of a daily presence, even
computer-aided separations can amplify insecurities and other
anxieties. (itals)``I hope you're not feeling so lonely that you'll
start a cyber affair,'' reads one Huff-Rousselle communication.
``You must have got my message about the frequent flyer miles, but
you didn't say anything back.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   E-mail is ``cold in the way text is cold,'' says McLaughlin at
Harvard, who had a two-year e-mail relationship with a woman in
another city. ``It's no substitute for some of the other senses,
for being physically in the same place. A voice can convey passion
and emotion in a way that text just can't. There is an energy that
can be missing from e-mail, even if it's convincing in an
intellectual way.''
</P>
<P>
   This is why bicoastal couple Doug McCasland and Virginia Reuter
tend to sprinkle their e-mails with endearments _ ``as a sort of
replacement for an affectionate tone of voice,'' says Reuter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  McLaughlin believes there is a richness and value to e-mail
that hasn't yet been been widely appreciated. He and his
ex-girlfriend kept a journal of their e-mail letters, which they
eventually bound into a volume ``as a record of our relationship.
It was very moving,'' he says. ``It traces everything from the
giddiest early stages to the demise of the relationship in gory
detail, but beautifully so.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  E-mail, he believes, ``is qualitatively different from other
forms of communication _ better in some respects and shallower in
some,'' he says. ``It's no substitute for hearing the quiet voice
of the other person. But you can sit down and spend some time
writing out your thoughts carefully, and speak in a more considered
fashion. It is really quite powerful to receive a page of
beautifully expressed thoughts and reflections.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some believe that e-mail has the potential to be a
parallel mode of communication even for couples living in the same
city.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, an administrator at Tufts University, says she
frequently e-mails her husband during the working day to process
the minutiae of married life _ weekend plans, children's
appointments, and other details that they are too busy or tired to
deal with in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We depend on this. We get a lot of work done that way,'' said
the administrator, who asked not to use her name because she
e-mails from work. ``It's a tension for employees that you can be
audited and have all your messages thrown in your face.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``You can see the power and uniqueness of e-mail,'' says
Sherry Turkle, who teaches the sociology of science at MIT and is
the author of ``Life On the Screen: Identity in the Age of the
Internet.''
</P>

   ``I see it in people who live together and see each other often.

communication but with a little bit of distance.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  In the case of some commuting couples, of course, there can
be too much distance. Just ask Mainen, sender of that e-mail

AMERICA'S NO. 1 CAD 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After all the buildup about President Clinton's
four hours of videotaped testimony before the Starr grand jury, now
we know the truth: Bill Clinton is a cad.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't depend on what the meaning of ``is'' is. He is a cad,
and always was.
</P>
<P>
   I watched all four hours and three minutes of the president's
testimony. The most shocking thing to me was his testimony about
his gifts to Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had given me a particularly nice book for Christmas, an
antique book on the presidency,'' Clinton said. ``I just thought I
ought to get up a few things and give them to her before she
left.''
</P>
<P>
   Listen to this master of the language. He thought he'd ``get
up'' a few things for her, perhaps pulling that $3 hat pin, $5 gold
brooch or $50 Rockettes blanket out of the drawer filled with the
gifts a president receives.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky sent a warm thank-you letter. Clinton sent her a note
saying, ``Hillary and I send our best wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton is a cad. That leaves only the question of whether
being a cad is a high crime or misdemeanor, and if the Republicans
dare impeach him for it. They have more than their share of cads in
their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Already the right wing is beating the drums of culture wars.
It's Bill's boomer generation vs. middle America, according to Pat
Buchanan, who seems to have forgotten that Clinton went to Oxford,
not Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition has said that since so many people
support Clinton, there must be something wrong with their family
values. So I thought I'd give my family a call. They're Democrats,
and still have their values.
</P>
<P>
   ``As your mother, Robbie, I wouldn't let you watch this,'' said
my mother, a salt-of-the-earth New Englander.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad I didn't think of calling earlier and having her
write a note to my editor asking to have me excused.
</P>
<P>
   My father said he'd watched much of the tape while eating in the
``99'' restaurant in Mashpee, Mass., near their home on Cape Cod.
My mom had better things to do, like go to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several TVs in the restaurant, and there must have
been 30 people in there, but nobody was watching it,'' my father
said. ``Every so often people would look up, but they'd say they
didn't understand what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   My dad and I could follow the tape because we'd done a lot of
homework. Besides, we're worried about what's happening to the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a tragedy that Bill Clinton has thrown his opponents
so much ammunition,'' my dad said. ``He's given new life to all
these awful people. ... You don't want the Christian Coalition
owning your life. They're a disgrace to Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to come from a truly religious family.
</P>
<P>
   Even though my father is a politics junkie, I doubt he would
have watched much Clinton testimony if he hadn't been at a
restaurant. He's a master with the remote, and would have found
``MASH'' reruns or played his tapes of old Red Sox games.
</P>
<P>
   That grand jury testimony was easily the most boring salacious
video ever made. But in a way, I'm glad I didn't get that note from
my mother and miss those four hours and three minutes of videotape.
It was interesting to hear what Kenneth Starr thought would shock
us.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't hear explicit language, as electronic stores like the
Circuit City in Concord, Calif., feared when they wouldn't allow
their TVs to be tuned to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the language was maddeningly inexplicit. Once-plain
words like ``alone,'' ``sex,'' ``affair'' and ``is'' turned out not
to mean anything, as Clinton twisted in his windiness.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't see a different Bill Clinton, as advertised. It was
the same articulate, media-wise Bill, but he had a grim, seething
quality, and clearly was afraid of stepping into a perjury trap.
</P>
<P>
   Was Clinton dodging the questions? You bet. Clinton even said he
had no interest in helping his legal enemies by doing a better job
of answering bad questions. Now that was honest.
</P>
<P>
   Was the Starr prosecution team a band of sex-obsessed
inquisitors? That's the way it seemed. By their tone and their
questions, they also seem obsessed with getting Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As my father said, ``The whole thing is degrading. The president
of the United States, a graduate of Yale Law School, has to be
interrogated about whether he knows what it means to be put under
oath.''
</P>
<P>
   It is degrading, and it is very bad family television. My family
watched Watergate, the Iran-contra hearings and Lyndon Johnson's
speech withdrawing from the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   All were important moments in TV. All involved presidents who
lied about big things, such as black-bag jobs on opponents and fake
torpedo boat attacks on American ships in the Gulf of Tonkin. Even
good old Dwight Eisenhower baldly lied about a spy plane being shot
down over the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Once we had presidents who lied operatically, and got away with
it. Now we have a president whose lies are as tinny as his
policies, and for that he's dragged through our living rooms by a
grand inquisitor.
</P>
<P>
   Who were these disembodied voices asking Clinton questions on
the tape? We never even saw the inquisitor's helpers asking the
questions. I can imagine what they looked like, though.
</P>
<P>
   They were running around naked, sticking out their tongues and
rolling around in mud.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it was the only thing left to the imagination.
</P>

POETICALLY EXAMINING PROZAC'S PARADOX

PROZAC DIARY 
By Lauren Slater 
Random House, 203 pp., $21.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A funny book about Prozac? That seems a conceptual stretch,
especially from a young author who is as candid about the pitfalls
of taking Prozac _ including writer's block and sexual dysfunction
_ as she is about the drug's psychologically liberating properties.
</P>
<P>
   Humor, however, turns out to be one of the chief virtues of
Lauren Slater's ``Prozac Diary,'' which takes up roughly where the
critically acclaimed ``Welcome to My Country,'' her first book
about her battle with mental illness, left off. Material that might
be cloying or self-pitying in the hands of a lesser writer sparkles
with originality in hers. A treatise on psychopharmacology (``the
one branch of medicine where there is no need for intimacy,''
writes Slater) becomes a bittersweet love story about A Woman and
Her Pill. The real-life love story of the author and her boyfriend,
a chemist, inspires a hilarious episode concerning homeopathy and
codependence.
</P>
<P>
   Slater even leaps from a sober meditation on frigidity to the
notion that Prozac could be the ultimate tool for radical feminists
_ freeing heterosexual women from the tyranny of libido by
rendering men, well, useless. Elsewhere, she recounts a furious
exchange with her doctor after the drug's potency has inexplicably
worn off. Well, the physician suggests, it must be a case of
``Prozac poop-out.'' Slater: ```Prozac poop-out?' I said. `You've
got to be kidding me.' I was taking a drug with a prostate problem,
a drug with sexual dysfunction ...'' Finding such humor amid a
harrowing relapse speaks strongly to Slater's writerly instincts.
</P>
<P>
   In her other life, Slater, a psychologist with degrees from
Harvard and Boston University, runs an outpatient clinic in East
Boston. Between the ages of 14 and 24, however, she was
hospitalized five times for depression and obsessive-compulsive
disorder. An anorexic, she still bears the scars of having sliced
herself with razor blades. Until she found Prozac, Slater had never
had a steady boyfriend or a normal relationship with food or a
semblance of a vocation, other than writing poetry and short
stories.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1988, she was given the potent antidepressant that had
just hit the market. Slater began with 20 milligrams daily; she
would wind up with a prescription for four times that dosage. Her
initial reaction was so overwhelmingly positive that her doctor
doubted it could be real. She felt high, Slater writes _ acid-trip
high. A brave new world opened up to her: first through real estate
magazines and open houses, then bar drinks, home cooking, and ATM
machines. She was a 26-year-old with ``the judgment of an early
adolescent,'' as she describes it. Meeting a stranger at a rock
concert, she follows him to a park and reluctantly has sex with
him. With her liberation come dangers for which Slater is totally
unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Prozac has replaced writing as her one true love.
She gets a job teaching literacy skills to immigrants. She gains
acceptance to graduate school. From small triumphs _ keeping an
apartment, managing a checkbook _ she moves on to far greater ones.
Meanwhile, she finds herself surrendering to the drug's deeper
spiritual and philosophical mysteries. ``Secretly,'' writes Slater,
``I started to fear a nuclear war only for the effects it would
have on the pharmacies.''
</P>
<P>
   Each step forward is dogged by doubt, however. Illness has been
so strong a component of her identity that its absence causes
Slater to panic. Her intellectual affinity for philosophers and
theologians causes Slater to liken Prozac to a ``Zen drug'' and
herself to a Buddhist novitiate: another side effect not advertised
by the drug's manufacturer, Eli Lilly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Prozac has made me into a nun,'' the author worries,
``or a nurse, or worse, a Calgon Lady.'' She contests Peter
Kramer's assertion in ``Listening to Prozac'' that the drug makes
its users ``better than well.'' Instead, Slater suggests, Prozac is
more like ``psychotropic Drano'' _ a remedy that trades higher
functioning for addiction and the frustrating loss of creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prozac Diary'' is made up of notes and journal entries, scraps
of memory, and letters to Slater's doctor. The collage effect
notwithstanding, the book is tightly bound by its humor and
intelligence. Slater's writing is confessional without being
sentimental, honest without being overbearing.
</P>
<P>
   While she has tried to wean herself off Prozac, Slater still
depends on it, she writes, to get along with her life and career.
On good days, she calculates, that means functioning at 70 percent
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prozac is a medicine that takes much away,'' the author
concludes, ``but its very presence in my life has been about
preserving as well as decaying.''
</P>
<P>
   With wit and courage, she makes that presence felt.

BOSTON SEEKS OPTIONS FOR ITS OLDER STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY   AND JORDANA HART  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON - Boston High School student Michelle Kilgoe has learned
to ignore the taunts from classmates when she takes her seat: What
kind of 20-year-old is still in 12th grade?
</P>
<P>
   Kilgoe, a three-time dropout with a toddler, says she is
determined to finish school. To her, a General Equivalency Diploma
is ``nothing. So she, along with almost 2,500 other 19- to
23-year-olds, attends Boston public school classes with students as
much as eight years younger.
</P>
<P>
   Few of these older regular- or bilingual-education students ever
graduate. Most simply drift in and out of school until they become
too old and embarrassed to show up, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Some are there as a condition of parole or probation; others are
immigrants and may not even be literate in their own language.
Most, however, have simply been held back year after year. Almost
all need expensive services, such as counseling and intensive
academic help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep down, a lot of these kids know they need to get a diploma
to succeed,'' said Boston High headmaster Thomas Hennessey. ``But
somewhere along the line they self-destruct. A lot of them stay
because their friends are here, they feel safe ... they are afraid
to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the high number of older students in Boston, School
Superintendent Thomas W. Payzant worries that money is being
misspent by trying to graduate some of them from a traditional high
school. He is organizing a task force to look at other ways to
educate the older students _ perhaps through ``bridge'' programs
that link to community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I worked in several large urban school districts,
I've never seen as many 19-, 20- and 21-year-olds in a district as
in Boston,'' said Payzant. ``Are these students best served in a
comprehensive high school?''
</P>
<P>
   Last year there were five high school sophomores in the city who
were 23 _ the age by which many adults have already graduated from
college. Altogether, there are almost 1,000 Boston public school
students age 20 or over _ and about 60 percent of them are still
not seniors.
</P>
<P>
   School officials can't simply push these students out the door
because the state, like most in the nation, has no age cap for high
school. The older students could attend adult education or GED
classes _ but many say they want to finish in a traditional high
school because the diploma means more.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a 26-year-old woman asked to be admitted to Brighton
High. School officials dissuaded her, but no law says she couldn't
go.
</P>
<P>
   Older students say they should be admired, not criticized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard sometimes. People say stuff,'' said Kilgoe in an
interview before her creative writing class at Boston High last
week. Most of her classmates are 17 and 18. Having little in common
with them, she keeps mostly to herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I've had so many chances. But I know a lot of kids who
don't even want to go to school. I'm determined to walk across that
stage,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kilgoe was a junior at English High when she became pregnant at
age 18, 2 1/2 years ago. She dropped out and had the baby. After
that she attempted to start school at Boston High two other times,
but day care problems and a lack of motivation, among other things,
forced her out again, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kilgoe and most older students say they feel out of place in a
regular high school and spend as little time there as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard,'' said Claudio Brandao, a 19-year-old junior
at Boston High. Coming here from Cape Verde in 1991, he has dropped
out of school three times, each time to go back to Cape Verde. His
father wants him to quit school and get a job. But Brandao says he
needs a diploma to ``get a good job, to get into the Navy, for
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The state does not track students by age and does not know how
many 19-, 20-, and 21-year-olds are still in high school statewide.
But the issue appears most acute in Boston. Superintendents
elsewhere say they have some older students, but the numbers are
insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   School attendance in Massachusetts is compulsory from age 6 to
16, but it is up to local school committees to decide how long they
are willing to educate a child beyond that, according to the state
Department of Education. Few districts, if any, have an age cap.
And a 1990 state memorandum to school districts, underscoring the
federal law requiring school districts to educate special-needs
students at least until they turn 22, added that to deny schooling
to other older students would leave a district ``vulnerable to a
legal challenge by an aggrieved student.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, however, the number of older students represents a
major expense. On average, it costs $6,349 a year to educate a
regular-education student in Boston, and $1,000 more for a
bilingual student, meaning the cost this year of educating Boston's
2,459 students 19 and older who are not classified as special-needs
will be more than $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Older students say they are often embarrassed by their age and
want alternative programs, but not the equivalency diplomas that
lack the reputation of a regular high school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Interim state Education Commissioner David Driscoll, like many
school administrators, said he would not support a cutoff age for
high school attendance. But he would like to see a variety of
alternatives for students who have a checkered academic history.
</P>
<P>
   Boston High's Hennessey agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easiest thing would be to get rid of these students,'' he
said. ``They will leave if you tell them to. But there is nothing
out there for them without a diploma other than dead-end stuff. So
we try to hold on to them as long as we can.''

CITIZENSHIP A DREAM DELAYED FOR IMMIGRANT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Rakhil Shchuchinskaya fled the German siege of
Leningrad during World War II in a horse-drawn cart, lived in a
remote barracks after the war, did not attend synagogue for fear of
Soviet authorities, and was harassed because she is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Now this 67-year-old immigrant, a pediatrician in her homeland,
lives in a Brighton high-rise with views of the Back Bay and
Cambridge that are nearly as stunning as the success that her
family has fashioned in their adopted country.
</P>
<P>
   But Shchuchinskaya still lacks something that she says would
make her life complete _ American citizenship. Since she applied in
early 1997, the Immigration and Naturalization Service has asked
three times for fingerprints that must be cleared by the FBI before
she can be invited to take the Oath of Allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   The INS lost one pair of prints, never informed her of the
disappearance, and continued to request a new set despite
Shchuchinskaya's medically verified statement that she could not
produce good fingerprints because of a skin condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this country. I see it is very good,'' said
Shchuchinskaya, who immigrated to the United States in 1992 with
refugee status. ``I can live here and be happy. But I want to be
equal.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, sister, and brother-in-law have all become
citizens. Her nephew is an anesthesiologist on the North Shore; her
daughter an IBM employee in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know life; I understand they have much work,''
Shchuchinskaya said of the INS. ``But maybe they have to have more
clever people and try harder to help people.''
</P>
<P>
   Shchuchinskaya's wait comes at a time of record applications for
citizenship. Nearly 1.6 million such requests were received
nationwide in fiscal 1997, an increase of 29 percent over the
previous year, according to the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee
Advocacy Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boston INS district, which encompasses much of New
England, there are 32,000 pending applications, according to
district director Steven J. Farquharson.
</P>
<P>
   That backlog means a prospective citizen here waits an average
of 16 months from filing to naturalization, Farquharson said. Add
to that delay a drastic change in the way fingerprints are
processed for the INS, and Shchuchinskaya's anxiety seems
well-founded, Farquharson said.
</P>
<P>
   As Shchuchinskaya.neared the five years of residency needed to
become a citizen, she submitted her application in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, the INS responded that her fingerprints were not
adequate. Shchuchinskaya submitted a new set with a doctor's letter
explaining that her eczema prevented high-quality prints.
</P>
<P>
   By February of this year, Shchuchinskaya had not heard back from
the INS. She appeared at the office to inquire about her status and
was told to place her question in a box. A subsequent INS letter
told Shchuchinskaya that her case was pending and to call in three
to four months.
</P>
<P>
   In June, when she checked back, the case was still declared
pending. Again, she was told to wait another 90 to 120 days.
</P>
<P>
   With this discouraging news, Shchuchinskaya's sister contacted
the FBI, which said its agents had never received the prints.
Another call to the INS office confirmed that they had been lost.
</P>
<P>
   A third set of fingerprints was forwarded in June. On Sept. 11,
Shchuchinskaya was informed that they had been received.
</P>
<P>
   Farquharson said he will give the case his personal attention.
All INS officers in Boston, he added, will be devoting at least two
months this fall exclusively to processing naturalization
applications.
</P>
<P>
   For Shchuchinskaya, the work cannot begin too soon. Although she
suffered religious insults and deprivation in her native St.
Petersburg, she is not satisfied merely to enjoy the comforts of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life, I wasn't equal with other people,''
Shchuchinskaya said. ``Now, I want to be equal.''

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; PITTSFIELD, Mass. _ Small things, like a perfectly executed
double steal, will be missed most. The crack of the bat. The
plastic, pigeon-scaring owls in the rafters. The delays as a fiery
sun sets in center field. Peanut shells on the worn floorboards of
the box seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's truly a magic here,'' said Kevin O'Hara of Pittsfield,
a zealous fan of the minor league Mets, who appear ready to pack
their bags for good. ``You're so close to the action that a good
pickpocket could lift the batting glove from the on-deck batter's
pants. The beauty and the memories that this little music box of a
park has brought to our lives will be sorely missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-one years after Walter O'Malley's Dodgers abandoned Ebbets
Field for Los Angeles' Chavez Ravine, professional baseball is
poised to return to Brooklyn, N.Y., at the expense of this
down-on-its-luck city in the Berkshires.
</P>
<P>
   And the thought of an empty Wahconah Park _ Pittsfield's
79-year-old venerable ball yard with quirky dimensions and a rich
history _ is evoking emotions approaching those felt in Brooklyn in
1957 when the zany Dodgers turned out the lights and boarded the
train for the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like someone in your family died,'' said Marty Adler of
Brooklyn, who maintains a hall of fame to the Brooklyn Dodgers and
is jubilant at the idea of professional baseball on Coney Island.
``I feel sorry for Pittsfield because I know how they feel. I'm
sure there are people there who define their whole day on the
success of that team. And now their whole day is shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome the team, but feel sorry for the fans they left
behind. But what are you going to do? What are you going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   What Pittsfield is doing is preparing for summer nights without
games against the Lowell Spinners, the Oneonta (N.Y.) Yankees, or
the Batavia (N.Y.) Muck Dogs _ sultry evenings when the beer garden
down the right-field line will be empty and the chance for free
pizza for everyone will no longer hinge on one fan's ability to
catch three consecutive pop flies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably as enjoyable a baseball experience as a fan
could ask for,'' said Bill Mesick, vice president of the Pittsfield
Mets fan club. ``You're right there with the players. You can hear
the arguments with the umpire _ juicy words and all. This place is
historic. A lot of great players have played here. I wish they
would just jack that stadium up, renovate it, and put it right back
down again.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not going to happen. The team's owners have made it
plain that they need a new facility if they're going to stay here.
And there seems little chance of that happening. Pittsfield Mayor
Gerald S. Doyle Jr., through a spokesman, said the situation is out
of his control. He said he expects the team to honor its licensing
agreement, which calls for the team to play here at least through
the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced last week that his
city had reached a deal in principle with the Mets to move their
single-A minor league club from here to a new, $20 million stadium
to be built on the site of an abandoned amusement area on Coney
Island.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is not final yet. The Yankees could reject the
move of a minor league team into their territory. But, club
officials say, it is increasingly likely that the Mets will depart
Wahconah Park after next year's season.
</P>
<P>
   William L. Gladstone, the minor league Mets president, said that
like the Dodgers, who were willing to stay in Brooklyn if they got
land for a new stadium, the Mets would like to stay here. But the
facilities _ spartan clubhouses, and insufficient lighting _ are
substandard, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful old playing field and the scene is
beautifully bucolic,'' said Gladstone, a Brooklyn native who
purchased the team in 1992 for $850,000 with four other investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``But from a fan's point of view, it's not a comfortable
stadium. The bathroom facilities are pretty bad,'' he said.
``Still, it's a charming place to see a baseball game. We've shown
more loyalty to Pittsfield than any of our predecessors and some
people appreciated it, which doesn't mean they won't be mad as hell
when we leave _ or if we leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Mets' 10-year stay at Wahconah Park has made them
the longest hometown team since the Pittsfield Hillies ended their
17th season here in 1930. Since then, a succession of bush league
clubs have come and gone, wearing the uniforms of the Electrics,
the Indians, the Red Sox, the Senators, the Rangers, the Brewers,
and the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   From seats as close as 40 feet away from the action, fans
through the years have watched former Red Sox first baseman George
Scott send towering home runs over the center-field fence, whose
due-west orientation occasionally forces only-in-Pittsfield delays
at blinding sunsets.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, players such as Lou Gehrig, Rafael Palmeiro,
Mark Grace, and Greg Maddux have laced up their cleats in
Wahconah's dank locker rooms and thrilled the fans, who pay $2.75
for general admission and $1.25 for a snow cone.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's like going to Fenway Park on a smaller scale,''
said Jacko Furey, 60, a Pittsfield native and longtime Mets fan.
``It would be a big loss. I know the kids love it there. They get
to see the future stars. A lot of summer nights, it'll be empty
with no games to go to. Last year, I'll tell you, it was just great
when we took the championship. It's pure baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The team drew 84,323 fans this year, the most since 1992. The
tally makes it the sixth most popular of 14 teams in the New
York-Penn League. ``We offer a lot of charm,'' said team spokesman
Ethan Wilson. ``But charm can only go so far and last for only so
many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Pratt, pulling draughts at nearby Pepe's tavern, a
post-game hangout, said that if the Mets leave, it will be another
blow to a city that already has absorbed too many of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Electric pulled out about 10 years ago,'' said Pratt.
``Now we've got the PCB issue. The department store (the former
England Bros.) is empty. This was the only positive thing that we
had going here. It's going to be a void.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pittsfield is a baseball city, Pratt and his customers
insisted on a warm afternoon last week. And, like Brooklyn, they
will hunt for another franchise that will spark standing ovations
and affordable family entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice to Pittsfield is not to give up hope and keep trying
to get another team,'' said Paul Montanaro of Brooklyn, a
long-suffering Dodger fan who is anxious for professional baseball
to return to his native Brooklyn. ``That's what we did all these
years and see what's happening now? We're back in the baseball
business.''

CONSUMMATE PERFORMER AWAITING HIS REVIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A deceiver Bill Clinton undoubtedly is and perhaps not a
deceiver alone but a perjurer as well, depending, of course, on the
many subtle shades of meaning that evidently attach themselves to
words like ``is'' and ``alone.''
</P>
<P>
   But semantic uncertainties aside, another thing was also clear
Monday in Clinton's videotaped testimony: MondayHe remains a
consummate political performer, capable of gaining an audience's
sympathy, even while trying to hide in a fog of cleverly chosen
words.
</P>
<P>
   In a situation unimaginably stressful, Clinton proved once again
that he is in a league of his own when playing to a larger
audience. And, as his own comments make clear, there's little doubt
that Clinton suspected that his testimony would eventually be made
public, even when he gave it on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the four-hour session, Clinton's answers were aimed
not so much at the prosecutors who have pursued him for years or
even the grand jury, but rather at the country itself.
</P>
<P>
   Forget all the spin from before the video's release about an
enraged president losing his temper, quarreling with his
inquisitors, ripping his microphone off, and abruptly demanding
breaks. For almost the entire four hours, Clinton hit just the
right notes: contrite, sorrowful, empathic, and eager for
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of making his own case, this was a far better
performance than the president's angry speech to the nation later
the same day, in which he lashed out at prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In word and tone, in body language and gesture, he seemed
occasionally ashamed, often apologetic, sometimes pained, annoyed,
reluctant.
</P>
<P>
   But the overall impression he conveyed was of a man making a
good-faith effort to answer questions, even while trying to salvage
a shred of personal dignity for himself and his family.
</P>
<P>
   There was no window into the angry inner psyche of a master
manipulator. Instead, what viewers saw was the Clinton they have
come to know, a man likable even as he misleads, someone many
Americans find appealing despite a long history of troubling
personal conduct. Despite a bout or two of finger-wagging and a
couple of flashes of anger, Clinton was polite even to his
inquisitors, treating them, in the main, more respectfully than
they treated him.
</P>
<P>
   He was disrespectful only to plain-spoken truth. But since
little by way of revelation came from his videotaped performance,
the effect was to let the president sugarcoat apparent (and in some
cases admitted) evasions, to plead a faulty memory, and to
interject explanations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton haters, of course, will have plenty of fuel for their
rage, while others now have proof for their long-held suspicions
about the evasiveness that seems to run to the core of his
character.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the president's much--remarked-upon ability to
compartmentalize his job and troubles and thus keep his calm under
fire. As Monday's videotaped testimony shows, what's truly
extraordinary is his ability to compartmentalize, categorize, and
qualify the truth.
</P>
<P>
   For example, many find it laughable that the president _ even as
he did not deny that Lewinsky performed oral sex on him _ could
still maintain that he had no ``sexual relations'' with her. The
same is true of his assertion that he tried to be truthful, though
not unnecessarily helpful, in denying a sexual relationship with
Lewinsky when deposed in the sexual-harassment lawsuit brought by
Paula Corbin Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Equally incredible was his contention that Monica Lewinsky's
deposition, as paraphrased by Clinton lawyor Robert Bennett, could
have been entirely truthful in contending that ``there is
absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, shape, or form, with
President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, actually, in the present tense, that's an accurate
statement,'' said Clinton. He later elaborated: ``It depends on
what the meaning of the word `is' means. If `is' means is, and
never has been, that's one thing. If it means there is none, that
was a completely true statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton displayed the same relativistic approach to truth when
prosecutors asked, ``Do you agree with me that the statement, `I
was never alone with her,' is incorrect? You were alone with Monica
Lewinsky, weren't you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, again, it depends on how you define alone,'' the
president replied.
</P>
<P>
   And so it went. But to what end?
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the airing of Clinton's four-hour testimony,
broadcast outlets periodically flashed the day's stock-market
fluctuations, as though the market was an EKG monitoring the
presidential pulse.
</P>
<P>
   In a way it is. The market, as it happens, dived as Clinton's
testimony began, but wound up ahead for the day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Content with the economy, Americans seem forgiving of their
tremendously talented, but terribly flawed, chief executive.
Indeed, polls show that despite what they now know about Clinton,
most Americans still approve of the job he is doing and hope he
remains in office.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to think that anything that average voters saw Monday
will change their minds.

THE WEB OF LIES BEHIND STARR'S SMEAR CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- While would-be drama critics dispute the value of
actually seeing and hearing President Clinton's grand jury
testimony yesterday, those who sift through real evidence can spend
much more rewarding hours.
</P>
<P>
   Just for example, three things are crystal clear from material
now on the public record as well as from halfhearted admissions and
omissions from independent counsel Kenneth Starr's argumentative
referral to the House of Representatives:
</P>
<P>
   _Starr's office smeared prominent attorney and presidential
friend Vernon E. Jordan Jr. to hoodwink Attorney General Janet Reno
into getting his jurisdiction expanded to include the Monica
Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   _Starr's office then smeared Jordan, along with the first
Lewinsky lawyer, Francis D. Carter, in order to give his
investigation juice with the press.
</P>
<P>
   _And while he has backed away from both those lawyers because
his investigation yielded not a credible shred of evidence against
these men (in fact, it produced the opposite), Starr's office
continues to use the smear to avoid owning up to an unconscionable
act of defamation.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the evidence as compiled and released so far
shows how Starr's office created the blatantly false impression of
a broad and deep conspiracy to suborn perjury and obstruct justice
to provide a legitimate-appearing cover for a grubby tale of a
president fooling around with a 21-year-old White House intern and
then trying to keep his conduct from his family and the country.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's pitch to Reno was that he should get the Lewinsky case
because the intimations of coverup from Lewinsky's rantings on the
famous Linda Tripp tape recordings were similar to his ongoing
probe of onetime Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell and
that there was an ``overlap'' with ``potential subjects and
witnesses,'' specifically Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Baloney. Starr called a zillion people before grand juries here
and in Little Rock. Hubbell had become a cooperating witness after
pleading guilty to defrauding his onetime Little Rock law partners,
and Starr didn't like what Hubbell told him. So he minutely
examined the Clintonites (Jordan was one of them) who helped
Hubbell find work during the period when he was protesting his
innocence to the world and who ceased helping him after he
confessed. Not one witness statement or document ever indicated
that the job search was anything more than well-connected friends
helping a false friend.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, didn't stop Starr from insinuating otherwise and
then using unchecked babble by Lewinsky on some of the Tripp tapes
to double the smear via the press.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, when the Lewinsky story broke in January, Starr's
office, with extra help from onetime Tripp literary agent Lucianne
Goldberg, put out investigative material to the effect that
Lewinsky was heard on the tapes telling Tripp that Jordan had
``instructed her to lie'' (ABC News) and that she discussed perjury
in his car on the way to meet her lawyer, Frank Carter (The
Washington Post). In subsequent leaks, stories were floated that
she had made sure her affidavit denying a sexual relationship with
President Clinton was not officially filed until after Jordan had
arranged a job for her with Revlon in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It took months, but those ugly clouds of insinuation were blown
away by the facts. For starters, Lewinsky's grand jury testimony is
radically different from what is known about her statements to
Linda Tripp. Involving Jordan in her famous job search turns out to
have been her own idea, long before she was on the Jones case's
horizon. She lied both to Jordan and to Carter about her
relationship with the president (just as Clinton technically lied
to Jordan). And Carter's timing in filing the Lewinsky affidavit
turns out to have had nothing to do with her Revlon job.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the facts, Starr's referral to the House continues the
smear. Sometimes using selected quotes from the obviously
discredited Tripp tapes, sometimes throwing in gratuitous or
unrebutted remarks from Lewinsky's grand jury testimony to
insinuate what he doesn't dare allege. Most of the sourcing in his
so-called ``narrative'' wouldn't pass editorial muster at a
supermarket tabloid.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the yearlong smears of good men with impeccable
standing around here, Starr's misbehavior in just this one element
of the case illustrates what a minefield a genuine impeachment
inquiry could become.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to stimulate press accounts and talk show
shouting matches. It is something else again to make a credible
case worthy of a constitutional process about anything more than
inexcusable, reckless sexual activity and an effort to keep it
secret that included lying.

NUANCE ON THE NET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA MATCHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jonathan Zittrain, executive director of the Berkman Center for
Internet and Society at Harvard Law School, maintains computer
communication is most effective when ``it's between two people with
a strong nuanced e-mail relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   But how do you convey nuance on a computer screen? Below, some
tips proffered by experienced e-mailers:
</P>
<P>
   --To convey anger: Use bold face or upper case lettering, or
lots of exclamation points. Being parsimonious with words can help.
</P>
<P>
   --To convey affection. Use X's and O's, or pet names, or
romantic text art, like flowers. You can utilize smiley faces,
though they are considered by some to be out of vogue. Beyond that,
``people are free to write haikus or whatever,'' offers Zittrain.
</P>
<P>
   --To flirt: Cute nicknames are useful. Concentrate on your
saluations (openings and closings): try matching the style of your
sign-off to that of your partner's greeting, or better yet,
one-upping it. ``If go one step and it's not reciprocated, consider
it a rebuff,'' says New York scientist Zachary Mainen, who has had
a long-term, long-distance e-mail relationship.  &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   --To pine away: Difficult to do via e-mail, ``other than various
versions of ``I miss you a lot,'' says Mainen.
</P>
<P>
   --To show surprise: Gasp! ...............thud.
</P>
<P>
   --To send high-tech greetings: Most mail programs, like the ones
incorporated into web browsers, will let you send graphics, voice
and even video clips in e-mail. A traditionalist could write a love
letter in his or her own hand-writing, then scan it into his
machine and send the resulting graphic as e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   E-lovers with a microphone and a sound card can mail each
other's spoken messages or mood music. Those with digital cameras
or video can send up-to-the-minute still pictures or movies.

MARRIED, WITH E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA MATCHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zachary Mainen, a New York neuroscientist, was trying to sustain
a long-distance relationship with a woman who lived in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   When her birthday rolled around, he did what any modern-day
lover on a limited budget would do. He sent her a bouquet of e-mail
roses, constructed of computer screen letters and numbers.  &UR;  &LR;  ``I
suppose if you look at it on the negative side, you can say it's
just cheap,'' says Mainen.
</P>
<P>
   But if you look at it on the positive side, you can say it's
just an adaptive solution to a contemporary domestic dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   At a time in American economic life when job demands have forced
numerous couples to live in different places, at least some of the
time, the definition of what it means to be in each other's company
is being radically stretched. Many couples are turning to e-mail
communication as a way to keep the passions going, the domestic
front stable, the news exchanged, and the phone bills down.
</P>
<P>
   Call these text-based relationships e-love. Or, in many cases,
e-marriage.
</P>
<P>
   And while e-mail has its limitations _ it's slower than a phone
call, it lacks inflection, it's easily misconstrued, it drives
employers nuts _ for many, many geographically separated couples,
it is ``like smoking the crack pipe of relationships,'' says Andrew
McLaughlin, a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society
at Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need that daily fix of words. You can't stop. It is the
fuel that keeps relationships going.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
From: Peter Huff-Rousselle &QL; 
To: Maggie Huff-Rousselle &QL; 
Subject: Still hoping to hear your voice sometime! &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hi, Lover!
</P>
<P>
   The problem you had with WORD sounds like a similar weird thing
that happened to me ... Send me the file as an attachment and let
me check it out for you.
</P>
<P>
   Do you still love me? I tried to imagine you falling for someone
else while I was gone for so long, but I couldn't. ... You're
always on my mind ...
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's one-half of a typical e-mail exchange between Peter and
Maggie Huff-Rousselle, formerly of Brookline, Mass. and now of No
Fixed Address. Maggie, 50, a health care management consultant for
several Third World countries, is working on a project in Phnom
Penh, Cambodia. Peter, 54, a retired health care administrator,
stayed behind in the Caribbean island of St. Lucia, site of
Maggie's last project, to prepare the couple's boat for a
transatlantic sailing trip.
</P>
<P>
   Exchanging megabytes of e-mail ``has made all the difference in
the world,'' says Peter, during a telephone interview from Quebec,
where the two recently vacationed. ``Without e-mail I can't imagine
what I would have done. I would have gone crazy feeling completely
disconnected from Maggie.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple has plenty of cybercompany, such as Doug McCasland
and Virginia Reuter, recently married. He does computer work at
Fidelity Investments in Boston, she has a job in San Francisco.
``We e-mail each other every day, sometimes several times a day,''
says Reuter, &UR;  &LR; via e-mail. ``This is similar to our e-mail output
when we are living together, so it gives me the illusion that he's
not really so far away.'' &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Or _ at the extreme end of things _ _ Bjorn Johns, a Colorado
engineer who spends two months a year surveying in the Antarctic.
While he's away, e-mail is his only viable way of staying in
contact with the woman he lives with in Boulder: He can telephone
out of the Antarctic but can't get incoming calls, and there's an
inconvenient 18-hour time difference between them. ``E-mail,'' he
says, ``is your main link to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  There is no way to know the number of commuting couples in
the country _ the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not track these
numbers _ let alone how many of them e-mail each other. But the
number is surely not small. In 1987, Washington psychologist Karen
Shanor, author of ``How To Stay Together When You Have to Be
Apart,'' estimated there were 2 million commuter marriages in the
United States, , and the number has likely risen. But for many,
it's a critical lifeline _ efficient, cheaper than the telephone,
and convenient, especially for couples living in different time
zones. Some find that e-mail _ with its illusion of distance and
its absence of eye contact _ is an easier way to discuss sensitive
or difficult topics. ``The fact that you seem to not really be
saying it ... makes it feel safer,'' says Helen Palmer, the Boston
bureau chief for the NPR radio show ``Marketplace.'' She uses
e-mail as one way of keeping in touch with her husband, freelance
musician Joshua Rifkin, who travels a great deal.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, when used creatively, playfully, and flirtatiously, e-mail
offers the unexpected benefit of ``kind of spicing things up,''
observes psychologist Shanor.

</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   To be sure, most e-mailing couples say their correspondencee
revolves largely around the mundane business of daily life _ what
the Huff-Rousselles refer to as ``domestic administrivia.''

   ``It's a good way to get another dose of family information and
news,'' says Curt Lorang, an engineer in St. Paul, Minn., who holds
down the family fort (including two children, aged 10 and 13)
during the week while his wife works in Fort Wayne, Ind., as an
executive for a division of IBM.

`SPORTS NIGHT' SEEMS LIKE A WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
SPORTS NIGHT 
Starring: Josh Charles, Peter Krause, Felicity Huffman, Robert
Guillaume, Joshua Malina

<TEXT>
<P>
   When ABC introduced ``Sports Night'' to TV critics in July, the
network revealed that it hadn't yet opted to employ a laugh track
on the show, at the urging of writer and executive producer Aaron
Sorkin. The reason: This comedy, which goes behind the scenes of a
cable series similar to ESPN's ``SportsCenter,'' contains more
dramatic moments and fewer one-liners than most of TV's half-hour
sitcoms. Alas, convention and network risk-fear prevailed, and
``Sports Night'' arrives equipped with one of those metallic,
automatic, fascistic chuckle machines that undermines realism as it
commands you to find something funny.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, ``Sports Night'' survives the trills of artificial
laughter to emerge as one of the more promising new shows of the
fall season. Yes, it joins TV's already long list of
self-referential media sitcoms whose family tree goes back to ``The
Mary Tyler Moore Show.'' But with the guiding hand of Sorkin, whose
screenwriting credits include ``A Few Good Men'' and ``The American
President,'' ``Sports Night'' manages to distinguish itself with
aspirations to be like ``Broadcast News,'' the movie that blended
the ethics of the news business with the emotional toll that
deadline work takes on its employees. Minutes before airtime, the
hyped-up staffers of ``Sports Night'' are quipping excitedly; the
morning after they face loneliness, broken loyalties, and moral
self-loathing about the tabloidization of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The show revolves around the popular anchoring team of Dan
Rydell (Josh Charles) and Casey McCall (Peter Krause). In the
premiere show, McCall is depressed about his separation from his
wife and son, and his on-air performance is suffering. While the
boss and a network stiff prepare to fire him, Rydell and the show's
producer, Dana Whitaker (Felicity Huffman), protect him and try to
jolt him out of his funk. In the context of ``Sports Night,'' it
seems, anything less than consuming passion about the workplace is
unacceptable. Tonight, in a humorous sequence, Dana gives the
coveted assistant producer job to a neurotic sports nerd who knows
to the day precisely how long ``Sports Night'' has been on the air.
Like her, he's workaholic material.
</P>
<P>
   It's unusual, and refreshing, for the central characters on a
sitcom to be so engaged in their jobs. ``Sports Night'' does bring
their personal lives into play, and the professional relationships
are deeply personal, but the action stays in the newsroom. The
first two episodes occur entirely within the ``Sports Night''
studio _ a set that is well-used with the help of some confident
camera work.
</P>
<P>
   There are bugs that need to be worked out of ``Sports Night.''
While it moves without much clunkiness between the serious and the
silly, the dramatic moments are in need of fine tuning. In the
climactic scene when Casey calls his wife and asks her to wake up
their son to watch an inspirational sports event, the
sentimentality meter goes into the red. Sorkin and the other
writers will need to be militant about keeping out the schmaltz,
and sticking to the restrained or angry drama that does work, such
as when Dana accuses Casey of ``screwing up'' her show.
</P>
<P>
   For a new series, ``Sports Night'' already has a nicely
developed sense of ensemble and texture. Charles and Krause show a
natural chemistry as anchors and friends, and Robert Guillaume has
strong presence as the imposing executive producer. The most
appealing actor, though, is Huffman, who is dynamic as the
committed producer who only lives for airtime. She's got caffeine
running through her veins.

`THE HUGHLEYS' EXPLORES SUBURBAN RACIAL TENSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE HUGHLEYS 
Starring: D.L. Hughley, Elise Neal, Eric Allan Kramer, Marietta
DePrima, John Henton 
On: ABC 
Time: Tuesday at 8:30 
Rated: TVPG 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Hughleys'' is a potentially interesting new addition to
TV's treatment of race, going back to shows like ``All in the
Family'' and ``The Jeffersons.'' It's audacious and socially
observant, and yet it has enough heart to make it into something
more than just a collection of incendiary jibes. If it can avoid an
annoying impulse to serve up warm and fuzzy lessons about how we
all should just get along, it could work.
</P>
<P>
   Like Fox's less-successful ``Living in Captivity,'' ``The
Hughleys'' looks at what happens when a black family moves into a
predominantly white surburb. But on the ABC sitcom the world is
seen through the eyes of the black family, and the source of the
racial tension is Darryl Hughley, a hothead who is a little too
ready to perceive slight. This reverse racism scenario is tempered
by Darryl's wife, Yvonne, who befriends the white couple next door
and urges her husband to ``meet people halfway.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner of a vending-machine business, Darryl is happy to be
living out the American dream. But he's sure his white neighbors
are appalled to see a black family moving in, and he curtly rejects
their friendly overtures, yelling: ``I don't sell drugs, I don't do
drugs, I'm not in a gang, I've never been in jail. And you know
what? I don't give a damn if O.J. did it.'' Simultaneously, he
fears what his pal from the old neighborhood has said: That he, his
wife, and his two children are ``on the slippery slope to losing
(their) blackness.'' Not only does his son like the music of
Hanson, after all, but his daughter wants to buy a white doll.
</P>
<P>
   The show, based on the experiences of its lead actor, standup
comic D.L. Hughley, is executive produced by Chris Rock. But unlike
Rock, ``The Hughleys'' ultimately lets all of its characters off
the hook. The white neighbors are indeed colorblind, and Darryl _
well, he's just lovably irritable. And that's not a bad thing on a
weekly sitcom, as long as it doesn't traffic in insultingly
sacchrine lines about finding a new meaning of the N word:
neighbor.

LANE, `ENCORE' MERIT LITTLE APPLAUSE FROM VIEWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
ENCORE! ENCORE! 
Starring: Nathan Lane, Glenne Headly, Joan Plowright, Trevor
Fehrman 
On: NBC 
Time: Tuesday at 8:30 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On ``Encore! Encore!,'' Nathan Lane plays an opera star who
loses his world-famous singing voice. Sadly, this unbearably
histrionic excuse for a TV character did not lose his speaking
voice, and so he is more than equipped to bellow and bully and
berate his way across the set, chasing after women to impress them
with his big celebrity when he's not treating his resentful sister
like his own personal servant. After a half hour of Joseph Pinoni
and his high-maintenance whining, you may wish he'd lost his mind
and a couple of other important marbles in the Italian hospital
where his vocal cord received its tragic nick.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ``Encore! Encore!'' is too much, with Lane
giving a one-note performance that is as tiresome as it is
unbelievable. Curiously, the sitcom is from the producers of
``Frasier,'' a beautifully modulated show that is also built around
a character with an inflated ego and a case of sibling rivalry. But
Kelsey Grammer's Frasier is as sympathetic as he is stuffy, and his
foibles are ultimately human. Lane's Joseph never appears to be
anything more than a cartoon narcissist, one who can't seem to stop
clutching his heart before falling into waiting chairs.
</P>
<P>
   The show's shaky setup has Joseph returning to his family's Napa
Valley winery, friendless, penniless, and jobless. ``I'm at the
lowest point in my life,'' he moans. His loving mother, played by
Joan Plowright, is an oddball who has a habit of attending the
funerals of strangers. She's glad her son is back, while his
sister, played by Glenne Headly, is not. She's tired of being
overshadowed by her garish brother, whom she calls Il Duce, and
she's rightly afraid he will corrupt the teenage son she's raising
on her own. In tonight's episode, Joseph has the boy drive him into
San Francisco for some action, and the pair return late at night,
obnoxiously drunk and in the company of a pair of floozies.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, Plowright, and Headley are a formidable trio of
performers. But Lane is best as a color supporting player, and no
matter how sharp her comic delivery is, Plowright needs good lines
as much as the next sitcom actor. And Headly, who had a great stint
as a no-nonsense doctor on ``ER'' a few season ago, doesn't get to
pull out enough brass as Lane's bitter sister. ``Encore! Encore!''
has been dogged by negative buzz since the pilot was recast and and
reshot over the summer, and tonight's episode will not contradict
the doomsayers. Despite it's connections to ``Frasier,'' and its
talented cast, it doesn't make you want to exclaim for a single
encore, nevermind two.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; PITTSFIELD, Mass. _ Small things, like a perfectly executed
double steal, will be missed most. The crack of the bat. The
plastic, pigeon-scaring owls in the rafters. The delays as a fiery
sun sets in center field. Peanut shells on the worn floorboards of
the box seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's truly a magic here,'' said Kevin O'Hara of Pittsfield,
a zealous fan of the minor league Mets, who appear ready to pack
their bags for good. ``You're so close to the action that a good
pickpocket could lift the batting glove from the on-deck batter's
pants. The beauty and the memories that this little music box of a
park has brought to our lives will be sorely missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-one years after Walter O'Malley's Dodgers abandoned Ebbets
Field for Los Angeles' Chavez Ravine, professional baseball is
poised to return to Brooklyn, N.Y., at the expense of this
down-on-its-luck city in the Berkshires.
</P>
<P>
   And the thought of an empty Wahconah Park _ Pittsfield's
79-year-old venerable ball yard with quirky dimensions and a rich
history _ is evoking emotions approaching those felt in Brooklyn in
1957 when the zany Dodgers turned out the lights and boarded the
train for the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like someone in your family died,'' said Marty Adler of
Brooklyn, who maintains a hall of fame to the Brooklyn Dodgers and
is jubilant at the idea of professional baseball on Coney Island.
``I feel sorry for Pittsfield because I know how they feel. I'm
sure there are people there who define their whole day on the
success of that team. And now their whole day is shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome the team, but feel sorry for the fans they left
behind. But what are you going to do? What are you going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   What Pittsfield is doing is preparing for summer nights without
games against the Lowell Spinners, the Oneonta (N.Y.) Yankees, or
the Batavia (N.Y.) Muck Dogs _ sultry evenings when the beer garden
down the right-field line will be empty and the chance for free
pizza for everyone will no longer hinge on one fan's ability to
catch three consecutive pop flies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably as enjoyable a baseball experience as a fan
could ask for,'' said Bill Mesick, vice president of the Pittsfield
Mets fan club. ``You're right there with the players. You can hear
the arguments with the umpire _ juicy words and all. This place is
historic. A lot of great players have played here. I wish they
would just jack that stadium up, renovate it, and put it right back
down again.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not going to happen. The team's owners have made it
plain that they need a new facility if they're going to stay here.
And there seems little chance of that happening. Pittsfield Mayor
Gerald S. Doyle Jr., through a spokesman, said the situation is out
of his control. He said he expects the team to honor its licensing
agreement, which calls for the team to play here at least through
the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced last week that his
city had reached a deal in principle with the Mets to move their
single-A minor league club from here to a new, $20 million stadium
to be built on the site of an abandoned amusement area on Coney
Island.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is not final yet. The Yankees could reject the
move of a minor league team into their territory. But, club
officials say, it is increasingly likely that the Mets will depart
Wahconah Park after next year's season.
</P>
<P>
   William L. Gladstone, the minor league Mets president, said that
like the Dodgers, who were willing to stay in Brooklyn if they got
land for a new stadium, the Mets would like to stay here. But the
facilities _ spartan clubhouses, and insufficient lighting _ are
substandard, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful old playing field and the scene is
beautifully bucolic,'' said Gladstone, a Brooklyn native who
purchased the team in 1992 for $850,000 with four other investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``But from a fan's point of view, it's not a comfortable
stadium. The bathroom facilities are pretty bad,'' he said.
``Still, it's a charming place to see a baseball game. We've shown
more loyalty to Pittsfield than any of our predecessors and some
people appreciated it, which doesn't mean they won't be mad as hell
when we leave _ or if we leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Mets' 10-year stay at Wahconah Park has made them
the longest hometown team since the Pittsfield Hillies ended their
17th season here in 1930. Since then, a succession of bush league
clubs have come and gone, wearing the uniforms of the Electrics,
the Indians, the Red Sox, the Senators, the Rangers, the Brewers,
and the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   From seats as close as 40 feet away from the action, fans
through the years have watched former Red Sox first baseman George
Scott send towering home runs over the center-field fence, whose
due-west orientation occasionally forces only-in-Pittsfield delays
at blinding sunsets.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, players such as Lou Gehrig, Rafael Palmeiro,
Mark Grace, and Greg Maddux have laced up their cleats in
Wahconah's dank locker rooms and thrilled the fans, who pay $2.75
for general admission and $1.25 for a snow cone.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's like going to Fenway Park on a smaller scale,''
said Jacko Furey, 60, a Pittsfield native and longtime Mets fan.
``It would be a big loss. I know the kids love it there. They get
to see the future stars. A lot of summer nights, it'll be empty
with no games to go to. Last year, I'll tell you, it was just great
when we took the championship. It's pure baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The team drew 84,323 fans this year, the most since 1992. The
tally makes it the sixth most popular of 14 teams in the New
York-Penn League. ``We offer a lot of charm,'' said team spokesman
Ethan Wilson. ``But charm can only go so far and last for only so
many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Pratt, pulling draughts at nearby Pepe's tavern, a
post-game hangout, said that if the Mets leave, it will be another
blow to a city that already has absorbed too many of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Electric pulled out about 10 years ago,'' said Pratt.
``Now we've got the PCB issue. The department store (the former
England Bros.) is empty. This was the only positive thing that we
had going here. It's going to be a void.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pittsfield is a baseball city, Pratt and his customers
insisted on a warm afternoon last week. And, like Brooklyn, they
will hunt for another franchise that will spark standing ovations
and affordable family entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice to Pittsfield is not to give up hope and keep trying
to get another team,'' said Paul Montanaro of Brooklyn, a
long-suffering Dodger fan who is anxious for professional baseball
to return to his native Brooklyn. ``That's what we did all these
years and see what's happening now? We're back in the baseball
business.''

LET'S HEAR THE TRUTH ABOUT FLOJO'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWENN KNAPP  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What is a legacy? Is it shiny purple leotards,
sparkling fingernails, a snappy nickname and cascading curls? Is it
glittering medals, blazing world records, a jog with the president
and a dream-starved neighborhood that watched one of its children
soar into history?
</P>
<P>
   Florence Griffith Joyner left all of that behind when she died
Monday morning at age 38 _ glory, glamour and a 7-year-old
daughter, too. But in dying far too soon, she might have left
something else, something that isn't as pretty or charming as the
woman herself, something that would be all too easy to bury with
her.
</P>
<P>
   If FloJo took performance-enhancing drugs, we need to know. Not
to sully her memory or label her a cheat, and certainly not to
blame her for her own death. We need to know because, if all the
rumors about her are true, she still can contribute something to
sports and to the youngsters who adored her. She can warn them, and
she can protect them.
</P>
<P>
   The innuendo about her will never vanish. No American Olympian
has ever been so strongly suspected of steroid use. When FloJo
obliterated world records in the 100- and 200-meter dashes in 1988,
she was 28 years old and astonishingly faster than she had been at
age 24. New, enormous muscles popped out from her thighs. Like her
male counterpart, Ben Johnson, she seemed too swift to be true.
</P>
<P>
   The drug testers in Seoul, ridiculed as ineffectual by most
competitors, somehow caught Johnson. FloJo never tested positive.
There was no scientific evidence against her. Her peers, though,
whispered constantly. Some talked out loud. In his autobiography,
Carl Lewis wrote: ``It was a common belief in the track world that
Florence had used drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants to hear this now, not when her old neighbors from
Watts are remembering what she did for their community, when she
can't defend herself with another round of denials.
</P>
<P>
   But we have become too skilled at turning away from these
stories. We told Gwen Torrence to hush up in 1992, when she didn't
win an Olympic medal and accused her competitors of drug use.
Torrence chose the wrong time to complain, when her protest was all
about winning and losing. But now, with FloJo gone, we need to ask
questions, about health and safety instead of winning and losing,
about how much was risked for those brilliant moments in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   This generation has already turned on the radio and television
too many times to learn that a famous young athlete's heart has
stopped beating. Sergei Grinkov collapsed on the ice, Hank Gathers
and Reggie Lewis on the basketball court. FloJo might be just like
them, a sad and confounding mystery, allotted her 38 years by fate
and then taken randomly.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy is being performed, but it may not yield more than a
hint of what took FloJo. She might have had congenital heart
disease. She might have damaged her heart with steroids, or she
might have taken performance-enhancing drugs with no real
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have not established a clear link between steroid use
and long-term health problems. They suspect liver and heart damage,
but they can't ethically experiment on humans for confirmation.
They have to rely on scant anecdotal evidence, from the rare
athletes who have admitted to drug use or been caught. If FloJo
ingested banned substances, they need to hear the truth from anyone
close to her, anyone who would know.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steve Courson, a former Pittsburgh Steeler lineman with heart
disease, has acknowledged taking steroids during his NFL career. He
has gone on a crusade against performance-enhancing drugs, giving
seminars in schools, trying to break through what he calls a
conspiracy of silence.
</P>
<P>
   Courson could be considered an unscrupulous cheat. He is, after
all, an admitted doper. But in anti-doping circles, he is
considered a beacon because he told the truth. The same could hold
for FloJo's memory, if she took drugs and a responsible confidant
tells her story with the best of intentions.
</P>
<P>
   And if FloJo took drugs, she was not alone. When news of her
death spread Monday, there should have been widespread fear in
baseball clubhouses, in football locker rooms ... Many athletes
should have started wondering: Could I be next?
</P>
<P>
   These last few months have been full of lessons about
performance-enhancing substances _ from the police crackdown at the
Tour de France to the revelation that Mark McGwire used a hormonal
supplement banned in some sports but allowed in baseball. In the
end, though, we brushed the lessons aside and waited for the happy
moments, to cheer for the sprint down the Champs-Elysees and for
Homer No. 62.
</P>
<P>
   But we could wake up to more and more news reports like the one
we heard Monday, that another star has passed away. The last 20
years have yielded a generation of athletes who turned their bodies
into lab experiments.
</P>
<P>
   If FloJo was one of them, it is disrespectful to her memory to
wait for this tragedy to fade away so that we can resume the
cheering. If there's any chance that sports stardom killed her, we
need to know, to prevent it from happening again and again. It
would be an awful way to remember her, but it would be more
valuable than world records or hot fashions. It would be a real
legacy.

AHOY THERE, MICKEY!

<TEXT>
<P>
   Would you or should you sail on a ship with mouse ears, rather
than some fanciful logo, emblazoned on its smokestacks?
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world's newest cruise ship, the Disney Magic, the
first of a two-vessel fleet of the Disney Cruise Line.
</P>
<P>
   And it's pure Disney magic, everything you think a cruise should
be, with lots of fanciful touches and unexpected fun. The Magic
looks just like a grand ocean liner should, but even here Disney
shows off its imagination. Take those smokestacks: Only one is
real; the other hides the ESPN lounge, complete with stadium
seating for catching the latest in sports events with big- screen
action.
</P>
<P>
   As the Magic was getting under way from Port Canaveral, I took a
shortcut through the ESPN Skybox located within the fake funnel to
watch the sail-away festivities, only to bump into Minnie Mouse,
who then rubbed noses with me, took me into her arms, and danced to
the sounds of the band outside. How will I explain this to our
cats? And, although I know Mickey is a nice guy, I was glad to see
he was busy in an adjoining room waiting to greet the passengers on
this pre-maiden voyage sail. Mickey and Minnie were dressed in
their best sailing outfits.
</P>
<P>
   This is Disney's entry into the cruise market. And Disney is
promising innovations, a ``seamless'' vacation, and places for kids
and adults where neither should meet. A tall order. While my cruise
was less than seamless and had a few bugs, the Disney concept looks
like a winner, and should win converts to cruising. Already the
company says 60 percent of its passengers have never cruised
before. That's the magic of the Disney name.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney Magic began sailing July 30, months after its planned
inaugural. The ship, Disney said, was not finished in time by the
Italian shipyard. Disney's vacation concept is to offer three- and
four-day cruises along with a three- or four-day vacation at Disney
World, about an hour's drive from Port Canaveral.
</P>
<P>
   All the cruises sail to Disney's own private Bahamian island,
Castaway Cay; four-day cruises also call on Nassau.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's idea for a seamless vacation is to have guests check
into Disney World, where they receive a ``World'' card that is used
to open the booked resort room, as a credit card for all purchases
in Disney World, and as identification. After the resort stay,
guests are bused to Port Canaveral to Disney's own terminal, where
there is no check-in; passengers just walk aboard the ship, showing
their cards. On board, the same card is keyed to open the stateroom
door, again be used for purchases, and to be identification on
leaving or entering the ship at port.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the ships of the day, which seem somewhat boxy,
the Magic looks the way a ship should. Entering, you find no huge
atrium but rather a somewhat plain lobby, similar to what one might
find on a grand ocean liner of the past. The largest dining room,
Lumiere's, also has the feel of one of the queens of the '30s and
'40s. Even the piano lounge, Sessions, has that feel.
</P>
<P>
   One thing you will not find on board is a casino. That's not
part of the Disney image, a spokesperson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney magic works wonders in its staterooms, lounges,
showroom, entertainment, children's facilities, innovative dining,
and on its private isle. Disney's island outdoes other cruise lines
not only in its facilities but, especially, because the Magic docks
at the island. On other cruise lines, one must tender in to the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Staterooms on the ship are well thought out, particularly for
families. All have extra space, allowing families of five to share
a room. Many rooms can be booked with an adjoining stateroom. All
have an innovative two baths; one has a shower/tub and sink, the
other a toilet and sink. Many staterooms have private balconies.
</P>
<P>
   While the ship is keyed to families, those without kids should
find enjoyment away from the younger set. Many lounges and one
dining room are for adults only. No kids. Adults will find a
night-time show area with a comedy club, a rock/ country lounge,
and other entertainment. A reservations-only Italian restaurant,
Palo, is found topside, with a sweeping ocean view, and it's just
for adults. There are also an adult pool and a marvelous spa and
salon. One can indulge in facials or therapies, using water or
aroma. If you're into fitness, there are plenty of programs
available; if you're looking to get fit, a personal trainer is
available.
</P>
<P>
   Kids should have a ball aboard. Huge areas are set aside for
them. Disney will have up to 50 counselors on board to care for
them from early morning to late at night. The Oceaneer Club, with a
Captain Hook theme, is a lavish area for the 3-to-8 set. The
9-to-12 gang get the Oceaneer Lab, where computers galore are
available, and they can have fun with science projects. On the open
deck, youngsters have their own pool and play areas.
</P>
<P>
   Most cruise lines forget about teenagers. The reason is simple:
Teens like to do their own thing, don't want programmed activities.
I know this from watching my own children grow up on cruises. But
Disney is creative and offers Common Grounds, a lounge area just
for teenagers where they can meet other teens, enjoy a cappuccino
or mock cocktail. Should the teens want to do something, there are
counselors there to help organize games, pool parties, whatever. On
Castaway Cay, the teens have their own beach area.
</P>
<P>
   Another innovation Disney offers is rotating dinners. Each night
guests dine in a different dining room; even their waiters move
with them. The most enjoyable room is Animator's Palate, where
black-and-white cartoons burst into color.
</P>
<P>
   Disney outclasses its competitors also in its showroom. It is
the equal, if not better, than any Broadway playhouse. And the
shows are spectacular. One featured the magical moments from Disney
classics, another an original fantasy with raging seas and
fire-breathing dragons.
</P>
<P>
   While our cruise had its bugs, it was a pre-maiden voyage. We
found some dining lacking, especially breakfast and lunch buffets,
which offered far less in variety and quantity than other lines.
One show suddenly stopped when its computer-operated animated
dragon failed to move.
</P>
<P>
   There have been reports of a lack of daytime activities for
adults, and complaints of not being able to book a spa treatment or
reservation at Palo. Disney has been working on these and other
problems, and by now should have them under control.
</P>
<P>
   The new line is headed by Arthur Rodney, who helped build
Crystal Cruises into a five-star line. Rodney brought along others
from Crystal, including a photogenic captain, Tom Forberg, who
proudly notes that the Magic is the most stable ship he's been on,
and that ``it looks like a ship.''
</P>
<P>
   One other complaint heard from many is that the Disney Magic is
expensive for families. Rates for a family of four would be between
$4,000 and $5,000 _ much higher than on a competitior such as
Carnival, Royal Caribbean or Premier. Disney stresses value, and in
this case there is no comparison.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney Magic was built for family cruising, and its
facilities on land (Castaway Cay) and sea are first rate. Even its
international staff, while having some rough edges, is highly
enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the Disney Wonder, a sister vessel, will join the
Magic.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Disney Magic is an 85,000 ton, 964 foot long vessel carrying
1,700 guests double occupancy (2,400 using extra berths in each
room).
</P>
<P>
   The ship offers three- and four-day cruises combined with a
three- or four-day stay at Disney World, about an hour from Port
Canaveral. The ship calls on Nassau and Disney's private island,
Castaway Cay. Disney's island is the only one where a cruise ship
can dock.
</P>
<P>
   Of its 875 staterooms, 73 percent are on the outside, 44 percent
of those with balconies.
</P>
<P>
   The ship has all the amenities of a floating resort (no casino,
however), along with separate adult and children's areas. Almost an
entire deck, 15,000 square feet is devoted to children's
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for a seven-day Walt Disney World and Magic cruise begin
at $1,295 a person. Rates depend on ship and resort accommodations
selected. For third, fourth or fifth guests sharing a room, rates
are $275 for child aged 2; $999 for children 3-17 and $1,199 for
adults 18 and older.
</P>
<P>
   The price includes round-trip air from most cities in the United
States and Canada; accommodations on land and sea; unlimited
admission to Disney World parks, ground transfers and more.

<HEADLINE>
CELLUCCI SUPPORT BY LABOR DECEPTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The labor unions that publicly declared their support
last week for Acting Governor Paul Cellucci, gives Attorney General
Scott Harshbarger more _ not less _ assurance that he has a solid
base of support within organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Cellucci and his supporters attempted to reap as much
political mileage as they possibly could with the endorsements of
Teamsters Local 25, Hotel and Restaurant Employees Local 26,
Service and Employees International Union Local 254, National
Association of Goverment Emoloyees (NAGE) and the New England
Council of Iron Workers.
</P>
<P>
   These endorsements reflect neither a defection nor a split among
unions. Rather, they reflect more of a splinter from organized
labor's large platform which has given its support, largely through
the key endorsement of the state AFL-CIO, to Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, these endorsements were not much of a surprise to
union activists supporting Harshbarger. They were expected.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Teamsters Local 25 was with the former Gov. Wiliam
Weld-Lt. Gov. Cellucci team since they were elected in 1990. In
addition, current Local 25 president, George Cashman, is a current
Weld appointee to the Massachusetts Port Authority's board of
directors and represents workers at the port authority.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel and Restaurant Employees union also has backed the
Weld-Cellucci team since 1990. Its president, Janice Loux, is a
Cellucci appointee to the MBTA board of directors, for which she
receives a $7,500 a year stipend. And the union's former president,
Dominic Bozzotto, has been recently appointed director of personnel
for the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority.
</P>
<P>
   As for SEIU Local 254, its president, Edward Sullivan, is an
appointee to the state's Workers Compensation Advisory Board and is
also a long-time Weld-Cellucci backer.
</P>
<P>
   Since NAGE did not back the Democratic gubernatorial candidate
in 1994, some union activists said they were not surprised that it
is backing Cellucci this year.
</P>
<P>
   While the New England Council of Ironworkers backs Cellucci, the
largest local in the council, Ironworkers Local 7 in South Boston,
has endorsed Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Cellucci's labor endorsements actually ring hollow
when compared to the unions that endorsed Harshbarger, including
the ones affiliated with the state AFL-CIO which gave its backing
in June to Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Harshbarger has received individual endorsements from
more than 30 unions representing 250,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   As Robert Haynes, president of the state AFL-CIO said of
Cellucci's endorsements, it's the members of these unions who
actually do the voting in this election. When they compare the
records of Harshbarger and Cellucci, the membership will select
Harshbarger as the champion of working men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   What means even more good news for Harshbarger (bad news for
Cellucci), is that Harshbarger is gaining the support of the labor
unions that backed his rival in the Democratic primary, former
Congressman and Ambassador Brian Donnelly. Plumbers Local 12
recently wrote a letter of endorsement for Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Cellucci and his supporters try to portray the labor
endorsements as major defections, the fact is they are long-time
loyal Harshbarger supporters who represent merely a splinter from
the platform of organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt it was labor that helped Harshbarger go over the 50
percent mark in voter support in a three-way primary race. And it
was labor's help that gave state Sen. Warren Tolman an eight-point
edge over unexpectedly strong rival Dorothy Kelly-Gay in the
Democratic primary for Lt. Governor.
</P>
<P>
   Strong union backing of state Sen. William Keating no doubt
contributed to his impressive victory in the three-way Democratic
primary race for Norfolk County district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   If labor had not been strongly behind the candidacy of state
Sen. Lois Pines in her race for attorney general, her loss in the
primary to Middlesex County DA Tom Reilly could have been far worse
due to her own political mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   As the overall results in the September primary demonstrate, and
what the November final will likely confirm, labor is back and
firmly behind the Democratic gubernatorial team of Scott
Harshbarger and Warren Tolman _ and there is no better confirmation
of this than the small number of expected labor endorsements that
went to Cellucci.

 McGWIRE AND SOSA OFFER A RESPITE FROM THE NATION'S TROUBLES  
 Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CARY CLACK  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The majestic arc of a baseball sailing over a left
field fence doesn't hail a cure for cancer, the cessation of war or
the promise of true love for all of God's children.
</P>
<P>
   Its flight doesn't carry the meaning of what it is to be an
American or instructions on how to live a good life.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is the home run that remains the single most captivating
and breathtaking event in sports, a burst of explosion that lasts
for only seconds yet can reverberate for a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Never before have two men provided so many memorable and
explosive moments in one season as have the St. Louis Cardinal's
Mark McGwire and the Chicago Cub's Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest home-run race in history has seen both men eclipse
Roger Maris' single-season home-run record. Neither Barry Sanders
pursuit of the NFL record for most yards rushing in a season or
Michael Jordan's assault on the NBA's single-season scoring record
so stopped the nation in its tracks and demanded its attention like
the McGwire-Sosa phenomenon has done.
</P>
<P>
   The cliche holds true that football may be America's passion but
baseball is still its pastime. For whatever reason, baseball has
always had the capacity to provide the nation with a respite,
however brief, from its troubles.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1941, as Europe was locked in war, the feats of
another pair of baseball players transfixed the nation with marks
that haven't been matched since _ Joe DiMmaggio's 56-game hitting
streak and Ted Williams' season ending batting average of .406.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the exploits of McGwire-Sosa have brought much
needed relief from the sexploits of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   (Not that baseball has ever been perfect. The home-run chase
revived talk of asterisks. One should never have been attached to
Maris because he played a longer season than Babe Ruth and it's
silly to suggest that one should be applied to McGwire because of
his use of a legal but controversial nutritional supplement. But if
asterisks had to be used, they should be attached to every record
set before 1947, before Jackie Robinson changed the complexion of
the game and elevated baseball's talent level.)
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't simply the sheer athleticism and competition of
McGwire-Sosa that have so captivated and touched the nation; it's
also the grace and dignity with which both men carry themselves and
the respect and fondness they have for each other and the game.
</P>
<P>
   Despite different backgrounds, McGwire, a white Californian who
had a privileged childhood, and Sosa, a black Dominican who shined
shoes and sold fruit to help his mother, both men have embraced
each other and the record chase with affection.
</P>
<P>
   Embraces that have transformed each of them into icons. McGwire
finally realized the potential that was expected of him if he could
just stay healthy for an entire season while Sosa evolved from a
gifted, though little known, player into a superstar who is now a
household name.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the defining period of the season came last month when
the Cardinals and a slumping McGwire landed in Chicago for a
series. Sosa's playful and infectious personality rubbed off on and
loosened up McGwire for the final leg of the home-run derby. It was
as if Sosa reminded him that baseball was a game and he should be
having fun.
</P>
<P>
   No, we won't find any philosophical truths in home runs. But the
enthusiasm of Sosa, and now McGwire, reminds us that baseball is a
game and it's OK to have fun.

   TAKE-BOS  
 PAPEETE, Tahiti: ... wine with dinner.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dinner proves the main activity in the evening. Entertainment is
limited. There is music for dancing, but stage shows are
infrequent. The cruise director did do a show one night, but we
missed it; and on two nights, a comedian performed (the first show
we stayed only a short while, and we missed the second one
altogether).
</P>
<P>
   There are also talks on the history of the islands, and a couple
of very enjoyable cultural shows, one by children from the islands.
</P>
<P>
   On board also are young Polynesian women known as Les Gauguines,
who perform singing and dancing, offer classes on Polynesian
crafts, and greet guests on tour and during dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Time spent aboard the Paul Gauguin is well spent. To see as much
of this part of the world as we did in a week's time would have
been impossible on our own. The island visits were made all the
better by the fact that we did not have to pack up to move about.
And, since doing nothing seems to be a way of life on the islands,
having at least a day at each island was more than enough time to
take them in.
</P>
<P>
   The Gauguin offers a variety of tours on each island, ranging
from water sports to jeep tours. While jouncing around on the back
of a jeep may not sound inviting, especially with some of the dirt
roads, we opted to do so on every island and enjoyed the
experience. We learned of the flora and fauna, the history, met the
people in small villages, and learned how pearls were made and
vanilla is processed.
</P>
<P>
   Black pearls and vanilla have become two of the major
specialties of French Polynesia. The pearls are promoted
everywhere. It's hard to return without a pearl (we bought a small
black pearl ring). The pearl business is relatively recent, and,
surprisingly, pearl shells from the Mississippi are used to help
form the French Polynesian ones.
</P>
<P>
   On three islands, we visited ``vanilla farms,''actually small
homes with a shed nearby where vanilla plants (part of the orchid
family) are harvested and dried, much of the work being done by
hand. Tahitian vanilla beans are considered larger and richer in
oil than other varieties. A small bunch can cost $10 to $15.
</P>
<P>
   The islands are all lush, and it would be easy to live off the
land. On one island, we met an Australian woman who is basically
doing just that _ living in a structure without walls and no
electricity with her Tahitian husband. She was our guide for the
day because the German who operates the tour with his Tahitian wife
doesn't speak English. Although the islands are French, English is
widely spoken. Even currency is no problem; dollars are accepted
everywhere. A thousand French Polynesian francs is the equal of a
dollar. This is paradise: no worries, no complications.
</P>
<P>
   Bora Bora and Moorea, however, were the highlights of our
cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Bora Bora is the setting for James Michener's Bali Hai in
``South Pacific.'' Michener said the island, with its soaring
volcanic mountains rising 2,400 feet above the Pacific and covered
in clouds, is the most beautiful in the world. I would put it in a
tie with Moorea, maybe even give the edge to Moorea. Maybe MGM
agrees with me, for in its 1958 movie version of ``South Pacific,''
the studio used Moorea as the mythical Bali Hai, while the main
filming was done on Kauai in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   While all our jeep tours were enjoyable, the one on Bora Bora
was unforgettable. If anything, it was a superb advertisment for
Land Rover maneuverabilty. We went over ruts I couldn't imagine any
vehicle traversing, then we climbed dirt roadways high into the
mountains, sometimes on paths that seemed to incline 45 degrees. We
explored World War II cannons hidden in the lush overgrown brush.
The guns, placed there by the Navy, were never fired. The island
became a rest and recreation spot for the military and, later, the
gateway to the South Pacific for pilots because it had the only
runway.
</P>
<P>
   Our other adventure included a shark and stingray feeding
outing. We dutifully went to a lagoon where guides tried to lure
sharks to us for feeding. None came _ maybe we were lucky. (Others
on the ship said they did feed sharks on their tour.) We did find
stingrays, but it was nothing like Sting Ray City in the Cayman
Islands.
</P>
<P>
   On land, we wandered about, stopping to peek in at a tattoo
parlor. Tattoos, once banned by missionaries and the government,
are again popular, not only with the islanders but also visitors.
In the shop, we could see a young American getting his arm
engraved. In old days, he would have had the process done with a
shark's tooth and a mallet.
</P>
<P>
   Moorea proved the most beautiful of the islands. We landed in
Cook's Bay, where verdant mountains climbed vertically around us.
To me, this is the picture-perfect South Seas island.
</P>
<P>
   On many islands, we saw maraes, ancient places of worship. On
Moorea, we found a large one set in a rectangular platform and made
up of thousands of basalt rocks. Some have stone back-rests, which
were reserved for the chiefs and priests. Only on Moorea did we get
bitten by something. Our guide explained that in whaling days, a
captain from Nantucket deliberatly introduced mosquitoes to the
island after a dispute with islanders.
</P>
<P>
   On Moorea, we toured plantations where banana, grapefruit,
ginger, coconut, and lemons are grown. Coconuts are found on all
the islands. Then we joined Michael Poole, who leads a
dolphin-watch excursion. Poole has been studying dolphins for
years, and knows the ones around Moorea by name. When we boarded
his small boat, he told us of a sighting of 50 dolphins in the
morning, so we headed for the sighting spot. No dolphins. We then
bounced, literally, over large waves in search of those elusive
dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, we landed on a nearly deserted beach where a large
Tahitian woman was sitting bare-breasted with a child. It was a
scene right out of a Gauguin painting. As we landed, she left.
Poole gave a talk on dolphins while we feasted on fresh island
fruits. We saw no dolphins other than the pictures he showed us.
Poole said our lack of dolphin sightings is extremly rare and
assured us that if we return, we will get a complimentary tour.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is sure, though: Sailing on the Paul Gauguin brought
the dream of the South Seas to life for me.

   TAKE-BOS  
 JUNEAU, Alaska: ... Mendenhall Glacier.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuesday is a ``two-fer'' day: We were in Skagway during the day
and at Haines during the night hours. Both are small towns, but
very different in their appeal to tourists. Skagway (or
S-k-a-a-a-g-w-a-ay, as some of the locals refer to it) was the
starting point for the 1898 Gold Rush. The town retains a lot of
the atmosphere of the gold rush days, with wooden sidewalks and
restored storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   Two popular tourist events in Skagway are the scenic White Pass
Scenic Railway, which follows the route taken by the gold
prospectors to the summit, allowing visitors not only breathtaking
views but a sense of how difficult it was for the prospectors to
actually reach the gold sites, and the Vintage Street Car Tour,
which takes groups of people in antique touring limousines through
the historical sites and byways of Skagway. This is a fun tour,
with actors and actresses driving the street cars and telling tales
of life in the 1890s and of the characters who made the town
infamous during the Klondike days.
</P>
<P>
   A short cruise down the waterway in the afternoon brought us to
Haines. You can go to a salmon bake, watch the Chilkat Indians
dance and explain their traditions, or ride along the coast and see
the natural habitats of the bald eagles. For us, a walk to the town
was sufficient, and we saw many eagles in flight. Most intriguing
here was the sun, which didn't set until almost 11 p.m., so we
could enjoy the panoramic mountain views at night (and also soak in
the rare 80-degree temperatures on this particular night).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But nothing we had seen in the first three days of this cruise
could prepare us for Wednesday's itinerary: sailing into Glacier
Bay. And our luck with the good weather continued: There were no
clouds in the sky, the sun was bright and the skies blue, and the
temperatures still on the mild side. On board the Rhapsody of the
Seas, passengers headed for the outside decks or for the inside
areas that have a lot of glass. There was a lot of environmental
concern shown by Royal Caribbean as the ship begansits passage into
the bay. The ship traveled slowly, signs were posted warning
passengers not to throw anything overboard or to feed any of the
wildlife the ship may encounter, and items such as straws and
plastic or paper coffee cups were not available during this part of
the cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Glacier Bay didn't exist 200 years ago; it was all ice. Glaciers
are formed when snowfall in the high mountains exceeds the
snowmelt. The snow turns into solid ice and then flows downhill,
influenced by temperature, slope, and gravity. Glaciers are either
advancing or retreating, and all those in Glacier Bay are
retreating. The bay itself has been formed over the last 200 years
as the glaciers have retreated. You get the sense of how this has
happened as you begin entering the bay. Lush vegetation and rolling
hills at the entrance slowly yield to rockier terrain, fewer trees,
and lessbrush. The farther into the bay the ship goes, the starker
the landscape becomes. Fields of ice and mountains of glaciers
replace the green.
</P>
<P>
   Before our cruise, we were told to bring heavy jackets, hats,
and gloves; some friends who were in Alaska last year in late July
told us it was really cold in Glacier Bay. As we began our day in
Glacier Bay, the day felt warm under the bright sun. But as we
moved farther into the bay, the glacier fields chilled the
atmosphere. By the time we got to the farthest inside site, we were
all wearing heavy clothes (jackets and sweatshirts, earmuffs, and,
yes, winter gloves). But we never left the outside decks during the
morning cruise.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhapsody of the Seas headed for the Grand Pacific Glacier
and the nearby Margerie Glacier, and when we arrived there,
virtually at the Canadian border, the captain halted the ship for
one hour. From time to time, he moved the ship around so people on
both sides of the vessel could view each glacier. Grand Pacific
Glacier appears to be dirty; this is the result of the glacier
dragging up dirt and rocks as it slowly retreats farther into
Glacier Bay. Margerie Glacier, on the other hand is pure white with
hints of blue ice, caused by the continual compacting of the snow
and ice (white glaciers have many trapped air bubbles; blue ones
are more dense).
</P>
<P>
   In the silence of the inlet, parts of the glaciers fall into the
water, preceded by loud popping and cracking sounds. As the
Rhapsody was about to depart, there was a thunderous roar, and a
large section calved off and crashed into the sea, accompanied by
the cheers and yells of the ship's passengers. A spectacular finish
to an hour of up-close glacier watching (the ship had stayed within
a few hundred feet of the glaciers).
</P>
<P>
   As we made our way out of Glacier Bay, we saw more of the
glacier fields. One, the Johns Hopkins Glacier, is a low-lying but
expansive ice field of a blue hue that appears to flow out of the
valley between two mountains. As we left the bay, another cruise
ship began making its way in. The only major disappointment was
that we didn't see any wildlife; usually people can see whales,
bears, moose, and native birds as they traverse the bay. In early
afternoon, we left the tidewater glaciers and headed for our last
stop, Ketchikan.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The meals on the Rhapsody are generally very good. Breakfast is
available in either the dining room (with complete waiter-kitchen
service) or the Windjammer Cafe (with a full-service buffet line.
The same is true for lunch meals, both offering a different variety
of foods. Most people still prefer to eat in the dining room at
night, even though the Windjammer offers full service but at a more
casual dress and service level. Every night, there are five main
choices of entrees available, and if there's nothing you like
there, you can have a grilled steak, salmon, or chicken cooked for
you. A variety of appetizers, soups, salads, pastas, and, of
course, desserts adds to the dining experience. If you're up late
at night, there is a buffet with a different theme each evening,
served around the midnight hour.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhapsody is alive at night, with the casino in full swing,
entertainment in the Broadway Melodies Theater, and various forms
of musical entertainment in the various lounges throughout the
ship. The professional entertainment in the main showroom is
excellent and varied, as it is on all Royal Caribbean ships;
there's a different entertainer on five of the nights, with the
ship's own group of singers and dancers on the remaining nights.
All of the performers were very good, but the Knudsen Brothers'
show on Wednesday night stood out because of their vocal virtuosity
in not only singing a cappella but in making their voices sound
like a full orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The last stop on our cruise was Ketchikan. There is a variety of
tours available, from seaplane flights through the Misty Fjords
National Monument to tours of the town and the Totem Bight State
Park. We opted for the park on this trip, and enjoyed seeing some
of the restored totem poles and hearing some of the Indian legends
and stories concerning those poles. Having taken the morning tour,
all six of us now had a chance to shop and look around Ketchikan.
One rather startling point is that at first glance, it looks like
almost any port in the Caribbean; all of the familiar stores in the
Caribbean also have outlets in Ketchikan.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, we began our return to Vancouver, spending all
Friday traversing the Inside Passage in Canadian waters. Again, the
views were spectacular, and every hour or so would pass a little
town, the only sign of civilization until we passed another one
later on. Friday night was time to gather all our gifts and
mementos and pack.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning we arrived in Vancouver; this was one of the
quickest disembarkations we've experienced. Within 20 minutes of
starting the process we were off the ship and on the bus headed
back for the airport. Of course, having to go through Canadian
immigration and US Customs is a fairly lengthy process, but we
still had plenty of time before we boarded our Canadian Pacific
flight for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Vancouver, we passed over the Canadian Rockies; the
peaks were snow-covered, and it was a fitting farewell to our week
in Alaska and on board the Rhapsody of the Seas.

TAHITI CRUISE BRINGS A DREAM TO LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAPEETE, Tahiti _ Like so many others, I've dreamed of leaving
civilization behind and escaping to one of those island paradises
in the South Pacific. Living freely off the land, swimming in
azure-colored waters. No cares, no cash, no worries.
</P>
<P>
   Reality, unfortunately for me, always sets in.
</P>
<P>
   Blame James Michener, Robert Louis Stevenson, Herman Melville,
and Paul Gauguin for inspiring the dream. Their writings and
images, as well as those of others, have created this vision of
paradise in my mind _ and, I'm sure, in countless other minds.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, with the introduction of a new cruise ship
sailing in the lovely waters of the South Pacific and named for the
artist who has so beautifully captured the sensuous images of the
islands, it was time to mix a bit of reality with a lot of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first realities was that Papeete, Tahiti, is a long,
long way from Boston. Is paradise possible in just over a week's
vacation, and would it be worth it? The answer to both questions is
``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Paul Gauguin , a 320-passenger vessel, is as delightful and
casual as Polynesia itself. The vessel sails weekly from Papeete to
five of the islands of French Polynesia _ Huahine, Raiatea, Bora
Bora, and Moorea.
</P>
<P>
   The Gauguin is a small vessel that proves big on pleasure. It
looks the way a ship should, with a simple yet elegant interior
design. All the amenities one could ask for on a ship are aboard,
along with some surprises. When docked, the ship's stern lowers to
provide a sports platform from which one can water-ski, kayak, or
windsurf. The sports platform is also the place to borrow
snorkeling gear because every island visited is ideal for
snorkeling.
</P>
<P>
   For most Americans, reaching Tahiti requires a long, tedious
journey: six hours to Los Angeles, a two-hour layover, then a 7
1/2-hour flight to Papeete. When we arrived at 1 a.m. Tahiti time,
we were greeted by musicians and given small white flowers, which
we learned are to be worn behind the ear _ the right ear if you are
taken, left if available. On leaving the airport, we also received
leis.
</P>
<P>
   Although the hour was late and the trip long, Radisson-Seven
Seas Cruises made our journey as pleasant as possible, with a
waiting room at a nearby resort. In the morning, we awoke to a
beautiful scene overlooking lush gardens and a placid lagoon. There
was a breakfast and a buffet lunch to help while away the time
before boarding the ship later in the afternoon. The ship's
check-in was handled at the resort.
</P>
<P>
   We opted for an island tour that included two museum visits.
After all, this would be our only time on Tahiti. One museum
explains the history and geology of the islands of French
Polynesia, the other is dedicated to Gauguin. While there are only
three original Gauguins on display, the museum explains his life
and displays many reproductions of his works. The other museum
explains the volcanic nature of the islands, all surrounded by
shallow turquoise lagoons. Where fresh water flows from the
islands, there are breaks in the lagoon, allowing ships to pass
safely into port.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon, we boarded the ship in Papeete, were greeted
with champagne, then escorted to our rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The staterooms are spacious. Ours, like many others, had an
outside balcony where we'd enjoy our room-service full breakfast.
In the evening, the balcony would be a pleasant place to enjoy a
drink overlooking the tiny lights of whatever island we'd be near.
(The ship offers a stocked bar with complimentary liquors, beer,
and soft drinks in each stateroom.) All cabins have an outside
view, and 50 percent have balconies. Bathrooms are luxurious, done
in marble, and all have tubs.
</P>
<P>
   The ship has a casino, but local law doesn't allow the slot
machines to be used. Another curious local law requires that to use
the ship's gift shop, one must purchase a minimum of $50 worth of
goods. There is a small windowless gym, also a small spa operated
by Carita of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the ship, there are reminders of French Polynesia,
from photos to a small gallery with art and artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, we found the Gauguin offers dining with style.
The ship's main dining room, L'Etoile, has open seating, and dining
was at our pleasure. The maitre d' offered us a choice of dining
alone or joining a larger table to meet other passengers. We chose
to dine alone. Other choices of meals are the open-air Grille and
Le Veranda, which alternates with French/Italian specialties. This
restaurant features a fixed menu that includes a sampling of
outstanding entrees and desserts from these two lands. While many
of the menus feature the creative cuisine of two-star Michelin chef
Jean-Pierre Vigato, owner/operator of Apicius restaurant in Paris,
the meals are international in scope.
</P>
<P>
   The Gauguin is French-built and operated by Radisson-Seven Seas
Cruises, which is making a very good name for itself in luxury
cruises. Besides the lure of French Polynesia, the reason we chose
the ship was because of the positive cruise we had aboard the
Radisson Diamond. While the service and food were on a par with the
Diamond, the Gauguin was at times affected by ocean currents
rolling with the waves, unlike the very stable twin-hulled Diamond.
</P>
<P>
   A nice touch both ships enjoy comes after dinner. With my rigid
diet, when asked about desert, I informed the waiter, ``Nothing.''
When others received their treats, a plate was placed before me
with ``Nothing'' inscribed in icing.
</P>
<P>
   Another enjoyable touch is the casual atmosphere of the ship. No
jackets or ties needed _ ever. The ship also has a no-tipping
policy and serves complimentary wine with dinner.

A CHAT WITH A CLIPPER CAPTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``That's my real love,'' Uli Pruesse was telling us while
pointing at a painting of a clipper ship on the wall of the Wheel
Haus restaurant in Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Cape Cod is known for its sea captains and their former homes,
many of which serve as delightful inns, but the last thing I was
expecting when entering the Wheel Haus was to meet a real sea
captain. Pruesse is a schooner captain on the Star Clipper, a
four-masted barquentine with five square sails on its formast.
</P>
<P>
   Once I saw the German dishes on the Wheel Haus menu, I was ready
to dine, but during the meal, I also feasted on the thought of
sailing on a genuine tall ship, one with historical ties to Boston.
Pruesse, who joined our table, owns the Wheel Haus with his wife,
Aleta. He hails from Hamburg, Germany, and has been sailing most of
his life. When Star Clipper came along, he couldn't resist the urge
to return to the sea. After all, he said, a sailor always has one
foot on land, one on sea.
</P>
<P>
   The Star Clipper is based on the designs of Donald McKay, the
masterful 19th-century clipper ship designer from East Boston.
McKay's vessels were known for their speed, an important factor
during Gold Rush days to get around Cape Horn with passengers and
cargo for the California gold fields.
</P>
<P>
   The modern-day version, Star Clipper and its sister vessel Star
Flyer, carry on that tradition, although with a lot more comfort
and fun than in Gold Rush days. The Star Clipper has 85 cabins,
each with a private bath and all the amenities. There are two
swimming pools, a dining room that fits all passengers, a library,
and a piano bar.
</P>
<P>
   The Clipper and Flyer sail to ports around the world, and one
ship is usually found in the Caribbean. Passengers can participate
in sailing the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Pruesse enthusiastically encourages passengers on his sails to
participate in steering, learning navigation, seamanship,
understanding the weather and skies, maybe even mastering the art
of knots.
</P>
<P>
   One sail Pruesse is particularly enthusiastic about is the April
17-24 Antigua Classic Yacht Regatta that includes competition for
the Tall Ships' World Peace Cup. The sail will include visits to
Tortola, St. Barts, and other isles, but will be in Antigua to
compete in the cup race. The race, which Pruesse and his friend Ken
Coombs started in 1988, has grown to become a world- class yachting
festival with tall ships of all sizes entering. The competition
includes races, knot tying, dinghy races, seamanship judging, and
the spirit of tradition. And, you can be on the Star Clipper for
its competition, picking up seamanship skills under the direction
of Captain Pruesse _ or just sit back and relax and enjoy the show.
</P>
<P>
   Also expected to participate in next year's race is HMS Rose,
which just happens to be sailing in the Boston area now.
</P>
<P>
   Star Clippers is building the world's largest clipper ship,
Royal Clipper, due to enter service late next year. The Royal
Clipper will be the second five-masted full-rigger vessel in
history, and for its inaugural season will offer seven- and 14-day
sails out of Barbados. For more information on sailing with Captain
Pruesse, write to Orleans Tours, 167 Route 6A, Orleans, MA 02653;
or telephone 508-255-7763.
</P>
<P>
   And should you stop by the Wheel Haus, you might even meet
another ``captain.'' Pruesse says Captain Stubing of the ``Love
Boat,'' Gavin McLeod, who lives nearby, stops in to chat and dine.
</P>

China in winter

</P>
<P>
   Winter cruises on the Yangtze River are being offered by Regal
China Cruises. The cruises, November through April, are for three
days and travel to the Three Gorges. While other ships cease
operations during the winter as a result of changes in the water
level, Regal created a short round-trip itinerary that allows a
visit to the Three Gorges and the spectacular smaller gorges Wushan
and Bandong.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Smoke free
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The world's first smoke-free cruise ship will begin sailing in
December. Carnival Cruise Lines' MS Paradise will feature a
completely nonsmoking environment. Guests and crew will enjoy a
smoke-free environment everywhere on the 2,040-passenger,
70,000-ton vessel, including open decks. ``The overwhelming
majority of adults do not smoke,'' said George Dessart, the
American Cancer Society's chairman of the board. ``They want a
vacation environment that is healthy and smoke-free _ especially
for their children. We hope Carnival's bold and innovative action
spurs others in the travel industry to follow their lead.'' The
$300 million vessel will sail from Miami beginning Dec. 6,
alternating between a eastern and western Caribbean route.

Nov. 29-Dec. 6 aboard the Norwegian Wind. Among Hall of Famers will
be Bob Feller, Enos ``Country'' Slaughter, and Harmon Killebrew;
current players will include Tyler Green, Denny Neagle, and Jason
Christiansen. Also on Dec. 5, the line's legendary Norway will be
the site of the first-ever Sports Illustrated Afloat cruise. Sports
fans will meet their heroes, past and present, and enjoy many
activities on the sail from Miami to the eastern Caribbean islands.
Among players participating will be Don Mattingly, Ozzie Smith,
Stan Mikita, John Havlicek, WNBA star and Olympic medalist Teresa
Weatherspoon, and track and field Olympians Florence Griffith
Joyner and Al Joyner. Guests will be able to also participate in
sports events with the stars. The cruise will also mark the
unveiling of the first Sports Illustrated Cafe, filled with
memorabilia, videos, and classic SI photography. NCL plans to
convert its existing Sports Bars on its other ships to SI Cafes.

ALASKA: IT FILLS YOU WITH AWE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT F. CUTTING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUNEAU, Alaska _ It's a rare day in Alaska when you can sight a
pod of Orca (killer) whales moving about the waters off Juneau for
an extended period of time. (Orca sightings occur about 14 times a
year in Juneau's Auke Bay.)
</P>
<P>
   It's a rare day in Alaska when you can sail into Glacier Bay and
not have a cloud in the sky and also have mild temperatures.
(According to the US Park Service rangers in Glacier Bay, these
perfect conditions exist about seven days a year.)
</P>
<P>
   It's also a rare week when you can enjoy the splendor and
spectacle of Alaska, with its soaring pinnacles and peaks and
valleys and waterways, without having rain or showers. (A week in
late May was the first in at least three weeks that it hadn't
rained more than one day.)
</P>
<P>
   We experienced these rarities on a cruise through Alaska's
Inside Passage this past May on Royal Caribbean's Rhapsody of the
Seas. And to use a very-much overworked word _ but the only one
that is really applicable to cruising in Alaska's waters _ it was,
well, totally awesome!
</P>
<P>
   Sailing on the Rhapsody is pretty cool, too. The 75,000-ton
vessel, just a year old at the time of our cruise, offers the usual
amenities of cruise ships, plus an expanded health and fitness
area, an indoor solarium complete with sculptures of Pharaohs, lots
of glass surrounding many of the public rooms, a five-deck atrium
of lights, marble steps, and gold trim and accents, a
well-organized design and traffic pattern throughout the ship, and
larger passenger cabins (at least for Royal Caribbean).
</P>
<P>
   The two-deck Edelweiss room, brightly lit, well-designed, airy,
and open, with a good combination of large, medium, and smaller
tables, provides a great place for dining. The Windjammer Cafe,
open for breakfast, lunch, tea time, and supper (for those who
prefer casual dress at dinner), is surrounded by glass, and is also
well-designed for ease in carrying food trays and table
arrangements that allow for good viewing of the outdoor scenery.
</P>
<P>
   The main showroom _ the Broadway Melodies Theater _ has the
latest state-of-the-art lighting and sound systems, as well as an
orchestra pit for the musicians (but the house band performs on the
stage for most of the cruise). This theater also takes a big step
forward in passenger comfort. Gone are the rows of sofas and
chairs, with small tables placed nearby _ a layout that never
seemed to work on other ships we have cruised on over the years.
Instead, the room on the Rhapsody is designed in a traditional
theater arrangement, with additional space between rows to allow
people to move in and out with ease (and also allows the wait staff
to serve drinks). Each seat has a beverage holder on one arm, which
makes it easier for both waiter and cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Shall We Dance lounge is one of the
better-designed dance/performance rooms we've seen on ships:
comfortable seating, good line-of-sight views, good dance floor,
and wonderful views through the floor-to-ceiling glass windows.
Being in the Land of the Midnight Sun, we had the opportunity to
experience spectacular sunsets while dancing or being entertained
at 11 p.m. in this lounge.
</P>
<P>
   When you cruise to Alaska, it's more than the ship that counts.
It's also more than the various stops and tours the ship makes.
It's the breathtaking scenery you see from the deck of the ship or
notice as you walk in any of the towns you visit during the cruise.
It's not just one thing but the whole picture that makes a week in
the Inside Passage so exceptional and memorable.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Upon arrival in Vancouver, British Columbia, on a cloudy, cool
Saturday, and after being bused from the airport to the terminal at
which the Rhapsody of the Seas is docked, we began the process of
embarkation. Two other ships besides the Rhapsody were leaving this
facility on this day, and the traffic getting in and out of the
terminal was at a virtual standstill. It took our bus well over a
half-hour to travel less than a mile. The line inside the terminal
was just as bad, but it did move along at a reasonable pace. By
midafternoon, we were on the ship, and having checked out our
cabins, we headed to the Windjammer Cafe for a pre-cruise lunch,
followed by a quick look at the ship's facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Embarkation day on a ship means being rushed and confused,
waiting for luggage to arrive at the cabin, getting shipboard
credit approved, doing the lifeboat drill, finding your way around,
locating your table in the dining room, checking out the casino,
going to the showroom or one of the many lounges, all after an
airplane trip of 5 1/2 hours and a three-hour time-zone change (and
to complicate the time-zone changes, a fourth hour was added to the
day as we reached Alaskan waters early on Monday morning).
</P>
<P>
   Another detail is finding time to go through all the information
on land tours and get your choices (the top two or three for each
tour you want to take) into the ship's tour office by midnight. All
of which is necessary because of the limited number of spaces
available on some of the tours; my indecision on whether to take a
helicopter or seaplane tour of glaciers cost me the chance to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   With all the first-day business finished, we went to bed looking
forward to Sunday, a full day at sea.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When we cruise the Caribbean, a ``day at sea'' means exactly
that; all we can see is water everywhere. Imagine our surprise, on
Sunday morning, to wake up traveling through the Inside Passage and
being able to see land; not at a distance, but close up. The view
was spectacular: soaring snowcapped mountains amid plentiful
forests, with low clouds adding an extra dimension of mystery to
the scenery. At some points along the passage, the ship came real
close to land, giving passengers an up-close glance at the scenery.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhapsody, with its expansive use of glass windows in public
areas, offered numerous places to sit back and relax and take in
the splendor of the north country. Even the open decks are designed
in such a way as to allow good viewing and at the same time offer
some protection from the cooler air that surrounds the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if we got bored looking at the world outside the
ship, we could always run to the casino to try our luck gambling or
go to the theater lounge to play Bingo, hear a shore talk, learn a
line dance, or take part in a multitude of fitness activities. Grab
a lunch from the buffet at the Windjammer Cafe or indulge in a more
leisurely meal in the Edelweiss dining room. Perhaps a pizza would
do the trick, or some sandwiches, light desserts, and drinks at
teatime.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday is a formal night on board, one of two nights on this
particular cruise. In a sign of the changing times, all of the
other nights are casual, with shorts and bathing suits the only
clothes prohibited in most of the public areas of the ship. Sunday
turned out to be special for us because the other two couples
cruising with us had arranged for a special cake in honor of our
recent 25th wedding anniversary. (And there's nothing quite like
having a group of waiters sing ``Happy Anniversary'' to you in a
dining room filled with close to 1,000 people.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We arrived in Juneau, the capital of Alaska, on Monday morning.
The choices of tours are varied, from helicopter rides to the
Mendenhall Glacier field to a wildlife cruise to a bus tour. We
decided to take the wildlife cruise while our friends took the
highlights tour. We were bused to Auke Bay, where we boarded a
large catamaran for our wildlife cruise. The outfit that operates
this tour ``guarantees'' that guests will see various forms of
wildlife or refund your money.
</P>
<P>
   For us, that guarantee was met in the first half-hour of this
three-hour adventure when we saw a pod of Orca (killer) whales;
such pods are only in the area six or seven days a year. A little
farther into the bay, we saw three humpback whales. Then we
discovered sea lions resting on a buoy. We've seen eagles in Maine
from a distance, but were totally unprepared for the eagle sitting
at the end of a rock ledge on Auke Bay. The bird didn't even budge
as this huge catamaran trolled nearby. In fact, there are so many
eagles in this part of Alaska that it's easy to see them soaring
through the skies.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the operator of this tour was very sensitive to
the environment and to not disturbing the whales, sealife, and
other wildlife we encountered. A naturalist was also on board to
explain the various forms of wildlife we encountered.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the wildlife, once again we were surrounded by
magnificent vistas, snowcapped peaks, green valleys, and, at one
point, a view of the Mendenhall Glacier.

PATRIOTS DEFENSE TAKES AWAY THE DEEP PASSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ After three games, the Patriots' defensive
statistics don't look as dominating as many had thought they would.
The Patriots are 14th overall in the league, 12th against the run,
and 18th against the pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole feeling among the staff and the players is
that we need to be better,'' said defensive coordinator Steve
Sidwell. ``We need to be more consistent. We haven't been a good
team on third down. You have to be able to shut teams down on third
down. In most situations, we shot ourselves in the foot.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense has failed to stop 43.5 percent of opponents'
third-down conversion attempts. Only Indianapolis (48.8) and Denver
(43.9) are worse. In Sunday's 27-16 victory over the Oilers,
Tennessee converted half its chances (8 for 16).
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is that teams have been able to pick up the
Patriots' blitz packages since New England has built a reputation
as being a blitz-oriented defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to understand what teams are doing to us,'' said
Sidwell. ``They're fearing our pressure, so what they're doing is a
lot of play-passing. They're trying to block everything up and just
trying to make a short throw. The Oilers had thrown more deep balls
than any team I've seen in a long, long time but they just threw
away their deep passing attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the offshoots of being a team that pressures is they do
things to offset the pressure. And that kind of makes them a less
wide-open attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots managed only one sack; it seemed every time they
blitzed, the Oilers were ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so concerned about sacks,'' said Sidwell. ``What I am
concerned about is good rushes. With the three- or five-step drops
they were working with, we could have rushed 11 and had a couple of
guys come free and the ball would have been gone. That's the way
teams are choosing to play us. It makes it harder for them to get a
big play against us, but it makes it harder for us to get to them.
The ball is just gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams such as the Oilers and the Colts shut off their deep game
out of respect for the Patriots defense, realizing that (1) they
would have to beat Ty Law deep, and the way he is playing right
now, that can't happen; and (2) the quarterback would get eaten
alive if he had to make a seven-step drop. So opponents are content
to try to assert themselves on the ground and use the short passing
game to keep drives going.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's game plan, said Sidwell, ``was to try and do
anything they could to keep out of third-and-7 situations. They
started the game breaking all of their tendencies. On first down
they were throwing it. On second down they were running it and
trying to make it where they didn't have many third-and-longs. The
second third-and-long situation they had on the second drive _ the
one where they made the field goal _ we lined up and called a blitz
and we busted the blitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got into the sub situation we had a couple of busts,
which gave them a couple of gifts. As a result, at the end of the
game when we got ahead, we got away from it and played basic
coverage in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidwell said the game plan was to pressure with the blitz on
third down and play basic coverage on the first two downs, but ``we
really didn't have as much success as we were hoping to have doing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because quarterback Steve McNair was hard to tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hard to finish off,'' said Sidwell. ``We had some
opportunities, but overall our guys did a good job doing that with
him. We're in a sitiation where you have to be able to finish that
guy, but that's not easy. He's a strong man. And he has some
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   On a positive note, added Sidwell, ``We had a couple of
outstanding plays. They ran three quarterback draws in that game.
We played those well. That's a dangerous play for (McNair) because
he had almost 700 yards last year. A lot of it came on the QB draw.
He converted a third-and-4 late when they were in their two-minute
situation and were trying to come back. But overall we did a good
job against draw.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight week, however, the defense allowed a
100-yard rusher. Eddie George hit 100 on the button.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there's always concern,'' said Sidwell, ``but that's
a damn good back. He made us miss like most. We gave him a 27-yard
run where we missed a tackle. We're still making too many mistakes,
not fitting it together with our run defense. We should be and will
be more solid in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   Another good sign was that the Patriots didn't get fatigued,
even in the heat and humidity on the field. The defense seemed to
get stronger late in the game, with Lawyer Milloy making a big
interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most encouraging thing is that we had to make a play late
in the game and we were able to do it,'' said Sidwell. ``Our missed
tackles came early and I think our guys didn't go into this game
giving them as much respect as they should have. That's a good
team. I thought it was going to come down to the wire and that's
what ended up happening.''

FOOTNOTE TO A HORRID SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   James S. Hirsch is a well-known Boston financial news reporter.
For three years, he covered mutual funds here with energy and
insight for The Wall Street Journal _ Fidelity Investments in
particular. Before that he worked in Houston and Pittsburgh, nine
years with the paper altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Then a routine assignment to cover the breaking news on the Mike
Barnicle story turned into a nightmare in August. Hirsh reported
that The New York Times Co. had ``declined to comment'' on The
Boston Globe's decision to reinstate Barnicle for a time. In fact,
Times Co. _ corporate parent to both the Times and the Globe _ that
day had issued a statement supporting ``the Globe's right to make
its own decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Globe complained to a spokesperson for the
Times, who then complained to the Journal that Hirsch hadn't called
that day. Six days later Hirsch was fired. The severity of the
penalty raised eyebrows around town and in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch's explanation was that his failure to call the Times that
day was an error borne of a careless assumption: The Times twice
had declined to comment to him on Globe affairs in the recent past.
The statement a Journal spokesperson gave was this: ``There are
few, if any, more serious violations of journalistic norms than
knowingly printing a falsehood.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Journal editors apparently had come down hard on Hirsch
two months before the Barnicle mishap on a story of more
significance to the newspaper and its readers.
</P>
<P>
   It was May 21 that a front-page article appeared about
Massachusetts' Community Newspaper Co. under Hirsch's byline. It
was headlined ``Paper Tiger?/ Fidelity Tries to Build/ A Newspaper
Empire/ Delivers Only Losses/Mutual Fund Giant Spends/Big. But Some
Advertisers Aren't Buying Its Story/It Sees Better Times Ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   By most measures, it was an excellent story, confirming and
extending the conventional wisdom about the chain of Massachusetts
newspapers that a Fidelity unit had assembled in the early 1990s: a
business plan that had not yet worked as had been hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch reported that according to ``people familiar with its
books,'' Fidelity had spent about $150 million buying newspapers,
but that in 1997 the &UR;  &LR; company had lost about $5 million before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amorization, on revenues of about
$100 million. In the two previous years, the company had lost $22.6
million on the same basis, he &UR;  &LR; stated.
</P>
<P>
   The story had a certain critical edge that was difficult to
miss. It disparaged the lack of newspaper culture among the
Fidelity executives who ran the chain. It noted their inability to
sell much advertising space to Fidelity's investment side. It
concluded darkly that ``Fidelity's tolerance for CNC's struggles
isn't inexhaustible.'' It had, in other words, all the hallmarks of
a story facilitated, at least in part, by rivalry within the ranks
of the mutual fund giant, among whose investment side managers
Hirsch enjoyed a generally excellent reputation. (Community News is
an outgrowth of Fidelity's formerly small venture capital unit.)
The story could have benefitted Dow Jones' Ottaway newspaper
subsidiary as well.
</P>
<P>
   William R. Elfers, Community Newspaper's chief executive,
responded with a three-page letter to the managing editor of the
Journal, alleging a dozen errors. A month later, three corrections
appeared. None went to the heart of the story, but each had
slightly overstated the negative case.
</P>
<P>
   Readership was estimated to be 1.4 million, not ``about one
million.'' A majority of the 129 newspapers _ broadsheets, tabs and
advertising circulars _ had negative cash flow when they were
acquired, not positive. And of 37 employees who were laid off in
1997, only two were ad salespeople, not all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed that there were only three (corrections,)''
says Elfers. ``Still, how many times do you see that in a story?
Three gross errors, things that are not just wrong but damaging?''
</P>
<P>
   Did the Community News corrections influence the Journal's
decision to fire Hirsh over the Times' complaint? Dow Jones
declines to comment. So does Hirsch, though some friends insist the
Fidelity story played no part.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Journal, however, a good many heads are shaking.
Granted that the paper's news pages are prouder than any other of
their reputation for fairness and accuracy. But wouldn't a
two-month suspension have served just as well?

EXPATRIATE FAMILIES GETTING MORE ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As global trade as grown, corporate America is doing a lot more
to prepare executives for overseas assignments and that means
responding to the needs of spouses and children.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, Boston-based Gillette Co.
</P>
<P>
   After an executive is selected for overseas travel, Gillette
sends the employee and spouse overseas for a weeklong inspection
orientation visit designed to help the family look at schooling,
housing, and neighborhoods and help them iron out relocation
concerns before a permanent move is made, says Frank O'Connell,
director of global compensation for Gillette.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, meanwhile, Windham International, a consulting firm
that specializes in helping executives relocate abroad, says
revenue from executive relocation overseas now accounts for 42
percent of its sales revenue. The company assigns employees'
spouses and children advocates, or ``buddies'' who meet them at the
airport and serve as friends, confidantes and allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there are even special programs for teens, and the
reason is that the whole success of the transfer depends on family
support. If the family isn't happy, the assignment won't last''
says Ilene Dolins, senior vice president of Windham, a privately
held firm.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, when the Employee Relocation Council in Washington,
D.C., polled company executives to determine why foreign
assignments fail, few, if any, employers were paying attention to
relocation services or counseling for expatriate families.
</P>
<P>
   Not surpising, ERC's survey results revealed as much. It found
that the foreign assignments of more than 60 percent of US
employees had failed because spouses and family members were unable
to adjust to the move.
</P>
<P>
   Although current statistics are not available, specialists say
more companies are paying attention to the problem by focusing
attention on trailing spouses and children.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study of 400 international executives by Berlitz
International Inc. and the Virginia-based Institute for
International Human Resorces, the typical expatriate is male (84
percent), between 39 and 45, (57 percent), and married with a
spouse or family that will accompany him or her on assignment (82
percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``Very often the spouse needs training more than the employee,''
says Michael McCallum, national director of business development
for Berlitz International Inc. ``Typically, the employee will have
a network of people to talk to. But the spouse is going to have to
keep the home together and negotiate outside the house on a daily
basis. If relocation fails, it is because a family member is
unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   To assist employees in the transition, Berlitz does
cross-cultural training and language instruction for the entire
family _ a significant change from the company's early reputation
as an international language institute that focused primarily on
offering instruction to the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Dolins recalls the story of an employee who returned home
abruptly after only one year, several months after his wife threw
up her hands and returned to the United States. Alone and
increasingly isolated, she grew resentful. ``His wife hopped a
plane after only two months abroad and now they are getting a
divorce,'' says Dolins. ``He felt the whole family fell apart
because of the assignment.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Monterey International Institute in California, employers
pay a minimum of $9,000 for a six-week language bootcamp that
teaches the executive the host company's language and also prepares
his or her spouse, and children to live abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs companies a fortune to send someone overseas,'' says
Jeannie Watts, program manager for custom language services at the
Monterey institute. ``It is a much better investment if the
expatriate and his family are able to speak the language,
understand the culture and are not living in an Enlish speaking
ghetto where they cannot communicate with anyone, but people who
speak English.''
</P>
<P>
   Students refer to the courses as ``bootcamps'' because Monterey
suggests that executives divorce themselves from the firm, stay
away from the office, and disconnect the telephone during the six
weeks. Some are so committed to the process they stay in area
hotels. Others, typically executives from foreign countries who are
learning English, are placed in American host homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty years ago, there were fewer comapnies doing this,''
says Watts. Now, all types of companies are working internationally
to compete and they are asking for language and cultural
instruction.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Watts, the most popular language program these days
is Chinese. Although the trend to study Russian has dropped, the
demand has picked up among oil companies with oil fields in
Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, a lot of expatriates lived in English speaking
ghettos,'' says Watts. ``They connected in American schools in
foreign cities, and moved to American communities abroad. But they
did not always appreciate and enjoy their assignments because they
were really living in isolation.''

ROCK STILL IN A HARD PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Times are such that even the slightest increase in business is
cause for joy at a local racetrack. Such is the case at Rockingham
Park, which concluded a 100-program meet Sunday with the overall
handle up 1 percent and attendance up 2 percent, reversing a recent
trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased,'' said Rock vice president Ed Callahan.
``I think we ran a good program, averaging $87,000 a day in purses.
We had very good, competitive racing and we had a full barn area
all season. I thought racing director Bob DeStasio and racing
secretary Jim Pambianchi did a real nice job. Things went very,
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   As glad as management is to record modest gains, it knows all
too well that Rock, like Suffolk Downs, continues to be squeezed by
other gambling venues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that we were up by more than 1 percent in June
and July, but when we got into the first and second week of August,
things began to tail off a little bit,'' said Callahan. ``The
differences this year from last were the introduction of a gambling
cruise boat from Gloucester and the opening of fair racing earlier
than usual this summer in Western Massachusetts, either of which
could have had an effect on us.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1992, when Foxwoods opened, we lost 40 percent of our
business. As far away as they are, the casinos in Connecticut hurt
us. With casino gambling coming closer, as with the boat, it has to
have some impact. And don't forget there is a casino in Montreal.
We lose as many people to the Montreal casino as we do to Foxwoods.
We are surrounded on all sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock dearly would love to get video slot machines, as the
popular Lincoln Greyhound Park in Rhode Island features. The idea
of slot machines went nowhere in New Hampshire this year. However,
with the Granite State undergoing a rigorous debate over improving
education, Rock officials hope for a chance in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislature, which is normaly out from June through
January, has had a number of special sessions on the education
issue, which has reached the constitutional stage, this fall, but
they have not looked into how to fund it,'' said Callahan. ``We are
hopeful that electronic gaming will receive the appropriate
consideration when funding is discussed. There is always a chance.
Whether it will be achieved or not is always a question.''
</P>
<P>
   Slots would be a home run for local racing, but there are other
things that government can do to help an industry that is so
heavily taxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a constant battle, it's tough, not just for ourselves,
but for the horsemen,'' said Callahan. ``The horsemen need better
purses to survive. The only way we have of doing better is to grow
the product. Give us the tools to keep it going, be it slots or
phone betting or whatever else. We are such a regulated industry
that we don't currently have the ability to fight our
competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A horse shoo-in
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It appears that justice has been served early this year, as Skip
Away, robbed of the Horse of the Year title in 1997, all but
clinched this year's top Eclipse Award with his convincing win over
a top field in the Woodward Stakes at Belmont Park last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Last time, enough Eclipse voters were fooled by Favorite Trick's
record (8 for 8) to vote him Horse of the Year, even though
2-year-olds run only against those their own age, don't carry
weight, and don't run past 9 furlongs. The only other 2-year-old
ever to win the award was Secretariat, which demonstrates how high
the bar should be for a juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   But Skip Away, 7 for 7 this year and on a nine-race winning
streak overall, is about to become the first horse in history to go
over the $10 million mark in earnings and has little to fear this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else could you give him to do?,'' said Sonny Hine,
trainer of Skip Away, immediately following the Woodward. ``Even if
someone else wins the Breeders' Cup, it wouldn't be enough. He's
won five Grade I races this year (as well as a Grade II and a Grade
III), and carried all that weight (as much as 131 pounds). I don't
know who else it could be. I just don't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard-pressed conspiracy theorists could come up with only one
long shot scenario that would deny Skip Away. Awesome Again, a top
3-year-old in '97, started late this season but is 4 for 4,
including the Whitney and Saratoga Breeders' Cup. If Awesome Again
were to beat Skip Away in the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup at
Belmont Oct. 10 and again in the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic
at Churchill Downs Nov. 7, he would end the year 6 for 6, with a
2-0 edge head to head. However, even that may not be enough to deny
the big gray, who has been racing hard since the Donn Handicap at
Gulfstream Park Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Byrne, who trains Awesome Again, knows that his charge must
defeat Skip Away twice to have any chance. It will be up to him and
owner Frank Stronach to come to the Jockey Club and throw down the
gauntlet. If they choose to go instead in the Hawthorne Gold Cup,
run the same day, the race for Horse of the Year is over,
regardless of what Skip Away does in his final two starts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Solid investment
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Thoroughbred Corp., headed by Prince Ahmed Salman, has
bought a ``substantial'' interest in Skip Away for breeding
purposes. The announcement was made after Skip Away's Woodward
tally by Rick Tronz, who will stand Skip Away at stud next year at
his Hopewell Farm in Midway, Ky. Thoroughbred Corp. also bought a
yearling who is a full brother to Skip Away at last week's
Keeneland September sales ... Rudy Baez won the Rock riding title
for the 10th time in 13 years with 112 victories, while Ron Dandy
won his second consecutive training title, saddling 46 winners.

GLENN IS CONTENT WITH RUNNING DIFFERENT ROUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES

   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Terry Glenn knows people tend to worry about
him. That is especially true of the people who are paying him large
sums of money to play football. What they worry about is how what
he does affects how well he plays.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn tends to worry about himself, his sister, his young son,
and his God. He doesn't worry much about the people who are paying
him large sums of money to play football. What he worries about is
how what he does will affect the people he's responsible for. His
theory is that if he worries about them, that should end everyone
else's worries about him.
</P>
<P>
   If you think about it, that makes more sense than a demand he
perform supervised bench presses for $400 a week in the middle of
March, 1,000 miles from his young son. It makes sense because if he
takes care of his business, where he does it is not that important.
What's important is that he does it, although Glenn has learned not
everyone shares that point of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a well-balanced family life the concern about me
might not be so much,'' Glenn said Monday while reflecting on why
he became the target of so many questions and concerns within the
Patriots organization over his decision to spend much of his time
conditioning himself alone rather than in New England's offseason
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know I'm on my own and I think they feel I might be too
immature to take care of myself. That's what separates you from
being mature or immature, but if you have pride in yourself you'll
do all you can to perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a little sister living with me. I have a son with my
name. They're my responsibility. They're my priority. If I do what
I have to do to take care of that priority it should take care of
the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Long into training camp whispers kept coming from inside the
organization that Glenn had not participated as the team had hoped
in its conditioning work. It was mentioned that he was coming off a
injury-plagued season that threatened to thwart his vast potential
if it became a pattern, and many wondered out loud if he'd
dedicated himself enough to the rigors of his job or if he even
recognized fully what those rigors were.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn read those comments. He heard the whispers. He is neither
blind nor deaf. Yet he walked his own road because he has been a
lonely traveler on that road for much of his life, alone since long
before he was a man.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's belief was Glenn needed to become stronger to
avoid injury because at 185 pounds he is slight by NFL standards.
While that might be true, Glenn thought back on the injuries that
cut his production to 27 catches after he pulled in 90 as a rookie
in 1996 and remembered how a diving Mark Montreuil had fallen
across the back of his legs in the season opener. He remembered
coming back on the bad ankle that resulted and scoring a touchdown
on his next reception before being sidelined for the better part of
the next three weeks because of it.
</P>
<P>
   Could their offseason program prevent a sprained ankle?
</P>
<P>
   He remembered catching 24 passes over the next six games,
including an explosive reminder of what his potential is when he
caught seven for 163 yards (23.3 yards per catch) against the
defending Super Bowl champion Packers before being poked in the eye
against the Vikings and pulling his hamstring a week later, an
injury that kept him out of five full games and for most of the
season-finale against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Would their offseason program prevent a poke in the eye? A
hamstring pull?
</P>
<P>
   Then he returned one last time, catching nine passes in two
playoff games, including five for 96 yards (19.2 yard average)
against Pittsburgh before he was slammed to the turf and broke his
collarbone, ending a season he'd rather forget.
</P>
<P>
   Would their offseason program prevent a broken collarbone?
</P>
<P>
   Some in the organization theorized it might, but Glenn doubted
it. If so, why did Garrison Hearst, one of the strongest backs in
the NFL, sustain the same collarbone injury? If so, why are so many
players sidelined with hamstring pulls every year?
</P>
<P>
   Yet Glenn tried, for a time, to adhere to the Patriots' wishes.
He showed up for the start of the conditioning regimen in
Foxborough, even though he feared some of what he was being asked
to do might slow him down.
</P>
<P>
   He did what they were asking but he wondered about it because
Glenn knows what got him into the NFL and made him a millionaire at
23 was not his strength. It was his speed, his hands and his
agility, not the ability to bench press a refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, he believes it has been his decisions in life
that kept him afloat after the murder of his mother, the only
parent he ever really had, when he was 13. His decisions, not
others'. He believes in what Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote about.
He believes in self-reliance. So he wondered.
</P>
<P>
   And then one day he went home. He went home for a lot of reasons
but he went home and brought out his orange cones and went to work.
He worked on his speed and his agility and, to a lesser degree, his
strength. He did what he thought was right and didn't do what he
thought wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   When he got to Smithfield, R.I., in July, he was light a few
thousand dollars in conditioning bonuses he hadn't earned by
choosing to stay closer to his son than to Patriot strength coach
Johnny Parker, but he was in shape. People in the organization
could whisper of their disappoiment at his choices, but no one
could say he wasn't ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   That was Glenn's first goal all along. To simply be able to
play. After three weeks he's played in 66 percent more games than
he was in this time a year ago and Sunday he was again the Terry
Glenn of 1996, the game-breaker everyone believes he can be.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn went 51 yards with one catch, making the right read
against a blitzing Oilers defense and adjusting a post pattern into
a short slant that turned into a long touchdown that won the game.
This would not have been his first bomb of the year had Drew
Bledsoe not overthrown him on at least two other occasions but that
doesn't concern him. At this stage, he's happy simply to be fit to
play.
</P>
<P>
   But to receive the blessing of fitness he had to work first. And
so he did. The way he does most things. Alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main focus was to get here in shape and be injury free for
the Monday night game (against Denver),'' Glenn said. ``Now it's to
get back to performing the way I did my rookie year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the Lord wants me to be patient. I had two years
where things happened so fast that I got to believing what so many
people were saying because I thought those things, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have time to think about what I was doing. I started
to believe, like everyone else, that I could do so much. Too much.
God gave me a lot of success when I needed it. Now I believe He
thought it was time for other things to happen. The injuries
humbled me. It woke me up to some things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year wasn't a good year but it was a good thing. Before
that I was just riding along. Then the injuries came and things
changed. People said things about me. They doubted me the way
people always have.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I went away and worked on my own. I been doing things on my
own for the longest time. It's not that I don't need anybody or
won't listen to anybody. I just feel strongest on my own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my team but I don't think about the organizaton first.
I think about my sister and my son first. I don't want to be on the
sidelines so my sister has to hear about her brother at her school.
I know the expectations for me are there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some ideas what can help me and what can hurt me and I
felt some of the things I was being asked to do coming off my
shoulder injury would hurt me. But I also have respect for J.P.
(Parker). If I stayed here I would have done what they asked even
though I didn't agree with it, so I left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't tell them I felt they were hurting me. It's hard
for me to say no to people. I don't want to let people down. So I
had to get away and do it on my own. Do the things that got me
here. I did and I got to see my son all the time, too. If I'd
stayed in New England I wouldn't have gotten to see him. The fact
is conditioning is about doing it. If you don't, you'll pay. Not
just the team pays. You'll pay. So why wouldn't I do it where I
was?
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I come back and read in Sports Illustrated that people
are disappointed with me. I don't like to feel I disappointed
anyone. I like to make people happy. But what were they
disappointed about? I was ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn thus far has stayed injury free and his 12 catches for 198
yards lead the team, as do his two touchdown receptions and
16.5-yards-per-catch average. Although he dropped two passes
against the Colts and one in Denver and was less than pleased about
it, he has done what he trained himself to do. He has stayed on the
field and showed Sunday that he remains the Patriots' most
dangerous weapon when he gets the ball in stride with room to run.
</P>
<P>
   But Terry Glenn is trying not to think too much about that, just
as he's trying not to fixate on a number that is haunting him. He
knows the 90 catches of his rookie year have become his measuring
stick in the eyes of those who worry about how he runs his life.
</P>
<P>
   He knows it is just a number, and frankly not one you often
reach, yet it has framed him and so he must face it the way he did
last year's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one sees 90 balls every year but guys like Jerry Rice and
Herman Moore,'' Glenn said. ``There's only a handful of guys who
ever did that. Once you've done it four or five times, then you can
talk about catching 90 balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy to stay on the field. I'm happy just to have
the opportunity to drop balls after last year because if I'm not on
the field I can't even do that. I don't take for granted any more
that I can be out there, but I know what it takes to get me going.
I know how to get the best out of me and I know if I do that they
won't have to worry about Terry Glenn any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is going to tell everything. Days go by. Weeks go by.
Months go by. I made a choice to go home and get ready on my own. I
made a choice to be near my son and do my work. That's how you open
the maturity door. If I do a good job this year, maybe there won't
be a question next time about me. Right now people will say what
they want, but if I handle my business they won't have nothing to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing but look at Terry run.

   But NOW loses me when it declares that Clinton's behavior was
not sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Monica Lewinsky went beyond tacky when she showed Clinton
the straps to her thong underwear. But Clinton was not compelled to
follow her lead.
</P>
<P>
   As leader of the free world, he more than any chief executive
should have known better than to diddle with a White House intern,
no less one who was just a few years older than his own daughter.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't far behind most people ready to chastise Lewinsky for
her naivete. Or was it cunning and manipulation?
</P>
<P>
   As I read excerpts of the report compiled by independent counsel
Kenneth Starr, it has been difficult to discern the difference. But
as psychologists, Lewinsky's friends and other observers have
dissected the report, Clinton's paramour emerges as an emotionally
immature, starstruck young woman who got in over her head.
</P>
<P>
   My annoyance with NOW's position notwithstanding, Lewinsky is no
victim, at least not in the sense with which a woman I'll call Mary
is most familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the women I work with, they're true victims,'' Mary
says. ``They're ... black and blue. They've had horrendous acts
committed against them. They have huge obstacles to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to advocate for them,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lewinsky is a tragic figure. ``I don't want to discount
her pain and victimization,'' Mary says.
</P>
<P>
   Mary works with women who've been abused by their partners. She
also voted for Clinton. More so than many other women who count
themselves among Clinton's supporters, her competing loyalties have
brought her to an uncertain crossroads as the president's crisis
surely brought NOW.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an advocate for women, it is a real dilemma,'' she says.
``I want to be objective. I don't want to assume the woman is
necessary always in the right.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Lewinsky's behavior, as she detailed it to the grand
jury, doesn't make it easy for Mary and others who might allow her
a sympathetic view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have sympathy for Monica Lewinsky because she was immature
and she was young,'' Mary says. ``But she, to me, was the pursuer
and aggressor in the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the bigger louse. After observing the president and
studying his history, Mary is convinced he's a user, if not abuser,
of women. So am I.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not hitting them,'' she points out, ``but there are many
ways to abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the `grown-up' in this,'' Mary adds. ``He had the
power.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony of it all is Clinton's impressive record of appointing
women and minorities to positions of responsibility throughout his
administration, a record NOW undoubtedly wants to protect. But at
what cost? Will NOW and other Clinton supporters simply avert their
eyes when it's just too painful to watch?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a contradiction,'' Mary says. ``The very man who
helps them turns around and uses them for his own personal gain.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``A person who does that is a real user of people.''
The more I see of this nation's president, the more I'm sadly
convinced she's right.

COACHING CHANGES ARE AFOOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Major League Soccer general managers are attempting to
achieve dramatic effects with coaching changes, they are
succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Fusion made a most timely change when they replaced
Cacho Cordoba with Ivo Wortmann, the Revolution a most spontaneous
change when Walter Zenga took over for Thomas Rongen. And the
MetroStars might top everyone with Monday's announcement that
Velibor (Bora) Milutinovic will replace Alfonso Mondelo.
</P>
<P>
   Milutinovic was to arrive in New York last night to begin
preparing for the final regular-season game, Saturday night against
the Revolution at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   There is a theory about changing horses in midstream, but it
does not apply to the MetroStars, who qualified for the playoffs
under Mondelo. A recent slump that included a 5-0 loss to D.C.
United indicates that Mondelo might have taken this team as far as
he could, and it was time to go to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bora has a reputation of being the best to coach a team where
it's going into a tournament,'' MetroStars general manager Charlie
Stillitano said. ``And let's face it, we're going into a
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Milutinovic developed that reputation on the national team
level, with Costa Rica, Mexico, and the United States. But then, he
had several weeks or years to develop a strategy. For the MLS
playoffs, Milutinovic has until a Sept. 30 visit to Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   This might seem almost like a capricious move, but it gives a
indication about the competitive intentions of MLS teams.
Stillitano's brother, Leo, made a similarly ruthless decision in
Miami in late July, and the team has prospered. Zenga was offered
the Revolution position after the team honored him at halftime Aug.
22; his hiring revived the team's credibility but was too late to
salvage playoff chances.
</P>
<P>
   Since the league's budget limits the impact of big-name player
signings, these coaching moves have been excellent generators of
publicity, the most effective means of transcending borders.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, these changes are all likely to produce
positive on-field results.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars have gone this route before with Carlos Queiroz
and Carlos Alberto Parreira. This time, the strategy could work
because (a) expectations are realistic, and (b) the MetroStars have
sufficient personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars' essential problems have stemmed from an identity
crisis relating to the enormous success of the New York Cosmos in
the '70s and '80s. They are members of a league with modest means
attempting to attain cosmic standards.
</P>
<P>
   Milutinovic and Zenga are popular figures globally, and they
also will attract attention from quarters outside soccer. They have
infectious personalities and, like Wortmann, enormous reputations.
Though Milutinovic is a coaching gypsy, he has much to prove after
his experience with Nigeria in the World Cup ended with a
humiliating loss to Denmark.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Barcelona survives
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barcelona survived a difficult week with ties at Manchester
United (3-3) in the Champions League and Real Madrid (2-2) in the
Spanish League. The Real Madrid-Barcelona game featured Dutch
coaches Guus Hiddink and Louis Van Gaal and only seven Spanish
players. There were six Dutchmen and four Brazilians, though
Roberto Carlos was suspended for Real Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of those Brazilians will play for the national team
when coach Wanderley Luxemburgo makes his debut against Yugoslavia
in the northern city of Sao Luis tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's attack will be based on the midfield play of
Barcelona's Rivaldo, who played for Luxemburgo with Palmeiras.
Holdovers from the second-place World Cup team include defender
Cafu (Roma) and midfielders Denilson (Real Betis), Emerson (Bayer
Leverkusen), and Rivaldo. The strikers are Brazil-based Marcelinho
Carioca (Corinthians), Christian (Internacional), and Fabio Junior
and Muller (Cruzeiro).
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo's first two games with Inter since his mysterious
no-show in the World Cup final were uninspiring. Real Madrid
humbled Inter, 2-0, in the Champions League, then Ronaldo scored on
a penalty kick in a 1-0 Serie A win over Piacenza.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A loaded Arsenal
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Manchester United is among the world's most famous and valuable
teams, but Arsenal is the best team in England.
</P>
<P>
   Arsenal, which won the league and cup double last season, took a
3-0 victory over Manchester United Sunday on goals by Tony Adams,
Frenchman Nicholas Anelka, and Swede Ljungberg.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two are honored
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only two US players were named to the International Federation
of Football History and Statistics CONCACAF team of the century _
San Jose striker Eric Wynalda and the late Adelino ``Billy''
Gonsalves, a Fall River native who was the US' top player in the
1930 and '34 World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   Gonsalves, whose parents emigrated from the Madeira Islands, was
among the most sought-after American players of his time. He
refused offers in Brazil after the '30 World Cup in Uruguay, where
the US finished in third place, and played with the top teams in
the American Soccer League.
</P>
<P>
   The finalists for the CONCACAF player of the century award are
the late Luis ``El Pirata'' Fuente, Carlos Hermosillo of the Los
Angeles Galaxy, and Hugo Sanchez, five-time scoring champion in
Spain with Real Madrid and formerly with the San Diego Sockers of
the North American Soccer League and Dallas Burn of the MLS.

IN THE BIG EAST, THINGS ARE LOOKING UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The doomsayers are gone _ for now, at least. Instead of talking
about the future, Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese is talking
about the present and the immediate past, which includes some
impressive nonconference wins, at least one team worthy of Top 10
consideration, and five of eight teams receiving poll votes.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened to the Big East?
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I've been saying all along, it's cyclical,'' said
Tranghese Monday. ``We've got some teams who can play, some teams
who are getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   Tranghese feels good about his league, and he should. Miami,
despite its self-destructive loss to Virginia Tech Saturday, is
getting better. Syracuse is a last-second loss to Tennessee _ one
that looks better after Tennesse's victory over Florida _ away from
a Top 5 ranking.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia and Virginia Tech are solid teams that should have
good and perhaps even great years, and Pittsburgh and Boston
College are moving up rather than down.
</P>
<P>
   Only Temple and Rutgers have failed to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look around and you can see improvement all around,'' said
Tranghese. ``At BC, (Tom O'Brien's) handprints are all over, and
the same thing has happened at Pittsburgh, where Walt Harris has
made them much better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if they had to pick a Heisman winner right now, I'm not
sure if (Syracuse quarterback) Donovan McNabb wouldn't win it or be
right there.''
</P>
<P>
   All this optimism from a man who was running a league that most
thought was on life-support a year ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago we had all the same questions but we didn't have
any answers,'' said Tranghese. ``It's still early yet, but if you
look around the country, I think we're doing all right. The ACC is
struggling somewhat and the Big Ten after Ohio State is having some
problems. I think we can go out and play with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Tranghese deserves as much credit as anyone for the turnaround.
His message to the coaches and athletic directors was go out and
play good teams. Which most, if not all, of the Big East schools
have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three things can happen when you play people,'' said
Tranghese. ``You can win, you can get killed, or you can lose in a
competitive game.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, all of those have happened. Ohio State beat up West
Virginia, but the Buckeyes are No. 1, and have been living up to
that ranking. Syracuse has lost a close big game and won a big
game, falling to Tennessee and beating Michigan. BC has beaten
average to below-average teams, and Pittsburgh has been competitive
(it lost, 20-13, to Penn State Saturday).
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that we have some programs who over the
long run have had some success and they're getting better,'' said
Tranghese.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A busy man
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Miami linebacker Dan Morgan is turning into a big-time stud. The
sophomore had 15 tackles against Virginia Tech Saturday night, the
third consecutive game in which he has had 14 or more ... Although
Pittsburgh lost, the atmosphere at Pitt Stadium had a big-game feel
to it. The crowd of 56,743 was the largest home crowd for the
Panthers since 1989 ... Rutgers had better beat Army Saturday
because it could be the Scarlet Knights' only good opportunity for
a Division 1 win this season. A loss surely will seal coach Terry
Shea's fate (if it hasn't already been sealed) ... Here's the
meaningless stat of the year. In its 70-14 loss, Rutgers topped
Syracuse in passing yardage, 174-164 ... Syracuse (and North
Andover) fullback Rob Konrad's three touchdowns against Rutgers
matched his total from last season ... The 70 points scored by the
Orangemen were the most ever in a Big East game and the second-most
by a conference team overall ... Give credit to Virginia Tech. The
Hokies not only hung in for a 27-20 overtime win but also limited
the potent Miami rushing attack to 37 yards. The Hokies have beaten
Miami four straight times _ the first team to do that since Notre
Dame from 1977-80 ... Miami has a tough stretch beginning with
Saturday's game against UCLA. Three of the Hurricanes' next four
opponents are in the Top 25.

EXECUTIVES' LOSSES DON'T LOOK GOOD ON PAPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you think your investment portfolio has taken a few lumps
this summer?
</P>
<P>
   Average investors suffered setbacks in their mutual funds and
brokerage accounts as global financial jitters squeezed the stock
market. But if misery loves company, we found it with lots of zeros
attached in the portfolios of some of the state's richest business
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Several chief executives, with giant financial stakes in the
companies they lead, have lost hundreds of millions of dollars on
paper between the time the stock market reached its peak July 17
and last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   They all remain fabulously wealthy and could easily recover
their paper losses if the market changed course. But the dimensions
of their short-term setbacks are mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   One example: Peter Nicholas and John Abele, the billionaire
cofounders of Boston Scientific Corp., a Natick, Mass. instrument
company. On paper, Nicholas and his family lost an estimated $387
million since July 17. Abele and his family suffered estimated
paper losses of about $366 million.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is software executive Alan Trefler, the chief
executive of Pegasystems Inc., who, with his wife, Pam, has made
large and high-profile donations to Boston public schools. Trefler,
who owns 75 percent of the shares in his publicly traded company,
suffered a $255 million setback on paper since July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Among nine executives, selected because of their large, publicly
disclosed stock holdings, seven of them have lost money since the
July market top. Four have suffered paper losses over the last 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   The results, which do not reflect other investments or assets
executives may own, are based on stock holdings reported in the
latest proxies issued by their companies. Several extremely wealthy
executives at private companies, such as Fidelity Investments
chairman Edward Johnson III and his daughter, Abigail Johnson, are
not included on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Desite the daunting dollars involved in the paper losses, many
of the setbacks are well within the percentage declines suffered in
the overall market during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index declined in price by 14 percent
since July 17 and the Nasdaq index lost 17.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Nicholas and Abele only lost 15 percent in the value of
their Boston Scientific stock and those holdings have actually
appreciated by more than $50 million apiece over the last 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   Amos Hostetter, who made a fortune in cable television, suffered
a paper loss of $126 million in his holdings of MediaOne Group
stock. But that decline represented less than a 5 percent decline
in value. Hostetter's stake has actually appreciated by nearly $1.4
billion over the last 12 months, to an estimated total of $2.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But other paper losses have cut deeper. Trefler's interest in
Pegasystems has shed 40 percent since July 17 and is off nearly 45
percent in the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Paper losses of about $132 million suffered by Reebok
International chief Paul Fireman and his wife, Phyllis, since July
17 represented a 48 percent decline. Reebok shares have plunged by
70 percent over the last year, cutting the Fireman holdings by $348
million.
</P>
<P>
   Losses of $83 million for Abraham Gosman and his two sons are
calculated over three public companies in which they own
substantial stakes. A recent, sharp rally in one of those
companies, Carematrix Corp., actually trimmed the losses.
Carematrix stock has jumped by more than $10 per share to 23 7/8 in
the last six days.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market's summertime blues did not cost everyone money.
Stock held by former EMC chief Richard Egan and his wife actually
appreciated by $5 million during the summer to $380 million. The
Egans' stock gained about $142 million over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest winner of all was a local native who does most
of his business in New York now. Viacom Inc. chief Sumner
Redstone's shares appreciated by $186 million since July 17 alone.
</P>
<P>
   The Viacom stock is actually owned by National Amusements Inc.
of Dedham, Mass., which counts Redstone as its controlling
shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   That Viacom stock, which had struggled for two years, has nearly
doubled in the last 12 months and boosted Redstone's stake by more
than $3 billion to a total of $6.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   State Street Research &AMP; Management is giving you another chance
to get in on its Aurora Fund _ if you dare. The company said the
$400 million small-cap fund, closed last year, will reopen to new
investors on Oct. 1 and remain open until Dec. 31 or until assets
reach $750 million, whichever comes first.
</P>
<P>
   Aurora is one of a number of small-cap funds that have announced
they are reopening amid an expectation of a rebound in these
stocks. That hasn't happened yet: The Russell 2000, a good
benchmark for small caps, was down 17.1 percent this year through
Friday; Aurora was down 21 percent.

SHE NEVER SAID, `THANK YOU' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this year of the Titanic, the stories seem to never stop. Two
recent books are filled with tales about the doomed ship, the
people who survived, and those who didn't.
</P>
<P>
   One of those storytellers was a forgotten survivor _ forgotten
until decades after the 1912 tragedy, when she delivered her
written recollections to ship historian John Maxtone-Graham. He, in
turn, has annotated and published them as ``Titanic Survivor'': The
Newly Discovered Memoirs of Violet Jessop Who Survived Both the
Titanic and Britannic Disasters'' (Sheridan Press, $23.95). Here is
one tale about Jessop, who was an ocean liner stewardess, that
Maxtone-Graham related as a guest speaker aboard the Grand Princess
cruise ship:
</P>
<P>
   After making it to a lifeboat, Jessop was given a baby to hold,
and she cradled that child in her arms all through that long and
awful night. Once aboard the rescue ship Carpathia, the baby was
returned to her mother _ who never once said ``thank you'' to
Jessop during the three-day voyage to New York. And that was the
end of that ... almost. Many years later, retired and living in
rural England, Jessop got a phone call at 3 a.m. A woman asked,
``Is this Violet Jessop who was a stewardess on the Titanic and
brought a baby to the (rescue) ship?'' ``Yes,'' said Jessop. The
caller laughed, said, ``I was that baby!'' and hung up. When Jessop
related this, she was told that perhaps the call was a joke. How
could it be, she replied: Until then, she had never told anyone
about the child she cradled at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Another source for Titanic lore is Logan Marshall, whose
original 1912 book, ``The Sinking of the Titanic,'' was published
within weeks of the disaster that killed more than 1,500. The book
has been abridged and edited for modern readers by Bruce M. Caplan
and republished by Seattle Miracle Press (paperback, $12.95).
According to Marshall's account, the ship was on fire from the
moment it left Southampton, and that probably contributed to the
disaster. And what's this about women and children first? Marshall
reports men being shot on deck as they attempted to board
lifeboats. Yet, there was also remarkable calm as the end neared,
and Caplan has a theory about that, which he shared with us: ``Sure
there was panic in the end, but people like Astor, Guggenheim, and
Straus (Mr. and Mrs.) were very calm. My theory is that most people
in 1912 took opiates (which were legal then) with them when they
went on an ocean voyage. They didn't have the wonderful drugs that
we have today, and if the seas became rough, opiates would be their
main salvation!! My theory is that when most of the people realized
that the ship was going down, and there was no hope of rescue, they
took an opiate.''

   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Quotable: &LR;  ``The boat sank _ get over it!'' _ T-shirt spoofing the
Titanic craze.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Snappy slogan: &LR;  ``Titanic _ the Artifact Exhibition,'' at the World
Trade Center in Boston through Nov. 1, has added the recently
recovered 16-ton section of the ship's outer hull to the exhibit.
Thus, the exhibitors proclaim, ``It's a Hull New Show!''

 &UR; Calling all trios: &LR;  To celebrate the launch of the Sea Princess _

Princess Cruises has launched a ``Sea to Sea Search for Terrific
Trios.'' The Pointer Sisters, a legendary trio themselves, will
help pick the most talented threesomes from among 20 national
finalists. Trios can be dancers, singers, musicians, jugglers,
magicians, or just about anything else. Those 20 finalists (who can
be amateurs or professionals) will receive an all-expense paid trip
to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., during the week of Dec. 15 to participate
in Sea Princess inaugural festivities. The grand-prize threesome
will win a seven-day Princess Caribbean cruise. Contestants should
submit a video performance no more than five minutes long (on
half-inch VHS tape), along with a 100-word statement about why
their trio is terrific and their name, address, phone number, ages,
and a photo. Send it all to Sea to Sea Search for Terrific Trios,
c/o Porter Novelli, 220 East 42nd St., 8th Floor, New York, NY

NANTUCKET: FESTIVE IN THE FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nantucket in the fall is special. Not only are there off-season
values in inns but the weather is fine and the island is festive.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders point out that unlike the short-lived fall foliage
displays of northern New England, Nantucket's distinctive autumn
palette of rare wildflowers, bayberies, beach plums, and scub oak
flourishes well into November.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen find October and November perfect for striped bass and
bluefish.
</P>
<P>
   The island also celebrates with a Cranberry Harvest Festival,
Oct. 16-18. In October, the island's vast cranberry bogs (before it
was divided, the Milestone Bog was the largest in the world) are
flooded, and millions of wine-red berries bob to the surface. It is
then the harvest begins. On Harvest Weekend, visitors are open to
the public to watch the harvest take place.
</P>
<P>
   For information about accommodations, call 508-228-0925 and ask
about midweek values and Getaway Packages. The island is easily
reached by airplane or ferry. One-hour high-speed ferry service is
also available.

Susannah's quilts
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the most astonishing quilts in Old Sturbridge Village's
exhibition, ``Northern Comfort: New England's Early Quilts
1780-1850'' is composed of approximately 12,000 miniature pieces,
many only the size of a dime. The Quilt is believed to have been
created by Susannah Allen Anderson Howard of Ware, Mass.
Aesthetically, Susannah's miniature-pieced quilt also shows the
growth of an American quilting tradition, said Lynne Bassett, the
village's curator of textiles and fine arts. The quilt has a
central medallion design typical of English-style quilting, but
also layers of block-pieced bordrs that feature 15 designs. ``Her
quilt is a predecessor of the block-pieced quilting style that is
now recognizably American,'' said Bassett. The quilt is one of more
than 40 on display through Jan. 3. Old Sturbridge Village is
particularly beautiful in foliage season. The 1830s' village is in
Stuirbridge near the intersection of the Mass. Turnpike and
Interstate 84. For information, call 800-SEE-1830.

GROWING NUMBER OF EXPERTS ATTEST TO PAIN THERAPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Illinois, Georgia.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ If you haven't heard of prolotherapy, you're not
alone. In fact, many mainstream physicians aren't aware of this
controversial approach to treating chronic pain, especially back
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of way out there,'' said Dr. Howard Smith, director
of pain management at Albany Medical Center. ``I don't think it
will ever be completely standard.''
</P>
<P>
   A small, yet growing group of patients and doctors, including
former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, swear by it. They claim
prolotherapy is often a better and more affordable alternative to
cortisone injections, expensive surgery, and narcotic pain killers.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: A trained prolotherapist injects an
irritant solution into damaged ligaments and tendons. The theory is
that such injections, usually a sugar or salt solution, are helpful
because they prompt the body's inflammation response or the process
by which we heal. The body increases the supply of blood and
nutrients to the bothered area and, eventually, constructs new
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, prolotherapy seems kind of far-fetched,
especially because we spend billions of dollars in this country to
fight inflammation with medications such as cortisone and
over-the-counter remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Prolotherapy proponents, however, say it makes sense when
treating chronic problems, such as sports injuries, osteoarthritis,
sciatica, fibromyalgia and other painful conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Most pain is due to weakness around damaged ligaments and
tendons, according to Dr. Ross Hauser, a Chicago physician and the
author of ``Prolo Your Pain Away!'' a new book on prolotherapy.
``Prolotherapy strengthens those structures.''
</P>
<P>
   Jayleen Angellotti, 57, said prolotherapy has helped her to walk
and sit again after waking almost two years ago with severe hip
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times I had to eat a bowl of cereal half-standing
and half-sitting,'' said the retired Illinois schoolteacher.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting a series of internists, neurologists and physical
therapists, she tried prolotherapy. Today, more than a year after
getting regular injections, she feels almost like herself again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the hardest thing is carrying and lifting,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith describes the strengthening induced by prolotherapy as a
form of nonsurgical support to the problem area: ``It's kind of
like bracing it medically with soft tissue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Why then aren't more physicians opting for prolotherapy? Koop,
who served as surgeon general under President Ronald Reagan,
answers that question in the introduction to Hauser's book:
``Medical folks are skeptical and prolotherapy, unless you have
tried it and proven its worth, seems to be too easy a solution to
complicated problems ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the skepticism is the fact that prolotherapy isn't
part of the standard medical school curriculum, even though it was
first developed in the 1950s. Estimates place the number of
experienced practitioners in the United States at only between 300
and 1,500. Dr. Ken Knott, a physical medicine and rehabilitation
specialist in Marietta, Ga., has been practicing prolotherapy for
15 years. He believes attitudes are finally changing because
patients are seeing good results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly something to consider other than surgery and
the results are permanent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Side-effects also are rare, practitioners say, because
prolotherapy injections aren't toxic and, if properly administered,
are harmless. Possible problems include allergic reactions or
temporary soreness.
</P>
<P>
   Though patients differ in their healing response, Knott said
most of his patients feel permanent pain relief after three to six
series of injections.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, at Albany Medical Center, is more cautious. He treats
three to five patients a year with prolotherapy, usually as a last
resort.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasizes that prolotherapy isn't for everybody. ``I'm
certainly on the stingy end of using it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hauser is optimistic physicians will become more generous with
prolotherapy as people learn more about it. ``I think in the next
five years prolotherapy will be state-of-the-art pain management.''

IT'S SHOWTIME AS BUYERS PLUCK UP THE CLINTON TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Clinton grand jury testimony has become a
hot commodity, with video stores, book publishers and retail Web
sites scrambling to sell the president's videotaped testimony
before a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deposition changed the course of history forever,'' said
Natalie Olinger, spokeswoman for MPI Home Video of Orland Park,
Ill. ``There has to be an easy-to-find access to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee on Monday released the taped
deposition, recorded in the White House map room Aug. 17 for the
grand jury investigating whether the president lied and abused his
power to cover up an extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   MPI will ship 100,000 copies of its ``The Grand Jury Testimony
of William Jefferson Clinton'' cassette Wednesday to on-line and
retail video stores, including Tower Records and Borders Books.
</P>
<P>
   The video, which will arrive in stores Friday, carries the
following blurb on the back cover: ``WARNING: This program contains
strong language. Parental guidance is suggested.''
</P>
<P>
   Paperbacks of Clinton's grand jury testimony about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky also are being rushed out for
publication by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week before, several publishers came out with copies of
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report to Congress that
contains allegations of perjury, abuse of power and obstruction of
justice that could lead to the impeachment of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Pocket Books, a division of Simon &AMP; Schuster, and PublicAffairs,
an independent publishing company, said Monday that they plan to
publish the transcript of the four hours of testimony under the
title ``The Starr Evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The video is already a best-selling item on the Amazon.Com Web
site, knocking Stephen King's latest novel, ``Bag of Bones,'' into
the No. 2 slot.
</P>
<P>
   At the Emeryville, Calif.-based Reel.com video retailing Web
site, the cassette came in at No. 3, behind ``Titanic'' and the
reissued Disney classic ``The Lady and the Tramp.''
</P>
<P>
   MPI made headlines earlier this year when it published ``Image
of an Assassination: A New Look at the Zapruder Film.'' That video
featured a digitally enhanced re-examination of the shooting of
President John F. Kennedy, and included more footage than had
previously been released. MPI sold 300,000 copies of that tape,
Olinger said, making it the company's best-selling documentary
title to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grand Jury'' will debut with a $14.95 price tag, though
Reel.Com, Amazon and many retail stores are discounting it to
$9.95.
</P>
<P>
   Olinger said the company obtained from the communications center
at the House of Representatives. There will be no commentary or
other content added to the tape, she added.

   ``People are getting it straight,'' Olinger said. ``No spin will
be added.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, CNN, MSNBC and other news sites have recorded
record numbers of visitors viewing the Internet versions of the
president's deposition. The crush of viewers going on line slowed
the Internet down by a third, according to the Internet Traffic
Report, a Web site that monitors Net usage.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks, a Seattle-based company that distributes on-line
video viewers, said their traffic will exceed their last
record-setting event: The June 16 Net broadcast of a live birth
that garnered RealNetworks some 1.1 million visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers aren't in yet,'' RealNetworks spokesman Greg
Makuch said. ``But preliminary reports show that this Clinton
deposition will at least be double the birth thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Wainwright, the chief executive of Reel.com, said she
expected a burst of Clinton tape sales, then a quick fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's something that has legs,'' said Wainwright,
who said one reason the tape will be a best-seller is because of
its unprecedented portrayal of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Watergate, where no one was privy to information
that didn't come from a reporter,'' Wainwright said. ``Here you
have the most powerful man in the free world testifying under oath
right before your eyes.''

   Ed. note: The following is a special package of stories from the
P-I on fall fashion. All stories are by Susan Phinney.
</P>
<P>
   FALL-FASHION-SKIRTS (Undated) Long skirts with sweaters were
epidemic on U.S. and European runways when fall '98 fashions were
unveiled. Show after show opened with a model wearing a slim,
ankle-length or longer skirt topped with one or two sweaters _ big
and bulky, short and tight or perhaps a twinset. And sure enough _
now they're here in stores and on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   PHOTO
</P>
<P>
   FALL-FASHION-HOME (Undated) Fuctional art practically begs to be
included in life because it was created to be beautiful or perhaps
whimsical AND useful _ one-of-a-kind lamps, hand-made rocking
chairs, pottery thrown by an artist and other items are both
user-friendly and affordable.
</P>
<P>
   FALL-FASHION-FABRICS (Undated) Comfortable clothes in luxurious
fabrics set the tone for fall '98. It's the little touches,
however, that make these clothes current and lively, give them
individuality. Here are things to watch to watch for.

WHAT GOES? GLOBAL ACCENTS, GRAY FABRICS AND OTHER GREAT THINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the little touches that make the clothes for fall current
and lively, give them individuality.
</P>
<P>
   Here are things to watch for:
</P>
<P>
   E is for ethnic looks. Embroidery from Asia or India. Patterns
and textures from the Middle East and Africa. String tie or frog
closures. Don't be surprised to find several cultures represented
in one garment.
</P>
<P>
   G is for gray. And we're not talking just gray flannel. Gray,
from pale to charcoal, is the neutral of the season. It's already a
best seller at The Bon Marche.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers may not trade their all-black wardrobes for it, but
gray is important to any fashion mix.
</P>
<P>
   What are the newest ways with gray? Ralph Lauren's gray flannel
jeans skirt, gray flannel Birkenstock clogs, or a sheer, shimmery
silver/gray evening dress.
</P>
<P>
   S is for sheen or sparkle. Crystal beads glimmer through dense
wools or synthetic poodle cloth. Even the sheerest fabrics appear
to be touched with gold or silver. Sequins and oversize paillettes
give added interest to patterned fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are a few beaded-all-over garments around, the
spare approach is most chic _ a tiny band of beads for accent, or
glimmer scattered randomly.
</P>
<P>
   H is for hoods. Expect to find hoods on everything from vests to
sweaters _ on sweaters that look like hooded sweat shirts, for
example _ and on coats. Hoods are age and gender blind.
</P>
<P>
   F is for furs. Fur cuffs, fur collars, fur jackets, fur coats,
even fur scarves and bags. Fur is flying this fall. Sometimes it's
dyed to match. Some of it's real. Some is frankly fake. The
luxurious feel, appearance and texture make fur most-wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Also look for:
</P>
<P>
   Animal prints, from spots to stripes.
</P>
<P>
   Colored/textured pantyhose. And don't be afraid to wear a color
that contrasts with the rest of a costume, like bright blue legs
with a gray tweed suit.
</P>
<P>
   Cashmere in any form.
</P>
<P>
   Bustles on skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Flats. Shoes haven't been this simple since Capezios took to the
streets in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Sheath dresses with matching coats. They look newer than
tailored suits.
</P>
<P>
   Padded vests, skirts, jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Turtlenecks on top.
</P>
<P>
   Handbags.
</P>
<P>
   Zip-front jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Knit dresses for day and evening.
</P>
<P>
   Suede shirtjackets.
</P>
<P>
   Cargo pants.
</P>
<P>
   Hats and caps, from cloches and fedoras to little knits.

 &HT;    PORTRAIT OF THE GRAND JURY: OPINIONATED, INVOLVED IN PROBE
 &HT;    840&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Crying tears of relief, Monica Lewinsky thanked the
grand jurors who had questioned, consoled and scolded her about the
most intimate details of her White House affair with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate all of your understanding for this situation and
your ability to open your heart and your mind and your soul,'' the
star witness told her anonymous, sympathetic inquisitors.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's nine-month
investigation of whether Clinton illegally covered up his
relationship with the former intern, the identities and activities
of the 23 federal grand jurors have remained shrouded in legal
secrecy. However, the panel's personality has begun to peek through
in the transcripts of testimony released by Congress and the
televised questioning of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Asking probing, informed questions, openly expressing its
opinions and pushing for answers, the grand jury is clearly not the
passive chorus for Starr's investigation that some outside legal
observers had supposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a longstanding investigation like this, a grand jury
becomes very proprietary about its role. The members take great
pride in their work and sometimes they have to be restrained by
prosecutors,'' said Joseph DiGenova, a former U.S. attorney and
independent counsel. ``They were the ones who asked the president
explicit questions about his sexual relationship with Miss
Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the grand jurors asked the sort of questions that many
Americans who aren't lawyers or politicians would pose if they had
a chance. Why did Lewinsky save the semen-stained dress? Does she
still love the president? What does she think about Linda Tripp?
Why doesn't Clinton just give a full, straight answer about his
``inappropriate relationship'' with Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not uncommon for a grand jury to ask questions of a human
or personal nature,'' said Bruce Yannett, a New York attorney who
worked in the Office of Independent Counsel in the Iran-contra
investigation. ``They're supposed to be a reflection of the
community at large, and they often ask the kinds of questions a lay
person would ask.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This grand jury is made up almost entirely of African-American
women from the District of Columbia,'' said DiGenova. ``They play a
very active role, contrary to public belief.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the grand jury that summoned Lewinsky back for a second
day of testimony _ a session in which prosecutors posed very few
questions. From the opening moments _ when the witness asked, ``Can
you guys call me Monica?'' _ it was an occasion more akin to an
``Oprah'' show than a legal proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to let you know we're not here to judge you in any
way,'' one juror began. ``I think many of us feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica, none of us in this room are perfect,'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   But, like much of the country, they were oh so curious.
</P>
<P>
   ``And today, Monica, do you still love the president?''
</P>
<P>
   She said she did until his televised speech in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you aware that he was having problems in his marriage?
Did this ever spill over in the time you were together?''
</P>
<P>
   That answer was redacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You said the relationship was more than oral sex,'' asked a
juror. ``I mean, it wasn't like you went out on dates or anything
like that like normal people, so what more was it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we spent hours on the phone. It was emotional,'' Lewinsky
testified. ``We were very affectionate. ... We'd hold hands. We'd
smile a lot. We discussed a variety, you know, a wide range of
things. .. .There was a real component of a relationship to it. ...
I thought he had a beautiful soul.''
</P>
<P>
   But the jurors, more than almost everyone, knew the details of
the case. Their questions weren't all softballs. The jurors wanted
to know about the witness's proffer and her immunity deal, and
about the day she was confronted by FBI agents and found out that
her friend, Linda Tripp, had been secretly taping their telephone
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   They asked about her past relationship with another married man;
the timing of the retrieval of presidential gifts by Betty Currie,
Clinton's secretary; conversations with Vernon Jordan, and her
thoughts when ordered to give a deposition in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment trial.
</P>
<P>
   While understanding, they weren't always approving.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a married man and it wasn't no secret of that fact,''
said one juror.
</P>
<P>
   They seemed to share Lewinsky's disdain for Tripp, but urged her
not to dwell on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say that even though right now you feel a lot of
hate for Linda Tripp, but you need to move on and leave her where
she is because whatever goes around comes around,'' said one.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is definitely going to have to give an account for what
she did, and you need to just go past here and don't keep her
because that's going to keep you out,'' advised another.
</P>
<P>
   And when it ended, the foreperson told the tearful witness: ``We
wanted to offer you a bouquet of good wishes that includes luck,
success, happiness and blessings.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In the questioning of Clinton, questions were relayed from the
grand jurors in the federal courthouse to members of Starr's team
in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President, the next series of questions are from the grand
jurors,'' said one attorney, Solomon Wisenberg. ``And let me tell
you that the grand jurors want you to be more specific about the
inappropriate conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The series of questions included: Is oral sex performed on you
within the definition (of sexual relations) as you understood it?
What is the legal basis of the president refusing to answer some
specific questions on sexual matters? Would kissing or touching the
breast or genitalia of another person constitute sexual relations
under the definition?
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton's lawyers cut off the session after an agreed-upon
four hours, Jackie Bennett, another of Starr's associates, said,
``Mr. President, I am notified the grand jury still has unanswered
questions of you.''
</P>
<P>
   This intense interest and remaining questions by the grand
jurors could spell trouble for the Clinton administration, since
the investigation is still going on, said DiGenova. ``I expect
indictments will be coming out of this grand jury very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Yannett said it is impossible to predict whether
indictments are forthcoming. It is apparent though, he added, that
this grand jury ``is acutely aware of the importance of its work.''

DUAL PURPOSE IS AN ASSET FOR ARTISTS' FUNCTIONAL WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   All art doesn't hang out or sit around waiting to be admired or
understood.
</P>
<P>
   Functional art practically begs to be included in life. It was
created to be beautiful or perhaps whimsical _ and useful.
</P>
<P>
   More people are buying into this art form _ one-of-a-kind lamps,
handmade rocking chairs, pottery thrown by an artist and other
items both user-friendly and affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Handcrafted pottery can be found for a few dollars when Pottery
Northwest in Seattle has a yard sale. Blown glass by local artists
is available for $25 to $25,000 depending on the size of the item
and the reputation of the artist. Furniture prices are often
comparable to high-quality manufactured designs.
</P>
<P>
   Functional art has other advantages: It usually doesn't require
a large space, a frame, special lighting or an insurance policy
rider.
</P>
<P>
   Some art appears functional, but don't be fooled.

   A blown-glass cylinder by Dale Chihuly may look like a vase, and
could be used as one, but it isn't meant to be one, says Kate
Elliott, owner of Elliott Brown Gallery in Seattle's Fremont
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   You'd probably hesitate to put flowers _ or anything else _ in
something with a $44,000 price tag, but as Elliott quips, ``It does
hold water.''
</P>
<P>
   Chihuly's art may fall into the for-viewing-only category, but
there are plenty of blown-glass pieces by artists that are meant to
hold everything from flowers and fruits to chip dips and drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Foster, owner of Foster/White Galleries in Seattle and
nearby Kirkland, says artists have historically made things with
dual purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Pottery is a prime example. Foster describes a platter by the
late George Tsutakawa _ an artist best known for his sculpture and
drawings _ as art that could be displayed or used for serving food.
</P>
<P>
   Foster says Tiffany lamps from the early 1900s were functional
art of that period. By the '20s, artists were making one-of-a-kind
pieces of furniture. In the '30s, pottery became an acceptable art
form.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the '70s that functional art began to assert
itself once again, when pottery flourished along with handcrafted
jewelry. Galleries began giving space to functional art, and the
line between functional and fine art began to blur.
</P>
<P>
   Foster/White Gallery staged a functional art show in the early
1980s _ a courageous move for the time. Foster says he met with
artists who showed at the gallery and asked them if they had any
ideas for a functional show. Artists could contribute whatever they
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show didn't affect their future work, but it did fire
their imaginations,'' Foster says today. Among the items _ an area
rug painted on Masonite, acrylic book ends, several small painted
tables and ceramics. The public loved it, Foster says. Art critics
were, to put it politely, critical.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are galleries devoted to functional art. And fine
art galleries often have some functional pieces to show. Artists _
especially those working in wood, glass and ceramics _ seem
comfortable in the duality of their works, Foster says.
</P>
<P>
   Foster cites Seattle artist Elaine Hanowell's fish lamps as
being ``truly art and truly functional.'' The painted paper lamps
on bamboo frames hang in the Dahlia Lounge restaurant in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He praises the finely crafted furniture by Viscount Linley _ the
British royal whose mother is Princess Margaret and aunt is Queen
Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
   Linley, known for inlaid wood designs, has created an eyeglass
cabinet for Elton John and other pieces for serious collectors
around the world. His shows in American cities are treated as art
events.
</P>
<P>
   After discussing functional art at length, Foster leans back and
says, ``I don't think you can define functional art. There's a line
of aesthetic judgment. I'd be offended if I went to a party and
found a fine piece by a Pilchuck (glass) artist used to serve
popcorn. It's sculpture.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster says it helps to know why the artist conceived a piece.
Anne Hirondelle, for example, makes ceramic vessels that look like
tea or coffee pots, but they're not. They're sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   ``An embroidered potholder might be art to the creator, but is
it art?'' Foster questions. ``Some things are marginal.''

   THE CLINTON CRISIS
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-JURY _ WASHINGTON _ A portrait of the Starr grand jury,
which turns out to be both more activist and more sympathetic than
people had realized. (Dart, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CANDIDATES _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton may or may
not escape impeachment, but the path to high office has been
drastically changed by his ordeal. Now that a mechanism exists to
extract politicians' secrets via private lawsuits, future
candidates for the White House _ and perhaps lower offices _ may
think twice before running. The result may be a process that places
a higher premium on purity than competence. (Shepard, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CHARACTER _ WASHINGTON _ Using psychological theories
that attempt to describe how such traits as integrity, ambition,
the ability to relate to other people develop to make up a person's
character, a New York psychoanalyst and political scientist
concludes that as a child President Clinton was alternately adored
and neglected by his mother and gradually taught that rules and
restrictions don't matter _ at least not for him. Stanley Renshon,
in the book, ``High Hopes, the Clinton Presidency and the Politics
of Ambition,'' attempts to set forth a theory by which voters can
systematically evaluate the character of candidates for president.
(Nesmith, Cox News Service 700).
</P>
<P>
   LAWPROFS-CLINTON _ In the halls of academe, President Clinton's
performance before the Kenneth Starr grand jury rated less than an
A but better than an F. Experts in law and communications were
analyzing the president's responses to questions about his sex
life. Like much of the public, they came away with a mixed review
of the president's performance. (Keilman/Bennish, Dayton Daily
News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MEDIA-CLINTON _ The media is taking a lashing from a large part
of the American public for its long-running and uncomfortably
detailed coverage of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. But newspapers,
TV networks and cable news stations have no choice but to call the
nation to an unwilling jury duty, according to media ethicists.
(DeBrosse, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

   CLINTON-JAPAN _ TARRYTOWN, N.Y. _ President Clinton meets with
new Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi at Rockefeller Family
Estate for the first time. (Deans, Cox News Service).

   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   POLMONEY-COLOR _ WASHINGTON _ A disproportionately small part of
campaign contributions come from people of color, according to a
new study by Public Campign. (Mollison, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   POLMONEY-DATA _ Comparison of contribution and income figures
from average ZIP codes with ZIP codes where most residents are
people of color.
</P>
<P>
   BUILDING-WASTE _ WASHINGTON _ The federal government is moving
toward contracting for a new Patent Office building that critics
have dubbed the ``Taj Mahal,'' complete with plans for $250 shower
curtains. What's more, after 20 years and at least $1.3 billion in
costs, the building won't belong to the government because it's
being leased. Sponsors of the project have already defeated an
attempt to kill it in Congress. A Senate hearing on Wednesday may
move the project closer to reality. (Malone, Cox News Service).

   CLASS-ACT _ WASHINGTON _ A group of veterans, including the most
decorated soldier and former prisoner of war from Vietnam, rally at

John McCain, R-Ariz., and others likely to speak. (Nesmith, Cox

   CARTER _ ATLANTA _ Jimmy Carter has his annual town hall meeting
at Emory University for students and faculty Tuesday. It is not
open to the public. During this forum, which is fairly informal,
Carter answers written questions from students. We go to seek if
anyone asks about the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal. (Kurylo, Atlanta

<P>
   NIEMAN-SUIT _ ATLANTA _ A woman who frequently shopped at Nieman
Marcus and went there one day and tried on some lingerie in the
dressing room, was taken by security guards after she left the
store and searched to determine whether she had stolen some items.
But she had not. The woman filed a federal civil rights lawsuit
against the department store. Verdict possible today. (Rankin,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   UNDERGROUND _ The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center
in Cincinnati will make its public debut this weekend with the
start of its civil rights lecture series and the first presentation
of the International Freedom Conductor Award to civil rights
crusader Rosa Parks. By the time Ohio celebrates its bicentennial
in 2003, the Freedom Center's interactive museum will tell the

abolitionists who harbored fleeing slaves in pre-Civil War America
during their escape to freedom in the north. (Joyce, Dayton Daily

   WALK _ Like the thousands of slaves who reached Ohio on their
way to freedom in Canada, Anthony Cohen will have traveled almost
800 miles through forests and rivers by the time he reaches Dayton
on Nov. 4. Cohen, 34, is retracing the steps of those who escaped

<P>
   NY-WINE-TASTING (New York) _ All over the New York City,
sandwiched between the dry cleaners and the shoe repair shops, are
wine stores, and on Saturday afternoons, many of them are opening
bottles of Spanish riojas, or California chardonnays, or Australian
syrahs and pouring them, free of charge, for anyone who takes the
trouble to stop in. In San Francisco, the hedonistic Saturday has
become a ritual, as cars stream across the Golden Gate bridge and
speed toward the vineyards of Napa and Sonoma. New York does not
have the vineyards, but it does have the wine stores, dozens and
dozens of them, and shrewd customers, after making a few phone
calls and drawing up a little list, can map out a personal wine
trail, as I did on a recent Saturday afternoon. By William Grimes.

   NY-FRENCH-PIZZA (New York) _ Even though the French influence is

example. Yes, pizza. Although it is most often known as a

HEM AND HER: HERE'S THE LONG VIEW OF THE SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (Photo available through Wieck Photo Database)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long skirts with sweaters were epidemic on U.S. and European
runways when fall '98 fashions were unveiled.
</P>
<P>
   Show after show opened with a model wearing a slim, ankle-length
or longer skirt topped with one or two sweaters _ big and bulky,
short and tight or perhaps a twin set.
</P>
<P>
   So numerous were these long styles, it seemed a foregone
conclusion that they'd be sweeping onto sidewalks, and into
classrooms, workplaces and parties come fall.
</P>
<P>
   Ankle-length styles are already seen on Seattle streets _ young
women striding out in their latest fall gear the minute there's a
cloud in the sky. Miniskirts, however, are still giving them
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Will there be long skirts in every closet? Will they become a
classroom classic, a workday uniform or just another ingredient in
the fashion mix?
</P>
<P>
   Historically, long skirts with trains flourished in the late
1790s. A century later, women were wearing a flared ``Gibson Girl''
style.
</P>
<P>
   But will the 20th century _ the one that opened with long skirts
and went on to expose ankles, knees and thighs _ end back on a long
note?
</P>
<P>
   Carol Steele, Northwest fashion director for Nordstrom, hedges.
She calls ankle-length skirts ``an option . . . part of the relaxed
sportswear influence . . . sort of a new pant.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that long skirts were an important part of Donna Karan's
DKNY collection _ usually a sure sign that a fashion is going to be
a best seller _ Steele predicts long skirts will become even more
important as the holiday season approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Ahern, fashion coordinator for The Bon Marche, says
ankle-length skirts are in all departments in fabrics ranging from
wool to denim to silk. Who's buying? Customers under 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a younger, more creative customer,''
Ahern says. ``For those over 30, it's going to be a
fashion-conscious, avant-garde shopper'' who buys long.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Ann Taylor chain, says their customers
have let them know they want a variety of hemlines _ and they're
getting them. Skirt lengths in these stores will range from
midthigh to ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle-based image consultant Audrey Beaulac says skirts and
sweaters are the fall fashion statement, especially long skirts
with flattter shoes or boots.
</P>
<P>
   But realistically, hems will probably hang from top of the
kneecap to ankle, with most settling somewhere midknee, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Beaulac points out that Nicole Miller was one of a very few
designers to feature above-knee skirts in her fall '98 collection.
But skirts aren't the only option this season.
</P>
<P>
   Pants are definitely part of the mix _ slim and straight to
slouchy trousers. They're also topped with sweaters _ often a
turtleneck. Sometimes they're shown with vests (especially furry
ones) or short, zipped jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Beaulac believes this will be a season for dresses, both knit
and woven. Sheath dresses will be worn under coats and jackets. A
sheath, jacket, pants, skirt and shell top can form a complete
wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   Wool jersey dresses are already best sellers for the Geoffrey
Beene label. When Brian Millsap brought the Beene collection to
Ruth Hill in downtown Seattle last month, long skirts weren't part
of the picture. Long dresses, however, were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day dresses have really caught on this season,'' Millsap says,
as he shows ankle-length and midcalf jersey dresses that are
selling well throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Other dresses in the Beene collection end just above the knee _
especially little black cocktail dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Cropped jackets have long been staples in Beene's collections,
and other designers have picked up on the shorter looks for fall
'98. Short jackets look right with long skirts. So do close-to-the
body sweaters and twin sets.
</P>
<P>
   Beaulac warns that a maxi coat over a long skirt would be too
'70s. Ahern says a blazer makes a long skirt look matronly. And
stiletto heels with long skirts are a fashion disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Hemlines lower, with designer touches
</P>
<P>
   A sample of long skirts and tops from top designers, unveiled at
shows in New York:
</P>
<P>
   Designer Donna Karan quilted silk chiffon for a long, slim
skirt, then paired it with a hooded polar fleece vest in her DKNY
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the skirts shown were bias cut, sans waistbands, resting
on hip bones. Others were cut like a pair of jeans around the
waist, ending in a slim skirt instead of pants.
</P>
<P>
   Designers Yeohlee and Susan Lazar opened with long, wrap skirts.
Linda Allard, designer for the Ellen Tracy label, slashed a long
walking skirt to the thigh. Ralph Lauren showed a jeans skirt in
gray flannel, even a full, half-circle skirt.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Eisen put a stretch mohair sweater over an iridescent
chiffon skirt for late-day. Han Feng's evening styles include a red
velvet skirt with a red cable-knit sweater.

SAN FRANCISCO GROUP TROUBLED BY CLINTON'S PERFORMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANNIE NAKAO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the realm of the ordinary, it was
extraordinary _ an unvarnished view of a president in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   With much of the rest of the nation, a panel of San Franciscans
saw it unfold Monday, watching on television at the San Francisco
Examiner at the request of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   After more than three hours of testimony by President Clinton,
they came away unconvinced about calls for impeachment but deeply
troubled by what they had seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not his high point,'' said the Rev. Stephen Meriwether
of the San Francisco archdiocese, who said the scandal made him
pose ``the age-old question: Would you want to read minds? No.''
</P>
<P>
   For Meriwether, 45, and the others, the sordid details of
Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky were revealed in a surreal
setting: the president, at times fidgety, at times tenacious, at
times unsure, answering for his sex life on national television.
</P>
<P>
   It was fascinating and unsettling at the same time for this
mostly Democratic quartet, all of whom voted to elect Clinton two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the same token, I also elected Richard Nixon twice,''
Meriwether said.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the testimony, they rolled their eyes at the
dogged legal gymnastics Clinton engaged in to avoid admitting that
the young White House intern performed oral sex on him. They joked
about the gifts Clinton gave her _ all items he apparently
scrounged from his own office. They pondered the term ``reasonable
circumstances.'' They took in how many times Clinton sipped a drink
or coughed nervously. They argued about just what it all meant for
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found myself almost resenting him,'' said Don Young, 30,
director of broadcast programming at the National Asian American
Telecommunications Association. ``I know it's not all his fault,
but why do we have to put ourselves through this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh man _ he's a big dog!'' said Toni Young, 35, a San
Francisco consumer rights advocate, who is not related to Don
Young. ``His thing is, `I'm a guy and I made some guy mistakes.'
He's not as contrite as I'd like him to be.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Toni Young said, ``He's a smart guy who says,
`I'm going to follow the rules you gave me.' Can I fault him? No.
The stakes are high.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fabulous euphemisms!'' noted Rosemary Bacy, 66, of San
Francisco, about the contorted definitions of sexual relations she
heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Encounters that were wrong ... inappropriate contact,
inappropriate sexual banter _ come now!'' Meriwether said.
</P>
<P>
   He also pronounced Clinton as being cheap to boot for not buying
any of the gifts he gave to Lewinsky, who lavished gifts on him.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's less than forthcoming behavior about the scandal
is entirely explainable, he argued.

   ``If one is so gauche as to ask about such intimate matters, one
should be expected to be lied to,'' Meriwether said. ``It was a
very natural reaction. It was embarrassing. He didn't want it to
come out.''
</P>
<P>
   That, however, doesn't make it right.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what, he should come clean _ it'll all be better,''
Toni Young said.
</P>
<P>
   No political novices, the four dismissed as whining Clinton's
complaints that he was being grilled about the meaning of taking an
oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy who has a (degree) from Yale School of Law. He
has a better understanding of the process than most,'' Toni Young
said. ``Stop with the persecution complex _ you're the leader of
the free world!''
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the panelists, Toni Young said she thought most
Americans are ``getting sick of the whole thing, unless they come
up with stronger charges stamped with perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to all the Whitewater and travel office
investigations?'' Bacy said. ``It's all vanished and we're left
with all this sex stuff. If the president's going to be impeached,
it should have to do with national security.''

   NY-WINE-TASTING (New York) _ All over the New York City,
sandwiched between the dry cleaners and the shoe repair shops, are
wine stores, and on Saturday afternoons, many of them are opening
bottles of Spanish riojas, or California chardonnays, or Australian
syrahs and pouring them, free of charge, for anyone who takes the
trouble to stop in. In San Francisco, the hedonistic Saturday has
become a ritual, as cars stream across the Golden Gate bridge and
speed toward the vineyards of Napa and Sonoma. New York does not
have the vineyards, but it does have the wine stores, dozens and
dozens of them, and shrewd customers, after making a few phone
calls and drawing up a little list, can map out a personal wine
trail, as I did on a recent Saturday afternoon. By William Grimes.

POLL SHOWS CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT INDIAN CASINO MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A new poll shows that a slender majority of
California voters support a statewide measure that would allow
expanded gambling at Indian reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks from the Nov. 3 election, 54 percent of voters
surveyed supported the initiative to allow tribal casinos to have
slot machines and high-stakes card games; 33 percent opposed it.
Thirteen percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of likely voters, conducted for the San Francisco
Examiner, also found majority support for Gov. Pete Wilson's
proposed education reform measure and a measure that would increase
the tax on cigarettes by 50 cents per pack to pay for early
childhood education programs.
</P>
<P>
   In the contests for statewide offices, the survey found that the
incumbent secretary of state, controller and insurance commissioner
enjoyed solid support. No candidate has established clear support
in the statewide races for lieutenant governor, attorney general
and treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were running a campaign, I wouldn't tell anyone to
relax,'' said Del Ali, pollster for Mason-Dixon Political/Media
Research, which conducted the poll for the Examiner. ``You can't
burn out because no one is focused on these races right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of 812 registered voters in California was
conducted Sept. 14-16. All who participated said they regularly
voted in state elections. The poll has a margin of error of plus or
minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 5, the Indian gambling measure, is the most
vigorously contested of the 10 initiatives on the Nov. 3 ballot,
with the two opposing campaigns expected to spend at least $75
million, mostly on commercial advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes expect to spend $50 million, but political insiders
say the forces supporting Proposition 5 may top the record for a
statewide initiative campaign of $84 million spent by opponents of
Proposition 103, the auto insurance initiative voters passed in
1988. Opponents of the measure, funded largely by Las Vegas casino
and hotel operators, plan to spend close to $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have been sparring in TV commercials running for
weeks. The tribes argue the initiative is the only way to keep
their slot machines, which make up 75 percent of Indian casino
revenues. Under current state law, slot machines are illegal, and
federal authorities are battling in court to seize them.
</P>
<P>
   Indian gambling opponents, a coalition that includes labor, law
enforcement and religious and business groups as well as casino
interests, say the initiative allows for little state oversight of
casinos and would result in an expansion of gambling in California.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents admit the tribes gained an early advantage by starting
their ad campaign in May, before the measure even qualified for the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The yes side has one message: sympathy for Indians. They've
pretty well established that message,'' said Frank Schubert,
manager for the No on 5 campaign. ``It's really our challenge to go
block by block and deliver our message. We're confident that when
we do that, we will win.''
</P>
<P>
   On other issues, the poll showed that 70 percent of those
surveyed supported Wilson's education initiative, Proposition 8.
The measure would permanently cut elementary school class sizes,
create parent-teacher governing councils and require teachers to
take competence tests. Only 15 percent opposed Proposition 8, while
15 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Voters also support Proposition 10, a measure sponsored by film
director Rob Reiner that would increase the tobacco tax to pay for
early childhood development programs. The survey found that 55
percent of those questioned said they support the measure; 33
percent were opposed and 12 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Voters supported, by a slimmer margin, Proposition 9, which
proposes giving electricity consumers a 20 percent rate reduction:
56 percent to 21 percent, with 23 percent still undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Among the incumbent statewide officers: Democratic Controller
Kathleen Connell was favored over San Mateo County Supervisor Ruben
Barrales, a Republican, 56 percent to 29 percent; Republican
Secretary of State Bill Jones was supported by 50 percent to 32
percent for Democrat Michela Alioto; Republican Insurance
Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush received the support of 47 percent
to 27 percent for his Democratic opponent, Assemblywoman Diane
Martinez of Rosemead.
</P>
<P>
   In the nonpartisan school chief contest, Superintendent of
Schools Delaine Eastin, a Democrat, had the support of 41 percent
to 28 percent for Gloria Tuchman, a Santa Ana school teacher who
co-chaired the successful Proposition 227 campaign to end bilingual
education.
</P>
<P>
   In the open seat contests, Democratic Assemblyman Cruz
Bustamante, the former Assembly speaker, was supported by 42
percent to 35 percent over state Sen. Tim Leslie, R-Roseville, for
lieutenant governor; Deputy Attorney General Dave Stirling, a
Republican, received the support of 42 percent in the campaign for
attorney general to 37 percent for state Sen. Bill Lockyer,
D-Hayward, the former state Senate president pro tem; and in the
contest for treasurer, Democratic businessman Phil Angelides of
Sacramento and Republican Assemblyman Curt Pringle, a former
Assembly speaker of Garden Grove, each gained 34 percent support
with 32 percent undecided.

RADIOACTIVE SEED THERAPY IS USED TO FIGHT PROSTATE CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday,
Sept. 28)   By DAVID UHLER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ With gentle force, Dr. Michael Sarosdy slowly
withdraws a foot-long needle from between Jim King's legs. The
hollow probe leaves behind a tiny trail of radioactive pellets in
the prostate gland of the patient. He sleeps on his back on an
operating room table, his feet locked in stirrups.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's next?'' Sarosdy asks, putting aside the used needle.
Beth Walker, a radiation dosage expert, glances at her chart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Charlie three to the base,'' she says. A nurse hands
Sarosdy another needle.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor turns and checks the alphanumeric coordinates on a
pinhole-dotted grid mounted on a stand, clamped close to the
patient at the end of the table. He finds the hole corresponding to
``big charlie'' _ the capital letter ``C'' at the top of the metal
grid _ and the number ``three'' along the left side.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate destination for the tip of this particular needle
is the ``base,'' the place where the prostate meets the bladder, a
spot about four inches inside Jim King.
</P>
<P>
   With latex-gloved hands, Sarosdy carefully inserts the needle
into the correct pinhole on the grid. Then he pushes it forward.
</P>
<P>
   As the minutes tick by in the operating room, the doctor, the
dosage expert and the nurse develop a rhythm, one that sounds like
a bizarre round of bingo or the board game ``Battleship.''
Location, needle, insert, withdraw. Sarosdy and his colleague, Dr.
Bradley Prestidge check their work on a nearby ultrasound monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Walker has preloaded each hollow needle with a carefully
calculated number of radioactive pellets, usually called ``seeds.''
Each seed, about half the size of a grain of rice, contains
radioactive iodine encapsulated in titanium. The kill zone around
each seed is about the size of a marble.
</P>
<P>
   The medical team thinks it will take about 85 seeds to
neutralize the cancer in their patient's prostate and keep it from
spreading into the rest of his body.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors found Jim King's prostate cancer about a year ago. A
routine screening for military veterans exposed to Agent Orange,
the chemical defoliant used during the Vietnam War, revealed an
irregularity in Jim's blood work. A ``prostate specific antigen''
test, known as a PSA, detected a slightly elevated level of
prostate-produced protein.
</P>
<P>
   A biopsy, however, failed to confirm suspicions. Nine months
later, Jim's PSA was higher yet. Another biopsy confirmed the
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Jim, a 73-year-old retired command sergeant major with the U.S.
Army, is no stranger to doctors' offices and operating rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons, suspecting lung cancer, removed a lobe from his left
lung in 1972. Tests showed it had been attacked by cryptococcus, a
fungus Jim may have picked up overseas. Also on his medical chart:
A heart attack in 1984, an aortic aneurysm, arthritis, two TURPs _
trans-urethral resection of the prostate _ to help him urinate.
</P>
<P>
   And now prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting with his wife, Mary, in a lobby outside Sarosdy's
office, Jim faces his upcoming operation with the stoicism of a
long-time military man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not scared,'' says Jim, a native of Boerne, Texas. ``It's
just one of those things that's part of life. Almost all of us at
this age have some problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The last couple of years, however, have been especially tough
for the King family, with medical battles on two fronts. Diagnosed
with breast cancer, Mary had a mastectomy and finished chemotherapy
just six months ago. She is scheduled for a cataract operation next
week. Today, however, all her thoughts are on Jim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Jim says, you have to live with whatever comes your
way,'' she says, with a gentle twang revealing a childhood spent in
Nashville. ``The man upstairs is the one who makes the big
decisions. ``Of course, Jim helps me because he's so upbeat. I
don't know what I'd do without him, to be perfectly honest. He's
always that way, 36 years he's been that way. He wakes up every
morning with a smile on his face.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple met in the library at Fort Sam Houston. Jim was
divorced and on his way up through the military ranks. Mary, the
widowed wife of an Army pilot, was working as a librarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted a book,'' Jim recalls. Mary remembers it
differently: ``He was doing some flirting is what he was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim had two children. Mary had three. Together, they made a
family. Like many military families, they traveled and moved a lot:
Japan, Europe and several stateside posts. The children are grown
now and scattered around the U.S., with jobs and families and kids
of their own.
</P>
<P>
   For the last eight years, home for Jim and Mary has been a
comfortable three-bedroom condo off Vance Jackson Road, with a
garden off the back patio for the flowers Jim loves to grow. He
usually takes a brisk walk every morning on the winding streets of
the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   At night, Mary sometimes joins him for a leisurely stroll.
Lately, she has noticed that her husband sleeps a little more than
usual, the only change since his prostate cancer diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim never was a person who slept an hour more than he
should,'' she says. ``You know, in the military you get up with the
birds.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarosdy reviews Jim's medical history in his office before
seeing him in an examining room. A urologic cancer specialist, the
only one in private practice in San Antonio, Sarosdy has performed
about 60 radioactive seeds procedures, also known as brachytherapy,
in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our patient is a 73-year-old man,'' the doctor says, flipping
through Jim's chart. ``He had a bad heart attack a number of years
ago. He takes a number of medications. ``He's not a great candidate
for a big surgical procedure. Even though this will require some
form of an anesthetic, either a spinal or general, it's going to be
less of an insult on him than a surgical procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   In more than 20 years as a surgeon, Sarosdy also has performed
dozens of operations to remove cancerous prostates. Possible side
effects of that surgery include incontinence and inability to
achieve erection.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneering work in the radioactive seed procedure began about a
decade ago. The early seed implants were done by surgically
exposing the walnut-sized prostate and inserting the seeds
individually. Today, with special needles and ultrasound guidance,
the procedure still carries some risk of side effects, although
with less chance of them occurring.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of brachytherapy vs. prostatectomy still is
under debate in the medical world. Sarosdy, however, calls the
radioactive seed procedure ``the biggest important change'' in
prostate cancer treatment in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MORE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a change in direction,'' he says. ``It's a change in
toxicity of treatment. The length of time to convalesce is markedly
diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarosdy walks out of his office and into the lobby. After
greeting Mary, he escorts Jim into an examining room. The operation
is in two days. During previous visits, Sarosdy and other members
of the medical team poked and prodded their patient, looking for
problem areas and mapping out the planned seed placement.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Sarosdy checks Jim's heart and lungs and runs over his
game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, your prostate will look something like this when we
get through,'' the doctor says, snapping on the light of a view box
to show Jim an X-ray of a prostate filled with seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been over this,'' Sarosdy says, pointing to the
black-and-white image. ``Your bladder sits right up there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Umm,'' Jim grunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's where the seeds are going to be, in the prostate right
in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-huh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we hope it will look like.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the cancer?'' Jim asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cancer in your case happens to be in the left apex. But we
do the entire prostate because there is about a 50-percent chance
that you've got cancer somewhere else in the prostate that we don't
know about. We want to make sure one of the others doesn't come
back to bother you.''
</P>
<P>
   When he leaves Sarosdy's office, Jim is all smiles. He pumps the
doctor's hand and says another physician told him ``you got the
best there is'' after learning Sarosdy and Dr. Prestidge were
treating him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who was that?'' Sarosdy replies, grinning. ``I'll have to send
that guy a bottle of whiskey.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim and Mary go home to their routine and to wait. Mary talks to
a son who lives in San Antonio. He wants to take off from work and
sit with her at the hospital during the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't bother,'' she says. ``We've been through lots worse than
this.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Jim also tells Mary to stay home. He'll drive
himself to Methodist Hospital for the early morning procedure and
park in the parking lot. Later, Mary can get a ride from a friend
to drive him home.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of Jim's operation, Mary awakens to the sound of a
car pulling out of their garage. It is 4:45 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Jim is gone, on his way to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A big crowd has gathered in the cystology suite at Methodist
Hospital. Also known as ``cysto,'' the pastel-hued room reserved
for urology operations and procedures is named for the cystoscope
that urologists use to peer inside their patients' urinary tracts.
</P>
<P>
   The medical personnel includes Sarosdy and Prestidge, a former
U.S. Air Force radiation oncologist now at the Cancer Therapy &AMP;
Research Center who literally wrote the book on the radioactive
seeds procedure for the Department of Defense. A team of nurses
assists the doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, the radiation dosage expert, has set up an aluminum box
with 28 needles, each loaded with several radioactive Iodine-125
pellets. The metal box absorbs their low-level radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wears surgical scrubs, booties and caps, along with
heavy lead aprons that will shield them from the radiation emitted
from occasional fluoroscope images. Since there is no incision, no
one wears a mask.
</P>
<P>
   Jim King is the star attraction. He lies on his back on the
operating table, his legs spread wide in stirrups in the
unflattering position most women are all too familiar with.
</P>
<P>
   Tubes in his nose and throat help Jim breathe. Most of his body
is draped in hospital linen. Anesthesiologist Russell Hern stands
near Jim's head, keeping an eye on vital signs with the help of a
bank of medical monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, Jim sleeps deeply. On the end of the operating
table, between Jim's legs, a special metal stand and carriage hold
the needle positioning guide and an ultrasound probe in place. Two
solid core needles inserted through Jim's perineum also help anchor
the mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   The theme song from the motion picture ``Excalibur''
triumphantly blares on the ``cysto'' sound system as the doctors
continue sowing radioactive seeds in Jim's prostate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what?'' Sarosdy asks, holding one of the loaded
needles in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Delta 3,'' Walker replies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Delta 3 is really close to where the urethra is,'' warns
Prestidge, watching the needle's progress on an ultrasound monitor
as Sarosdy slides it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let you know when I hit it,'' Sarosdy says, smiling. ``I
think not.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes just under an hour to put all the seeds into Jim's
prostate, a total of 85 pellets.
</P>
<P>
   Sarosdy uses a cystoscope to look for any misplaced seeds in
Jim's bladder. Because of the patient's previous TURP procedures,
the chances are good for a seed to have pushed through his urinary
tract's weakened walls.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors will flush out any loose seeds with water. Even if
they miss one, Jim will be able to pass it with his urine, probably
without feeling it. The sound of French horns and strings playing
the ``Pilgrims' Chorus'' from the opera ``Tannhauser'' fills the
room as Sarosdy pushes the scope into a plastic tube in Jim's
penis.
</P>
<P>
   The tip of the cystoscope has a lighted lens. The picture on the
TV monitor looks like the view from the front car on a roller
coaster, careening down a long, pink tunnel. Sarosdy twists the
scope around, catching glimpses of Jim's bladder and other
highlights of the urinary tract.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is looking good, Brad,'' Sarosdy says to Prestidge. ``No
seeds. I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't trust anything I say today,'' announces Jim's wife,
Mary, sitting in a surgery waiting room at Methodist Hospital.
``I'm on another planet right now.''
</P>
<P>
   She talks on and on about Jim and their life together. On the
night before his operation, Jim told Mary to ``dress up when you
pick me up at the hospital. I want to see a pretty girl when I wake
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary's blond hair is neatly coiffed, her makeup is on and she
wears a Kelly green dress. It brings out the color in her eyes. She
looks tired, however, and she hasn't eaten all morning. She rushed
to the hospital with a neighbor, Billie Mimms, right after Sarosdy
called with the news: Jim is fine. The procedure was a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thank God everything is all right,'' she says. ``Now, I
can breathe again. We've just got to get Jim home and get him well
again. Then we're going to be well for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   It is 1:45 p.m., four hours after Jim's operation, before
orderlies and nurses finally wheel him into a ``short stay'' room
where Mary can visit.
</P>
<P>
   Jim won't let Mary kiss him. He hasn't had a chance to brush his
teeth. She kisses two of her fingers and presses them to his lips.
Jim kisses them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's my pretty woman,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife at his side, Jim King drove home the day after his
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Mary King is recuperating after successful cataract surgery.

FIRST, THERE ARE THE DOUGHNUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Preparing frostings and deep-fried foods are two of
my least favorite culinary tasks. But thanks to ``The Cupcake Cafe
Cookbook'' by Ann Warren and Joan Lilly (Doubleday, $25), there I
was, first heating and eventually discarding pounds of shortening
to make two batches of doughnuts, then up to my elbows in masses of
soft butter for buttercream.
</P>
<P>
   Decorative cakes strewn with bright buttercream blossoms like
wildflowers in a meadow are the signature of Cupcake Cafe, a little
place that has been on the corner of 39th Street and Ninth Avenue
for 10 years. But in the beginning, as the introduction to this
book explains, it was about doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Ann and Michael Warren, who had worked at the Well-Bred Loaf, a
big wholesale baker, wanted to start their own doughnut company.
They rented what had been a small down-at-the heels bakery and went
into business making not just doughnuts, but muffins and other
breakfast pastries, eventually adding home-style pies and cakes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the help of Ms. Lilly, Ms. Warren's sister, there is a
book that begins with doughnuts, both yeast and cake. Ms. Warren's
efforts to recreate some favorite varieties sent me into the
kitchen to try the cake doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   First, the wheat-and-oat kind that were supposed to be like the
ones that Chock Full o'Nuts used to make but turned out to have
their own nut-rich identity.
</P>
<P>
   Then I moved on to the recipe for Long Island crullers, very
good, plump vanilla doughnuts that were nicely crusty on the
outside. Were they supposed to be Crutchley's Crullers, once a
Southampton, N.Y., icon?
</P>
<P>
   They came close, though I remember the ones from Crutchley's as
having a little less nutmeg. And the instructions did not suggest
frying the centers, or holes, which you could always buy at
Crutchley's.
</P>
<P>
   The tips on doughnut making in the beginning of the first
chapter refer mainly to using professional cutters and fryers, but
some of the information about proper pots and temperatures is for
home cooks. The recipes in the book are all rather basic _ and they
work _ so the pages in my copy will not remain pristine and
stain-free for long.
</P>
<P>
   Though tempted by the bran muffins sweetened with only a bit of
honey and the sticky buns riddled with nuts and raisins, I have
resisted these for the time being. I cut to the chase _ the
cupcakes.
</P>
<P>
   There are five basic cake recipes, which can be baked as either
layers or cupcakes. The dark, intense chocolate cake calls for a
rich batter, made with unsweetened chocolate and cocoa, white and
brown sugars, buttermilk and lots of butter and eggs. It was moist
and exceedingly chocolaty.
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate and vanilla buttercreams topped with simple, nonfloral
but attractive rosettes added the finishing touch to mine. The
buttercream, made with sugar syrup and eggs, is the kind used by
professional bakers, not the shortcut combination of confectioners'
sugar and butter that is given in many cookbooks. Detailed formulas
are provided for tinting the plain buttercream.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-third of the book keeps you busy with frosting and
decorations. The authors advise plenty of practice on a cutting
board or counter top before attempting a special-occasion
extravaganza. One trick: Put the inscription on the cake before the
flowers, so if there's a blunder it can be easily erased.
</P>
<P>
   The instructions for fashioning various kinds of dazzling
flowers would have benefited by more step-by-step photographs of
exactly how each petal or leaf is made, how a lilac blossom differs
from a hydrangea and how to build the random bouquets that spill
over the Cupcake Cafe's cakes and that make them so distinctive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LONG ISLAND CRULLERS  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``The Cupcake Cafe Cookbook'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1{ hours &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 cups sifted all-purpose flour, plus flour for dusting
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   1{ teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 egg yolk
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces ({ stick) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 pounds solid vegetable shortening
</P>
<P>
   Confectioners' sugar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Sift together the flour, baking powder, nutmeg and salt in a
large bowl.
</P>
<P>
   2. Beat the eggs, egg yolk and sugar until thick and light, then
gradually add the vanilla, melted butter and milk.
</P>
<P>
   3. Pour the egg mixture into the bowl with the flour mixture,
and toss lightly with a large fork until all of the ingredients are
moistened and a soft dough can be formed.
</P>
<P>
   4. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Roll or pat the chilled dough to
1-inch thickness on a lightly floured surface. Cut with a 2{- to
3-inch doughnut cutter.
</P>
<P>
   5. Melt shortening in a wok or a heavy 3- to 4-quart saucepan
(do not use a nonstick or enamel pot) over medium-high heat to a
depth of at least 2{ inches. Heat it to 365 degrees. Slip four or
five doughnuts into the hot fat, and fry them for about 2 minutes
on each side. Remove them with a spatula or slotted spoon, and
allow them to drain on paper towels. If desired, the centers can
also be fried.
</P>
<P>
   6. Dust the cooled doughnuts with sifted confectioners' sugar
before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: about 18 doughnuts and 18 centers.

   &UR; (Editors: A COLOR SLIDE showing Barbara Ross-Lee with her sister,
Diana, is available.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By CHERYL HECKLER-FELTZ &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Ross-Lee grew up in the projects of Detroit, put herself
through medical school and became the first black woman to head a
medical school in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Her story could serve as a blueprint for any woman trying to
balance family and career, or for anyone facing overwhelming
obstacles like poverty and isolation.
</P>
<P>
   But she is still strongly identified with her supremely
recognizable sister, pop diva Diana Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Ross-Lee, dean of the Ohio University College of Osteopathic
Medicine, has been featured in People Magazine and USA Today. Many
will tell you she is to the world of medicine today what her
younger sister was to the world of music 30 years ago -- a bona
fide shooting star.
</P>
<P>
   And if, after her years as physician, professor and dean, the
opening line is often, ``So YOU'RE Diana Ross's sister,'' as
children the opposite was true.
</P>
<P>
   Diana would start a new year at school and hear teachers croon,
``So YOU'RE Barbara's little sister!''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara was always seen as the brains of the family and Diana
the brawn.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, when teenager Diana was an aspiring singer,
the family's Detroit apartment pounded with the music of future.
Motown stars Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Smokey Robinson crowded
around the kitchen table experimenting with the R&AMP;B sound that was
to become a part of American culture.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Barbara knew them as friends but showed little
interest in their music, ``Books were my passion,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   While Diana's singing career skyrocketed, and she claimed a
place in the history of American music, Barbara pioneered in other
ways. The first in her family to attend college, Barbara constantly
forged new paths, and today -- by her very position at Ohio
University -- claims an important place in African-America womens'
history.
</P>
<P>
   Born June 1, 1942, Barbara was the oldest of six children born
to Fred Ross, a factory worker and union steward, and his wife,
Ernestine, a homemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Accustomed to both hard work and creative financial problem
solving, Barbara held many different jobs while growing up -- from
ticket sales clerk at the Old Graystone Ballroom in Detroit and
dance instructor to microbiologist at Sealtest Dairy (which
included literally gallons of free ice cream each week for her
relatives) and mistress of ceremonies for Diana's performances with
her pre-Supremes group the Primettes.
</P>
<P>
   She always was a standout science student with a strong interest
in medical school, but didn't pursue it right after graduating from
Wayne State University in Michigan in 1965. Instead, she earned a
masters in education and began teaching junior high science.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970 a friend suggested that Barbara -- by then a divorcee
with two young children -- apply to Michigan State University
College of Osteopathic Medicine, a new medical school in Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand, I am of an age in which women,
especially minority women, found it very difficult to be accepted
in medical schools,'' Ross-Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   She was accepted and began a grueling, highly structured,
never-a-moment-to-spare, three-year campaign to become a doctor of
osteopathic medicine.
</P>
<P>
   (Osteopathy emphasizes a hands-on approach in the belief that
the muscles and bones of the body play a significant role in many
diseases. In addition to conventional tests and drugs, the
osteopathic physician's manipulative therapy may be used to correct
a wide range of physical ailments, from migraines to back strains
to Parkinson's disease.)
</P>
<P>
   After graduation and residency, Ross-Lee returned to Detroit and
for 10 years maintained a family practice in a section of the inner
city marked by poverty and a high crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't have many problems with violence, but there
were some tense circumstances,'' she said. ``My patients were as
protective of my clinic as I was, and they helped look out for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   One great frustration, however, were the number of people who
sought her out as a physician because of her famous sibling, a
concept she finds appalling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never go to a doctor because she was Barbra
Streisand's sister,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Diana appeared in concert in the Detroit area,
patients, friends and even strangers would jam the phone lines to
Barbara's medical office trying to get tickets.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most painful episodes for Barbara happened in a
hospital elevator when her mother was undergoing treatment for the
breast cancer that claimed her life in 1984. Diana was sobbing in
her sister's arms over the impending death of their mother when the
elevator operator touched her on the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me, aren't you Diana Ross? Could I have an autograph?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 Barbara began teaching family medicine at MSU-COM,
eventually becoming chairwoman of the Department of Family Medicine
and associate dean for health care policy.
</P>
<P>
   She has also completed a fellowship in nuclear medicine, is a
commissioned captain in the U.S. Naval Reserves and -- for good
measure -- was the first osteopathic physician to participate in
the prestigious Robert Wood Johnson Health Policy Fellowship, where
she worked as a legislative assistant to former U.S. Sen. Bill
Bradley for 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   As his legislative assistant for health policy, she was the lead
person representing him in the areas of women's issues, women and
children, immunizations, tobacco, alcohol and substance abuse,
senior citizens and infant mortality.
</P>
<P>
   From her office in the rolling hills of Athens, Ohio, Ross-Lee
promotes an agenda to maintain excellence in education at her
school, to improve healthcare for isolated populations in her
region of the state and -- most ambitiously -- to strengthen
osteopathic medicine's role in the national conversation regarding
primary care physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that we could
easily serve as the model for primary-care education for the rest
of the country,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Typically called ``America's other doctors,'' osteopathic
physicians make up only about 5 percent of U.S. physicians (about
35,000 compared to more than 600,000 allopathic (conventional)
medical doctors).
</P>
<P>
   These doctors are considered the more hands-on cousins of M.D.s,
providing badly needed primary care family practices and
demonstrating dedication to preventive healthcare and service to
poorer populations.
</P>
<P>
   What they DON'T have is the clout, wealth and political power of
the American Medical Association. Ross-Lee -- with her own
history-making achievements and her sister's
internationally-recognized name -- may be uniquely positioned to
change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being dean of a medical school is of no consequence unless I
can make the way better for those who will follow ... those who
must follow me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was not always a medical school dean. Before this, I was
a medical educator. Before that, I was a family physician
practicing in the inner-city of Detroit. Before that, I was a
grade-school teacher in the inner-city of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``And before that, I was poor and living in the housing projects
of Detroit.''

 &HT;    'PSYCHOBIOGRAPHER' OFFERS ANALYSIS OF CLINTON'S CHARACTER
 &HT;    330&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's unprecedented political
problems are the natural outgrowth of a psychology dominated by
exaggerated self-confidence and the notion that normal standards do
not apply to him, according to a political psychology researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Those traits - not compulsive behavior or ``sex addiction'' -
converged in Clinton's relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky and the controversy that now shakes the presidency,
says Stanley A. Renshon, a New York psychoanalyst and political
scientist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a man who dislikes boundaries and a man who believes
he should not be held to them,'' Renshon said in an interview.
``This is one of the tragedies of this whole saga. What makes a man
take those chances that he doesn't need to take? The view that he
is entitled to have what he wants, when he wants it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Renshon thinks Clinton's intellect and a lifelong
habit of outsmarting his adversaries caused the president to
believe - and probably still believe - that he can get out of any
trouble he brings upon himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that he sits in the White House now, figuring a
way he can get by this. He is probably thinking, 'If I finish my
presidency and I did a lot of good things, in the long run this
other stuff won't matter.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to be one who thinks that without some strong
sanction, something that says no to this behavior, there'll only be
another experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 1996 biography of Clinton, ``High Hopes: The Clinton
Presidency and the Politics of Ambition,'' Renshon used publicly
available information to develop a theory that attempts to describe
Clinton's character.
</P>
<P>
   The book received the American Political Science Association's
Richard Neustadt Award for the best book on the presidency and the
National Association for the Advancement of Psychoanalysis Gradiva
Award for Biography last year.
</P>
<P>
   It has been reissued in paperback by Routledge Press.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Renshon sees the president as a man whose character was formed
of three interconnected domains: ambition, integrity and
``relatedness,'' or the ability to interact with other persons.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that a childhood dominated by Clinton's capable and
self-indulgent mother, Virginia Kelley, produced a man with the
ability to invest himself in achieving an unbridled ambition but an
inability to adhere to a core of central values and ideals.
</P>
<P>
   ``His moral compass is stuck on ambition,'' Renshon said.
</P>
<P>
   As to Clinton's ability to interact with other persons, Renshon
says that while the president is an unusually charming politician,
his charm is ``manipulative, rather than real.''
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, he believes Clinton has a self-esteem bordering on
hubris and can perceive little difference between the human being
he wants to be and the one he is.
</P>
<P>
   Biographical psychoanalysis is a controversial subject, with
many psychotherapists arguing that it is impossible to understand a
personality without intensive, one-on-one therapy sessions.
</P>
<P>
   But Renshon, a practicing psychoanalyst who sees patients on a
daily basis and also teaches political science at the City
University of New York, says his work is simply a process of
collecting public facts and trying to make sense of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not magic,'' he said. ``I do what any scientist does.
I look at the evidence that his behavior generates and then I try
to make sense of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book, he relies heavily on information in books by
Washington Post reporters David Maraniss (''First in His Class: A
Biography of Bill Clinton'') and Bob Woodward (''The Agenda: Inside
the Clinton White House''), political writer Elizabeth Drew (''On
the Edge: The Clinton Presidency'') and Mrs. Kelley's
autobiography, ``Leading with My Heart: My Life.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has developed a voluminous file of newspaper and
magazine clippings, going back to Clinton's earliest appearance in
Arkansas politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear that he's a man who's constantly had problems
with the difference between what he says and what he does,''
Renshon said. ``That is documented in many, many ways. That's fact.
It would be the intellectual equivalent of malpractice not to
recognize this pattern.''

 &HT;    ANALYSIS: IMPEACHMENT FEVER MAY INFECT PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton may or may not escape
impeachment, but the path to high office has been drastically
changed by his ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Now that a mechanism exists to extract politicians' secrets via
private lawsuits, future candidates for the White House _ and
perhaps lower offices _ may think twice before running.
</P>
<P>
   The result may be a process that places a higher premium on
moral purity than competence, as impeachment, or the threat of it,
threatens to evolve into just another weapon in the political
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The psychic cost of running for president has been escalating
for some time now,'' said Dennis Simon, a political science
professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. ``Now, it's
likely to increase so much that it's probably beginning to
discourage some people.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``politics of virtue'' that is rising from the possible
impeachment of Clinton is likely to give all but the purest some
pause before seeking the nation's highest office.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, for example, has tried to slow
speculation about his political future even as he has continued to
top polls of Republicans' choices for the party's presidential
nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has enjoyed a wide zone of privacy as governor. But as a
presidential candidate, he probably will have to answer specific
questions he has refused to answer so far, such as the use of
illegal drugs and why he was once known as a ``major league
party-goer,'' as The New York Times recently described him.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri, the son and
grandson of ministers, is quickly establishing himself as the
favorite GOP son of the Christian Coalition with his ``Traditional
Values'' agenda.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, the front-runner is Vice President Al
Gore Jr., who, despite being tainted in recent investigations of
Clinton-Gore campaign fund-raising tactics, maintains a ``Boy
Scout'' reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a standard that presidents should be removed from
office only for acts that seriously harm the nation, a ``fitness
standard'' for being president is ``what's being worked out now''
as Congress moves toward impeachment hearings on Clinton, said
Gregory Wallance(cq), a New York lawyer who was a prosecutor in the
FBI's 1991 Abscam investigation of bribery in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress lowers the bar for what constitutes an impeachable
offense, it will ``almost certainly'' establish a fitness standard
for the next presidential election in which there is no privacy
zone, added Wallance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have never really decided about their presidents _
whether they can be human or they must be role models,'' said
Buckner Melton, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill law
professor who has been advising House Judiciary Committee Chairman
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., about the definition of impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is impeached for what Melton views as largely private
actions, the next round of presidential candidates will run
campaigns promoting themselves as role models, he added.
</P>
<P>
   And it is unlikely that pre-election confessions will inoculate
candidates against invasions of privacy, said Simon. ``It's OK to
try, but any candidate who does that should still expect a lot of
stories about their private lives,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Melton said the increasing partisanship in Congress's treatment
of Clinton is ``a first sign'' that impeachment may eventually
become a political tool as common as attack TV ads or opposition
research. ``It depends on just how politicized this is going to
become,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Rebecca Brown, a constitutional scholar at Vanderbilt
University's law school, expressed concern that impeachment and
civil suits against sitting presidents could undermine the
constitutional election process.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's case, lawyers pursuing Paula Jones's civil sexual
harassment suit were able to question the president about former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton's denial of a ``sexual
relationship'' has led Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr to
conclude that he committed perjury, possible grounds for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Future zealots who lose an election will not have to wait
until the next election,'' she said. ``There's a process now where
they can undo the results of an election without having to wait.''
Even Clinton's resignation in the face of possible impeachment
would be ``an affront to the constitutional system,'' she added.

FRESH FIGS ARE TO RELISH, OR TO MAKE INTO ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af) 
By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I can't say this about too many foods, but I can vividly
remember my first taste of a fresh fig. This is because I grew up
at a time when this plump, succulent fruit was sold almost
exclusively in its dried form.
</P>
<P>
   It took me 20-plus years of life to encounter a fresh fig, and
that was in Rome. In both appearance and taste it was unexpected
and spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Like chestnuts, fresh figs are so common in Mediterranean
countries that they are taken for granted _ there are places where
you can hardly give them away _ and yet I still encounter friends
and relatives who have never tried one.
</P>
<P>
   But now fresh figs are sold not only at fancy markets (where
they cost as much as $3 each), but also at sidewalk stands
throughout Manhattan (where the price runs to a more acceptable $2
a basket), at Italian grocery stores everywhere and even at many
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   And their season is now.
</P>
<P>
   While the best way to eat figs is out of hand _ few fruits are
as luxurious _ there are rewarding ways to employ them in the
kitchen. Add them to sauteed and braised dishes, especially those
made with dark, winey sauces, during the last few minutes of
cooking, and they contribute an element of delightfully sweet
surprise. And cooked figs become even juicier and more tender than
they are when raw.
</P>
<P>
   Figs add liquid to foods rather than absorb it. This tendency
reminded me of two other foods long associated with the
Mediterranean, the olive and the eggplant. Which, in turn, led me
to try treating the fig the way I often do those fruits _ mashing
them with a variety of herbs and spices and making a sauce.
</P>
<P>
   As I experimented with the fresh figs, I was thinking of
eggplant caponata and olive tapenade, both of which are moist,
highly seasoned all-purpose relishes.
</P>
<P>
   There are differences, of course: unlike caponata and tapenade,
fig relish does not make an especially good spread, or even a dip.
And although the herbs used with them are similar, fig relish
remains sweet.
</P>
<P>
   This fig relish really shines as an impromptu sauce. It is
especially successful on grilled swordfish or tuna, but nearly as
good with grilled or broiled chicken (especially dark meat), pork,
lamb or beef.
</P>
<P>
   Note that all of these foods contain some fat: combining the fig
relish with superlean meats or fish like boneless chicken or
flounder produces dishes that seem to lack substance.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe is my favorite way to combine figs and seasonings,
but it is hardly the last word on the subject. Possible additions
and substitutions abound.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you can add a tiny amount (a quarter-teaspoon or
so) of minced garlic to the relish, or alternatively, crush a
garlic clove and let it sit in the mixture for a few minutes,
fishing it out just before serving. Add a teaspoon or more of
minced shallots _ or a couple of tablespoons of chopped olives or
anchovies. Lime or mild vinegar can be substituted for the lemon.
</P>
<P>
   You can also change the herbs: a teaspoon of minced thyme or
rosemary in place of the basil makes the relish considerably more
pungent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GRILLED SWORDFISH WITH FIG RELISH
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces fresh figs
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced capers
</P>
<P>
   Zest of 1 lemon, minced
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and fresh black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 large or 2 smaller swordfish steaks, a total of 1{ to 2 pounds
(tuna may be substituted)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped basil. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Start a charcoal or wood fire or preheat a gas grill or the
broiler. The fire should be moderately hot, and the rack set about
4 inches from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   2. Gently rinse and stem the figs; chop them into about \-inch
pieces, being sure to catch all the juice. Toss in a bowl with the
capers, lemon zest and juice, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, salt
and pepper. Set aside while you cook the fish.
</P>
<P>
   3. Brush or rub the fish with the remaining oil, season it with
salt and pepper and grill it, turning once, for a total of 6 to 12
minutes. (Swordfish is done when firm and almost opaque throughout;
tuna can be cooked to any degree of doneness you like.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Just before serving, add the herbs to the fig relish; then
taste and adjust the seasonings. Serve the fish with the fig relish
spooned on top.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

BRIGANTE DEI BARBI: A HEARTY MATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brigante dei Barbi, Fattoria dei Barbi, 1994, Tuscany. About
$42.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombini family, owners of the Fattoria dei Barbi, say this
wine was named for a local thief, or brigand, who satisfied his yen
for good food and wine by breaking into their cellars. His name was
Bruscone. No matter.
</P>
<P>
   The wine is a worthy companion to the great Barbi Brunellos and
can take its place among the Super-Tuscans, elite wines employing
nontraditional Tuscan grapes. The Brigante blend is 50 percent
sangiovese grosso, the grape of Brunello, and 50 percent merlot.
</P>
<P>
   The sangiovese spent 24 months in large oak casks; the merlot 14
months in French oak barrels. Brigante occupies a place behind the
three Barbi Brunellos and in front of a less expensive sangiovese
blend known as Brusco dei Barbi.
</P>
<P>
   Brigante is a rich, intense wine with a deep garnet color. It
should have a long life, but it can be enjoyed now and will go well
with hearty late-fall meals.

DRUM ROLL, PLEASE, FOR THE 1995 BORDEAUX 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you plan to buy wine in the next few weeks, and you probably
do, as more wine is sold in the fourth quarter of the year than at
any other time, there is no question about what you should buy:
1995 Bordeaux. It is one of the better vintages of the waning
century.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, some prices are incredible. The 1995 Chateaux Margaux and
Mouton-Rothschild are $300 to $350 a bottle, Lafite is around $250
and Petrus at least $1,000. Yes, for a single bottle. But so what?
That some new BMWs cost $90,000 doesn't seem to stop a lot of
people from enjoying Toyotas at $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, first-growth prices are for collectors and investors,
not for mere mortals who actually drink wine. For drinkers, there
are many good buys among the 1995 Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995s are big wines, which means they are dark in color,
rich in flavor and tannic. And yet, remarkably, many of them are
already good to drink.
</P>
<P>
   The writer A.J. Liebling once observed that a great wine has two
publics: one that likes it for its profound qualities as well as
its superficial ones, and another that likes it only because it is
easy to like.
</P>
<P>
   Some people will buy these beautifully balanced 1995s and
happily drink them up. Others will buy a few cases, try a bottle,
congratulate themselves on their astute purchase, then stash the
rest away for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the youthful appeal of these wines, they have the tannins
that will enable them to profit from the complexity that extra
aging gives. Either way, it will be hard to lose.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 vintage in Bordeaux was uniformly good. This is not an
empty compliment. In some years _ 1997 appears to have been one of
them _ unpredictable weather patterns can cause one vineyard to
produce ripe healthy fruit while an adjoining one turns out grapes
that are immature and acidic.
</P>
<P>
   Buying wines from that kind of vintage is like walking through a
minefield: only an expert knows which way to go.
</P>
<P>
   The summer of 1995 was dry and hot in Bordeaux. There was rain
in September, but not enough to dilute the grapes. Merlot, the
principal grape in the right bank communities of St.-Emilion and
Pomerol, was particularly successful. Merlot ripens earlier than
cabernet, which means much of it was less affected by the autumn
rain.
</P>
<P>
   Parenthetically, the river banks referred to here are those of
the Garonne River, which rises in the Pyrenees, and its
continuation, the Gironde, into which it flows north into the
Atlantic. St.-Emilion and Pomerol are inland, hence to the east of
the river. Sauternes, Graves and the Medoc are on the left bank.
</P>
<P>
   Among the right bank 1995s worth considering are, first of all,
Chateau Figeac. This magnificent property in St.-Emilion has
produced some great wines, and this 1995 is one of the best in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   This is also the 50th anniversary of the chateau under the
ownership of the Manoncourt family. The wine is concentrated but
rounded and accessible, making it tempting to drink now. It is not
inexpensive, though, selling for $70.
</P>
<P>
   More appealing pricewise and still excellent is Chateau de
Sales, from Pomerol. This one would sell well just on its bouquet;
it is $25. Haut Corbin, from St.-Emilion, also $25, and La Cabanne,
from Pomerol, a few dollars less, are other worthy choices.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, from this part of the Bordeaux spectrum, there is
Chateau Monbousquet. A new owner, Gerard Perse, has changed the
wine's style. It is darker, richer and less accessible when young,
but gives every sign of having a great future. It needs a few years
in the bottle; $40.
</P>
<P>
   In the Medoc, on the left bank, the great star of the vintage is
Chateau Margaux. The people who rate wine by numbers are talking
unhesitatingly about 100 out of 100 for this one. At upward of $300
a bottle and $3,600 a case, most people are going to have to take
the critics' word.
</P>
<P>
   But Chateau Margaux also makes a second wine, mostly from
younger vines, called Pavillon Rouge. It goes for $60; in this
overheated market it is probably worth it. In a good year, any
Chateau Margaux will be a treat.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the commune of Margaux, Sacha Lichine has continued the
drive of his late father, Alexis, to improve Chateau
Prieure-Lichine. The 1995 promises to open into a beautifully
balanced wine in a year or two; it is about $30.
</P>
<P>
   Another praiseworthy Margaux is Chateau d'Angludet, nurtured and
restored by Peter A. Sichel, who died earlier this year. The 1995
is a surprisingly big wine, and a good buy at $25.
</P>
<P>
   One more excellent second wine is Les Fiefs de Lagrange, from
Chateau Lagrange in the commune of St.-Julien. It's not easy to
find a St.-Julien of this quality at this price, $20.
</P>
<P>
   Chateau d'Armailhac, adjacent to and owned by Chateau
Mouton-Rothschild, is a forward wine, good for drinking now. It is
intense, but soft on the finish. It is not the second wine of
Mouton, but a separate entity worth its price of $27 to $30.
</P>
<P>
   In St.-Estephe, the northernmost of the famous Medoc wine
communes, Chateau Phelan-Segur is a best buy. This property has
been renewed over the last six years, and the wine shows it.
</P>
<P>
   St.-Estephe wines are historically tougher and more tannic than
wines from the more southern communes. Phelan-Segur has good
structure and it will last, but its almost rustic quality sets it
apart from its neighbors. It is $27.
</P>
<P>
   These are only a handful of the good wines from 1995. Keep in
mind that the vintage was a good one across the board. At whatever
price you can afford, your chances of getting a good bottle are
excellent.

VIVE LA PIZZA: SIMPLE, RUSTIC AND, YES, FRENCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even though the French influence is everywhere in New
York's culinary world, a few foods that are common in France have
managed to escape the city's dragnet and remain almost unknown
here. The French pizza is one stunning example. Yes, pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is most often known as a pissaladiere, it is what it
is: a round, flat bread, crisp on the bottom, simply garnished on
top, rustic and yet urbane.
</P>
<P>
   At first, I couldn't remember seeing even one here, but recently
I went searching for these French pizzas, with some success. At the
restaurant Provence in SoHo, there is in fact a pissaladiere that
gets it just right: a serving of leavened bread with a thin,
brittle crust on the bottom and, on the top, a blanket of golden
sauteed onions and a bit of anchovy.
</P>
<P>
   At Picholine on the Upper West Side, a similar but smaller
pissaladiere is sometimes offered as an appetizer. Another kind of
French pizza, the tarte flambee of Alsace, usually served with
bacon, chopped onion and a touch of the creamy cheese called
fromage blanc, is a study in achieving complex flavors and textures
with the minimum number of ingredients. Mercer Kitchen in SoHo
serves one version.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond these, the offerings are sparse, indeed. But travel
through the regions of France with your eyes open for anything that
looks like pizza, and you'll come back impressed not only by how
plentiful these pizzas are but also by their variety.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like the galette de Perouges, are sweet rather than
savory. And many of them are served at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the pizzas of France and Italy, despite having different
tendencies in herbs and cheese, have more in common with each other
than they do with most of those produced here.
</P>
<P>
   Most American pizzas appeal to the national tendency toward
excess, and they have been corrupted into serving as a complete
meal _ a weighty concoction consisting of a ton of chewy mozzarella
and a host of strong-flavored ingredients loaded onto a crust that,
whether thick or thin, can barely support its toppings.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, most pizzas are exactly in the spirit of the
pissaladiere and the tarte flambee, often with toppings that are no
more than a sprinkling of rosemary, salt and olive oil. Or more
elaborately, there is the addition of a few slices of tomato and a
little fresh mozzarella, with the cheese lighter and less stringy
than what we're used to.
</P>
<P>
   That simplicity is more in keeping with the origin of pizza,
which probably occurred spontaneously in different places. The
likeliest explanation is this:
</P>
<P>
   In areas where bread was a staple, communal ovens were
traditionally fired up only once or twice a week. Since large
loaves keep better than smaller ones, the standard loaf was four to
nine pounds. It was only natural for the frugal bakers to throw the
remaining scraps of dough into the oven while it was heating.
</P>
<P>
   Some dough was undoubtedly formed into small loaves _ rolls,
essentially _ and some was patted into flat, pielike breads that
cooked almost instantly. The temptation to top these flat breads
with whatever was around was obviously irresistible. The result was
pizza, or whatever you want to call it. The variations from one
region to another might be merely matters of nuance or effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Provencal version of the pissaladiere, for instance, is
often garnished with two of the region's signature ingredients:
black olives and sliced tomatoes, both in minuscule amounts by our
standard. It is usually served at room temperature as often as not
because in Provence, and throughout France, pizza is snack bread.
Since it lacks gobs of cheese congealing on top, it retains its
appeal even when cool.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best pissaladiere I ever had was served at Cours
Saleya, the wonderful open-air market in the heart of old Nice. It
was baked in a wood-burning oven a few blocks away, sent to the
market by bicycle and eaten standing up or at picnic tables shaded
by huge awnings.
</P>
<P>
   The wedges were gently sweet and intensely salty; the crust,
just a half-inch thick, was perfumed with the local olive oil and
was perfectly browned and crisp. It was so simple _ mostly just
sweet onions on a wonderful crust. And yet it was so much more.
</P>
<P>
   If pissaladiere is the most familiar of the French pizzas,
galette de Perouges is the most surprising. This is the best-known
product of Perouges, a well-preserved and perfectly restored
medieval village not far from Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   Although galette is a word used for many free-form tarts in
France, this particular galette seems more familiar than most: a
large, round pie, slid into an oven on a paddle and cut into crisp
wedges.
</P>
<P>
   On closer inspection, however, and especially on tasting, this
is no common variation on pizza. The crust is rich and sweet _ a
yeasted dough made with butter and sugar, and rolled nearly flat.
And the topping is butter and sugar; no more.
</P>
<P>
   Since this is remarkably fertile farmland, one of the most
productive areas of France, it is perhaps not surprising that its
pizza is supremely rich.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The galette is baked in a hot oven until the sugar caramelizes
and the crust becomes brittle; unlike most pizzas, this dough is
not chewy but crunchy. You can buy slices of the galette on the
street, but it is best eaten as served at the Ostellerie du Vieux
Perouges, the 500-year-old hotel-restaurant in the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   There, it is presented as a more formal dessert, with fresh
fruit and a toupin, or tub, of creme fraiche.
</P>
<P>
   The tarte flambee of Alsace may be the world's northernmost
indigenous and legitimate pizza. You see it everywhere, although it
is most common in the north, around Strasbourg.
</P>
<P>
   Alsace is French, of course, but the food, language and
appearance are quite German in character. In this regional
crossroads, there are many variations, based largely on the
background of the baker.
</P>
<P>
   Tarte flambee is a bit puffier and less flat than most pizza.
Although it is usually spread with fromage blanc, bacon and onion
before baking, there are many variations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The differences are usually based on religion,'' said Norbert
Mueller, the owner of Chez Norbert, a restaurant in Bergheim, a
village in Alsace. ``Protestants, who are economical, often use
much less cheese; Jews, who don't eat pork, omit the bacon, and
Catholics make them as rich as possible.'' This last generalization
may be based on the fact that Friday _ traditionally a meatless day
for Catholics _ was also the day on which many ovens were fired up,
so a rich tarte flambee might have been the day's main meal.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the variation, there is a peculiar convention in tarte
flambee: Each wedge is rolled from the wide crust end to its point,
and the rolls are eaten end to end.
</P>
<P>
   Since French pizzas are so difficult to find outside France _
and are among the easiest of all pizzas to make _ it makes sense to
try them at home. Drawing inspiration from what I tasted in France,
and from Charles Van Over's book, ``The Best Bread Ever''
(Broadway, 1997), I recreated three French pizza recipes.
</P>
<P>
   I took a couple of liberties, for simplicity's sake. First, I
used the same dough for both pissaladiere and tarte flambee; a
classic tarte flambee's dough would be made without the olive oil I
use here, but I think it only enhances it.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the best tarte flambee uses onions that have been salted
for a day or so; salting draws out their water, which makes them
milder and helps them to brown. It's a nice refinement, but not
essential.
</P>
<P>
   And assuming that few people have access to fromage blanc, I
substituted a combination of sour cream and milk, which I believe
works equally well; it also makes a good stand-in for creme
fraiche, if you want to serve it with a galette de Perouges.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, my pizza dough recipe makes enough for two pizzas; if
you're baking only one, wrap the remaining dough in plastic and
freeze it for as long as a month. Then, just bring it to room
temperature and pick up right where you left off. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DOUGH FOR PISSALADIERE OR TARTE FLAMBEE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: at least 1 hour &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon instant or rapid-rise yeast
</P>
<P>
   3 cups (about 14 ounces) all-purpose or bread flour, plus more
as needed
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon olive oil. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Combine yeast, flour and salt in food processor. Turn machine
on, and add 1 cup water and 2 tablespoons oil through feed tube. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Process for about 30 seconds, adding more water through feed
tube, a little at a time, until mixture forms a ball and is
slightly sticky to the touch. If it is dry, add another tablespoon
or two of water, and process for another 10 seconds. (In unlikely
event that mixture is too sticky, add flour, a tablespoon at a
time.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Turn dough onto floured work surface, and knead by hand for a
few seconds to form a smooth, round ball. Grease bowl with
remaining olive oil, and place dough in it. Cover with plastic wrap
or damp cloth, and let rise in warm, draft-free area until dough
just about doubles in size, or at least 1 hour. (You can also let
dough rise more slowly, in refrigerator, for as long as 6 or 8
hours.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. Follow recipe for pissaladiere or tarte flambee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: Enough dough for 2 pizzas, each approximately 12 inches. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   TARTE FLAMBEE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 to 60 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dough for 1 tart (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   Flour for sprinkling over dough
</P>
<P>
   Oil for baking sheet
</P>
<P>
   1 cup fromage blanc or creme fraiche, or } cup sour cream
thinned with one-third cup milk
</P>
<P>
   One-third to { cup minced onions
</P>
<P>
   One-third to { cup minced bacon
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to at least 500 degrees (600 is better, if your
oven goes that high). Knead dough lightly, and place it on a
lightly floured surface; sprinkle it with a little more flour, and
cover with plastic wrap or towel. Let it rest while oven heats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Pat or roll out dough as thinly as possible to diameter of 12
inches, using more flour or oil as necessary. The process will be
easier if you allow dough to rest occasionally between rollings. If
you have a pizza stone in your oven, place dough on a floured peel,
or long-handled board; if you do not, lay dough on baking sheet
brushed lightly with olive oil. Let dough rest for 15 to 30
minutes, or until it begins to puff ever so slightly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Spread fromage blanc or alternatives on dough. Sprinkle with
onions, bacon, a little salt and plenty of pepper. Bake until
nicely crisp, about 10 minutes; if tart is browning unevenly,
rotate it back to front about halfway through cooking time. Serve
hot. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: about 4 servings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PISSALADIERE &QL;
</P>

<P>
   6 to 10 anchovies (optional)
</P>
<P>
   About 12 good pitted black olives, cut in half (optional)
</P>
<P>
   6 to 8 thin slices of tomato (optional). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Knead dough lightly, and place
it on lightly floured surface; sprinkle it with a little more
flour, and cover with plastic wrap or towel. Let rest while oven
heats and you cook the onions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Place olive oil in large skillet, and turn heat to
medium-high. Add onions, along with some salt and pepper, and cook,
stirring frequently, until onions give up their liquid and become
quite soft, at least 15 minutes; do not allow onions to brown. When
they are cooked, turn off heat and stir in thyme. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Pat or roll out dough as thinly as possible to diameter of 12
inches, using more flour or oil as necessary. The process will be
easier if you allow dough to rest occasionally between rollings. If
you have a pizza stone in your oven, place dough on a floured peel,
or long-handled board; if you do not, lay dough on baking sheet
brushed lightly with olive oil. Let dough rest for 15 to 30
minutes, or until it begins to puff ever so slightly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. Spread dough with onions, and then decorate, if you like,
with anchovies, olives, and tomato. Bake until nicely crisp, 15
minutes or more; if tart is browning unevenly, rotate it back to
front about halfway through cooking time. Serve hot or at room
temperature. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   1. Combine yeast, flour, salt, tablespoon of sugar, cold butter,
egg and lemon zest in food processor. Turn machine on, let it run
for a second until mixture is blended, and then let machine run
while you add \ cup water through feed tube, a little at a time,
until mixture forms a ball and is slightly sticky to the touch. If
it is dry, add another tablespoon or 2 of water, and process for
another 10 seconds. (In the unlikely event that mixture is too
sticky, add flour, a tablespoon at a time.)
</P>
<P>
   3. Turn dough onto very lightly floured work surface, and knead
by hand for a few seconds to form a smooth, round ball. Place in a
bowl, covered with plastic wrap or damp cloth, and let rise in
warm, draft-free area until dough just about doubles in size, or at
least 1 hour. (You can also let dough rise more slowly, in

</P>
<P>
   5. Pat or roll out dough as thinly as possible to a diameter of

`MULAN' COMES TO LIFE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Messages about ``girl power'' aside, Disney's
animated feature ``Mulan'' was decidedly cute. Think Mushu, the
jive-talking dragon.
</P>
<P>
   Now, four months after the summer film release, there's an
opportunity to view a more authentic and serious representation of
the tale _ and you don't have to travel to China.
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing Opera will perform ``Mulan, the Woman Warrior'' on
Oct. 24 at CSUN as a fund-raiser for the Northridge-based San
Fernando Valley Chinese Cultural Association.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Mulan'' opera will star Shurui Yang, China's top opera
diva and a national heroine who &UR;  &LR; has performed with musical
legends, including Luciano Pavarotti.
</P>
<P>
   Yang, who lives in San Gabriel, said she hopes audience members
won't come anticipating a live Disney, fairy-tale version of Mulan
complete with Asian mysticism and a romantic interest.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the ``Mulan'' opera will focus more on Mulan's humility
and her loyalty to her family and country. The legend of Mulan is
based on an ancient poem about a dutiful and brave girl who
disguises herself as a boy to replace her conscripted father in the
Chinese Imperial army.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping with Chinese tradition, the Beijing Opera will feature
acrobatics and minimal dialogue, unlike European operas. But the
exaggerated gestures and props help tell the tale. And although the
opera will be presented in Chinese, don't worry, the story will be
spelled out for you in English in the opera's program.
</P>
<P>
   The opera is one of the Chinese cultural association's bigger
fund-raisers. The association also will host a fund-raising banquet
Friday at the Universal Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1971, the nonprofit organization promotes Chinese
culture and heritage and serves families in the San Fernando and
San Gabriel valleys. The group eventually hopes to establish a
proposed $6 million Chinese Heritage Center in the San Fernando
Valley. A site has not yet been selected.
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing Opera also will perform ``Mulan'' at the Chao
Performing Center in El Monte on Oct. 18 &UR;  &LR; as another association
fund-raiser.

GETTING UP TO `SPEED'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; You've seen them on TV, those warm-and-fuzzy
commercials showing Greek fishermen doing spreadsheets on their
laptops, or Bedouin tribesmen miraculously tapping into the latest
cell phone technology.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Anderson has seen this sunny, corporatized vision of the
future, too. But she's not necessarily buying it. Though her
artistic career has been built around cutting-edge electronic
experimentation, Anderson today sounds a bit turned off by all this
talk of a digital brave new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just was so sick of this incredibly teary version of the
future: `Everyone's plugged in, it's just going to be amazing,' ''
says the 49-year-old high-tech muse, speaking by phone from her
offices in Manhattan's TriBeCa district.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was something that rang in the wrong way for me. There's
something a little too much about salesmanship. I thought, `There's
gotta be a catch here. What's really going on?' I mean, I actually
see it as one of the most successful marketing ploys of all time,
to convince people, especially Americans _ you know, it really
works very well on us because everybody's so terrified of falling
behind, we're so competitive. And the whole thing is like, `Unless
your web site's really cool, you're gonna fall behind.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling ambivalent about the shape of things to come is nothing
new for Anderson. When she first pierced the popular imagination,
in 1981, it was with her spooky electronic ode ``O Superman,'' in
which a mother's taped phone greeting morphs into an ominous
presentiment of military-industrial power-mongering.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she repeatedly has addressed technological themes
while partnering with such artistic innovators as musicians Nile
Rogers, Brian Eno, Peter Gabriel and current beau Lou Reed,
performance artist Spalding Gray and film directors Jonathan Demme
and Wim Wenders.
</P>
<P>
   What's unusual about Anderson's latest project, ``The Speed of
Darkness,'' isn't so much its content as its form. The 80-minute,
intermissionless work, which will have its L.A. premiere Friday at
UCLA's Royce Hall, uses only keyboards, violin and digital
processing equipment. Invoking three different settings _ a
theater, a mental hospital and a control room _ ``The Speed of
Darkness'' suggests how these places are fusing into a single
post-industrial techno-culture.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson performs solo on a near-empty stage, riffing about the
future of art and technology in her sing-songy voice, while
touching on cybersex, the Internet and the role coffee plays in
fueling visually overstimulated virtual environments.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her 1995 tour ``The Nerve Bible,'' a multimedia spectacle
that demanded 33 tons of equipment, ``The Speed of Darkness''
employs no minicams, video projections or animated cartoon
chorines. Anderson says the work's subject matter dictated its
stripped-down aesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a choice about how it should look and feel, and what
control is,'' she explains. ``I thought, `I'll just do this in the
most simple way.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sort of like ``Laurie Anderson Unplugged''?
</P>
<P>
   Anderson demurs. ``Unplugged, you know, for me is like 50
plugs,'' she says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I don't like machines. I, unfortunately, love
them; I adore them. And I equally hate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson says she wrote ``The Speed of Darkness'' two years ago
as a diatribe about everyday life in the computer age. She expected
that her feelings would change and she'd become more enamored of
computers and the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she's become less interested, drawing a parallel
between the Internet and cable television: 30 million Web sites and
nothin' on. She also finds the digital aesthetic to be either too
``smooth and glitzy'' or else grainy and ``inherently ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I don't love low-res (resolution) stuff, I really do,
like, a great stray pencil drawing, you know, (or) a guitar solo
that's done on just the world's oldest, crummiest guitar but is so
heartfelt it's just amazing. You know, that stuff. But I think
there's so much temptation in digital stuff to make something that
has this corporate aesthetic, that it comes out looking real
heartless.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Anderson's hardly becoming a neo-Luddite. She has
released a CD-ROM and maintains her own Web page. Her beef, she
says, isn't with technology per se, but with its relentless
promotion as a panacea for uncertain times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that even compared to five years ago, certainly to 10,
people are so much more insecure about what they're going to be
doing. Their jobs are sort of, they do one thing for a while and
then that industry falls apart, or whatever. It didn't used to be
so precarious. And I blame that on speed, and on this incredible
sort of personal arms race people have gotten into.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson wasn't surprised by a recently published study
indicating that people who spend large amounts of time on the
Internet are more likely to suffer from feelings of loneliness and
depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing about staring at a rectangle in your room _
any rectangle,'' she says. ``I'm on a rampage against rectangles,
because the way they organize the world for you is so horrible. So,
all the projections that I'm doing are onto these really jagged
surfaces or three-dimensional things.''
</P>
<P>
   Her next project, ``Song and Stories From Moby Dick,'' may take
Anderson even further away from the late 20th century.
Co-commissioned by UCLA and co-directed by avant-garde mainstay
Anne Bogart, the piece is an idiosyncratic interpretation of Herman
Melville's mystic yarn about whaling and the nature of God.
Transposing its weirdly beautiful language into music has been ``a
struggle,'' Anderson says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had forgotten how totally strange this thing is, I mean so,
so strange! I mean, all these images of enormous heads _ that's the
thing that just struck me when I read it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And this also is something where I'm going to be working with
actors. I've never done that before. So, it's totally terrifying to
me. It's opening in April. Every morning, I wake up in a cold
sweat.''

FOOD QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS: LEVELING A LAYER CAKE; EATING PIGEONS;
GOLDEN SYRUP FROM BRITAIN; WATER BATH FOR CHEESECAKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: The word AT in parentheses has been used in the last graf

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leveling a Layer Cake
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know of a baking or cooling method that keeps the tops
of layer cakes flat? I want to avoid slicing off the tops.
</P>
<P>
   A: While there is not exactly a solution to the problem of domed
cake layers, there are a few things you can do to minimize the
peak.
</P>
<P>
   The first is to make sure that your oven is properly calibrated
(oven thermometers are available in kitchenware stores). If it's
not, adjust the oven setting until the thermometer registers the
temperature called for in the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   An oven that gets too hot encourages a cake to rise unevenly.
This is because the sides of cake that touch the pan cook and set
faster than the center, which continues to rise while baking.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, a cake baked in a 350-degree oven will have a
relatively flat top (there may be a slight rounding), an even color
and a fine-textured crumb.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to avoid a high peak is to bake the cake in a heavy
pan with a dull surface, like one made from aluminum. This type of
pan distributes heat evenly, resulting in a more level cake.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't mind getting another piece of kitchen equipment,
you could look for a product called Magi-Cake Strips. These are
made from aluminized fabric, and when dampened and secured around
the outside of the pan, they help keep the sides cooler.
</P>
<P>
   This way, the sides and the center of the cake can rise and bake
at the same rate.
</P>
<P>
   Magi-Cake Strips are available in some kitchenware stores and
can be ordered from Sweet Celebrations, (800) 328-6722. They cost
$16.50, plus tax and shipping, for a set of three sizes.
</P>
<P>
   There is one advantage, though, to slicing off the top of a cake
to level it out.
</P>
<P>
   It gives the baker a chance to taste the cake and to exercise a
little quality control before serving it to guests.
</P>
<P>
   It's Pigeonneau, Not Pigeon
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have noticed ``pigeon'' on a number of menus. Could this
possibly be the bird New Yorkers know all too well?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, the slate-colored birds that many New Yorkers regard as
little more than ``rats with wings'' are not the same birds that
French gastronomes love to serve roasted with their livers. But the
two are related.
</P>
<P>
   The pigeon family comprises many species, including the
succulent wood pigeon that the French call pigeonneau, and the
tough-fleshed, city-dwelling rock pigeon, which no one would want
to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Pigeonneaux, which are called squabs in the United States, are
bred and raised for food. They are sold when they are still quite
young, before the birds learn to fly. As a result, squabs have very
tender flesh with a strong, meaty flavor. They are a favorite of
many chefs _ no matter what they are called.
</P>
<P>
   A Sweet Touch From Britain
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have two recipes for Australian sweets that call for golden
syrup. What is it, and can I substitute something else?
</P>
<P>
   A: Golden syrup is exactly what the name implies _ a thick,
sweet syrup with a rich, almost nutty flavor and a pale amber hue.
It's made by boiling down sugar-cane juice, and it's a great
favorite in Australia and in Britain, where it's also known as
light treacle.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy golden syrup in gourmet shops and some large
supermarkets, and online at www.flavourofbritain.com ($3 for a
1-pound can). If you don't have any on hand, light corn syrup or a
very mild honey makes an adequate substitute.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being used in baked goods, golden syrup makes a
terrific topping for ice cream, pancakes, French toast and waffles,
and can be spread on buttered toast in place of marmalade _ a snack
that British children adore.
</P>
<P>
   Water Bath for Cheesecake?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there any advantage to baking cheesecake in a water bath,
that is, placing a spring-form pan in a pan of water while baking?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, there is. An oven's heat is spotty, while a pan of water
is one temperature throughout. Baking cheesecakes _ or custards or
other baked goods _ in a pan of water allows them to cook evenly
and slowly. The result is a more uniform texture; instead of the
outside cooking before the inside, the whole thing cooks at the
same rate.
</P>
<P>
   A water bath also helps prevent overcooking, and because the
rising steam creates a moist environment, it eliminates hard, brown
edges.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the safest way to bake using a water bath is to bring
a kettle of water to a boil while you preheat the oven. Wrap the
outside of your spring-form pan in foil to guard against leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Then set a roasting pan (or any pan bigger than the cheesecake
pan) on the oven rack, and set the cheesecake in the empty pan.
Pour the boiling water into the roasting pan until it comes halfway
up the side of the spring-form pan. Since the pan is already in the
oven, you won't have to move it and risk spilling boiling water.
</P>
<P>
   To test a cheesecake for doneness _ without inserting a knife _
gently shake the pan back and forth. The cheesecake should jiggle
ever so slightly in the center, but be essentially set _ just a
little looser than gelatin.
</P>
<P>

HOME SECRETS: LIGHTBULBS TO PLAYING CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who knew that electric light bulbs could be used to mold
chocolate cups? Or that hotel shower caps can be used to cover
bowls in the refrigerator?
</P>
<P>
   No one could accuse Dining section readers of lacking in
resourcefulness.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's column about unusual kitchen equipment used by chefs
(``Quick, Hide the Tools. Here Comes a Chef.'') included a request
for readers' own unconventional and ingenious tricks. The responses
flowed in a steady, lively stream.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few home cooks, it seems, who have been hitting the
hardware store and drugstore as hard as chefs.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley B. Dickes uses the lightbulbs to mold chocolate cups as
follows. He oils a bulb _ 60, 75 or 100 watt, depending on the size
cup you want _ then dips it halfway into warm, melted chocolate and
stands it on wax paper. Once the chocolate cools, the bulb can
simply be lifted off.
</P>
<P>
   Nylon mesh paint strainers, Catherine Jones wrote, can be used
when making flavored broths or chai. She fills a stockpot with
water, fits the strainer _ which looks like a mesh sack with an
elastic opening _ over the rim of the pot and loads it with
vegetables and herbs or chai spices. (You may want to wash the bag
before you use it.)
</P>
<P>
   After cooking, she simply lifts out the strainer, and with it
the spices and vegetables. Phyllis Schondorf had a similar
alternative to cheesecloth: she uses a closed pierced spoon, the
kind normally used for steeping loose tea, for holding spices when
pickling or making soups.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Anchin has found a novel way to cut onions without tears.
No, she doesn't keep a piece of bread perched on her tongue or
breathe through her mouth. She wears a snorkel mask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wearing my snorkel mask,'' she wrote, ``I slice, chop and
grate, and my eyes never tear or burn.'' Never mind the odd view
into her kitchen window.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most unusual idea came from Ratna Sarkar, who uses
playing cards to spread crepe batter thinly and evenly on a hot
griddle. ``Pour a ladleful of the batter on the griddle and quickly
spread with the edge of the card, using two semicircular sweeping
motions,'' she advised. ``Aces are particularly good.''
</P>
<P>
   Several readers integrated equipment used in their professions
into the kitchen. Dave Gibboni, a chemist, likes to use a
cone-shaped Erlenmeyer flask to steep saffron in hot water: after
all, it was designed so you can swirl a solution without spilling.
</P>
<P>
   He also favors a 10-inch-long, nickel-plated lab spatula, which
has a scoop at one end and a flat blade at the other, for removing
small amounts of dried spices and herbs from narrow-mouthed jars.
And he assured us, there are such places as discount lab equipment
houses where one can buy these things.
</P>
<P>
   Two readers recommended doctors' hemostats, or surgical clamps,
for removing pin bones from fish and for pulling ``boil in the
bag'' vegetables from boiling water. (Kitchen tongs work, too.)
</P>
<P>
   But cooking equipment makers, listen up: not all of your
products end up in the kitchen. On her first dig, Naomi Miller, an
archeologist, used a grapefruit knife to scrape away dirt from
delicate objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've also used little Italian gelato spoons to scoop up
charred plant remains,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The chemist who uses Erlenmeyer flasks in his kitchen takes bits
of his kitchen to the lab, too. He uses butcher's paper for
transferring powders and a wood-handled spatula, usually used for
flipping eggs, as a lab scoop.
</P>
<P>
   One reader relies on her hand-held beater to mix paint. You may
not want to eat whipped cream at her house.
</P>
<P>
   A few readers told me things that might make me want to decline
their dinner invitations. One man cooks salmon in his dishwasher.
Another reader wrote approvingly of her neighbor's practice of
drying salad on the spin cycle in her washing machine. Is it left
with an ever-so-slight scent of Tide?

IN CHARD, THE GLORY LIES IN THE GREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BARBARA KAFKA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Swiss Chard has a secret: it really is a type of beet. But while
the stars of the beet family _ the red beet and the Italian
red-and-white beet _ are valued primarily for their bulbous roots,
chard's glory is its magnificent greenery.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, every inch of its stems, ribs and leaves can be used in
a variety of dishes that seem just right for fall and winter
nights.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans have known this for centuries. In Provence and on the
Ligurian coast of Italy, where the local dialects use the same
words for ``chard'' and ``beet,'' young stems and leaves are cut up
and sauteed like spinach, and larger plants are steamed or boiled
and dressed with a hollandaise sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Since chard is so versatile, it is a shame to waste any of it.
Leaves not used in a recipe can always be cut in strips and added
to bean or legume soups. Extra stems can be blanched and served
like asparagus.
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of chard. Swiss chard is green with very
pale green to white stems and ribs. Ruby chard, has green leaves,
but red stems and ribs. Swiss chard is milder in taste, while ruby
chard's flavor is more beetlike.
</P>
<P>
   When chard is young, you can cook the leaves with their ribs,
which branch out into the leaf from the stem. But the ribs become
thicker and more fibrous in older, larger chard and take more time
to cook than the leaves, so it is best to separate the leaves from
the ribs before cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Simply cut the leaf away from the central rib with a knife, or
hold the stem in one hand and with the other hand fold the leaf
over the rib and pull the leaf away from it.
</P>
<P>
   A bunch of chard on the stem can vary from 10 to 20 ounces.
Cooked leaves shrink; a pound cooks down to a cup. Stems stay
roughly the same size after cooking.
</P>
<P>
   The rich chard gratin given here should be made with the white
stems of green chard, both for looks and for a more elegant flavor.
The chard tart, typically Provencal, can be made with red or green
leaves or a combination of both.
</P>
<P>
   Sauteeing the stems of ruby chard in an anchovy and garlic paste
makes for a Mediterranean dish that is sweetened just a bit by
raisins. This dish looks nice served on colorful plates. &QL;

   1. Bring 10 cups of water to a boil. Add chard stems. Cover
until water returns to a boil. Uncover, and cook for 10 to 12
minutes. Strain in a colander, reserving { cup of liquid. Run stems
under cold water to refresh. Leave in colander for 10 to 15 minutes
to drain. May be prepared 3 to 4 hours ahead up to this point.
</P>
<P>
   2. Soak raisins in reserved { cup liquid for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. In a mortar, crush garlic with the kosher salt to make a
paste. Add anchovies and fennel seed. Crush until fairly smooth.
Place raisins with liquid in a microwave oven, and cook for 1
minute, or simmer on top of stove until softened. Drain raisins.
</P>
<P>
   4. In a medium saucepan, combine olive oil with blanched stems,
garlic-anchovy paste, raisins, tomatoes and pepper. Cook over low
heat, stirring, until warm throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 to 6 servings. &QL;

<P>
   SWISS CHARD TART &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 hours 15 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the pastry: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 \-ounce package active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon canola oil, plus extra to oil 10-inch pastry ring
</P>
<P>
   1\ cups flour, plus extra for rolling out dough &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the filling: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   { pound Swiss or ruby chard leaves (reserve stems), washed,
dried and roughly chopped (about 8 cups)
</P>
<P>
   \ cup rice, cooked 8 minutes until barely firm
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 3{-ounce button fresh, soft goat cheese
</P>
<P>
   \ pound prosciutto
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper to taste. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the glaze: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon milk or cream. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. To make dough, sprinkle yeast over \ cup warm water and let
sit for 5 minutes. There should be some bubbling action after a few
minutes. If nothing happens, the yeast is old and should be
discarded. Combine remaining ingredients for pastry in a small
bowl. When ready, add the yeast-water mixture. Combine the two
mixtures. Turn out on a flat surface, and knead, just until
combined. If dough is too wet and sticky, add a little more flour.
Form dough into a ball, return to bowl, cover with a kitchen towel
and put in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in volume.
</P>
<P>
   2. Meanwhile, make filling. In a food processor, pulse all the
ingredients for filling until well combined, scraping down the
sides of the bowl once or twice. Mixture should not be a puree, but
should have texture. Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   3. About 20 minutes before cooking the tart, place rack in the
center of oven. Heat oven to 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   4. Lightly oil a 10-inch pastry ring. Place it on a baking
sheet. Lightly oil the section of sheet enclosed by ring. Set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   5. Divide dough in half. Roll out bottom crust to a 12-inch
circle, using extra flour as needed. Twirl dough onto the rolling
pin, and set into the oiled ring. Tuck dough snugly into the ring.
Leave the dough edges up along sides of ring. Lightly prick dough
with a fork, so that it will not rise too much while cooking.
Spread the filling evenly over the dough.
</P>
<P>
   6. Roll second half of dough into a 10-inch circle. Place circle
on top of filling and smooth with fingers. Fold edges of first
crust over second to seal in filling. Trim flap to about \-inch
width, and remove any extra dough. Pat down gently with a fork to
make a firmer seal.
</P>
<P>
   7. For the glaze, beat egg with milk or cream (or water). Brush
glaze over crust. Using the sharp tip of a knife, make 3 slashes in
the crust to act as air vents. Cook for 40 minutes. Remove from
oven, and gently slide tart off onto a flat plate. Serve warm or at
room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 1 10-inch tart.

ONE BOY, ONE GIRL, TO GO PLEASE
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Tuesday Sept. 29)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As if there weren't enough choices to make in life, just in
cable channels and pizza toppings alone, now comes a way to select
a Mike or Molly.
</P>
<P>
   I know couples who can't agree from one day to the next what
color the new couch should be and cannot imagine them ever
committing to the sex of a child.
</P>
<P>
   What a responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Long before you get around to having children, you imagine
yourself with some cute little kid who will adore you forever, and
sometimes in your daydreams you see this as a boy child and
sometimes as a girl child. Depends on the mood, maybe even the
moon.
</P>
<P>
   And then you get pregnant and you dream even more and eventually
out pops one or the other, although many people opt to know ahead
and not wait for the big surprise.
</P>
<P>
   But even knowing in advance so you can croon ``Zelda'' to your
round belly is a lot different than placing your order for her
ahead, as is now scientifically possible through a newly tested
``sperm sorting'' technique.
</P>
<P>
   Even considering the notion gives some people the shivers. Ask
parents if they could have chosen their baby's sex would they and
what would it be, and they lower their voices as if the very
subject threatens the wonder of their beloved one in the Beastie
Boys T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   It's out of bounds for a lot of people to imagine. This is a
mystery they're not willing to tamper with. ``Isn't that what life
is all about - not knowing?'' said the father of a daughter.
</P>
<P>
   He likes the words of poet Khalil Gibran: ``Your children are
not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life's
longing for itself. They come through you but not from you. And
though they are with you they do not belong to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say that gender selection will serve families who
carry a genetic disease that afflicts only one sex. This is
reasonable, but when they talk about helping couples who want
``family balance'' it begins to sound more like a designer baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``A boy for you and a girl for me'' is a nice line in an old
song, but to calculate such a perfect pairing sounds yuppie-driven,
like acquiring a Jeep to go with the town car.
</P>
<P>
   I understand wanting the experience of raising a daughter after
you've had a son, or vice versa, but part of wanting is hoping. And
then loving who you get.
</P>
<P>
   There's a couple in Southern California with three daughters who
decided to try one more time for a son. (``Trying for'' is
something that would disappear under high-tech baby selection, but
this couple decided to gamble the old-fashioned way.)
</P>
<P>
   They ended up with quadruplets. Four girls. Now a total of seven
girls. It sounds like an apocryphal story about stopping while
you're ahead, but it's true. I've seen family pictures and they all
look happy, though a bit dazed.
</P>
<P>
   How would you choose if you could? What if you were feeling
under pressure from the relatives to produce a specific gender?
What if you felt like being contrary?
</P>
<P>
   What if you voted boy/girl just because you thought that's what
your darling wanted?
</P>
<P>
   There was a time in recent memory in American culture when boy
babies were favored over girl babies. Of course, we all know this
is ludicrous, but discrimination still exists against girls in some
places.
</P>
<P>
   Like in China. What if a Chinese cultural preference for boys
was supported by a guaranteed boy baby technique? Would it become
an all male-nation? And then stop?
</P>
<P>
   There are so many things couples need to talk about before
deciding to become parents, why add one more issue?
</P>
<P>
   What if you had one of those partners whose natural response is
``I don't care, you decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Would you make a list of good and bad points, like you do when
trying to decide whether to buy in the country or the city?
</P>
<P>
   The perks are pretty much interchangeable now that we've
discovered that girls can toss the ball around and boys like to
cook. Daughter or son, equal value. Either one can become a doctor,
inherit the farm, run the family business and pass on the family
name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so glad I didn't have that choice,'' said a mother of two
boys and a girl. Had it been up to her she thinks she might have
opted for all girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think with girls you'll have that bond, someone to hang
out with, the mother-daughter fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   But she says, ``I would have missed out on so much,'' including,
she says, ``the chance to raise evolved boys.'' As it turned out,
of her three children, the tightest bond today is with her younger
son.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't get nice surprises like that if you thought you
knew best and scheduled ahead.
</P>

overstated. A San Angelo state legislator is seeking millions to
destroy mesquite trees; in Kingsville, a group called Los Amigos
del Mesquite have organized a contest to find the state's tallest,
straightest mesquite. It will then use the winner's seed pods to

say we book a flight for dinner?'' Fort Worth-based American
Airlines is at least making an effort to improve the state of
airborne fare. The airline giant Tuesday opened its 10th Chef's

what many others know, that poetry no longer connects with the body

country or across the Atlantic, write only for a small audience of

CAN THERE BE LIFE AFTER DEATH FOR `NEWSRADIO'?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Being forced to patch holes is never a comfortable place for
writers, producers and stars to be creatively, but what hasn't been
out of the ordinary for the cast and crew of ``NewsRadio''?
</P>
<P>
   This quirky workplace comedy about a struggling radio station is
well-known for a past colored with near-cancellation experiences
and last-minute reprieves, with bolting cast members and public
exchanges with network presidents over what producers considered
second-class treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as it moves into a fifth season without scene-stealing Phil
Hartman, the show must use the season premiere Wednesday to deliver
to its devotees a respectful cinematic eulogy while providing
newcomers with the essence of its irreverent style.
</P>
<P>
   Unaccepted departures always leave a creative team a bit puzzled
about how to proceed. But the shooting death of Hartman this year
severely altered the series' creative balance, and in light of
Khandi Alexander's departure last season, a question remains
whether it can regain its footing.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Lovitz, a close friend of Hartman's who worked with him on
``Saturday Night Live,'' will step in beginning next week as Max
Lewis, a painfully insecure and, they hope, very funny reporter.
</P>
<P>
   As for Wednesday's episode, written by creator Paul Simms, fans
will find the half-hour somewhat heartwarming, if not all that
funny or clever in light of the episode's delicate balance.
</P>
<P>
   They knew the character's absence had to be explained, so ``Bill
Moves On'' finds the saddened staffers of WNYX dealing with Bill's
(Hartman) sudden death of a heart attack while, of all things,
watching television. (What he was watching isn't explained.)
</P>
<P>
   Dave (Dave Foley), Matthew (Andy Dick), Lisa (Maury Tierney),
Beth (Vicki Lewis), Joe (Joe Rogan) and Jimmy (Stephen Root) are
seated at the station's conference table, heads bowed, trying to
steer clear of awkward silence.
</P>
<P>
   The episode unfolds with their reaction to Bill's death, hanging
mostly on Matthew, who is convinced that Bill is not dead but
either running a boat charter company in Afghanistan or teaching at
a scuba diving school in Nepal. Bill had always told the gullible
Matthew of this ``secret life'' he would one day lead.
</P>
<P>
   Near the episode's end, Alexander pops up, having flown in from
London. That's when Dave pulls out an envelope given to them by
Bill's lawyer, who was asked to do so if anything ever happened to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Dave is reading this to you,'' Dave reads, ``I have either
been fired or passed away. Since my formidable talent would
preclude the former, I'd have to assume that the latter is true.''
</P>
<P>
   Each cast member reads aloud letters directed to them. Tears
flow. Jokes are flat and somewhat forced. Devotees won't care. The
episode fades as Bill's desk is ravaged by staffers and carried off
by two movers with Jimmy sitting on top of it. Bill's chair sits
alone, as the screen fades.
</P>
<P>
   Since milestones, like the death of a sitcom's key player,
usually get our attention, NBC expects a sizable audience for
Wednesday's episode and for next week's introduction of Lovitz.
</P>
<P>
   After that, ``NewsRadio'' will be on its own. The next few weeks
will be scrutinized by NBC. If the moderately rated series (No. 68
last season) can't sustain the additional audience it's likely to
receive, perhaps the plug needs to be pulled.
</P>
<P>
   Strange way of looking at it. But this is, after all,
television. Only so much mourning, and it's back to business as
usual.

 &HT;    WHITE AREAS DOMINATE POLITICAL GIVING, STUDY SAYS
 &HT;    570&AMP;add. With POLMONEY-DATA.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The vast majority of contributions to federal
candidates come from areas that are wealthy and white, says a study
to be released Wednesday by Public Campaign.
</P>
<P>
   That could cause political neglect of the needs of minority
neighborhoods and communities, according to the Washington-based
nonpartisan group, which advocates public financing of campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's useful to have a study documenting what we already sensed
_ that the money comes from one place and the people of color live
in another,'' said Selena Walsh, director of policy and
communications for the League of United Latin American Citizens.
``Public Campaign's study shows why people in the community should
support campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The national study of contributions of $200 or more in 1995 and
1996 from every ZIP code with more than 1,000 residents shows:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In the 2,479 ZIP codes where more than half the residents are
of Hispanic origin or black, Asian, American Indian or other racial
minorities, the average contribution per person to candidates for
the White House or Congress was $1.60.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In the nation's average ZIP code, where 76 percent of the
residents are non-Hispanic whites, the per-person average was 61
times as high _ $97.79.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  One out of every 1,250 people in minority-dominated ZIP codes
gave $200 or more. In the average ZIP code, the ratio was much
higher _ one out of every 416.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Only some of the difference was accounted for by income
levels, which averaged $9,046 per person in minority ZIP codes, but
$12,381 in the average ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 98.9 percent the 27,000 people in Georgia's 30314
ZIP code, in and around the Clark-Atlanta University Complex, are
African Americans. Only 12 gave $200 or more.
</P>
<P>
   But in the much wealthier 33480 ZIP code in Palm Beach, Fla.,
where nearly 96 percent are non-Hispanic whites, 816 of the 6,600
residents gave that much.
</P>
<P>
   One result could be that politicians will spend more time with
the people from Palm Beach than those from the Atlanta
neighborhood, Public Campaign maintains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawmakers (in tough races) no longer have the luxury to
talk to their one-time friends and neighbors about school safety
and child care and job security,'' says the study. ``Instead, they
have to shake hands at high-donor cocktail parties where they'll
hear about capital gains and inheritance taxes and the negative
impact of a minimum-wage hike.''
</P>
<P>
   William McNary , legislative director of Citizen Action of
Illinois, who helped coordinate the study, said Wednesday, ``The
study shows that campaign finance is just as segregated as many
other areas of society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That means that we in the disenfranchised communities must
move campaign finance reform beyond the do-gooder approach of good,
earnest, well-intentioned white liberals,'' McNary said. ``Getting
special interest money out of politics should be seen as a natural
extension of the political empowerment movement that got rid of the
poll tax and other financial barriers to participation.''
</P>
<P>
   The study's results are consistent with a study released earlier
by scholars from four universities who interviewed a sample of more
than 1,000 generous donors to federal parties and candidates. They
concluded that most big donors are rich, conservative men, and 95
percent of the donors are white.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``In a crude way, ZIP codes probably do capture different kinds
of communities,'' said political scientist John Green of the
University of Akron, who helped conduct the earlier study for the
Center for Responsive Politics. ``It's a geographic variation on a
position that others have taken: If money is a sources of access
and influence, then people with less money are going to have less
influence in political contexts where money counts.''
</P>
<P>
   However, people of color who live in heavily minority
neighborhoods have one advantage over those in neighborhoods with a
more even mix, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that they are concentrated in one community,
they can become visible to office-seekers who want their votes, and
get action on their concerns,'' Green said. While voter turnout is
dismal in most poor neighborhoods, ``you could probably make a case
that a hyper-mobilized community can have more influence than
others,'' he said.

ROAST PORK WITH POTATO-TURNIP GRATIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   I grew up on a dairy farm in central New York, and the first
cold snap still makes me yearn for the hearty, soulful foods of my
childhood. My mom had a stick-to-your-ribs approach to cooking _
which was fine by me and my six brothers and sisters _ and her
braised pork chops with mashed potatoes and cream gravy was one of
our favorite fall meals.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, pork was a different meat. Rich and fatty, it was
the sort of everyday food that rarely appeared on the menus of fine
restaurants. Today, hogs are being raised for more flavor and less
fat.
</P>
<P>
   And along with many other chefs, I now use pork in both hearty
and light dishes. Its tender texture lends the meat to a quick
roast or braise, and its mild flavor makes a good match for most
vegetables and a great variety of herbs and spices.
</P>
<P>
   In this dish, I moved only a little bit away from family
tradition by combining a simply roasted pork tenderloin with a
creamy French gratin.
</P>
<P>
   The leanness of this cut allowed me a bit of extravagance with
heavy cream and cheese. To liven things up, I added turnips to the
gratin for a contrast in taste and texture: cooked, the turnips
become lighter and add a sweet, astringent counterpoint to the soft
butteriness of the potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   As a final bit of tinkering, I infused the cream with roasted
garlic for sweetness and depth.
</P>
<P>
   On the plate, the dish cries out for the color and balance of
fresh greens; try some sauteed kale or spinach. &QL;

<P>
   ROAST TENDERLOIN OF PORK WITH POTATO-TURNIP GRATIN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Butter for greasing dish
</P>
<P>
   4 cloves roasted garlic (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1 pound potatoes, peeled and cut into [-inch slices
</P>
<P>
   1 pound turnips, peeled and cut into [-inch slices
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons butter at room temperature, cut into small pieces
</P>
<P>
   { cup grated Emmenthal cheese
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   \ cup fresh bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons canola oil
</P>
<P>
   3 pork tenderloins, 10 to 12 ounces each, well trimmed of all
fat and silver skin
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups chicken stock or low-sodium canned broth
</P>
<P>
   } cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons minced fresh sage
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced fresh flat-leaf parsley
</P>
<P>
   6 fresh thyme sprigs, for garnish. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Lightly butter a round gratin dish, 10 by 2 inches. Preheat
oven to 425 degrees. Whisk roasted garlic into the heavy cream
until very well blended; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a large mixing bowl, toss potato and turnip slices until
they are well combined. Using a clean kitchen towel, pat the slices
until they are very dry. Spread half the mixed potato and turnip
slices evenly across the bottom of the gratin dish. Sprinkle them
with 2 tablespoons of the butter, \ cup cheese and nutmeg to taste.
Repeat with the remaining potato and turnip slices, butter, cheese
and nutmeg to taste. Pour the garlic-flavored cream on top.
Sprinkle with bread crumbs. Bake until vegetables are tender and
the top is golden, about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. While gratin is baking, prepare pork tenderloins: season pork
with salt and pepper to taste. In a large nonstick ovenproof saute
pan, heat canola oil over medium-high heat. Add tenderloins to pan,
and sear, turning frequently, until well browned on all sides,
about 6 minutes. Transfer tenderloins to a plate, and drain excess
oil from the pan.
</P>
<P>
   4. Return tenderloins to pan, and add stock, { cup of the wine,
1 teaspoon of the minced thyme and 1 teaspoon of the minced sage.
Stir to blend. Place saute pan in the oven (with the gratin). Roast
until an instant-read thermometer registers 150 degrees when
inserted into the thickest part of the meat, about 15 minutes; the
pork should be slightly pink in the center. Remove pan from oven,
and let pork rest 5 minutes. Transfer to a platter, and carve
crosswise into \-inch-thick slices. Cover loosely with foil, and
keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   5. Strain pan juices into a small saucepan, and skim off excess
grease; set aside. Place saute pan over high heat, and add
remaining \ cup of wine. Cook, stirring constantly, until pan is
deglazed, about 1 minute. Pour deglazing juices into pan juices.
Place saucepan over high heat, and bring to a boil. Lower heat, and
simmer about 3 minutes. Add remaining 1 teaspoon thyme, remaining 1
teaspoon sage and the parsley. Adjust salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   6. Cut six equal wedges of potato-turnip gratin, and place one
in the center of each of six warm dinner plates. Place three to
four slices of pork tenderloin around one side of the wedge on each
plate. Drizzle pan juices around plate. Garnish with a sprig of
thyme, and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Note: To roast garlic, trim the top third from a large head of
garlic. Rub the head with olive oil, wrap in foil and bake at 325
degrees until the cloves are soft, about 45 minutes.

CLINTON ON TAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c. 1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's tortured videotaped testimony
before a grand jury about his sexual encounters was one of the most
disgraceful moments in the history of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But exposing it to the world on Monday changed nothing, really.
</P>
<P>
   We already knew more than we should about his strange, reckless
behavior with Monica Lewinsky. We already knew that the president
had a slippery way with words. We already knew that it is sex, not
Whitewater, that is Clinton's biggest vulnerability. We already
knew the independent counsel's office is obsessed with bringing him
down.
</P>
<P>
   And now that we've seen the president's contorted performance,
the impeachment process rolls obliviously along, responding only to
its own momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cannot stop it, no matter what he does or says, so long
as he occupies the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, trapped in the constitutional process, will not stop
it either. Whatever the ultimate public impact of releasing all the
gory details of the president's sexual encounters, the political
system demands that he be punished, in some way. Humiliation is not
enough.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency, no matter how temporarily diminished, will
survive this, as it has survived other traumas.
</P>
<P>
   But the survival of its occupant is another matter. His fate
depends upon a question that has no clear answer: Does a president
who is a lying lecher so demean the office that he deserves to be
impeached?
</P>
<P>
   The president's testimony was sufficiently nimble to allow him
to escape immediate political disaster. He was obviously
obfuscating, but his interrogators failed to nail him outright on
anything that might prove perjury or obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact he was asked only about women and not Whitewater or
other less titillating investigatory issues tends to confirm public
suspicion that this is not about serious crimes but merely about
sex.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he realized that the videotape was likely to
be made public, and he was accordingly cautious and controlled. He
did not reach the White House in the first place by being timid or
tongue-tied.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the simultaneous release of the written transcript
of Lewinsky's grand jury testimony helps the president against a
charge of suborning perjury, since she insists he neither asked her
to lie nor promised her a job in return for her silence.
</P>
<P>
   The voters are not clamoring for the president's removal. His
job approval rating actually went up after Monday's testimony, from
60 percent to 66 percent in the latest USA Today/CNN Gallup poll.
This is despite the fact he's not fooling anybody: 81 percent said
they thought he was lying when he claimed to believe his dalliance
with Lewinsky was not a sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   But that only briefly stalls what is going on here. He could tap
dance through Central Park to mass applause and still not shake the
legislative process initiated when independent counsel Kenneth
Starr sent his report advocating impeachment to Capitol Hill. All
Clinton has managed to do is live to fight again another day, and
the battles get tougher and tougher and harder and harder to
tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   What his testimony demonstrated is not pretty. It shows us that
Clintonspeak is an exercise in the use of language to create an
illusion, in order to conceal reality and mislead listeners. He
denied having sex ``as I define it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other politicians have noted for years that Clinton habitually
says what he thinks they want to hear, but in such an opaque way
that he can later claim to be misunderstood if they are
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   This is a useful political talent and not quite the same thing
as directly lying. But it is basically dishonest.
</P>
<P>
   Now the House Judiciary Committee must decide: Does it amount to
perjury? If it meets that legal definition, is it an impeachable
crime?
</P>
<P>
   The core of the problem is that the answers will be slow in
coming. The House will soon release more Starr documents and is
likely to vote next week to authorize impeachment hearings,
probably to begin after the November elections. This could go on a
very long time.
</P>
<P>
   It is too much, already. We think and talk about nothing else.
We may even run out of new Monica jokes and begin repeating the old
ones. Clinton should resign and spare the country any more of this
shameful stuff.
</P>

 &HT;    Don't avert eyes from the horrors of famine in Sudan
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This story was different.
</P>
<P>
   And, after a morning spent in the grassland of southern Sudan,
amid the keening of the starving people, it came to me that I was
different, too.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, I was observing all I could, making notes and
gathering information. But my conduct so startled me that I took
out my notebook and wrote these words: ``I was not allowing myself
to make eye contact. It was more than language. It was more than
just the bloodshot eyes, covered with crawling flies. I didn't want
to look into their minds. I didn't want to feel what they felt.''
</P>
<P>
   I have seen dead people before _ stacked in the back of a truck
in Nicaragua, laid out in a hospital yard in the Dominican
Republic, incinerated by mobs in the streets of Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at dead people is one thing. Looking at dying people is
something else.
</P>
<P>
   Who wants to look into the eyes of a dying man and have no
answers for him, or of a mother whose daughter is dying in her arms
and mumble, ``Sorry, nothing I can do''?
</P>
<P>
   But if I wasn't there to try to understand the experience of the
Sudanese people, to understand what they as human beings were going
through, then I had come a long way for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   I had to ask. I had to stop averting my eyes.
</P>
<P>
   So recently I interviewed mothers of children who were weakened
by hunger, ravaged by disease, in danger of dying.
</P>
<P>
   I squatted in front of a woman preparing to bury her daughter
and asked how the little girl had died. My eyes searched out those
of a woman who had just buried her husband. I could never
understand, but I wanted her to know I was willing to try.
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult work, a wrenching experience. I walked from the
burying field back toward the small United Nations camp where I had
pitched my tent. I was overheated, dehydrated and disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   I searched the sky for afternoon thunderclouds. I wanted nothing
so much as a cloudburst.
</P>
<P>
   I stopped, took out my notebook and wrote these words: ``Praying
for rain _ an end to the heat, an end to the thirst, an end to the
work of interviewing the dying and bereaved.''
</P>
<P>
   That evening, in the U.N. camp, Yohannes Tecle, an Eritrean
UNICEF official, cooked up a pot of sticky rice. In the sauce, he
put pretty much everything he had left. I think there were peas in
there, and some tuna, and a melange of other ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   I ate greedily. Then I slept.
</P>
<P>
   People have asked how anyone can eat in the midst of famine. I
can say only this: When you're hungry, you eat. When you're tired,
you sleep. The business of living goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing my two cups of rice with the 21,000 people clustered
around the village of Ajiep would have accomplished nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, I learned a woman a few feet from my tent died,
huddled under an empty grain bag, in the night's cold rain. I could
not have invited the population of southern Sudan into my tent.
</P>
<P>
   All I can do is carry on my work. These stories _ and, more
vividly, the stark and haunting photographs by Rich Addicks _ are
meant to show you as best we can what we saw in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Please don't avert your eyes.

 &HT;    Famine in southern Sudan reaches catastrophic proportions
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAHR EL GHAZALM, Sudan _ Abuk bol's father starved to death.
then her mother died.
</P>
<P>
   Abuk was left with her grandmother, Aweng, to care for her. And
nothing to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Then a rumor reached their village that relief agencies were
distributing food in the village of Ajiep, several days' walk away,
the measure of distance in a land devoid of the trappings of the
modern world. So the old woman slung the child on her hip and set
out along the narrow footpaths that crisscross the flat grasslands
of southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   They ate leaves and grass to stay alive. They slept in the open,
nothing to shield them from the rains and the cool night air.
</P>
<P>
   After days of walking, guided by the trails traveled by
predecessors on this desperate journey, grandmother and child
reached Ajiep, a once-small village now swollen to an encampment of
tens of thousands. There is food here _ grain to be mixed with
water and cooked into a gruel.
</P>
<P>
   Only now, Abuk is in terrible shape.
</P>
<P>
   Her ribs protrude. Her shoulder blades stick out like little
wings. Her head seems too large for her body.
</P>
<P>
   From her size, you might guess her age at eight months, but Abuk
is 4 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Aweng sits on the ground under a tree and feeds Abuk the gruel.
With a wave of her hand, the old woman tries to shoo away the flies
that swarm across the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   She worries that the flies will make Abuk sicker, but she is
grateful for the food.
</P>
<P>
   Without it, she says, ``We would die, all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   A human catastrophe is unfolding in southern Sudan, a land
haunted by famine.
</P>
<P>
   You see it in the hollow cheeks of infants who suckle at breasts
empty of milk and in the hollow expressions of mothers whose eyes
are empty of hope.
</P>
<P>
   Three million people _ nearly 10 percent of the country's
population _ will need some level of food assistance to make it
through the coming year, say U.N. officials in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The famine has hit hardest in the province of Bahr el Ghazal in
the southwestern part of Sudan, where 770,000 people are threatened
with death by starvation. To try to avert a catastrophe even larger
than what hit the region in the late 1980s, a huge international
relief effort must continue at least through October 1999, said Ted
Chaiban, deputy chief of operations for the U.N. relief effort in
southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Flying 15 cargo planes and 10 small passenger planes out of two
bases in Sudan and two in neighboring Kenya, the relief program
flies tons of food into Bahr el Ghazal every day, if the rains
allow it. The biggest airlift in the history of Africa is under way
in southern Sudan. The planes bring food from donor countries _
such as grain from the American Midwest _ to people such as Aweng
and Abuk.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with relief agencies call the situation in southern
Sudan a ``complex emergency.'' It has no single cause.
</P>
<P>
   But the disheartening reality is this: The primary cause of all
this hunger and misery and death is not the vagaries of weather or
any other caprice of nature.
</P>
<P>
   It is the utter indifference of some human beings toward the
suffering of others.
</P>
<P>
   True, scant rains the past two years have reduced harvests and
left people in southern Sudan poorer and less healthy.
</P>
<P>
   But the main cause of the famine is Sudan's 15-year civil war.
Soldiers on both sides have robbed people of their cattle and sent
them fleeing from their land, unable to plant crops or support
themselves in any way.
</P>
<P>
   This famine, officials say, is largely man-made.
</P>
<P>
   A fly-covered blanket shrouds the still form of a baby.
</P>
<P>
   Then the blanket moves, ever so slightly, rhythmically rising
and falling, giving evidence of shallow breaths.
</P>
<P>
   There is life yet beneath the shroud, but for how long, no one
can say.
</P>
<P>
   If the epicenter of the famine is Bahr el Ghazal province, the
very heart of the epicenter, the place where one finds the worst
suffering in this giant jumble of human disaster, must be a place
like the therapeutic feeding center in Ajiep.
</P>
<P>
   Here, aid workers treat the babsy under the blanket and other
children who are not merely malnourished but also starving.
</P>
<P>
   This center, run by the Belgian chapter of Doctors Without
Borders, an organization that provides medical care in poor
countries, treats children 5 and younger _ and then only ``when the
problem becomes a pathology,'' says Christine Nadori, a nurse from
Ottawa who works in the feeding center.
</P>
<P>
   But Doctors Without Borders (known internationally as Medecins
San Frontieres) estimates that 55 percent of the thousands of
children in Ajiep are malnourished. The therapeutic feeding center
can accommodate 170 children at a time.
</P>
<P>
   How then to choose? How to practice triage?
</P>
<P>
   The center admits only children who weigh less than 60 percent
of what they should for their height.
</P>
<P>
   That means, for example, that a child who is 3 feet 11 inches
tall _ one who should weigh 48 1/2 pounds _ can get treatment only
if he weighs 29 pounds or less. A 19 1/2-inch baby _ who should
weigh 7 1/2 pounds _ will be treated here only if she weighs less
than 4 1/2 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Children at that level of starvation are susceptible to a host
of ailments, including chest infections, eye infections, skin
infections, diarrheal diseases and hypothermia, says Nadori.
</P>
<P>
   Nadori, clad in a white T-shirt and crisp slacks, strides
briskly through the center, keeping order, promoting efficiency.
But she is not detached: She says she knows each child and
remembers many who have left.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, she stops to pick up a baby and hold her close.
</P>
<P>
   Around her, coughs punctuate the cries that rise over the tent
encampment. Flies congregate in infected eyes of children. Larger
children with legs like sticks care for smaller children with skin
like leather. Mothers offer breasts like prunes to babies with
faces like skeletons.
</P>
<P>
   This center has one purpose: to feed people. Come nightfall,
when the sun sets and the air cools, children and mothers, some of
them naked, must leave and find what shelter they can to stave off
the hypothermia that can claim the lives of the weak.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 children are admitted to the therapeutic feeding center
every day, Nadori says. Many have walked four or five days to reach
Ajiep. Though the program is designed for children, mothers who are
nursing starving babies are fed once a day as well.
</P>
<P>
   Each child is dosed with vitamin A, folic acid and antibiotics.
Any child so malnourished has some infection, Nadori says. It may
not be visible, but it's there.
</P>
<P>
   Each child carries a calabash for a bowl and is fed five times a
day with a serving of high-energy milk laced with sugar, oil,
vitamins and minerals. A child is released to the supplemental
feeding program _ in theory, a program designed to supplement food
somehow being obtained elsewhere _ when she reaches 70 percent of
her desired weight and maintains it for a week.
</P>
<P>
   The average stay is 21 days. Doctors weigh the children
regularly and keep notes on their condition and ailments.
</P>
<P>
   But the records show, too, that the effects of famine go beyond
the physical. A typical notation, this one on the file for a
2-year-old girl named Ayok Tong Akway, says tersely: ``Both parents
died. Cared for by blind grandmother.''
</P>
<P>
   Sudan, the largest country in Africa, is about the size of the
United States east of the Mississippi River. It stretches from the
Middle East to middle Africa, from Egypt in the north to Congo,
Uganda and Kenya in the south.
</P>
<P>
   And its population is diverse, as one might expect in a country
of that reach.
</P>
<P>
   The people in the north are mostly Arab and Muslim. The south is
predominantly African and tribal; residents generally adhere to
either Christian or animist beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the south was subjected to frequent raids by slave
traders from the north. Building on that inauspicious start,
relations between the north and south have traditionally been poor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, the government in Khartoum tried to impose Islamic law.
The south resisted. Civil war has wracked the country since.
</P>
<P>
   Exuberant greetings ring out over the verdant grassland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cibak!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cibak!''
</P>
<P>
   The people in Ajiep are Dinkas, members of a pastoral African
tribe. The word, pronounced ``she-bahk,'' is their greeting, the
Dinka way of asking, ``How are you?''
</P>
<P>
   Ajiep used to be a village of 4,000 or 5,000. Now, 21,000 people
live clustered around the feeding centers and, aid workers say, if
you extend the count to those camped a few hours' walk away, the
number is greater than 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to walk from one end to the other of this
impromptu city _ say, from where the U.N. people live in a few
tents pitched under a tree, past the therapeutic and supplemental
feeding centers and on beyond toward the drop zone _ without being
greeted dozens of times and shaking dozens of hands.
</P>
<P>
   Even amid starvation and death, all is not gloom and despair.
</P>
<P>
   The Dinkas follow traditional tribal beliefs. The men carve
parallel V-shaped scars into their foreheads. As a manhood ritual,
all males have their six front bottom-row teeth pried out with a
chisel. While some Dinkas plant crops, such as millet and sorghum,
many are cattle herders, almost totally dependent on their cows.
</P>
<P>
   They survive on milk, cheese and blood from living cows;
sometimes, too, they visit other tribes to trade cattle for grain.
With their cattle, Dinkas are in good shape; when their cattle are
stolen, they are in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   So the condition of people varies dramatically in this newly
created Dinka city, depending largely on whether they have been
preyed upon by the contending armies and on how many days they had
to walk to reach Ajiep. Some people are stick-thin, others
relatively healthy.
</P>
<P>
   At least so far.
</P>
<P>
   This year's crops should be harvested in October. But this
year's crops will meet only a fraction of the needs, fill only a
fraction of the bellies.
</P>
<P>
   This is the rainy season, and the grass on the savanna grows
lush and green. This doesn't look like the backdrop to a famine.
</P>
<P>
   But the rains came too late for many of this year's crops.
Worse, marauding militias drove people from their land during the
planting season, preventing seed from being sown.
</P>
<P>
   Even if all goes well and peace breaks out and next year's rains
come on time, there will be no new harvest until October 1999.
Between now and then, even those Dinkas who still have cattle and
other livestock to trade will find there is no grain.
</P>
<P>
   Except that flown in by relief agencies.
</P>
<P>
   So people cluster in Ajiep, lashing empty grain bags to sticks
as the roofs of temporary shelters. A few of the thousands of
refugees have had the strength and wherewithal to build tukuls, the
round huts of thatch in which Dinkas live. Still others live in the
open.
</P>
<P>
   Over the crowded encampment rises a constant cacophony: the
bleating of goats, the braying of donkeys, the lowing of cows, the
keening of women, the crying of children.
</P>
<P>
   But there is laughter, too.
</P>
<P>
   And when night falls and the crying stops and the African sky
arches high and black and impossibly full of stars, the sound of
singing rises over the camp, joyful enough to break your heart.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, tall enough to be 9 or 10, is so thin you can see the
entire outline of his pelvis, each flat flange of hip bone showing
clearly under his skin. Another boy helps him stand, then clasps
him around the waist with both arms and carries him gently to his
feeding.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a young girl cradles a skeletal baby, perhaps her
brother. She dips her finger in her porridge and allows the baby to
suck it off her fingertip.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there stand naked children so cadaverous they seem to
have no bottoms, so emaciated their knees are bigger around than
their thighs. One child can walk only with the aid of a stick.
</P>
<P>
   To look at such suffering is to wonder how any religion or
principle, whether Islam or even freedom, could possibly warrant
such massive human sacrifice. Who could allow this to happen, let
alone contribute to it, and still lay any claim to morality?
</P>
<P>
   But it gets worse than that. Some of the fighters, aid workers
say, are little more than warlords and bandits, fighting not for
principle but for profit.
</P>
<P>
   The southern Sudanese people have suffered famine before,
notably in 1988 and '89, when an estimated 250,000 people died. Why
suddenly again in 1998?
</P>
<P>
   Kerubino Bol, a military leader in the Bahr el Ghazal area,
began as a rebel leader but later switched to the government side.
Early this year, unable to strike the deal he wanted with the
government, he switched back and attacked the government-held town
of Wau, 40 miles south of Ajiep, igniting a new round of fighting
and turning tens of thousands of people into refugees just when
they should have been planting crops.
</P>
<P>
   The government, uninterested in improving living conditions in
rebel-held areas (and with better conditions, perhaps, political
support for the rebels), made the problem worse by banning flights
into Bahr el Ghazal province. Relief flights could not get through
at the risk of being shot down.
</P>
<P>
   Under international pressure _ in April, British International
Development Secretary Clare Short accused the government of Sudan
of ``deliberately inflicting this starvation on its own people for
its own ends'' _ the government relented.
</P>
<P>
   And in July, both sides agreed to a three-month cease-fire in
Bahr el Ghazal to allow relief planes to fly food in to the
starving.
</P>
<P>
   The truce is set to expire Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The C-130, droning in the distance, bursts through the clouds
over Ajiep.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, Charles Inwani, a muscular and ebullient Kenyan
working with the World Food Program, an arm of the United Nations,
waits in a Land Cruiser with a large antenna mounted on the front.
Working as the air traffic controller, he grabs his microphone and
warns the C-130 pilot about a thunderstorm approaching from the
south and a small plane trying to land at the nearby patch of mud
that passes for an air strip.
</P>
<P>
   A few Dinka workers, yelling and waving sticks, chase stragglers
out of the drop zone as the C-130 approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Then the first-world technological behemoth swoops low over the
primitive African landscape, opens its hatch, and 16 tons of grain
thunders to the ground, most of it in bags weighing more than 100
pounds each.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, a Russian-built Ilyushin disgorges twice that
much food, and then another Ilyushin flies in, and still another.
Rain may prevent planes from dropping food here for days, so
officials drop grain while the sun shines.
</P>
<P>
   It is the largest airlift in the 35-year history of the United
Nations' World Food Program. About 35 relief agencies and other
nongovernmental organizations, working largely out of a base in
northwest Kenya called Lokichokio, are involved _ including the
Carter Center, which fights guinea worm, and Atlanta-based CARE,
which distributes seeds and tools in some areas and runs feeding
centers in the hard-hit town of Wau.
</P>
<P>
   The airlift, coordinated by Operation Lifeline Sudan, a U.N.
organization created for the purpose, flies more than 11,000 tons
of food a month into 75 sites in south Sudan. Two U.N. agencies _
UNICEF and the World Food Program _ are involved, as are a host of
other agencies, such as Doctors Without Borders, Save the Children
Fund and Oxfam.
</P>
<P>
   Lokichokio, once barely a speck on the map, is now Kenya's
third-busiest airport. About 350 relief workers (up from 100 in
March) live in a fenced compound of huts, offices, radios and a
dining hall. Pilots, who work for private companies, live in an
adjacent compound.
</P>
<P>
   Single-engine Cessna Caravans take relief workers to feeding
stations in Sudan inaccessible by any other method. Planes ferry
officials between Lokichokio and Nairobi. And five C-130s rumble
off the airstrip every morning, head for south Sudan, then return,
usually to take on a second load.
</P>
<P>
   In Ajiep, the food will be distributed not only in the
therapeutic feeding center for those in the worst shape but also in
weekly handouts of small bags of grain to 5,000 more children, who
wait for hours under the hot sun in rows delineated by fences made
of thorn tree branches. Every other week, 110-pound bags are issued
to women with families.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that the airlift is saving lives. Food is
being delivered to the starving. But relief workers worry that the
aid is doing harm as well.
</P>
<P>
   Feeding stations draw people off their land, leaving them unable
to support themselves. They create what Yohannes Tecle, an Eritrean
who is the United Nations' coordinator in Ajiep, calls ``ghettos.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people congregate where there are no sanitary
facilities. Flies flit from feces to food. Water pools in putrid
puddles. The risk of disease is grave.
</P>
<P>
   Some relief workers think, too, that the tribes' traditional
survival skills and lines of authority are being altered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe there has been permanent or semipermanent damage
to the society,'' said Matthew Anderson, a CARE official in
Lokichokio, the airlift staging area in northwest Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Without the aid, though, people would die.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the international community cannot maintain this
level of effort forever. But no end to the war is in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Adeng Manyuot pours water tenderly over the body of her
2-year-old daughter, washing it clean. Nearby a man finishes
digging a small grave.
</P>
<P>
   Adeng covers her daughter with a dingy shroud, climbs into the
shallow grave and gently lays the body down. Then she climbs out
and walks away.
</P>
<P>
   The gravedigger fills in the hole.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Adeng has buried a member of her
family. Her husband died this year. So did her 4-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be the last time, either. Four of her children live,
but they are sick, and she is worried.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is this the only burial here today. By nightfall, 13 people
will be laid to rest in this field as hunger and disease take their
steady toll.
</P>
<P>
   Awec Mawyen and her family are from Ajiep. But three years ago,
as fighting wracked the area, they moved to Barurud, two days' walk
if you're healthy. When the hunger came this year, she tried to get
food in Barurud but was turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Awec and her husband, Amet Akol Awet, are Dinkas. Most people in
Barurud are from the Luo tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Add to civil war, late rains and marauding warlords another
factor in this complex emergency: tribal rivalry exacerbated by
scarcity and hunger.
</P>
<P>
   Turned away, Awec and Amet walked from Barurud back to Ajiep as
best they could. They were so weak that instead of two days, it
took them five.
</P>
<P>
   When they arrived, two days ago, they were issued cards by the
World Food Program entitling them to food. But the crowd was too
big; they could not fight their way through.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday it rained. No food was distributed.
</P>
<P>
   This morning Amet was dead. This afternoon Awec must bury him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very bitter about that,'' she says. ``If I see a person
from Barurud and I have the power, I will deny that person food
from here and say, `You go back to Barurud.'''
</P>
<P>
   Night falls, the air cools and rain sweeps across the land. A
woman, walking alone, makes her way into the encampment. Perhaps
her family has died along the way, falling beside the narrow
footpaths as so many others have.
</P>
<P>
   But she perseveres, walking on through the rain, finally
reaching Ajiep.
</P>
<P>
   Weak, hungry, with little clothing and no shelter, she curls up
on the ground not 30 yards from where two American journalists and
some aid workers slumber in their tents. She pulls an empty grain
bag over herself for protection from the rain and a little bit of
warmth.
</P>
<P>
   All night the rains fall relentlessly, drumming on the tents,
soaking the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, the showers cease. Dawn creeps across the land.
Under the grain bag, curled into the fetal position, the woman lies
dead.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows her name.
</P>
<P>
   To cover the famine, writer Don Melvin and photographer Rich
Addicks hopped a decrepit 10-seat Beechcraft Super King Air from
Nairobi for the three-hour flight to the relief staging area at
Lokichokio, in northwest Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   From there, after a night's stay in thatched huts, they rode a
Cessna Caravan, with room for six passengers, for three hours over
war-wracked south Sudan to a muddy landing strip in the middle of
the flat grassland.
</P>
<P>
   They pitched tents under a tree and spent that day, all of the
next and part of a third interviewing and photographing famine
victims and relief workers.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin, 45, is assistant international editor at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. Addicks, 44, has been involved with
photography at the Journal-Constitution for 16 years.

`THE LAST BIG THING': WAGING WAR AGAINST THE CULTURAL STATUS QUO 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(JT) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some nasty fun is to be had watching Simon Geist (Dan Zukovic),
a bogus journalist, colossal misanthrope and art snob, make fools
of the publicity-hungry show business hopefuls he interviews for a
nonexistent Los Angeles magazine in ``The Last Big Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   As Simon, scowling like a rabid grand inquisitor, sneeringly
rants about the death of culture at the end of a millennium, he
sounds more and more like an unhinged devotee of the comedian
Dennis Miller. His self-defining moment of revelation _ the perfect
post-modern image he flaunts to mock the trash culture he so
despises _ is a snapshot of his own distorted reflection in a metal
trash can as he scrunches his face into a parody of Edvard Munch's
painting ``The Scream.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Simon's favorite pastimes is visiting a local comedy club
where he heckles the mediocre talent with obscene catcalls. When he
interviews a scuzzy rock band that specializes in moronic ditties
saluting the stars of 1970's television sitcoms, he makes sure the
group discovers near the end of the session that there isn't any
tape in his cassette recorder. His contempt doesn't prevent the
band from hiring him to film what he intends to be the stupidest,
most career-damaging music video ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Zukovic not only plays Simon but also wrote and directed ``The
Last Big Thing,'' a satire whose sharpest moments echo the tone of
a Nathanael West novel. In the film's funniest scene, Simon
dispatches an ambitious multimedia artist named Magda (Sibel
Ergener) to the 13th floor of an office building where he promises
she will be discovered by a famous star-making mogul. Rushing into
the building, Magda, who suggests Courtney Love in catwoman drag,
darts into the first office she sees, leaps onto the desk of an
incredulous middle-aged businessman and starts writhing, growling,
spitting and cursing.
</P>
<P>
   The film is at its best in the bits like these, in which Simon
gleefully vents what appears to be Zukovic's own free-floating
disgust with the pop cultural wasteland and the lust for fame that
is becoming a national pathology. A little of that anger goes a
long way. And once Simon has made his points, his sour pranks begin
to seem redundant.
</P>
<P>
   Where the movie falls flat is in telling the story of Simon's
relationship with his roommate and disciple, a dysfunctional young
woman named Darla (Susan Heimbinder), whose father pays the
couple's rent on a sterile suburban tract house in the Los Angeles
suburbs. While Simon is carrying on his one-man guerrilla campaign
against the cultural status quo, Darla is dreaming up her own
magazine dedicated to chronicling Simon's cause.
</P>
<P>
   The joke of the movie, of course, is that Simon, for all his
pretenses of alienation, is at heart an outsider who wants in. The
moment an attractive model he interviews takes a romantic interest
in him, the purity of his intentions becomes suspect. And Darla,
who until then has been a true believer in the holiness of his
little war, becomes jealous and resentful. From here on, Simon's
unmasking is only a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last Big Thing'' is a movie that will not date well.
Especially in its mockery of pop music and music video, its
sensibility is already a decade behind the times.
</P>

 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the sixth day, New Yorkers do not rest. Saturday,
supposedly set aside for leisure, is the day for picking up the dry
cleaning, dropping off shoes for new soles, buying groceries and
taking the cat to the vet. It is a workday.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another Saturday out there, unknown to most New
Yorkers. All over the city, sandwiched between the dry cleaners and
the shoe-repair shops, are wine stores, and on Saturday afternoons
many of them are opening Spanish riojas, or California chardonnays,
or Australian shirazes, and pouring them, free of charge, for
anyone who takes the trouble to stop in.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, the vinous Saturday has become a ritual, as
cars stream across the Golden Gate Bridge and head toward Napa and
Sonoma for a weekend of tasting. New York does not have the
vineyards, but it sure has the wine stores, dozens upon dozens of
them, and shrewd customers, after making a few phone calls and
drawing up a little list, can map out a personal wine trail, as I
did on a recent Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the wine-tasting season was just gathering steam
after the summer recess, the pickings were pretty attractive. To
kick things off, the Chelsea Wine Vault, in the Chelsea Market, was
offering three sparkling wines from Mionetta, a winery near Venice.
On a smarmily humid afternoon, a well-chilled prosecco hit the
spot.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the store, customers were lining up for red
and white Lillet, the French aperitif. The clock was ticking,
however. Skipping Lillet, I headed northward to Best Cellars on the
Upper East Side, which draws a crowd every Saturday afternoon, when
it pairs a wine with food. The wine du jour was a lush Alsatian
pinot blanc by Willm, matched with foie gras mousse spread on
triangles of toasted brioche. That, folks, is a deal.
</P>
<P>
   From Best Cellars it was barely 100 steps to Wright on Third
Avenue, where customers were being treated to a fume blanc,
cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay and merlot from Estancia, a
California winery. It was a useful trip, a chance to assemble a
profile of the winery at zero cost.
</P>
<P>
   Stop No. 4, at Acker Merrall &AMP; Condit on West 72nd Street, was a
must. A representative from Penfolds and Lindemans was presenting a
lineup of Australian chardonnays and cabernet-shiraz blends. The
ace up her sleeve was a bottle of Penfolds Grange, 1993 vintage _ a
$165 item that in real life I admire from a safe distance. Now,
instead of studying the label, I simply asked for a taste and, for
one thrilling moment, my palate lived beyond its means.
</P>
<P>
   The Grange encounter seemed like a fitting finale to a very
productive couple of hours. I had tasted wines that were new to me.
I had picked up interesting bits of information along the way. I
had emerged a better, more rounded human being. And the experience
had not cost me a dime.
</P>
<P>
   In a city of more than 7 million people, it might seem insane to
offer free drinks, but that's exactly what happens every weekend in
wine stores all over Manhattan. This civilized custom did not
become possible until five years ago, when the state Legislature
lifted the restriction that said stores could open only bottles of
New York state wine.
</P>
<P>
   Soon wineries and the wine merchants began capitalizing on a
splendid opportunity to show off their wares, get more traffic
flowing through the shops and sell more wine. For customers, the
free tastings offer a chance to learn a little and to test-drive a
bottle before taking it home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It educates our customers,'' Christopher Cree, a managing
partner of the Chelsea Wine Vault, said. ``The person who comes in
and has never tasted a prosecco has suddenly discovered a new area
of sparkling wines.''
</P>
<P>
   Wineries and their distributors use the tastings to grab the
attention of fickle consumers and to break through the marketplace
clutter. ``It's a great vehicle for introducing your product to
people who may not know about it,'' said Anne Marie Harrison, a
representative of Franciscan Wine Merchants, who was pouring
Estancia wines from California at Wright. ``This makes people feel
comfortable about spending the money for the wine.''
</P>
<P>
   Some stores feature a single wine, others lay out a selection.
Some highlight the wines of a single maker, while others establish
a theme, pouring, say, a selection of cabernets from different
makers. In many cases, a representative from the winery or the
company that distributes the wine is on hand to pour, answer
questions and observe consumer reactions to the product.
</P>
<P>
   It's all very low-key. Most shops simply place a handmade sign
in the front window, inviting one and all to step inside and sip a
little chardonnay, pinot grigio or syrah. But collectively, this
service adds up to an amazing variety of wines on offer, at a
variety of prices, from workaday Portuguese tintos to up-and-coming
Chileans to more-than-respectable Bordeaux and Burgundies.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the action begins Friday night, as some wine shops,
especially ones in midtown, try to lure the after-work crowd, and
it picks up again on Saturday afternoon, with some shops getting
started as early as noon, but most doing their tastings between 3
and 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing intimidating about the protocol. Like the
supermarket employees who hand out pizza puffs on a toothpick, the
winery representatives set up a small table, uncork their wines and
ask passing customers if they'd like to have a taste.
</P>
<P>
   If the answer is yes, they pour an ounce or two of wine in a
glass, or a plastic cup, briefly explain what's in the glass, and
wait for the customer to express an opinion or ask a question. No
question is too stupid. They are happy to talk all day about their
favorite subject.

<P>
   As a single woman, I can't help but look at America's
relationship with President Clinton as being like certain dating
relationships I've had, where it gets to be ``all about him.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``all about him'' relationship starts off equal. (In
America's case, you give him your vote, he gives you women in the
cabinet, pro-choice policies, a Middle East peace process.)
</P>
<P>
   Things seem to go fine for, oh, six years until suddenly he gets
busy. He can't meet you someplace. He's at the office all the time.
He's having problems he can't explain. It's not about you, America
_ he needs his space.
</P>
<P>
   So then, for eight whole months America is hysterical and on the
phone with everyone else in America. America just doesn't ``get''
him.
</P>
<P>
   America quizzes him endlessly _ and when America does, he gets
peeved. So, except for the special prosecutor (who, frankly, I
would've liked to have in a few of my dating relationships), our
country is having exactly the same kind of affair I often do. It's
``all about him,'' and America is stuck sitting home alone night
after night eating ice cream and watching John Gibson on MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   As a human woman, I don't like guys playing with my head. How
about a whole country's head? No wonder Americans are upset: We're
having a very dysfunctional relationship with whom? Not some guy _
the federal government! And most of us don't like to be hysterical
about the president of the United States all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, I find myself lying in bed, staring wistfully at the
ceiling, endlessly wondering if my president really cares about me,
or if he just wants to go down well in history.
</P>
<P>
   There's another element to this ``dating relationship'' many of
us are deluded about. As a country dating its president, America
seems to fit the mold of the ``trophy wife.'' I mean, in country
terms we're a hot number. The approval ratings for this president,
then, seem to be mostly about our desire to stay with him and go on
as a ``power couple.'' Young. Attractive. Well off. Nice GNP. (I
mean, so far, in the relationship.)
</P>
<P>
   I think America realizes that there are a lot of world leaders
whose calls we'd never even return let alone seriously discuss
impeaching! That's something to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   Dating analogy aside, self-centeredness is what ticks off
Americans most _ not the sex, not Ken Starr (the poor man's Terry
Southern), not even the $40 million (which just would've been blown
on bombers or IRS forms or something just as stupid.) It's the
``All About Him'' presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is this president and the Congress, and the House (the
members of which also seem to have ``all about me'' relationships
with their constituents) have long ago spurned their ``significant
other'' (America) in favor of it being all, and endlessly, about
them (and Geraldo Rivera). It's their air time, their election
campaigns, their pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   Well, guess what. America doesn't want to be laughed at by
France, lectured by England or repeatedly stood up by you. How we
got into this relationship I don't know _ we certainly didn't meet
the federal government at a health club _ but it's assuredly got to
end. We can't take it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Truly, it should be all about us.

 NEW YORK: favorite subject.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the Chelsea Wine Vault, for example, Enore Ceola, a
representative from Mionetta, was stationed behind an upright wine
barrel, pouring his bubbly treats as customers lined up like kids
at a Good Humor truck. As he poured, he gently felt out his
audience. Did they know what prosecco was? Excellent! Did they know
the difference between frizzante and spumante? When brows furrowed,
Ceola explained: Frizzante has half the effervescence of spumante.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are good because they ask questions,'' he said.
``This is positive. Italians think they are supposed to know
everything about wine, so they won't say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   At Wright _ where an outside awning announced ``Wine Tasting
Today: Please Come In!'' _ Ms. Harrison and an assistant stood
behind a small table off to one side of the store and appealed to
customers as they strolled by. ``Would you like to try some wine
today?'' they asked.
</P>
<P>
   Warily, most customers accepted the invitation, and listened
politely as Ms. Harrison announced that the Wine Spectator had
recently given Estancia's fume blanc an 88 rating.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the afternoon, Ms. Harrison had to fend off a couple
of wise guys who had apparently been doing some heavy tasting
already. ``Would you care for a dry white wine?'' she asked one of
them. Woozily, he said, ``I prefer a wet wine.'' (For the record,
most wine shops will indulge a repeat taste, but they are not
inclined to let customers put a foot up on the rail and plant
themselves for an afternoon of serious drinking.)
</P>
<P>
   Booze hounds form a very tiny minority of the free-tasting
population. The typical Estancia taster that day was more likely to
sip, and then tentatively offer an assessment, which, nine times
out of 10, was ``nice.'' A little like that 88 from the Wine
Spectator, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Some people felt obliged to be a little more creative. Sipping
the Estancia merlot, one customer looked toward the ceiling,
silently communed with his taste buds for a moment, and said,
``This tastes smoky, uh, smokyesque.''
</P>
<P>
   It made sense that Wright, a bargain hunter's wine store with a
youthful clientele, was offering the accessible, modestly priced
wines of Estancia, selling at the store at prices ranging from
$9.99 for the chardonnay to $15.99 for the merlot.
</P>
<P>
   At Acker Merrall, the wine presentations are geared toward a
more knowledgeable customer, and on Saturdays the store likes to
pop the cork on at least one big gun _ a Mouton-Rothschild from
Bordeaux, say, or Harlan Estate from the Napa Valley.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular Saturday, the store was pairing two everyday
wines by Lindemans, Bin 65 chardonnay ($6.99) and Bin 45
cabernet-shiraz ($8.99), with Penfolds Padthaway chardonnay
($14.99) and Bin 389 cabernet-shiraz ($22.50). The legendary Grange
was a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word got out on the street,'' Patrick Boland, the store's
managing director, said. ``I think a lot of people organized their
day around the Grange.''
</P>
<P>
   Acker Merrall, more than most wine stores, fine-tunes its
tastings. On Friday nights, with an eye to the customer who wants
to grab a bottle for dinner, it pours one wine, usually under $25.
Saturdays are more ambitious. By keeping a sharp eye on customer
reactions, Boland said, he can develop a flavor profile for his
regulars and give them tips on wines they might like.
</P>
<P>
   Other wine stores have also tinkered with the basic tasting
format. Best Cellars, whose top price for a wine is $9.99, offers a
free tasting every night, featuring one wine that connects to a
weeklong theme. One week the store featured wines that would help
explain the role of tannins. Another week, the lesson was
fortification, or the addition of alcohol to wines like port and
sherry to arrest fermentation and provide extra backbone.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturdays, Best Cellars brings in a chef or cookbook author
and matches wine with food, a concept that draws as many as 300
customers from 2 to 4 p.m. The foie gras mousse, prepared by Scott
Snyder of the Astor Restaurant and Lounge, drew nicely. Past
offerings of Washington state oysters and caviar nearly touched off
a stampede.
</P>
<P>
   The Chelsea Wine Vault, in addition to weekend tastings, keeps
about 12 bottles at the ready on a copper-sheathed shelf near the
cash register, a kind of wine bar where customers can sample before
they buy. This may be the best deal in town. Recent offerings
included a Beringer white zinfandel ($6.99), an Argentine malbec
from Alto de Madrano ($8.99) and a single-vineyard zinfandel from
Hendry Ranch in the Napa Valley ($24.99).
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Wines and Spirits, in midtown, once teased its
customers by pouring a mystery wine from a brown bag with the
promise that anyone who could identify it would get the bottle
free. No one came up with the answer, and no wonder. It was a
rarity, a white wine from the tiny Provencal island of
Porquerolles, made from the obscure rolle grape.
</P>
<P>
   Slipping in a wine from Porquerolles may be cheating, but no one
complained, in conformity with the unwritten law of all such
tastings: No grousing allowed. If the wine is good, you call it
great. If it's mediocre, you say it's fine. You may even mean it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a rule of thumb,'' Boland of Acker Merrall said. ``All
wine tastes better when it's free.''

 &HT;    GEORGES POUNDS DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, HAITI AS FLORIDA BRACES FOR
STORM
 &HT;    EDs: May need updating after 6 p.m . EDT.
 &HT;    With HURRICANE-HAITI-0923.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Hurricane Georges pounded the island of Hispaniola,
shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti, and pushed late Tuesday
toward Cuba and the U.S. mainland, distracting South Florida
residents who began preparing for the fury of this hurricane
season's deadliest storm.
</P>
<P>
   Packing winds of 120 mph at midday, Georges was expected to
devastate Hispaniola, home to 15 million people, many of whom live
in substandard housing.
</P>
<P>
   The formidable storm knocked out power and forced residents into
shelters across the densely populated Dominican Republic, where two
people were killed by downed electrical lines.
</P>
<P>
   Georges had paralyzed the Dominican Republic's capital of Santo
Domingo by mid-afternoon, where it flooded streets, uprooted trees,
and whisked away tin roofs and satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, officials expected a high death toll in Haiti due to
the unsafe living conditions of thousands of desperately poor
Haitians.
</P>
<P>
   In Haiti's capital of Port-au-Prince, which is surrounded by
slums, fragile communities of cardboard homes cling to slippery
hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   ``People die here even when we just get a heavy downpour, one
that's not even a tropical storm, so this could be catastrophic for
us,'' said Michelle Karshan, a spokeswoman for Haiti's President
Rene Preval.
</P>
<P>
   When Tropical Storm Gordon, a much weaker system than Georges,
struck Haiti in 1994, hundreds of people were killed in mudslides.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, forecasters predicted Georges could affect
southernmost Florida by late Thursday or early Friday. The National
Hurricane Center in Miami was expected to place parts of South
Florida under a hurricane watch late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Workers placed shutters over the windows at City Hall in Key
West, while authorities advised all visitors and non-residents of
the Florida Keys to evacuate the island chain who's only connection
to the mainland is a two-lane highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate most of the evacuations will occur on
Wednesday,'' said Billy Wagner, an official with the Monroe County
Emergency Management Service. ``Anyone who's got plans to visit the
Keys should postpone them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane warnings were posted for Haiti, eastern Cuba, the
southwestern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands, and a
hurricane watch was in effect in parts of Cuba and the Bahamas on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials expected to issue a hurricane watch some time
Wednesday for South Florida, where residents packed the stores in
search of supplies such as batteries, flashlights and water.
</P>
<P>
   Georges was expected to weaken somewhat as it moved off the
shore of Hispaniola, but not below hurricane strength. As of 5 p.m.
EDT Tuesday, Georges had sustained winds of 110 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Still, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predicted
that Georges would pack much less of a punch than Hurricane Andrew,
which caused billions of dollars in damage in densely populated
South Florida in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday and early Tuesday, Georges wreaked havoc across the
northeast Caribbean, killing at least 10 people, mostly due to
mudslides and collapsed roofs.
</P>
<P>
   Boasting gusts of up to 130 mph, the hurricane dumped two feet
of water in the mountains of Puerto Rico, while bending palm trees
and flipping small aircraft like they were pancakes.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, all of the U.S. territory's 3.8 million people were
without power, and 80 percent of people were without running water,
while more than 25,000 people sought refuge in shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico was able to operate Tuesday
for relief flights, but remained closed to other traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are starting from ground zero,'' Puerto Rico's Gov. Pedro
Rossello said of recovery efforts.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton declared Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands disaster areas, authorizing immediate release of federal
recovery aid. Scores of federal and Red Cross officials fanned
across the island to assess damage, expected to soar to hundreds of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In Antigua, the storm split open government-built houses and
ripped corrugated roofs off hundreds of other homes. In St. Croix,
winds shoved a 50-foot sailboat ashore and destroyed part of the
boardwalk. In St. Kitts, about 70 percent of the houses suffered
damage, as did the hospital, airport, and police station.

<P>
   MIAMI _ For Haiti, it was to be the delegation of its dreams.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the impoverished nation had planned to host first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, media mogul Ted Turner, investor
George Soros, and William Gates II, the father of America's richest
man, Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, the well-heeled notables have big bucks, and Haiti
desperately needs them.
</P>
<P>
   But now the ferocious Hurricane Georges has crashed the party
before it even began.
</P>
<P>
   The visit by the Clinton-organized, 75-member delegation --
officially dubbed ``Civil Society's Contribution to Democracy'' --
has been postponed to some time in October due to the storm,
according to Haitian government officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought all of these people were going to come visit here,
Ted Turner and Hillary Clinton, and we were excited,'' said
Michelle Karshan, a spokeswoman for Haiti's President Rene Preval.
``These people were going to talk about giving money and support to
various projects in Haiti, which we really need.''
</P>
<P>
   David Harwood, a spokesman for the United Nations Foundation,
the Washington, D.C.-based charity created to designate U.N.
programs to receive Turner's funding, said Turner had planned to
send a foundation representative to Haiti, rather than go himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foundation has some activities going on that might relate
to Haiti and the Caribbean, and we wanted to talk about these,''
Harwood said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Clinton said she was not sure that the trip
would be postponed, adding that a final decision would be made by
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's visit to Haiti would have been the first time
many of the delegation members, including Clinton, have visited the
country.
</P>
<P>
   However, Soros, the Hungarian-born international financier,
opened a foundation in Haiti last year -- the Knowledge and Freedom
Foundation -- to promote democracy and youth projects with a $2
million annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   The economy in this country of seven million people has
foundered since 1994, when a U.S.-led invasion ousted military
dictator Raoul Cedras and restored the democratically elected
Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Haiti's annual per-capita income is $250, about one-tenth
the average of Latin America and the Caribbean. Infant mortality is
almost twice the regional average, while malnutrition affects about
half of all children.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear exactly what the delegation planned to do during
its visit besides meet with non-governmental groups to discuss
judicial reform and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   But what was clear was that Haiti would be picking up a carpet
of debris left by Georges rather than rolling out a red carpet for
its much-anticipated guests.

THE WHITE HOUSE GOLDFISH BOWL IS A LOUSY PLACE FOR SECRET LOVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secret Service officers thought something fishy was
up at times when their radio crackled reports of President Clinton
moving toward the Oval Office just after Monica Lewinsky entered
through the White House gate.
</P>
<P>
   And moments after her departure, especially on weekends, Clinton
would return to the White House residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just like clockwork,'' one officer said. Another
officer wanted to bar Lewinsky's entry but was told by a supervisor
it was none of his business whom the president saw.
</P>
<P>
   That was just one of dozens of instances documented by
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in which the electronic and human
eyes and ears of the White House recorded the comings and goings of
Clinton and his young lover.
</P>
<P>
   No agent, no official, no reporter, no electronic device ever
caught them in an erotic act. But Starr's enormous compilation of
evidence _ everything from second-by-second logs of the president's
movements to grand jury testimony of agents stationed outside the
Oval Office _ proves one thing: The White House is a goldfish bowl,
a lousy place to carry on an illicit love affair.
</P>
<P>
   If the serious possibility of impeachment were not at stake,
much of the evidence could form the basis of a zany Marx Brothers
movie or some other slapstick comedy of a bygone era.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the two devised a cover story that Lewinsky was
delivering papers to the president when she visited him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal secretary, Betty Curry, dialed Lewinsky's
telephone number for Clinton so that the log of calls made through
White House telephone operators wouldn't show that the president
had dialed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton was nervous that detection literally was just
around the corner. On December 28, 1997, at their last face-to-face
meeting, Lewinsky noticed during a kiss that Clinton didn't have
his eyes closed. Instead, he was looking out the window of his
private study.
</P>
<P>
   When she complained that he wasn't being romantic, the president
said ``Well, I was just looking ... to make sure no one was out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had reason to be concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Without drawn curtains on windows leading out to the Rose
Garden, their trysts were fair game for Secret Service officers or
other White House personnel outside.
</P>
<P>
   Once, the sight through a window of a gardener made them retreat
from the study. Most of their encounters took place in a hallway
and bathroom, both windowless.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton kept a door ajar so he could hear approaching footsteps,
Lewinsky testified. During one interlude, they were interrupted by
White House aide Harold Ickes, who was calling ``Mr. President.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``jetted out into the Oval Office and I panicked,''
Lewinsky recalled. She hustled through a door leading to the
president's dining room and down the hall past the chief of staff's
office. In a phone call afterward, Clinton ``was a little upset
with me that I left,'' Lewinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their subterfuge, Lewinsky made a point of entering
the president's office suite through one door and exiting through
another door.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, ``no (guard) would know how long I had been in there,''
Lewinsky told the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the agents' grand jury testimony, however, Lewinsky
was not fooling anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty commonly known that she did frequent the West
Wing on the weekends,'' former Secret Service officer Lewis Fox
testified. Another officer, William Ludtke III, saw her exit from
the pantry near the Oval Office looking startled.
</P>
<P>
   Another agent, William Bordley, reported stopping Lewinsky
outside the Oval Office because she lacked a White House pass.
Clinton opened the door and reassured the agent that her presence
there was OK. She went in.
</P>
<P>
   Still another agent, Robert Ferguson, recalled Clinton telling
him he was expecting ``some staffers,'' and watching as Lewinsky
arrived saying the ``president needs me.'' Ferguson rotated to a
position outside the Oval Office window and saw the two enter the
study where he couldn't see them.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky in particular wanted to avoid White House aides who
viewed her with suspicion. One of them, Clinton's personal aide
Stephen Goodin, was concerned over appearances and said Lewinsky
should not be alone with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   So during their meeting on Feb. 28, 1997, according to Lewinsky,
Currie chaperoned them to the study _ and then left the room.
</P>
<P>
   Another staffer, then-Deputy White House Chief of Staff Evelyn
Lieberman, chided Lewinsky for violating a policy forbidding
interns from hanging around the West Wing.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky replied that she was no longer an intern.
</P>
<P>
   After an unidentified Secret Service agent told Lieberman that
Lewinsky was considered a ``nuisance,'' Lieberman ``decided to get
rid of her,'' according to Lieberman's grand jury testimony.
Lieberman quickly arranged for Lewinsky to transfer from the White
House to the Pentagon in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not put an end to the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   In one now-infamous episode, Lewinsky arrived at the northwest
gate on Dec. 6, 1997, to deliver a letter and gifts to Clinton.
Currie had said Clinton was meeting with his lawyers and instructed
Lewinsky to wait.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting, she was informed by uniformed Secret Service
officers that Clinton actually had television personality Eleanor
Mondale in his office. Lewinsky stormed away in anger and called
Currie from a pay phone to complain about misinforming her.
</P>
<P>
   Currie then called the guards and chastisted them for revealing
that Clinton was seeing Mondale. Later, Clinton told the Secret
Service watch commander, Capt. Jeffrey Purdie, not to discuss the
incident. Purdie said Clinton told him: ``I hope you use your
discretion,'' Later, Purdie told his subordinates: ``Whatever just
happened didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   This past summer, the Clinton administration fought a losing
battle to prevent Secret Service personnel from testifying. The
result, one former agent said, is to turn the White House into even
more of a goldfish bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been part of our culture not to talk about what
goes on,'' said Bob Snow, a former Secret Service agent and past
president of the retired Secret Service agents association. ``But
this is one step further in that `fishbowl' direction. In fact,
it's two or three steps beyond.''

   NEW YORK _ No dank forest glen could produce beautiful, frilly
oyster mushrooms in sherbet colors: delicate peach and lemon
yellow. These mushrooms, coming into markets now, are grown in
straw by Hopewell Organic Foods in West Grove, Pa., from spores
that originally came from Korea, where the colorful mushrooms are
prized.
</P>
<P>
   But once sauteed, their colors fade, like those purple string
beans that turn green when heated. The peach mushrooms become
salmon-beige and the yellows take on a grayish hue. The colors hold
better if they are blanched quickly in boiling water, drained and
tossed with a dressing to use in a salad. And they have an engaging
flavor, with a fruity, almost perfumed touch of sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   The mushrooms are sold loose at Fairway, 2127 Broadway (74th
Street) and 2328 12th Avenue (132d Street), for $9.78 a pound, or
in three-and-a-half-ounce packages for $3.29. &QL;

   Don't know the difference between the amatriciana and arrabbiata
when you are in your favorite Italian trattoria? Help is on the
way. Not one but two dictionaries of Italian culinary terms have
been published in the last few months: ``Dictionary of Italian
Cuisine'' by Maureen B. Fant and Howard M. Isaacs (Ecco Press,
$27.50) and ``The Dictionary of Italian Food and Drink'' by John
Mariani (Broadway Books, $17 paperback).
</P>
<P>
   The ``Dictionary of Italian Cuisine'' has more entries,
extensive cross-referencing and hundreds of terms in regional
dialects. But the definitions are often not as detailed as in the
Mariani book, which also has some recipes, more explanation of the
cuisine of various regions and, for each entry, a guide to the
pronunciation.
</P>
<P>
   Each book gives general pronunciation rules in its introduction,
and the Fant and Isaacs book has a handy English-Italian index.
Neither book will fit easily into your pocket, so you will have to
bone up before you dine out. &QL;

   Last summer, Shelburne (Vt.) Farms went back in time and started
wrapping some of its wheels of raw-milk Cheddar in cheesecloth,
instead of sealing them in wax, for aging. The cheese, above, is
dark ivory and firm but buttery, with a complex flavor at once
herbaceous and fruity. It has a sturdy, mottled rind the color of
concrete beneath its layer of cloth.
</P>
<P>
   The cheese, aged a little more than a year, is available on a
limited basis at Balducci's, 424 Avenue of the Americas (Ninth
Street), and at Murray's Cheese, 257 Bleecker Street (Cornelia
Street), for $18.99 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Pricey for Cheddar? ``Even though the cloth wrapping allows the
cheese to age faster than regular Cheddar, which is sealed in
Cryovac, then waxed before it is shipped, it is more
labor-intensive to make because you have to keep turning the wheels
and scrubbing the rind,'' said Elizabeth Skinner, who handles the
cheese marketing for Shelburne.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the cheese ages in the cellars of Major Farm in Putney,
Vt., but Shelburne Farms is building its own aging cellars. &QL;

   Of the dozen or so kinds of smoked salmon on the market, most
are made from farm-raised fish. But occasionally the leaner,
richer-tasting variety made from more muscular wild salmon is
available.
</P>
<P>
   Now through November, wild Scotch salmon imported by a company
called Sir John Wincroft will be available at a number of shops:
Todaro Brothers, 555 Second Avenue (30th Street), for $35.96 a
pound; Marche Madison, 931 Madison Avenue (74th Street), for $47.96
a pound; Dean &AMP; DeLuca, 560 Broadway (Prince Street), $48 a pound;
Grace's Marketplace, 1237 Third Avenue (71st Street), for $51.96 a
pound, and William Poll, 1051 Lexington Avenue (74th Street), for
$60 a pound. &QL;

   Despite the cheap rent and spacious kitchen, a store on the
Bowery did not work out for Carolyn Giacolone, who opened Fina
Pastry there last year. So she closed the shop and reopened it as
Carolyn's, 1516 First Avenue (79th Street).
</P>
<P>
   The narrow, homey storefront has eight little tables, and the
kitchen is set up to allow her to offer soups and sandwiches in
addition to delicious apple- and prune-filled pastries, biscotti,
tarts, muffins and doughnuts.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, from the perspective of the weather satellite, an
impressive cluster of showers and thunderstorms associated with an
area of low pressure swirled over the western Gulf of Mexico. On
Wednesday, with steering winds blowing from east to west over the
region, the cluster of showers and storms will move inland to south
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, an expanding area of showers and thunderstorms
will affect parts of the southern Plains, particularly sections of
Kansas, as increasingly warm and moist air is drawn northward and
forced to rise over a thin layer of retreating cooler air.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of showers and thunderstorms, some heavy, will erupt
over parts of Florida, with the most active storms likely to form
across central parts of the state. Localized street flooding is
likely.
</P>
<P>
   An autumnal air mass will build into the northeast states,
carried on brisk winds from the northwest that will average 15 to
25 mph. A few chilly showers will dampen extreme northwest New
England before migrating northeast to the Canadian Maritimes.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, sunshine will soften the chill of brisk Canadian
winds, though some fair-weather cumulus will develop over mountains
from the Poconos and Catskills of northeast Pennsylvania and
southern New York to the Green and White Mountains of Vermont and
New Hampshire. Frost is likely Wednesday night in mountain valleys
of the northeast states, with fog forming over river valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a few showers will escort a cool front across the
upper Middle West from the central Rockies to the northern Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Curious Comparison
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of similar intensity and path, Hurricane Georges has
been likened to Hurricane Hugo, which came ashore near Charleston,
S.C., on September, 21, 1989. On Monday (September 21), as
Hurricane Georges bore down on San Juan, Puerto Rico, 10.52 inches
of rain fell at Charleston, breaking the city's record rainfall for
the date. Curiously, Charleston's previous record for the date was
nearly 5 inches of rain with Hurricane Hugo. On Tuesday, in the
spirit of strange comparison, rain at San Juan, Puerto Rico,
tallied 5 inches as Hurricane Georges passed close to the city.

`THE BRANDON TEENA STORY': A RAPE, A BEATING, 3 MURDERS ... AND
THEN THE TWIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(JT) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The young women whom Brandon Teena dated all agree about one
thing. Brandon, a fresh-faced 21-year-old Nebraskan who was raped
and beaten by two acquaintances on Christmas Eve in 1993, then shot
to death with two others by the same pair a week later, knew how to
treat a woman. He was courtly and sent flowers and was an excellent
kisser. Growing up, the star he most idolized was Cher.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Brandon's girlfriend, Lana Tisdel, discovered he was
really a woman (he was born Teena Brandon) undergoing hormone
therapy in anticipation of a possible sex change operation, she did
not recoil in horror. But in the eyes of Brandon's male friends,
Thomas Nissen and John Lotter, two shiftless young men from the
rural Nebraska town of Falls City, to which he had just moved from
Lincoln, once they discovered his sex, he became a freak. They felt
at once betrayed and sickened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brandon Teena Story,'' Susan Muska and Greta Olafsdottir's
riveting, understated documentary, bends over backward not to
sensationalize a murder case that encapsulates the deep-seated
fears about gender and alternative sexuality harbored by millions
of Americans, especially those living in the heartland. Falls City,
an economically depressed small town with an all-white population
of just under 5,000, epitomizes that sprawling rural and semi-rural
section of the United States that might be described as the Land of
the Pickup Truck.
</P>
<P>
   Those who live and work here may have heard of gay liberation,
but they've never met an uncloseted gay or transgendered person and
have no desire to do so. Although Falls City prides itself on being
a close-knit, God-fearing community, we learn that it has a high
rate of domestic violence. You can sense these ominous
undercurrents during a scene at a local demolition derby where all
the men are toting guns.
</P>
<P>
   The film methodically interviews the surviving principals,
including the killers, both of whom were convicted of first-degree
murder and are now in prison, one of them ( Lotter) on death row.
We meet Brandon's parents, who talk sympathetically about their
dead child's troubled life. Brandon had suicidal tendencies, and
having no other means of support, eked out a living by forging
checks.
</P>
<P>
   When we first meet the killers, who are interviewed separately,
they seem nice enough, although we later learn that each had
already served time in prison. As they recall their early
friendship with Brandon, it's obvious that they liked him and were
fooled by his sexual charade. What's so unnerving about the movie
is how unemotional most of their recollections are. Their voices
are as flat and uninflected as the austere Nebraskan landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The film's most casually horrifying note is sounded by the
sheriff in charge of the rape case, who offhandedly refers to the
victim as ``it.'' Because of his failure to prosecute the rape case
vigorously, Nissen and Lotter were free to track Brandon down at a
farmhouse on New Year's Eve and kill Brandon and his companions,
24-year-old Lisa Lambert and her friend Philip Devine, a visitor
who happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   The grisly details of the murders are reconstructed through
audio recordings made during Nissen's 1995 murder trial. Nissen, in
exchange for testifying against Lotter, was spared the death
penalty but sentenced to three consecutive life terms. Lotter's
appeals are awaiting review by the United States Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brandon Teena Story'' shows us that in the Land of the
Pickup Truck, the hatred and fear of unorthodox sexuality run deep.
Instead of being shouted, it festers until it explodes in acts of
violence whose cause even the killers themselves don't seem to
comprehend fully.

   Y2K-SETTLEMENT _ ATLANTA _ An Atlanta company was involved in
what is being touted as America's first Y2K settlement. It was
$250,000. A Detroit-area grocer sued Tec America, an American

BellSouth. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

and I am not happy with that. I asked if this is inferior to the

reason for using finger-jointed wood is to save money, not for
structural superiority. What is your advice? And other
consumer-interest questions. (Grieg, Austin American-Statesman)

   BBO-BAUMAN _ ROSWELL, N.M. _ First Mark McGwire, then Sammy
Sosa, caught and passed Babe Ruth and Roger Maris. But neither will
catch Joe Bauman. The real home run king of professional baseball
is 76 and retired in Roswell, N.M. Bauman hit 72 home runs in 1954
for the minor-league Roswell Rockets in the Longhorn League.
Bauman, who never played in the majors, also hit .400 and drove in
224 runs that season in 138 games. He made $4,000 _ good money for
the minors _ and also received a free ham for each homer. But the
real bonus came when fans passed money through the backstop fence
after each blow. He collected about $900 when he broke the minor
league record with homer No. 70. He bought a gas station in Roswell
and forgot about the big leagues. Then 32, he said he couldn't
afford to leave Roswell. (Curtright, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

September 21 in Mission Viejo, Calif., at the age of 38. (Lance,

   TEXAS-CARS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Before there was a Motor Mile, back
when U.S. 183 was considered in the far reaches of Austin, before
Austinites had ever heard of a car named KIA, downtown was the
place to car shop. In the early 1900s, East Fifth Street, Texas,
was lined with dealers. Today, they've all but disappeared.

   FBN-DOLPHINS-JOHNSON _ DAVIE, Fla. _ This stuff _ a shiny 3-0

examine the three-game gem he now holds in his hands _ and will
continue to hold for two weeks until the Dolphins resume play
against the New York Jets. (Woods, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-GRILLED-DOLPHINS _ DAVIE, Fla. _ Jimmy Johnson plopped down
in a chair for his day-after meeting with the newspaper reporters
who cover the Miami Dolphins. Before taking any questions, the
unusually relaxed Johnson (being 3-0 heading into a bye week will
do that) steered the conversation toward the pressure of being an
NFL head coach in 1998 and how, because of increased media
coverage, it is different than when he took charge of the Dallas
Cowboys in 1989. (Woods, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   BBA-MCCOY-COLUMN _ CINCINATTI, Ohio _ ``I sat out Sunday's game

On our team we see Barry Larkin and Bret Boone try to play every
day . . . but every day for 16 years? Wow.'' (McCoy, Dayton Daily

</P>
<P>
   BBN-BRAVES-BEATABLE _ Greg Maddux is missing his targets by
inches. To the Atlanta Braves, he might as well be missing by a
mile. The Braves, who begin a quick two-game series tonight at Pro
Player Stadium against the Florida Marlins, have won their division
in each of the past seven seasons, including this one. But they've
won the World Series only once (1995). (Graziano, Palm Beach Post)

</P>
<P>
   HKN-PANTHERS-WORRELL _ It's an unlikely scenario, but if the
Florida Panthers ever decide to assign right winger Peter Worrell
to an East Coast Hockey League team, fans of the Pensacola Sky
Pilots would love to have him. (Biggane, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

ABDUL-JABBAR TO COACH AT ARIZONA RESERVATION SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has won championships. He set the
NBA's all-time scoring record. He fought Bruce Lee in the movies.
Now, he wants to coach.
</P>
<P>
   His first job?
</P>
<P>
   Alchesay High School.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Alchesay, a 3A school in Whiteriver that features a
6-foot-2 center and sits on the White Mountains Apache Reservation
in northeastern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar, who fell in love with the area the past three
years while doing research for a book on the buffalo soldier,
expressed interest this summer with the school and recently sent a
letter of commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the school board approved Abdul-Jabbar to come on as
a volunteer assistant basketball coach under Raul Mendoza, who
guided the Falcons to the state championship game last season.
</P>
<P>
   The towering figure plans to leave his swank Beverly Hills,
Calif., home next month and lease a place on the reservation for
the basketball season, said Alchesay Principal Herve Dardis.
</P>
<P>
   The reservation, already a basketball hotbed, has been abuzz
since word came out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody, all the players, the whole town, are excited,''
said senior guard Kyle Goklish, a returning starter. ``I think a
lot more kids will be coming out. He has a lot to offer us through
basketball and through life, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar could not be reached for comment. He is not
expected to stay beyond the basketball season, Dardis said.
</P>
<P>
   Dardis kept Abdul-Jabbar's interest in coaching at the school
quiet until this week, wanting to make sure the former Los Angeles
Lakers center was sincere on his promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met the guy once,'' Dardis said. ``I think he wants to
coach. I know he wants to help young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``He mentioned to me he had a conversation with (retired Gen.)
Colin Powell on the need for people to serve as volunteers and help
young people. I think the seed was planted there.''
</P>
<P>
   But why Alchesay?
</P>
<P>
   Dardis said that Abdul-Jabbar has a friend who lives in the area
and did some research of the culture there for a non-fiction book.
He also was a guest speaker during a ribbon-cutting ceremony two
years ago for the opening of the school's activity center.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to coaching, Abdul-Jabbar will speak to classrooms
about the history of the culture he learned through his research,
Dardis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he will share more than just history,'' Dardis said.
``I'm sure he'll impact some kids on the lessons of life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, Abdul-Jabbar was accused of assault and
arrested at a Toronto airport for possession of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't respond to that right now,'' Dardis said about
Abdul-Jabbar's run-ins with the law. ``I don't want to speak for
the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said he met Abdul-Jabbar in July and found him to be
humble. He said they discussed basketball philosophies. They had
breakfast at a Whiteriver restaurant, which became something of a
spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people saw him and started coming up to him,''
Mendoza said. ``People wanted his autograph. He had cards made with
his autograph on them and handed them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the parking lot, and people driving by were
stopping their cars to get a better look.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was polite about it, but I see we're probably going to have
to make some arrangements, some provisions, so this doesn't get too
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza's teams have traditionally played before packed
gymnasiums on the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Now?
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not going to be there to see us,'' Mendoza said.
``They're going to be there to see him.'' &QL;

   BBO-BAUMAN _ ROSWELL, N.M. _ First Mark McGwire, then Sammy
Sosa, caught and passed Babe Ruth and Roger Maris. But neither will
catch Joe Bauman. The real home run king of professional baseball
is 76 and retired in Roswell, N.M. Bauman hit 72 home runs in 1954
for the minor-league Roswell Rockets in the Longhorn League.
Bauman, who never played in the majors, also hit .400 and drove in
224 runs that season in 138 games. He made $4,000 _ good money for
the minors _ and also received a free ham for each homer. But the
real bonus came when fans passed money through the backstop fence
after each blow. He collected about $900 when he broke the minor
league record with homer No. 70. He bought a gas station in Roswell
and forgot about the big leagues. Then 32, he said he couldn't
afford to leave Roswell. (Curtright, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   JOYNER-OBIT _ At the height of her popularity, former track star
Florence Griffith Joyner commanded the attention of everyone in her
presence. Martin-Floreal was reminiscing about Griffith Joyner
after finding out she had died of an apparent heart seizure
September 21 in Mission Viejo, Calif., at the age of 38. (Lance,

   TEXAS-CARS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Before there was a Motor Mile, back
when U.S. 183 was considered in the far reaches of Austin, before
Austinites had ever heard of a car named KIA, downtown was the
place to car shop. In the early 1900s, East Fifth Street, Texas,
was lined with dealers. Today, they've all but disappeared.

   FBN-DOLPHINS-JOHNSON _ DAVIE, Fla. _ This stuff _ a shiny 3-0
mined from a muddy 21-0 victory against the Pittsburgh Steelers _
is real gold. That was Johnson's analysis after having a day to
examine the three-game gem he now holds in his hands _ and will
continue to hold for two weeks until the Dolphins resume play
against the New York Jets. (Woods, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-GRILLED-DOLPHINS _ DAVIE, Fla. _ Jimmy Johnson plopped down
in a chair for his day-after meeting with the newspaper reporters
who cover the Miami Dolphins. Before taking any questions, the
unusually relaxed Johnson (being 3-0 heading into a bye week will
do that) steered the conversation toward the pressure of being an
NFL head coach in 1998 and how, because of increased media
coverage, it is different than when he took charge of the Dallas
Cowboys in 1989. (Woods, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   BBA-MCCOY-COLUMN _ CINCINATTI, Ohio _ ``I sat out Sunday's game
because Cal sat out,'' Eddie Taubensee said with a laugh. ``Hey,
2,632 straight games? He deserves a day off. I can't imagine that.
On our team we see Barry Larkin and Bret Boone try to play every
day . . . but every day for 16 years? Wow.'' (McCoy, Dayton Daily
News) MOVED.

<P>
   FBC-LONGHORNS-GOAL _ AUSTIN, Texas _ With Rice up next and the
meat of the Big 12 South schedule looming ahead, the push starts
now toward the Texas Longhorns' primary goal. Win state. (Wangrin,
Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-BRAVES-BEATABLE _ Greg Maddux is missing his targets by
inches. To the Atlanta Braves, he might as well be missing by a
mile. The Braves, who begin a quick two-game series tonight at Pro
Player Stadium against the Florida Marlins, have won their division
in each of the past seven seasons, including this one. But they've
won the World Series only once (1995). (Graziano, Palm Beach Post)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   HKN-PANTHERS-WORRELL _ It's an unlikely scenario, but if the
Florida Panthers ever decide to assign right winger Peter Worrell
to an East Coast Hockey League team, fans of the Pensacola Sky
Pilots would love to have him. (Biggane, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF `THE FULL MONTY'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What's the story behind the expression ``the full monty''?
</P>
<P>
   _ S.H., Holden, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: Like the ``whole nine yards,'' ``monty'' is an expression
with more than a dozen poorly documented but plausible
explanations. The expression appears to have been coined in the
1980s, so the absence of a reliable history is even more puzzling.
</P>
<P>
   The expression means ``the whole thing,'' and one theory links
it to ``die volle Montur,'' a German phrase meaning ``full dress
uniform.'' Another describes it as a corruption of ``the full
amount.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxford English Dictionary's editor, Neil Fulton, a participant
in the Internet discussion group alt.usage.english, has researched
the phrase exhaustively. ``As a result,'' he writes, ``I am able to
state, categorically, definitively, and authoritatively, that I
don't know where it comes from.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxford English Dictionary researchers are asking the public for
help in finding evidence of the origin of ``the full monty,''
especially anything that predates 1986. If you can help, write to
Oxford English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, Great Clarendon
Street, Oxford OX2 6DP, or send an e-mail to oed3(at)oup.co.uk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My nephew was recently killed when a train at a crossing hit
his truck. Is there a group I could join that helps stop these
senseless accidents?
</P>
<P>
   _ E.W., Keller, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Operation Lifesaver is a national, nonprofit organization
that focuses on training people to speak on crossing safety, said
Marmie Edwards, vice president of communications for the group.
Last year, its 3,000 speakers gave presentations to 2 million
people at schools and other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, which has about 16,000 train crossings, ranks No. 1 among
states in these types of collisions. Last year, it recorded 54
deaths, 197 injuries and 421 collisions. Illinois was next, with
about half those numbers in collisions and deaths, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there were 461 crossing deaths last year, 3,865
collisions and 1,540 injuries. To contact Operation Lifesaver, call
(800) 537-6224; write to 1420 King St., Suite 401, Alexandria, VA
22314; or visit the World Wide Web site www.oli.org.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My son-in-law told me my oleander plant is poisonous. Is that
true?
</P>
<P>
   _ L.W., Bedford, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Oleanders are extremely poisonous, according to information
provided by the Texas A&AMP;M University horticulture program. The
plant contains a deadly heart stimulant similar to the drug
digitalis.
</P>
<P>
   ``So powerful is this poison that a single leaf of an oleander
can kill a child,'' according to the program's report ``Poisonous
Plants and Plant Parts.'' ``Many people have died merely from
eating steaks speared on oleander twigs and roasted over a fire.''
</P>
<P>
   For more information about poisonous plants, write to the Texas
A&AMP;M University Horticulture Program, 202 Horticulture/Forest
Science Building, College Station, TX 77843-2134 or visit the World
Wide Web site aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Just how many squash soups can one city serve?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the number is infinite, as chefs, inspired no doubt
by the presently ubiquitous butternut squash, present variations on
this homey classic.
</P>
<P>
   Butternut squash _ the bisque-colored squash with orange flesh,
the tall one that stands straight up like a corseted bowling pin _
is easy to love. Unlike most other squashes, it doesn't require a
machete and Herculean strength to cut. The peel comes off easily
with a vegetable peeler, and it can be chopped with an ordinary
chef's knife.
</P>
<P>
   The fine-textured flesh is predictably rich and buttery, unlike
pumpkin or acorn squash, which can be stringy and bland. When
cooked with water, stock or cider, the flesh of the butternut melts
down to a rich mash. When pureed, it tastes like a meld of cream,
butter and squash.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious why chefs find squash soup irresistible. Who
wouldn't?
</P>
<P>
   SQUASH AND CIDER SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Time: 35 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 butternut squash, about 1 1/2 pounds
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, peeled and minced
</P>
<P>
   1 cup vegetable or chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   2 cups apple cider, approximately
</P>
<P>
   Fine sea salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   1. With a vegetable peeler, peel the squash from top to bottom.
With a large, heavy knife, cut it in half lengthwise. Discard the
seeds. Cut the two halves in half lengthwise, and then cut across
to make large cubes. There should be about 4 cups.
</P>
<P>
   2. Swirl olive oil in the bottom of a large, heavy pot. Add
onion and garlic, and cook slowly until soft, about 5 minutes. Add
squash cubes, stock and 1 cup of cider. Cover, and cook over medium
heat until the squash is very tender, about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Uncover, remove pot from heat and let rest 10 minutes. In a
food processor, puree the mixture, in 2 batches if necessary.
Return the mixture to the pot, and whisk in up to 1 cup of the
remaining cider, thinning mixture to desired consistency. Season
well with salt and pepper. Heat again until very hot, divide into 6
soup bowls and serve. (Soup can be made in advance and frozen, or
refrigerated overnight and reheated before serving.)
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Variations: Just before it is served, the soup can be
embellished with a little dry mustard, cayenne pepper, sour cream,
yogurt or creme fraiche to taste. The soup can also be served in a
mug, with a cinnamon stick for stirring.

   PEANUT-BAN (New York) _ Peanut butter is under attack at the
schoolhouse door. Cheap, nutritious, popular and traditional, it
has nonetheless taken its place on the list of substances _ like
asbestos and lead _ that send shivers down the spines of school
administrators. Prodded by activist parents warning of lethal
allergies, by the claims of some researchers that peanut allergies
are on the rise and, not least, by a fear of litigation, growing
numbers of public and private schools across the country, including
many of New York City's independent schools, have banned peanut
butter from their cafeterias.
</P>
<P>
   NY-BUILDING-INSPECTORS (New York) _ Construction experts say
there are glaring problems with the city's 18-year-old effort to
require inspections and repairs of tall buildings. City officials
acknowledge that laws governing facade maintenance have long
allowed for ineffective, sometimes useless, inspections of many
buildings. And while the officials have made recent efforts to
strengthen the laws, inspection records and interviews with city
officials, engineers, architects and landlords indicate that
numerous problems exist.

   NEW YORK _ What was Manhattan like long, long ago, before
skyscrapers, multimillion-dollar condos and co-ops and fast-food
outlets? The opportunity to see arrived Tuesday at the Museum of
the City of New York, where it will be exhibited from Saturday
through Nov. 29. It is a watercolor drawing believed to be the
oldest surviving visual representation of New York City. Made about
1650 and on loan from the Austrian National Library in Vienna, the
pen-and-ink sketch, 21 inches wide and 12.6 inches high, looks at
New Amsterdam from a point approximating the northern end of Nutten
(now Governors) Island at the entrance to the East River.
</P>
<P>
   The sketch, ``De Stadt Nieuw Amsterdam gelegen op het Eylandt
Manhattans in Niuew Nederlandt,'' is the centerpiece of a new
exhibition, ``New York Begins: A Rare Drawing of New Amsterdam,''
including maps and artifacts and a chance to learn what now stands
on the sites once occupied by the forts, taverns, warehouses,
churches and whipping post depicted by the 17th-century artist.

   In the Windy City, woodwinds, brasses, stringed instruments and
all manner of music will vie with Sammy Sosa and the Cubs for
attention when the Chicago Symphony Orchestra ushers in a weekend
feast at Symphony Center beginning on Friday night, with the
opening of its 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Barenboim will lead works by Mozart, Haydn and
Tchaikovsky, with the mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli as guest
soloist. Saturday brings the grand opening of the Eloise Martin
Center, known as Echo, the orchestra's new interactive
music-education environment in Symphony Center. And for 24 hours
starting at 7 p.m. on Saturday with a one-hour Chicago Symphony
concert, Marshall Field's Day of Music will offer free Dixieland,
classical, blues, flamenco, chamber, Irish and other music
throughout the center.

</P>
<P>
   A crucial performer in the Royal National Theater's new
production of Shakespeare's ``Antony and Cleopatra'' has returned
to the bosom of the London company after a mysterious two-week
absence. Just as tickets for the show, starring Helen Mirren and
Alan Rickman and opening Oct. 20, were to go on sale, the missing
Cedric reappeared.
</P>
<P>
   He happens to be the sine qua non serpent used by Cleopatra for
her suicidal end. But Cedric, a California king snake asked to do a
stretch by impersonating a venomous asp, disappeared from his box
backstage at the Olivier Theater. On Saturday, Cedric shocked one
of the staff when he was seen slithering across the floor of the
theater's costume room. Taken into custody, Cedric was returned to
his quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The show goes on. All's well that end's well.

TREASURIES FALL AS YIELD LEVELS FALL TO HISTORIC LOWS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices of U.S. Treasury securities fell for the first
time in five days Tuesday despite weakness in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors may have been a little reluctant to buy
at current prices with yield levels, which move inversely to
prices, already at historic lows.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year bond's price fell 19/32 to 105 8/32. Its yield, rose
to 5.15 percent from 5.12 percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last two months the bond market has derived
strength from the selloff in stocks, reflecting moves by investors
around the world to the relative safety of Treasury securities. So
it was considered unusual that both bonds and stocks fell Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts attributed the bond weakness to uncertainty over
what the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee will do at its
meeting next Tuesday. While speculation has increased that the
Federal Open Market Committee may move to lower rates, which could
help soothe anxiety in global markets, there is no obvious reason
for reduced rates in the United States, where the economy is
showing resilience.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management,
said, ``At the very least, the FOMC will adopt a bias toward easing
at this meeting, but the probability of an actual easing at this
juncture has increased markedly and may well be more likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were more emphatic in their prediction that the Fed would
move to ease rates. Philip Braverman, senior vice president and
chief economist at the DKB Securities (USA) Corp., said in his
latest market report that the Fed would take such a step because of
deepening distress in emerging markets, the threat of deflation in
the global economy and some signs of slowing economic growth in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Additional insight into the economy's performance will emerge
later this week when the Commerce Department releases a revision to
the second-quarter gross domestic product number, along with August
data for durable goods orders, personal income and consumer
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, whose ambiguous
remarks about interest rates last week contributed to a large
selloff in stocks, will be testifying Wednesday before the Senate
Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the Treasury will sell $15 billion of new
two-year notes, which by late Tuesday were being offered in
when-issued trading at a price to yield 4.62 percent.

`BLOOD': A SCIENCE AND A BUSINESS, A SAVER AND A KILLER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review) 
(lb) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Douglas Starr points out early in this ``Epic History of
Medicine and Commerce'' that when human blood has been broken down
into derivative products, its market value is 1,600 times that of
refined petroleum: about $40 for a barrel of oil compared with
$67,000 for an equivalent quantity of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Blood, in other words, is not just a compelling, mystical symbol
of the spirit of life; it is a commodity and is medically
indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Blood,'' Starr, the co-director of the Graduate Program in
Science Journalism at Boston University, has written a fascinating
history of blood, both as a challenge for scientific understanding
and as a product of global business.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific understanding, of course, had to come first, and some
of the most absorbing parts of Starr's story involve excursions
into medical history, when the role of blood in the body was
determined and the practice of transfusing it was invented.
</P>
<P>
   The tales of early experimenters, like Jean-Baptiste Denis of
France and the members of the Experimental Philosophy Club at
Oxford, are science history at a high and exciting level. Starr
covers the early experiments by which sick humans were transfused
with animal blood, explaining not only why such experiments were
bound to fail but why the early experimenters actually believed
they had achieved some success.
</P>
<P>
   These early transfusers were terribly wrong in their methods,
but Starr reminds us of the major contribution they made to
science. Before them, the human condition was believed to be a
matter of mysterious, semimagical humors, one of which was blood.
They determined that the body was a matter of ``chemicals, vessels
and pumps'' with blood _ previously deemed a kind of magical
substance _ a nutrient, a biological substance.
</P>
<P>
   Starr moves on to an equally riveting chapter on the practice of
bleeding, which endured for 2,500 years in the West despite the
fact that in almost every case it did more harm than good. His
portrait of Benjamin Rush, the American founding father whose
fanatical, blind devotion to bleeding as a cure-all killed many of
his patients, is a study in scientific obtuseness.
</P>
<P>
   What Starr calls ``the modern era of transfusion medicine''
began in 1908 with the work of a French researcher named Alexis
Carrel, who lived in New York. Carrel invented the technique of
taking blood from one person and putting it into another _
sometimes, when luck prevailed, saving lives.
</P>
<P>
   The principle that determined success or failure was, of course,
blood type, unknown to Carrel. It was discovered around the turn of
the century by a brilliant Viennese named Karl Landsteiner.
</P>
<P>
   Starr traces each of the scientific steps by which blood could
become a commodity, sketching in along the way some interesting
side implications, such as the early use of blood type in criminal
or paternity investigations and the historical significance of
hemophilia in Russian history. (It brought the mystic healer
Rasputin to the Romanov court.)
</P>
<P>
   But the bulk of the volume is devoted to the second element in
the history of blood, its role as an increasingly important
international product that had to be collected, broken down into
its constituent parts, stored and sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every epoch, people had seen blood as more than it really
was _ more than a liquid or component of their body, but as a
reflection of their image and understanding of themselves,'' Starr
writes. He is speaking of the way World War II accelerated research
into the techniques of blood transfusion, so that a wounded soldier
was given blood he had donated months before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood, once held in religious regard, had been removed from a
man's circulatory system, separated, processed, freeze-dried,
packaged, shipped and reconstituted _ only to be injected into the
same individual in a completely different form several months later
and half a world away.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Starr tells all this in sprightly, vigorous fashion, smoothly
explaining the technical side of things, adding colorful
descriptions of a large international cast of characters here and
there. Sometimes he piles on a bit too much detail, as, for
example, when he describes the blood-bank system as it evolved in a
half-dozen countries. Still, the narrative generally moves briskly
as Starr recounts the full and sometimes very dark story.
</P>
<P>
   He tells, for example, of hideous experiments performed on
prisoners by Josef Mengele-like Japanese researchers during World
War II, and, in the late 1960s and '70s, the morally troubling
concentration of blood-collection centers in poor countries like
Nicaragua, which became a source of blood products for the rich,
industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
   Vast profits were made by a new sort of entrepreneur, the
international blood broker. In Nicaragua, this global economic
system, in which the bodies of the poor were a kind of raw material
for the rich, became a focus of revolutionary anger against the
dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr foreshadows his story, and then ends it with the most
troubling episode in the history of blood as a commodity: the
spread of the AIDS virus in contaminated blood. His foreshadowing
has to do with the sensational 1992 trial of four French
bureaucrats, three of whom were convicted of failing to stop the
use of HIV-contaminated blood products in thousands of
transfusions. Starr's history of this incident is a gripping piece
of reporting.
</P>
<P>
   He stresses the French illusion that, because their
blood-collection system was based entirely on voluntary, unpaid
donations, the supply was safe. And even when that illusion died,
the failure to adopt sterilization techniques and the unwillingness
to destroy valuable stocks of available blood ``condemned thousands
of French citizens to AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   For a time, in other words, blood became a dubious commodity,
one that killed as well as saved, until effective steps were taken
to ensure the safety of the product. The efforts to do that mark a
final chapter in a rich story admirably told in this book.

 &HT;    CLINTON WARNS OBUCHI THAT JAPAN MUST TAKE ACTION TO SHORE UP
ECONOMY
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Concerned that Japan's listless economy could deepen
the global economic crisis, President Clinton warned Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi on Tuesday that ''swift and effective
action,'' is needed to clean up the tsunami of bad debt washing
over Japan's banking system.
</P>
<P>
   And, with the U.S. trade deficit with Japan mushrooming, Clinton
asked Obuchi to develop, within two weeks, a plan for opening five
key sectors of the economy -- telecommunications, pharmaceuticals,
energy, housing and construction -- to increased imports
competition.
</P>
<P>
   In their first meeting since Obuchi took office in July, Clinton
sought publicly to assure the Japanese of the premium the United
States places on its relationship with Japan, where more than
40,000 U.S. troops, pilots and sailors are based to help safeguard
U.S. security interests in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton invited Obuchi to a state visit at the White House
sometime early next year, Obuchi accepted, and administration aides
said they were working on a date.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States has no more important relationship in the
world than our relationship with Japan,'' Clinton told reporters
during a break in three hours of summitry with Obuchi. ''We are
very interested in deepening our partnership in the security area,
in the political area and in doing what we can economically
together to restore growth in the world and to stabilize the world
financial situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, however, over coffee, green tea and lunch,
Clinton delivered a tough message to Obuchi, Japan's sixth prime
minister since Clinton took office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   With Japan's major banks lumbering under an estimated $1
trillion in bad debts, Clinton told Obuchi that ''swift and
effective action,'' is needed to restore health to the system so
that lending, the lifeblood of economic growth, can resume, said
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president, in his comments, stressed the urgency of swift
and effective action to stimulate domestic demand-led growth,''
said Summers, who was in the meetings, ``and strengthen the
financial system in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Prime Minister Obuchi made it clear that it was his intention
to take appropriate measures to secure an early turnaround in the
Japanese economy,'' Summers added.
</P>
<P>
   He said the infusion of public money is essential, meaning that
Japanese taxpayers should be prepared to pay billions of dollars to
help shore up debt-ridden banks.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said such public funding should be carefully structured
so that it's not simple ''bailouts to shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether public money should be used to bail out
banks has roiled the Japanese political system this week. Over the
past few days, a compromise bailout plan potentially involving
hundreds of billions of dollars came unglued after opposition
parties in Tokyo's Diet, or parliament, withdrew their support.
</P>
<P>
   Raising another area of political contention for Japan, Clinton
called on Obuchi to institute an aggressive combination of economic
reforms aimed at increasing the access U.S. companies have to
Japan's market.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the sector-specific market openings, Clinton
requested that Obuchi develop a plan for increasing U.S. access to
Japanese government contracts for computers, medical technology and
telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barschesfsky said
deregulation and restructuring of Japan's economy was essential to,
not inimical to, the long-term health of Japan's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''In addition to banking sector reform and substantial fiscal
stimulus, market opening and deregulation are critical,''
Barschesfsky told reporters. ''Not only to the global economy, but
also to the functioning of Japan's own's economy, which remains
terribly over-regulated and under-productive.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expressed his concern, aides said, about the ballooning
U.S.-Japan trade gap, on track to top $60 billion this year, in
Japan's favor. The gap is widening chiefly because the combination
of a sagging economy in Japan and a weakened yen have sharply
reduced Japanese demand for American goods.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. exports to Japan fell to $58.9 billion, a drop of nearly 12
percent as compared to last year's figures, during the first seven
months of the year, according to the Commerce Department. That
tumble translates into more than $6 billion in lost sales to U.S.
farmers, manufacturers and raw materials suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi replaced Ryutaro Hashimoto, who resigned last summer in
the wake of a major parliamentary defeat for the Liberal Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   The LDP has dominated the political system of post-war Japan and
promulgated the policies credited with leading the country from the
ashes of war to become the world's second-largest economic power.
The party suffered a stinging rebuke by voters, however, angry over
a languid Japanese economy that has been flat or contracting for
seven of the past eight years.

   The dating game. The mating game. The waiting game. I knew about
the first two stages of relationship development. It's that last
one that slipped through the cracks of my education about the
opposite sex.
</P>
<P>
   The dating game was somehow both fun and frustrating. All those
hours debating what to wear, where to go, what to do, and what to
say. Along the way, I met some neat, interesting guys who are
successful and happily married today. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I also met some incredibly strange, unpredictable fellows. I
don't know where they are today, and I don't care, either. Because
of the latter group, I highly recommend double-dating, at least in
the beginning. There's nothing more disconcerting than being alone
with your date, 30 miles from home, when he rolls his eyes to the
top of his head and asks you, ``Do you hear the voices, too? I hate
it when they sing like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, after sorting through the lily pads, you may just find a
prince. He's charming, funny, smart, good-looking, and he shares
your values. Your comfort level around him increases to the point
that you can gulp down your soda and burp in front of him without
dying of embarrassment. He stops washing his car and getting a
haircut before every date. Before you know it, wedding bells are
ringing, and your best friends give you high-fives as you stroll
down the aisle. And there he is, Mr. Wonderful, your new mate.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the waiting game starts.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, not right away. There's an adjustment period during the
honeymoon when you are both on your best behavior. You know, you
jump up every morning to brush your teeth and wash your face before
he wakes up. He runs errands with you and repairs stuff around the
house with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Then, slowly but surely, things start to change. You decide
you'd rather have a cup of coffee before you brush your teeth or
your hair. The pizza man no longer needs directions to your house,
and when he arrives, he calls you by your first name. Yes, the
honeymoon is over.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one day you say, ``Honey, would you take out the trash
for me?'' and he grunts in response but it's a positive kind of
grunt. A half-hour later, he's still watching the game and the
trash can is now overflowing because you've added that pizza box
and a wilted head of lettuce to an already large pile of refuse.
Annoyed, you finally decide to do it yourself. He doesn't protest.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is just waiting him out.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it's hard. The grass is taller than the shrubbery. The
dripping sink annoys you. The cabinet falls on your foot every time
you open it. It's tempting just to do it yourself. Don't. If you
asked him to do it, and he gave a positive response. He will do it.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually.
</P>
<P>
   After umpteen arguments that all ended with, ``You just didn't
give me enough time. I said that I'd do it. What's the big rush
anyway? `Better Homes and Gardens' is not coming by today,'' I
finally learned my lesson. Just wait and wait and wait.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, sometime before never, he would take care of the
task. Sure enough, nothing bad would have happened in the meantime.
Neither `BH&AMP;G' nor my mother nor the yard patrol would have stopped
by and given us a citation. Friends have never dropped by and
complained that they had to jiggle the handle on the toilet to make
it stop running. In fact, contrary to my predictions, beanstalks
have never grown out of the trash can.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I know it's hard. Try to ignore it or make a list of all the
things that you've procrastinated about and do some of those while
you wait. Heck, if it's really killing you, just do it yourself.
But if you can, just wait. He'll do it.
</P>
<P>
   Someday.
</P>
<P>
   Really.

 &HT;    New therapy for bladder control gives women tool to fight
incontinence
 &HT;    By Amanda Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_A new treatment demonstrated Tuesday by a Georgia
company promises to help women control incontinence by merely
sitting in a special chair twice a week for eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Neocontrol Pelvic Floor Therapy System, developed by
Neotonus Inc. and Emory University(Ga.) and Georgia Tech
researchers, uses pulsed magnetic therapy to exercise and
strengthen pelvic muscles that control bladder function. It is
being made available first in Atlanta and will be rolled out
nationwide next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the majority of patients, it's a simple, safe and painless
treatment,'' said Dr. Niall Galloway, a urologist and director of
the Emory Continence Center. ``Our studies show it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Galloway helped develop Neocontrol, which was approved by the
Food and Drug Administration in June, and the continence center is
treating 45 patients with the system.
</P>
<P>
   Neotonus will be licensing the system, manufactured at Design
and Manufacturing Services, to doctors' offices and treatment
centers, said Neotonus CEO and President Tony J. Morris. So far,
the treatment is available at 10 metro Atlanta sites. Some
insurance may cover the $1,200 to $1,500 treatment cost.
</P>
<P>
   About 85 percent of the 15 million Americans afflicted by
incontinence are women, and that's why Neotonus focused on them,
Morris said. Initial tests suggest the treatment also may help men
who've lost bladder control after prostate surgery, but so far the
treatment is approved only for women. The most common causes of
pelvic muscle weakness are childbirth, surgery, injury or hormonal
changes during menopause.
</P>
<P>
   With the Neocontrol system, women sit fully clothed for about 20
minutes twice a week in a chair that has magnetic technology
imbedded in the seat. Pulsating magnetic fields induce muscle
contractions in the pelvic floor to build strength. The patient
feels her muscles tighten, but experiences no pain.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment works much as Kegel exercises do. Those exercises,
developed in the 1950s by Dr. A.M. Kegel, involve contracting the
anal sphincter as you would to prevent a bowel movement or urine
flow. They must be repeated several times a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the patients who need this (Kegel) treatment the most who
find it the most difficult to do,'' Galloway said. ``The Neocontrol
system helps them to understand how to work those muscles and keep
the problem from coming back again.''
</P>
<P>
   Treatments for incontinence include collagen injections to the
urethra, probes to provide electrical stimulation and surgery
called a vaginal repair, a $12,000-to-$15,000 operation that
involves tightening the muscles and ligaments of the pelvic floor.
</P>
<P>
   None of those procedures works for all women, and neither does
Neocontrol therapy. Galloway said it is inappropriate for women who
have metallic implants in their pelvic area, such as a hip
replacement, or for women who have cardiac pacemakers.
</P>
<P>
   In ongoing clinical trials involving 117 women in Cleveland,
Chicago, Philadelphia and Orlando, half of those who have completed
eight weeks of Neocontrol therapy reported being ``completely
dry.'' Eighty-three percent said they had seen ``significant
improvement'' in their incontinence.
</P>
<P>
   The therapy has won raves from patients who were helped in the
clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've regained my life in regard to sports and exercise,'' said
Penny Stockford, 45, an Orlando nurse who developed incontinence
after a hysterectomy and treatment for cancer. ``It's great not
having to be ever mindful that I have a leakage problem. It's a
wonderful feeling to be that free.''

   All eyes will be on the new ladies of country
</P>
<P>
   By Russ DeVault
</P>
<P>
   STAFF WRITER
</P>
<P>
   The way Faith Hill sees it, she and the other women are more
than holding their own as it comes time for the 32nd Country Music
Association awards program tonight. ``We're selling records and
kicking the boys' butts,'' Hill says. ``We're the ones to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of country fans and pop music mainstreamers will indeed
be watching the women of country during the CBS telecast _ last
year's glitzy show drew an audience of 20.7 million and this year's
is expected to do equally well.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among the younger stars _ loomed over by Reba McEntire
just as the male contingent is by Garth Brooks _ are teen sensation
LeAnn Rimes, 33-year-old Shania Twain and Hill, 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reba, boy, is she big _ a major cottage industry,'' says Larry
Vallon, national talent buyer for Los Angeles-based Universal
Concerts. ``Then you have LeAnn who's set some sales records and
Shania is going through the ceiling. Faith is the next big thing.
She seems to have set up her career perfectly, coming along slowly
with no overnight success, which gives you staying power.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the pop-oriented Twain, the first ``country'' act seen on
MTV, Hill clearly reaches beyond the ``Stand By Your Man''
mentality once imposed upon Nashville's women. (She's married to
country star Tim McGraw.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel uncomfortable calling myself a star, but I consider
Shania a star,'' Hill says Tuesday, during a break in awards show
rehearsals Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shania puts out great albums, has a great image, great videos,
is a bit edgy, is selling out arenas and appeals to a wide
audience,'' says Hill, who's nominated for Female Vocalist of the
year, among other awards. Then, laughing, she admits, ``(I) always
think about it (reaching the same level of success as Twain). I'm
not to that place yet, but I hope to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The 32nd Annual Country Music Association Awards
</P>
<P>
   8 EDT, tonight on CBS, live from Nashville's Grand Ole Opry.
</P>
<P>
   -- Host: Vince Gill.
</P>
<P>
   -- Top nominees: George Strait (5), Garth Brooks, Faith Hill,
Patty Loveless, Tim McGraw (4 each), Brooks &AMP; Dunn, Martina
McBride, Steve Wariner (3 each).
</P>
<P>
   -- The big deal: An all-out producton number with Shania Twain
singing her new single, ``Honey, I'm Home,'' as more than 200
cheerleaders race from the lobby to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   -- Performers include: Garth Brooks, Brooks &AMP; Dunn, Dixie
Chicks, Faith Hill, Alan Jackson, Patty Loveless, Reba McEntire,
Tim McGraw, LeAnn Rimes, George Strait, Pam Tillis, Travis Tritt,
Shania Twain, the Wilkinsons, Mark Wills, Wynonna, Trisha Yearwood.
</P>
<P>
   -- Hall of Fame inductees: George Morgan, Elvis Presley, Tammy
Wynette, E.W. ``Bud'' Wendell.

 &HT;    CNN's 'Superwoman'
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_Almost 30 years ago, a very young Jeff Greenfield
strenuously warned a very young Pat Mitchell not to go into
television. It would, he said, ruin her life.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1969, and Mitchell and Greenfield were working on John
Lindsay's New York City mayoral campaign. Greenfield, now a senior
analyst at CNN, looks back and laughs at how wrong his advice was.
Pat Mitchell, 55, is now president of CNN Productions and Time Inc.
Television, one of the most powerful and respected women in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Her profile reaches an apex Sunday with the debut of ``Cold
War,'' the colossal 24-hour documentary that Ted Turner envisioned,
then turned over to Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Television didn't ruin Mitchell's life. It consumed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a schedule that would kill Superwoman,'' says Barbara
Pyle, CNN's globe-hopping CNN documentary maker. ``She literally
lives on the red-eye.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I call her 'Bumper to Bumper,','' says Scott Seydel, the
Atlanta businessman she's been dating for three-plus years. ``Any
time she's got any space to sign up for something that looks
interesting, she will.'' She stood Seydel up on their first date,
when a last-minute schedule change sent her back to Hartsfield
International Airport, her home away from home.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, they're underplaying Mitchell's over-scheduling.
Last month, she flew to Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, on four
hours' notice for ``NewsStand: CNN and Entertainment Weekly,'' the
newsmagazine she's in charge of. Glenn Close and Marisa Tomei were
doing a play there, and CNN couldn't find a last-minute
correspondent. So the network tapped Mitchell, who started out on
the air rather than in the executive suite (she used to sub for
Jane Pauley on ``Today'' in the late '80s). She also went to
Havana, Cuba, to tape a special on Fidel Castro that aired Sept.
13.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the promotional trips for ``Cold War'' and other
documentaries, business meetings at Time Warner in New York, the
charity boards such as Mikhail Gorbachev's international
environmental group Green Cross and the mentoring group Girls Inc.,
the Sundance Institute (she calls Robert Redford ``Bob,'' as all
his friends do).
</P>
<P>
   At least she's stopped flying to London every other week,
something she did for three years while ``Cold War'' was being
assembled there by executive producer Jeremy Isaacs (``The World at
War'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere in all that, I try to find a life,'' Mitchell says.
``My family describes me as a blur.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, she'll be in her office in the CNN Center a mere six
days.
</P>
<P>
   The office wall behind her desk is dominated by a huge movie
poster for ``Woman to Woman,'' a 1929 melodrama and also the title
of Mitchell's early-'80s syndicated talk show, a precursor of ``The
Oprah Winfrey Show.'' Orbiting the poster are photos of Mitchell
with Gorbachev, Castro, Hillary Clinton, on safari in Africa _ the
last a working vacation, as nearly all of Mitchell's vacations are,
with the exception of occasional fly-fishing or mountain hiking
getaways with Seydel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to think I'm a workaholic, but I probably fit a
lot of the descriptions,'' Mitchell says. ``I have the balance
issues that almost everyone has with a job like this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if she fits the technical definition (of a
workaholic), but she's probably pushing the envelope,'' says her
son, Mark, 33, a CNN producer. ``But she enjoys her work. I think
there's a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the rest of Mitchell's office is filled with Native
American art, which Mitchell started collecting as an undergraduate
at the University of Georgia in the early '60s. She had already
found herself drawn to it when she was told that her
great-grandmother was a Creek Cherokee who had passed as white.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell caught her travel bug early in life, as an Army brat.
``I went to three schools in the third grade,'' she says. ``I had
to adapt pretty early. I always had the wrong accent and I'd have
to start all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, her family settled in Swainsboro, Georgia, and
Mitchell went on to UGA on a drama scholarship. A young marriage,
son Mark, a divorce, a master's degree in English and an
entry-level job with Look magazine right before it went out of
business, all led up to the Lindsay campaign, where she met
Greenfield, started producing TV ads, and got an offer to produce a
New York show called ``First Person.'' She took it despite
Greenfield's misgivings and has worked in television ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell got into television at exactly the right time, the
early '70s. Women were finally being ``allowed'' to be more than
weathergirls, and she reveled in the new atmosphere. In 1974,
WBZ-TV in Boston turned the station over for a day to Mitchell and
a few female co-workers for live interviews with Gloria Steinem,
Betty Friedan and Helen Reddy on ``Yes We Can Day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Among women our age (50s), she's one of those who had to break
the ground,'' Pyle says.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, Mitchell bounced between on-air interviewer on
``Today'' and ``Woman to Woman'' to behind-the-scenes producer.
``When I was a kid,'' says her son Mark, ``I always secretly hoped
she would be Barbara Walters, some famous interviewer.''
</P>
<P>
   But she was drawn more to making documentaries on issues that TV
didn't pay enough attention to: child labor laws, infant mortality,
female peace activists.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, as an independent producer trying to raise funds for a
project titled ``A Century of Women,'' she was hired, unexpectedly,
to head TBS Productions, Turner's documentary unit. Jane Fonda, an
old acquaintence from California, was among those who urged her to
take the desk job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the reputation of being Ted's pet, his philanthropy,''
Mitchell says. ``We had value to Ted, but I wanted us to have value
as a business.''
</P>
<P>
   She set about balancing the do-good documentaries Turner loves _
on environmental concerns, Native Americans _ with the bottom line,
turning the documentary unit from a money-loser to a money-maker.
Her job titles, power and influence increased as TBS Productions
morphed into CNN Productions in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   So here she sits today, with ``one of the best jobs in
television,'' more than 2 million frequent flyer miles on Delta
alone, an ongoing serious relationship with Seydel, a house on the
border between Virginia-Highland and Morningside with a backyard
pool she only got into four times over the summer because of her
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wears more hats than Bartholomew Cubbins,'' says Seydel,
referring to an old Dr. Seuss book, ``The 500 Hats of Bartholomew
Cubbins.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way she is. But instead of taking them off, she's
piling them all on top of each other.''

 &HT;    Fall for Hilton Head
 &HT;    By Nick Tate
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILTON HEAD, S.C._There is something about a fall beach vacation
that feels a little like rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Wading into the surf long after most regular folks have locked
away their sandals and buckled back into jobs. Playing tennis at
the precise hour most parents are picking up the kids from the bus
stop. Sipping a cool drink at a sunset-backlit cafe and
contemplating an obscenely late dinner, not a care in the world
about homework or school lunches or the morning commute.
</P>
<P>
   Few places celebrate this off-season spirit as well as Hilton
Head, S.C. Anyone within a day's drive knows the best time to hit
this Lowcountry haven is the fall _ just before warmer temperatures
head south for the winter and after hotels and attractions drop
their high-season rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Labor Day, it's real low-key here,'' says Niveen Corish,
a 33-year-old Georgian who makes frequent weekend jaunts to the
family's Sea Pines Plantation condo with husband John and
7-year-old son Trevor. ``Crowds thin out and it's much more
relaxed. Even when we go to the beach it's a different experience.
There are more families with small children, not as many teenagers
and no crowds.''
</P>
<P>
   Marti Fulton, who grew up on Hilton Head and now lives in
Alpharetta, Georgia says that with her son, Jordan, 8, in school,
it's hard for her and her husband, Steven, to break away for a
quick retreat. But the rewards are worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were there on Thanksgiving two years ago and it was 75
degrees,'' said Fulton, 42, a marketing consultant with the
Communigraphix Studio of Alpharetta. ``The air has that good crisp
feel, and it's good beach weather because it's not oppressively hot
and the water stays warm. Plus it's easy to get (tennis) court time
and into restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   To help you plan an escape, here's a list of Hilton Head best
bets for fall, which begins today.
</P>
<P>
   A shore thing
</P>
<P>
   Hilton Head's best feature may be the 12 miles of sugar-white
beaches that skirt the shoe-shaped island. At South Carolina's
southernmost tip, the semitropical barrier island's shoreline is
warmed year-round by the Gulf Stream. Average temperatures remain
in the 70s well into November, with October's average a
beach-friendly 77 degrees and the Atlantic a comfortable 75.
</P>
<P>
   Some hotels and resorts fold the cost of beach access and
parking into the bill. Two popular public beaches with restrooms
and other amenities are Folly Field Beach off Matthews Drive,
mid-island on the coast, and the expansive Coligny Beach, at the
southern end of the island off North Forest Road.
</P>
<P>
   The play's the thing
</P>
<P>
   With more public golf courses than even a fanatic could sample
in a month's time (40-plus) the island is a duffer's paradise. Most
courses are open year-round with holes bordering the ocean, winding
around coastal lagoons or through woodlands. The Harbour Town Golf
Links at Sea Pines, site of the MCI Classic-Heritage of Golf
Tournament on the PGA tour, is well-known for its 18th hole
overlooking Calibogue Sound and the island's lighthouse
(843-842-8484). The Palmetto Dunes resort, mid-island, also
features a number of award-winning courses named after their
designers: Arthur Hills, George Fazio and Robert Trent Jones
(843-785-1138).
</P>
<P>
   In addition, miniature golf courses dot the island. Legendary
Golf (900 William Hilton Parkway, 843-686-3399) offers two 18-hole
mini courses _ one for kids and a second for serious players
looking to work on their short game while entertaining the family.
``We get the guys who walk in right off the golf course with
vendettas, looking to settle the score with their buddies here,''
says manager Robert Brown. ``This isn't just a place for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Legendary Golf is open daily: $6.50, nine holes; $8.50, 18
($4.50 for kids under 9). Other mini courses: Island Putt &AMP; Drive
(U.S. 278 at Folly Field Road, 843-842-9990) and Main Street Golf &AMP;
Games (4101 Main Street, 843-689-3866).
</P>
<P>
   Harbour Town
</P>
<P>
   There's no better way to get into the vacation spirit than a
visit to this charming waterfront square anchoring Sea Pines
Plantation at the island's southern tip. Hard by a marina and
steepled at one end by a candy-striped lighthouse, Harbour Town is
a quaint collection of boutiques, galleries and cafes. Take in the
night air on a wooden rocking chair on one of the open-air public
porches, or treat yourself to a cool drink _ and the kids to
homemade ice cream _ under the center's Liberty Tree.
</P>
<P>
   You can also give the kids a workout at a new playground at the
square, or lead them up winding stairs of the Harbour Town
lighthouse, which affords a commanding view from the upper deck.
There's a variety of family concerts and activities, including an
occasional performance by singer-songwriter Gregg Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Harbour Town also features many high-end antiques and home decor
shops, but hard-core shoppers may also want to visit the Hilton
Head Factory Stores (U.S. 278), featuring more than 75 outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Come sail away
</P>
<P>
   Interested in natural history? Try a pleasure sail or a dolphin
cruise. Sonny Compher has been leading 90-minute eco-tours for 14
years on large and small boats, departing from Broad Creek Marina
($12 for adults; $9 for kids, 843-681-2522).
</P>
<P>
   A combination tour guide and environmental educator, Compher
likes to salt his cruises with tales of island history, while
pointing out the occasional bottle-nose dolphin, manatee, gator or
waterfront celebrity villa. The boats are covered, so rain isn't a
problem. ``September and October are great times to get out on the
water,'' says Compher, 58, whose tours conclude with an examination
of a crab net he keeps dockside _ usually teeming with shrimp,
crabs, even a small shark now and then. You can also choose among
dozens of other tours, on yachts, large boats, even kayaks. A good
place to weigh the choices _ from eco-tours to deep-sea fishing
outfits to sunset yacht cruises _ is at the Hilton Head Island
Chamber of Commerce Welcome Center on U.S. 278, on the way into
town.
</P>
<P>
   Riding along
</P>
<P>
   Hilton Head has several stables that offer fine guided tours
with a mare's eye view of the island's natural beauty. Some have
special kids' packages and pony rides, allowing parents and young
environmentalists to venture into the woods year-round to check out
majestic moss-draped live oaks, pines, magnolias and palmettos. The
forests and nearby marshes are havens for deer, pelican, great blue
heron and more than 100 other bird species.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton Stables, at the Sea Pines Equestrian Center (190
Greenwood Drive) has more than 70 horses. The stables offer pony
rides ($5) for children 7 and older, riding lessons ($40) for ages
5 and up, and scenic 90-minute tours (adults: $30) through a
600-acre forest preserve. Information: 843-671-2586.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis everyone?
</P>
<P>
   With 300 courts, Hilton Head may have more tennis options per
square mile than any place in the nation. Sea Pines Racquet Club at
Harbour Town and Van Der Meer Tennis Center offer kids', women's
and juniors' programs through the fall and rent court space by the
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Court time at Sea Pines (843-363-4495), featuring 25 clay and
five hard-surface courts, is $16 per hour for walk-ons, and club
managers tailor lessons and clinics to families' needs. At Van Der
Meer (800-845-6138), court time is $15 per hour for walk-ons (hard
and clay outdoor courts) and one-hour private lessons for kids
start at $35. Van Der Meer also has four covered courts ($20 per
hour) for use in wet weather.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   -- Accommodations: Options range from expensive home, condo and
villa rentals (fetching thousands by the week) to hotel and motel
rooms that go for less than $100 per night. Sea Pines Plantation is
a good choice if you're seeking an all-in-one experience, with
beaches, pools, tennis, golf, restaurants, shopping and playgrounds
a short walk or bike ride away. Fall rates range from $200 per
night (down from $235 in summer) for a two-bedroom condo
overlooking the Harbour Town Yacht Basin (four-night minimum) to
$125 ($165 in summer) for a similar facility a 10-minute drive away
(800-732-7463).
</P>
<P>
   -- Eating out: The island has 200 restaurants of every stripe.
Our favorite was the Crazy Crab in Harbour Town (843-363-2722),
with its fine seafood at family-friendly prices. Crabby Nick's
(U.S. 278, 843-842-2425) is also a hit with families, with magic
shows between the under-$10 meals. Giusseppi's Pizza &AMP; Pasta
(Shelter Cove, 843-785-4144) serves up classic New York-style pies
and pitchers of beer at affordable prices.

 &HT;    Season Premire of ``Newsradio'' devoted entirely to Hartman
character
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the writing done for all the television shows premiering
this week, probably none was harder than the task assigned to Paul
Simms. After the murder of Phil Hartman by his wife in May, Simms,
the series creator, had to open this season of ``NewsRadio'' with a
farewell to Bill McNeal, Hartman's character.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman was more than just a cast member of ``NewsRadio''; he
was a mentor to the other players, most of whom were younger. So
it's fitting that rather than just write McNeal out with a few
lines of dialogue, the season premiere is devoted entirely to
McNeal's death and reactions to it.
</P>
<P>
   TV series have had to say hasty goodbyes before to actors who
have unexpectedly died, notably Michael Conrad (Sgt. Phil ``Let's
be careful out there'' Esterhaus on ``Hills Street Blues'') and
Nicholas Colasanto (Coach on ``Cheers''). But Hartman's death
merits an entire episode that is respectful without being maudlin,
and pretty funny given the topic.
</P>
<P>
   The season opens with the cast members returning from McNeal's
funeral; we're told he died of a heart attack. Instantly, the
employees of WNYX are ``reassuring'' news director Dave Nelson
(Dave Foley) about his boring, two-hour eulogy: ``It was totally,
uh, comprehensive.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a little bit of play off the idea of not speaking ill of
the dead, though McNeal, the station's news anchor, was a
self-centered, pompous control freak with a mean streak. It's what
made him funny within these sitcom walls; in real life, McNeal
would have been unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   And we're reminded toward the end of how unbearable he could be
when the staffers get hand-written notes from McNeal, each written
in advance with the instruction that it be delivered in the event
of his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Lisa,'' the one to newswriter Lisa Miller begins, ``I'm
sorry I was so obsessed with seeing you naked.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the Bill McNeal we loved to laugh at. He, and Hartman,
will be missed. Next week, Jon Lovitz joins the cast as a news
anchor who reportedly will be as obnoxious as McNeal was.
</P>
<P>
   In a bizarre coincidence, Hartman also had a guest-starring role
on last season's cliffhanger finale of ``3rd Rock From the Sun,''
which is resolved with the season premiere tonight (9 EDT on NBC).
His character had kidnapped Harry (French Stewart) and scenes from
that show will be seen in an opening montage. But the show then
moves off in a different direction so it was unnecessary to recast
Hartman's role.
</P>
<P>
   ``NewsRadio''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B

 &HT;    Will the title soon be ``Dharma, Greg, &AMP; baby''?
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're getting a baby. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' last season's break-out cute couple, come
roaring back tonight (8 o'clock EDT on ABC) without a hint of
sophomore slump. They're Lucy and Ricky for the '90s: she's zany
and unpredictable, he's the long-suffering straight man. When they
click, Jenna Elfman and Thomas Gibson are sexy, sweet and just plan
irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, they have a secret weapon: their in-laws. Her folks, Abby
(Mimi Kennedy) and Larry (Alan Rachins) are unreconstructed
hippies, while his, Kitty (Susan Sullivan) and Edward (Mitchell
Ryan) are country-clubbing blue bloods. When the four of them get
together, it's like oil and Evian.
</P>
<P>
   What ``D&AMP;G'' doesn't appear to need so early in its promising
life is a baby, the plot device that pretty much clobbered ``Murphy
Brown.'' But that's what they appear to be getting in the season
opener, with ``appear'' being the operative word. Dharma befriends
a supermarket cashier who's nine months pregnant and abandoned by
the baby's father. In her impulsiveness, she decides she and Greg
need to adopt the baby. Only Greg, the rational half, doesn't think
so.
</P>
<P>
   There is much to-ing and fro-ing, leading to an ambiguous,
to-be-continued ending. But getting there is enormous fun.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   Headline goes here
</P>
<P>
   A new ``Law &AMP; Order'' season (its eighth), a new ``Law &AMP; Order''
character (its umpteenth). Some things never change. Abbie
Carmichael (Angie Harmon) is the striking, inventive, gloves-off,
hang-'em-all addition to the district attorney's office tonight (10
o'clock EDT, on NBC), leading the prosecution in an adopted baby's
death. But first she needs to lock horns with old-hand D.A. Jack
McCoy (Sam Waterson). ``I understand you're opening a children's
wing on death row,'' he barks when she arrests a 7-year-old for
murder. ``Thrilled to be working with you,'' she barks back.
This'll work. ``Law &AMP; Order'' knows what it does best and does it
week after week, year after year, and tonight is as reassuringly
twisty as ever.

HANK WILLIAMS' TOTAL CAREER IN A BOX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SHIRLEY JINKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hank Williams Sr. would have been 75 last week (Sept. 17), so of
course it's time for Mercury Nashville to make some serious cash in
commemoration.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Tuesday's release of ``The Complete Hank
Williams,'' the all-time, smash-mouth, hands-down, end-all, be-all
of Hank Sr. boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Other sets have focused on single aspects of Hank's career, such
as blues, singles, radio, etc., but the only thing lacking here
would be, say, a two-minute outtake tape of a coughing fit during
some recording session.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big, big box, and it's comprehensive. Really. And at a
suggested list price of $170, who would expect less?
</P>
<P>
   The 225 tracks, on 10 CDs, include 53 previously unissued ones.
All of the MGM and early Sterling Records sessions are here, plus
130 nonsession and radio/television performances.
</P>
<P>
   There are cuts from the earliest Montgomery demos, the later
Shreveport sessions, Armed Forces Radio shows, the Health and
Happiness shows, and a live one from Hank's European concert tour,
with many special gems included.
</P>
<P>
   An August 1952 Nashville demo recording of ``Kaw-Liga'' has two
false starts as Hank tries to get the future classic down the way
he wants it.
</P>
<P>
   Kitty Wells and Johnnie Wright join Hank on ``Dear Brother,'' an
unreleased 1948 demo recorded in Shreveport when all were on the
Louisiana Hayride.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest recording, a simulated radio performance from 1939
that was used to pitch the 17-year-old Hank to live radio
programmers, stands in stark contrast to his later works: ``Happy
Rovin' Cowboy'' would give rise to ``Weary Blues From Waitin' ''
and ``We're Getting Closer to the Grave Each Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Hank's spoken-word work was appealing without being ingratiating
or overly emotional. He had a gift for intimate conversation within
the confines of mass media. There are the ``Luke the Drifter''
recordings (''Be Careful of Stones That You Throw''), a radio
commercial for Hank's book ``How to Write Folk &AMP; Western Music to
Sell,'' and a two-minute radio apology to Washington, D.C., fans
for canceling a concert due to back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But the printed matter that accompanies the set becomes
ponderous. Two 150-page booklets are included, with 120 supposedly
rare photos, ads, posters, LP covers, charts and even handwritten
lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   How much is too much? Well, pictures of Hank's guy stuff
(fishing tackle, phonograph, guns) don't add a lot and have a
cheesy, holy-relic feel. And the telegram from Hank's mom to his
sister has been reprinted ad nauseam: ``Come at once Hank is
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   While Williams biographer Colin Escott's ``Notes on the Music''
is sometimes fascinating, especially the preface describing Hank's
era and the music industry as it was then, it is also long. The
quotes from modern-day stars are superfluous; who is going to say,
``actually, Hank Williams wasn't all that great''?
</P>
<P>
   Much simpler, and clearer, is a foldout time line of Hank's
life.
</P>
<P>
   A 2,500-word essay by Daniel Cooper is way, way over the top.
``His songs have proven vibrantly resistant to millennial
obsolescence,'' Cooper writes. In other words, they're timeless.
``... Williams, alone and in absentia, has had to absorb Americans'
need to localize psychic demolition. ...'' Huh?
</P>
<P>
   Part of Hank's greatness was that he was a much better writer
than either Escott, or Cooper, or this reviewer. Simple as it is,
``I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry'' never fails to demolish my psyche.

THE BEASTS OF ALASKA BEST SEEN FROM INTERIOR OF BUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENALI NATIONAL PARK, Alaska _ Half past 4 o'clock in the
morning is a disagreeable hour to begin a vacation day.
</P>
<P>
   But wild things start stirring early, and we had not come nearly
3,500 miles to lie in our beds while other folks were out
consorting with enormous fanged and horned brutes.
</P>
<P>
   So we stumbled erect and dragged on clothes. I fetched coffees
from the lodge's breakfast bar. And at the stroke of 6 we climbed
aboard a bus for an all-day excursion into this 6-million-acre park
and preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing the wildlife from a bus window may sound a bit effete,
but it minimizes vehicle traffic on the park's one access road.
What's more, there are creatures out here that _ unless you happen
to be a world-class sprinter _ are more prudently observed from a
machine than on foot.
</P>
<P>
   During our first week in other parts of the state, few beasts
except marine animals had shown themselves. But today, the
literature promised, would be different. And it was.
</P>
<P>
   Two things, especially, a traveler here hopes to see. One is a
grizzly bear. The other is Mt. McKinley, or Denali (``the high
one'') in the language of the native Athabascans _ at 20,320 feet
the tallest mountain in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Great mountains generate their own weather and often are
wreathed in clouds though the rest of the sky may be clear.
There've been only 20 days this summer, we're told, when the view
of McKinley wasn't all or partly obscured, and this day was no
exception.
</P>
<P>
   But with bears, said our driver-narrator, the chances were
better. There are between 200 and 300 grizzlies in the park. This
computes to about one bear every 38 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be making rest stops during the day,'' the driver said.
``From time to time, a bear will come through one of the rest
areas. If one approaches, get back on the bus in a quiet and
orderly way.''
</P>
<P>
   At the second stop, overlooking a broad valley, a bear did
appear, a solitary giant lumbering across the dry river bed just
below. You'd be astonished at how quietly, how orderly _ and how
(ital)fast(end ital) _ the bus seats filled up.
</P>
<P>
   And that was only the beginning. Before the outing ended, we'd
seen 494 square miles worth of grizzlies, no fewer than 13 of them.
A sow and her yearling cub came over a ridge and crossed just
behind us. The cub stopped to pick up an orange cone marking some
road repair. Then, pronouncing it unpalatable, he brushed it aside
and they ambled away.
</P>
<P>
   The richness of life there on the high tundra was amazing. My
notebook contains the tally.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the bears, no fewer than 19 caribou were seen, grazing
the wild meadows. And 34 white Dall sheep perched on grassy patches
among the severely up-slanted mountain faces.
</P>
<P>
   Also two cow moose with lugubrious snouts and no antlers; 14
willow ptarmigan adults, their plumage just starting to turn white,
with more scurring chicks than could be counted; one each of
Steller jays and black-billed magpies; two Arctic ground squirrels,
and one hoary marmot, clinging precariously to a gnarled branch
overhanging a sheer drop of hundreds of feet.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it was a fine day of creature watching. And the box
lunches were tasty.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, after turning back toward the lodge, the driver
announced he would suspend his commentary in order to give full
attention to the road.
</P>
<P>
   It's good that he did because on the worst part, rounding
Polychrome Mountain, our bus now was in the outer lane, next to the
precipice. My seat was on that side, and on tight turns sometimes I
could see no gravel road at all _ only yawning emptiness and
certain death.
</P>
<P>
   I experienced a religious conversion, however, and thus was
able, barely, to prevent myself from fainting.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   The above are notes from yesterday. This afternoon we boarded a
domed train car on the elegant Midnight Sun Express for the 7-hour
ride back to Anchorage, and the start of the next phase of this
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Though we're traveling independently, we seem to have fallen in
with some large tour group composed mainly of older folks.
Excluding our daughters in their 20s, we are _ I grieve to admit _
far gone in adulthood ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   But these were (ital)senior(end ital) seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Stimulating beverages were available, and if you think the fun
stops at 80 you are badly mistaken. By the time we neared
Anchorage, some of those people were in full throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be arriving at the terminal soon,'' the hostess on the
car announced over the loudspeaker. ``Be sure to collect all your
belongings, and please be careful on the stairs.''
</P>
<P>
   The stairway from the upper-level seating to the track-level
exit below was tricky, with tight turns.
</P>
<P>
   What the hostess meant to say, I'm sure, is that it would be a
shame for anyone to take a tumble with the trip so near its end.
</P>
<P>
   What she said instead _ no doubt an innocent slip _ was: ``We'd
hate for anyone to fall down the steps (ital)this late in life.(end
ital)''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody complained. There was no sign anyone even heard. The
folks behind us were calling for another round.

KFI PROMOTION A BELLRINGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; If you got a message at home from talk radio
KFI-AM (640) morning host Bill Handel, join the club.
</P>
<P>
   The station hit upon an unusual marketing scheme to publicize
Handel's daily 8 a.m. updates on President Clinton. About 200,000
area residents received a phone call from Handel.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Turner, KFI's marketing director, had heard of a company
that leaves mass messages on answering machines throughout the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, we had Bill record a personal message reminding people to
tune into his Clinton updates, and it got left on machines
throughout Los Angeles,'' Turner explained Tuesday. ``Bill's really
fired up about the Clinton situation. That's all he can talk
about.''
</P>
<P>
   In Handel's auto-dialed message, he introduces himself, saying,
``Please listen tomorrow morning at 8 on KFI-AM (640). Thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Handel said the response was ``pretty terrific. A lot of people
called complaining and screaming, of course. They don't call to say
they're happy with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner said this was the first time he had heard of such a
promotion being used in radio. The messages were left several days
last week and Monday and Tuesday of this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've even had people calling the station to return Handel's
calls, saying, `I got your message. Thanks for calling,' '' Turner
said. ``And a lot of people said they were going to save the
message.''
</P>
<P>
   FRIENDLY RIVALRY: They square off on the air, but competing talk
hosts Joe Crummey and Wayne Resnick share the spotlight tonight at
a West Hollywood club.
</P>
<P>
   KABC-AM's (790) Crummey and KFI's Resnick are longtime friends
and guitarists. They'll perform covers and original songs at 9 p.m.
at the Crooked Bar, below Coconut Teaszer (8121 Sunset Blvd., West
Hollywood).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like KFI and KABC are getting together,'' Crummey says.
</P>
<P>
   On the air, though, each host is promoting the event without
uttering the other's name, referring instead to a ``mystery
guest.''
</P>
<P>
   Crummey and Resnick, who met several years ago when both were
working at KFI, compete on their respective stations on Saturday
evenings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're wondering if people who flip back and forth have figured
it out,'' Crummey said. ``We don't want to mention each other on
the air, but we've remained buds over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Crummey said admission tonight is free ``if you mention either
Joe or Wayne at the door.''
</P>

 A group based on friendship  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILIAN MINCER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas City, Mo. _ It started with a Monday night tennis game.
The evenings always ended with dinner and discussions about work
and family.
</P>
<P>
   One thing led to another, and the women decided to create an
organization for business owners like themselves. While they
haven't ruled out including men, the Executive Exchange now has 14
female members.
</P>
<P>
   They are lawyers and architects, consultants and manufacturers,
married and single, in their 30s and their 50s, but all have
employees and are intentionally not in competing businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I really wanted and needed was my own advisory board,''
said Patricia Kane, managing principal of the Schuster Kane
Alliance Co., and one of the exchange's founding members. ``We're a
great resource, and we've also become good friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in its third year, the members take turns arranging the
meetings, the food and the programs. They always follow the same
schedule: They begin with discussion about concerns they have at
work. The conversations range from when to implement pay raises and
how to encourage a difficult employee, to where to find a lawyer
and who knows a good nanny.
</P>
<P>
   The women then compile a list of questions for their guest, who
speaks during lunch. On a recent Friday, Judy Hohn, president and
owner of Serenity the Rejuvenating Day Spa, arranged for a speaker
on team building.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the meetings are never dull. Even with a
guest, they are sprinkled with laughter, questions and debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really good at challenging each other,'' said Kane.
``But confidentiality is one of the most important parts. What I
say here never leaves this room.''
</P>
<P>
   Tula Turner, president of Supreme Insulation, said she values
not only the camaraderie but the expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It validates you not only as a woman, but as a
businessperson,'' she said. ``You know that you're doing the right
things.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a time when these busy women can recharge their
batteries. They leave with answers and encouragement they often
can't get from employees, family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one place where people understand when I say
something,'' said Becky Blades, president of Blades and Associates,
a public relations firm. ``These people can all relate.''
</P>
<P>
   And the women also take the time for others. Each year they
collect money for a particular charity. This year it's Katy's
Place.
</P>
<P>
   Members have wondered if their model can be duplicated. I think
it can.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're at the top or starting out, we all need support,
friendship and nurturing. Let's follow their lead and duplicate a
good thing.

NEW MERCANTILE SUBSIDIARY IS BROKERING TAX CREDITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ Mercantile Bank has launched an innovative way of
trading Missouri tax credits that finances historic renovations and
community development projects.
</P>
<P>
   Mercantile has created a subsidiary, the Missouri Tax Credit
Clearinghouse, that buys tax credits from nonprofit organizations
and community redevelopment projects, then sells them to investors.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Governor project in Jefferson City, Mo., provides an
example of how the program works. The long-vacant hotel is being
restored as an office building.
</P>
<P>
   Through the clearinghouse, Mercantile is investing about $5
million in equity to pay for the renovations. The bank says it
doesn't need the tax credits associated with the investment and
will sell them next year to investors who can benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Other projects that are benefiting from the program are the
Northland Lofts, in which the historic Bella Hess building in North
Kansas City, Mo., is being converted to a 152-unit apartment
building, and the recently restored Elms Resort &AMP; Spa in Excelsior
Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Bader, president of Mercantile's Community Development
Corp., which specializes in community-related projects requiring
special financing, said many people wanted to invest in community
development projects but didn't understand how tax credits work or
which projects are a good match for them.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, she added, ``Some companies and nonprofits
have more tax credits than they can use. The Missouri Tax Credit
Clearinghouse brings them together.''

 &HT;    FOES CHARGE FEDERAL BUILDING WILL BE MORE COSTLY THAN ESTIMATED
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Opponents plan to charge Wednesday that a proposed
2.1 million-square-foot Patent and Trademark Office headquarters
will cost more than the $1.3 billion estimated by the government
and could become a federal extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen buildings come and go for 30 years, and the same
mistakes are made,'' said Pete Sepp, an official with the National
Taxpayers Union who is scheduled to testify at a Senate hearing on
the controversial project. ``With this one, we have a chance to
make changes before the concrete is poured.''
</P>
<P>
   The building that has been dubbed by some a ``Taj Mahal''
because of amenities such as a sculpture garden and landscaped park
planned for the still-undetermined suburban Virginia site.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters point to government studies concluding that a new
consolidated complex would save $72 million over the costs of
remaining in 18 older buildings scattered in Arlington, Va., across
the Potomac River from the capital.
</P>
<P>
   However, opponents were set to fire back at Wednesday's hearing
with a new private study by the Arthur Andersen consulting firm
projecting that, rather than a saving money, the move would
increase costs by $47.7 million. The review was ordered by Charles
E. Smith, the current landlord, which is fighting to keep the
Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) in his buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The new study concluded that government estimates had not
anticipated cost overruns or delays that occur with most federal
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the very least, the Andersen study means more analysis is
necessary,'' Sepp said. ``If this much money is at stake, what's
the harm in taking a few more months to see if the option PTO wants
to pursue is the best one?''
</P>
<P>
   The new Patent headquarters has already cleared most of the
obstacles in Congress, with backing from Sen. John Warner, R-Va.,
whose transportation and infrastructure Subcommittee has set
Wednesday's hearing. The government schedule calls for a contract
to be awarded by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   The project has been lampooned for lavish plans outlined in a
government study for furnishing the new headquarters. A list of
``budgeted furniture expenditures'' included $250 shower curtains,
$1,000 for a coat rack, $13,298 for a modular table, and $83 each
for waste baskets, not to mention cribs at $750 apiece and desks
costing as much as $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Patents and Trademarks Commissioner Bruce A. Lehman wrote Warner
recently that this list was a ``worst-case scenario'' and added,
``I personally assure you, we have never contemplated nor will we
spend $250 for a shower curtain, $750 for a crib, or $1,000 for a
coat rack.''
</P>
<P>
   His spokeswoman, Brigid(cq) Quinn said Tuesday that the cost for
the project would go no higher than $1.3 billion for rent plus $135
in relocation costs for the Patent office, whose work force is
expected to expand to 7,100 by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no unanticipated costs,'' she said, citing a
congressional ceiling for the project.
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics are not convinced. ``Virtually every project has
some kind of ceiling on it, and those ceilings are full of holes,''
said Sepp, noting that NASA had a ceiling for the space station but
keeps asking Congress for additional funding.
</P>
<P>
   Critics often compare the Patent building to the recently
completed Ronald Reagan Office Building, a massive 3
million-square-foot structure down the street from Capitol Hill
that was first estimated to cost under $400 million. It came in at
$800 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan building has a distinct advantage, however. It was
built to last 200 years and is owned by the government. The
proposed PTO building would cost $1.3 billion in rent over 20
years, and after that, the government would have only an expired
lease.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the decision to lease instead of own, Quinn said it
was because of the way the federal government budgets. ``We'd spend
perhaps $700 million to build it, and it would have to be taken
from one year's budget,'' she said. ``The determination was made
that a long-term lease was the way to go.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ When Indonesia's economy began collapsing
in August 1997, Rudy Ramli, president of Indonesia's fourth-largest
private bank, gathered his top lieutenants for a pep talk. ``If
everybody is going to die,'' Ramli said, ``we want to be the last
ones to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ramli's bank, Bank Bali, is clinging to life, though he
acknowledges that it is being strangled by bad loans and will need
an infusion of capital from outside investors to stay afloat. What
sounded alarmist in the summer of 1997 seems merely realistic in
the autumn of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Bank Bali's woes illustrate just how thoroughly the Asian
economic disaster has wrecked Indonesia's banking system. The vast
majority of the country's 240 banks are insolvent _ relics waiting
to be taken over by the state or simply shut down. Even the few
well-run banks, like Bali, have been infected by the disease,
trapped by suffocating debts, a collapsed currency and social
unrest that has led to panicky bank runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody trusts Indonesian banks,'' said Rizal Ramli, a
prominent economist, who is not related to Rudy Ramli. ``It is like
we have no banks at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, having suffered along with its customers, Bank Bali is
now pursuing what might be called a Depression-era strategy. It
stopped lending to corporate and retail customers last November.
Since then, the bank has done little other than husband its capital
and try to convince people that it is a safe place to keep money.
</P>
<P>
   The government, according to Rizal Ramli, has only made things
worse, deepening public mistrust by dragging its feet in
overhauling the banks. Although Jakarta has moved toward agreements
to bail out some of the largest bank owners, experts said
Indonesia's President, B.J. Habibie, would have to take far more
sweeping measures to clean up the entire sector. These include
closing numerous banks, forcing many others to merge and holding
bank managers accountable for what turned out to be reckless
lending.
</P>
<P>
   As countries from Russia to Japan grapple with debt-ridden
banks, Indonesia's halting efforts are instructive. While it is
true that a banking overhaul here has been delayed by bureaucratic
inertia and a reluctance to crack down on politically connected
bank owners, the bigger problem may be that more than a year after
its banks first ran into trouble, Indonesia still seems paralyzed
by the enormity of what has happened to its once-thriving financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics tell the tale: More than 60 percent of loans made by
Indonesia's banks are classified as nonperforming _ meaning they
will probably never be repaid. Of the more than 200 banks, experts
said that perhaps 10 would emerge from the crisis intact. The total
cost of bailing out the banks could reach $30 billion, an amount
equal to 15 percent of Indonesia's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta's financial district, bank headquarters still line
the streets, one-upping each other with gleaming facades and
sumptuous lobbies. But the towers stand mostly empty, as their
occupants have laid off employees or turned their operations over
to the government's bank revamping agency. No longer temples of
finance, the banks are now the tombstones of Indonesia's moribund
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has really had this experience before,'' said Piyush
Gupta, the country manager of Citibank in Jakarta. ``But having
talked to colleagues who worked in Brazil or Argentina, it gives
you the benefit of knowing what could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, the banks in those countries were reeling under
a similar combination of crushing debt and capital flight. By
liquidating hopeless banks, merging others and allowing foreign
banks to take over local ones, Latin America was able to climb out
of its debt crisis. While nothing will really make a difference
until economic growth resumes, Gupta said he believed a similar
prescription would eventually cure Indonesia's banks.
</P>
<P>
   At Bank Bali, Rudy Ramli is determined to do whatever is
necessary to survive. Bali's health is better than most of its
peers: Its ratio of non-performing loans is 48 percent, compared
with a national average of 65 to 70 percent. And its deposits have
actually grown in the last three months as people have switched
money out of other, more troubled institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bank Bali is one of our favorite banks in Indonesia,'' said
Roy Ramos, a banking analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. in Hong Kong.
``It is well managed and professionally run.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ramli acknowledged that if Bank Bali were forced to write
down all of its nonperforming loans, the bank would be wiped out.
Its deposits account for only 8 percent of its total assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just no way we can survive without foreign money,''
said Ramli, a wiry 40-year-old, whose jocular manner belies his
often dire pronouncements. ``We have to negotiate, no matter what
the price.''
</P>
<P>
   To attract the necessary capital, Ramli said he might be forced
to sell a controlling stake in his bank to a foreign investor. He
recently retained J.P. Morgan to explore potential deals. Before
the crisis, Bali had sold minority stakes to Sanwa, Japan's
fourth-largest bank, and UOB, a Singaporean bank.
</P>
<P>
   Relinquishing control would be a bitter pill for Ramli, the
eldest son of an ethnic Chinese family that has controlled Bank
Bali since his father bought the company in 1967. Indeed, foreign
takeovers of banks have become a touchy political issue throughout
the country, as it has become clear that there may be no other way
to rescue the ailing banking sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad thing, but we have to face it,'' said Firman
Soetjahja, the deputy president of Bank Bali. ``Of course, it would
be better if not all or even a majority of the banks became
foreign-owned. We'll see how much the government will step in to
help the surviving banks.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear the government can do much more to solve the
bank crisis without outside help. Indonesia's central bank has
already pumped more than $11 billion into cash-short banks. It has
taken over 31 banks _ freezing the operations of some and shutting
down others.

WARDROBE GOES WILD

By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Could Drew Carey replace Jerry Seinfeld as TV's
next trendsetter?
</P>
<P>
   Will women start copying the fashion stance of Mimi, now that
frizzy-haired Elaine is gone?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it's possible.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Carey was last seen as a lovable teddy bear kinda
guy with nerdy horn-rimmed glasses and a crew cut. But beginning
tonight he's a babe magnet.
</P>
<P>
   On a visit last week to the Burbank studios where ``The Drew
Carey Show'' is filmed, the Daily News discovered a new and
improved Drew who's as stylin' as a blue-collar guy from Cleveland
can get, from his surfer-blond hair and goatee to his sexy wire-rim
glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Carey says the new look reflects his TV character's interest in
joining a band, but he admits he does like the look and wants to
keep it.
</P>
<P>
   According to Carey, ``This season I go a little crazy. It's my
rock 'n' roll thing, so I grow a beard and get new glasses _
they're by Matsuda _ which I think I may wear a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he chuckles, pauses and says, ``But I can't look sexy in
every show. I'm really a Gap kind of guy on and off the set. And in
an upcoming episode, I have an affair with Mimi (played by Kathy
Kinney), and even then I don't wear anything special.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even a sexy bathrobe or bikini briefs?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I dropped my pants, all you'd see is green plaid Gap
boxers,'' he confides.
</P>
<P>
   Mimi, on the other hand, plans on major drama for her romantic
interlude. ``Maybe a hot pink negligee with marabou feathers and
leopard accents. You know, something sophisticated but colorful,''
says Kinney.
</P>
<P>
   Sophisticated? A character who wears circus tents trimmed with
sequins as office attire and applies eye shadow with a trowel?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand the character,'' says Kinney, who
rarely wears makeup and prefers the understated style of Armani in
real life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mimi thinks she's beautiful like Elizabeth Taylor ... or
better. She wears bright colors and sequins, attracting men like
the bee is attracted to brightly colored flowers ... so she'd never
wear brown, black or navy except on the bottom of her shoes,''
Kinney explains.
</P>
<P>
   In the studio's wardrobe room, it's clear which side of the
closet is Mimi's. ``Drew Carey'' costume designer Julie Rhine says
the Mimi character loves color, ruffles, huge earrings, animal
prints, fake fur and real feathers, so she and her design team are
constantly creating new dresses and matching coats or scarves. Even
her wide size-9 shoes are custom made, whether they're lime green
leather or red-white-and-blue sequins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dressing Mimi is the biggest challenge of my job. I have to
constantly come up with new ideas so the wardrobe doesn't get
stale, because I think viewers do remember her outfits,'' says
Rhine. She adds that Mimi's fashion tastes are evolving, and this
season you'll see more international-looking costumes, including
some designs out of Chinese silk, instead of last year's '70s
theme.
</P>
<P>
   Is there ever going to be a major Mimi make-over?
</P>
<P>
   ``No. If you put her in jeans and a T-shirt, she wouldn't stand
out ... she wouldn't be Mimi,'' says the designer. According to
Rhine, Mimi would be unhappy in boring suits or twinsets, but she
loves ruffles, baby doll dresses with tiny purses, swing-dress
silhouettes and bias-cut skirts, as well as long vests with billowy
pants.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto on the makeup. Makeup artist Robert Germain says Mimi's
trademark peacock blue eye shadow _ a blend of blues by M.A.C.,
Sebastian's Trucco, Make Up For Ever and La Femme _ will not be
washed off. However, he's seriously thinking of giving her a
different wig this season.
</P>
<P>
   Creating the Drew character is a lot easier. The sense of style
is very blue collar, exactly what Carey wears in real life. Even
the vintage ties the TV character wears to the office are modeled
after those the real Drew wore in his early stand-up comic days.
</P>
<P>
   The wardrobe is bought off the rack at local stores, says Rhine,
Places like Robinsons-May, Nordstrom, Macy's, Sears and the Gap
carry plenty of soft, muted colors in T-shirts, plaid shirts and
jackets, just the kind of look he likes.
</P>
<P>
   And the labels are what many men have in their own closet:
Cricketeer suits, Nordstrom's own label white dress shirts, Old
Navy sweat shirts, Wyn Spooner Hawaiian shirts and lumberjack plaid
shirts by Lemon &AMP; Soda. His shoes are from Thom McAnn in Cleveland,
and his wristwatch is often a Timex.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the new 'do and glasses, Carey will wear the same old
comfy clothes in upcoming episodes, including his boring brown
suits at the office and his his favorite Cleveland Indians jacket.
</P>
<P>
   But honestly, the man could use a little spiffing up.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Mimi, who has no trouble telling people their faults, will
let him know that his tie is tied too short and that black shoes
and socks don't go with everything.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe, just for laughs, she won't.

 JAKARTA, Indonesia: down others. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And it has placed another 32 banks under the scrutiny of an
oversight body, the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the government took over Bank Central Asia,
Indonesia's largest private bank, which is controlled by Liem Sioe
Liong, an ethnic Chinese financier with close ties to Indonesia's
former president, Suharto. Liem is the patriarch of the Salim
family, which runs Indonesia's largest business group.
</P>
<P>
   (On Tuesday, the government reached an agreement with the Salim
group to acquire big stakes in its companies in return for
Jakarta's financial support for the bank.)
</P>
<P>
   BCA suffered a calamitous bank run last May, after the fierce
riots and looting in Jakarta, which were largely directed at
Chinese-owned businesses and led to the resignation of Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the relatively small number of banks under state
control, experts said the government was struggling. It has
installed executives from state-owned banks to run these banks. But
as analysts point out, being a midlevel manager at a stable state
bank is rather different from running an insolvent private bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like taking a guy who lives outside Chicago and suddenly
putting him in the jungle in Zaire without a compass,'' said
Fabrice Desmarescaux, a principal at Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton in
Jakarta who advises banks on revamping.
</P>
<P>
   The government is also moving slowly on another part of its
overhaul: carving out the bad loans of banks and placing them in an
asset management company, where they can be sold to private
investors. Such a company would function similarly to Resolution
Trust Co. in the United States, which disposed of the bad loans
from the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Ramli said that the pace would quicken by the end of September,
when Indonesia is expected to pass a new banking law allowing the
government to begin selling the assets of banks to foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
   But even then, the progress will depend on the willingness of
outsiders to hunt for diamonds in the wreckage. Peter Woicke, the
chief executive of J.P. Morgan Asia Pacific in Singapore, said,
``At this moment, it is very difficult to find foreign investors
willing to invest in Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the major impediments is Indonesia's social unrest, which
seems to be escalating again as people blame Habibie for widespread
food shortages. Indonesia's economic output is expected to shrink
by as much as 20 percent this year, compared with 1997. And its
currency, the rupiah, has not been able to rise above the important
psychological level of 10,000 to one U.S. dollar. That makes it all
but impossible for companies to repay their loans.
</P>
<P>
   For Bank Bali, survival means playing a waiting game. In a new
promotion, Bank Bali is encouraging customers to deposit U.S.
dollars. At the end of the maturity period, the bank pledges to
return the notes, plus 12 percent interest. The lure is that the
dollars will not be converted into rupiah _ a practice that had
discouraged people from depositing dollars since the rupiah seemed
only to fall in value. Rather than take a loss from an eroding
exchange rate, people had begun stashing dollars under mattresses.
</P>
<P>
   Such sales pitches seem to be working. After declining sharply
in the first several months of the crisis, Bank Bali's rupiah
deposits increased 10 percent from June to August, while its dollar
deposits rose 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bank Bali has also been forthright in disclosing the extent of
its bad loans. Firman said that far from doing harm, the candor had
bolstered the bank's credibility among customers. Other Indonesian
banks _ particularly those, like BCA, with ties to sprawling
conglomerates _ were more opaque about their liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   For all of its strengths, Ramli acknowledged that Bank Bali's
future was as perilous as that of its country. Another eruption of
mob violence could set off another round of bank runs _ this time,
hitting Bank Bali. It could also drive away investors who are just
starting to think again about Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   As an ethnic Chinese businessman, Ramli has more than financial
worries. After the riots in May, he spirited his family to
Singapore and then to Bali for three weeks to protect them from
anti-Chinese persecution. Now, Ramli said, he dreaded a new
outbreak of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Ramli said he did not feel hopeless. ``Indonesia will
always need banks,'' he said with a wry laugh. ``Indonesia may
disappear from the world scene. But as long as there are people
here, they'll need rupiah.''

that they're, well ... old.
<P>
   While modernization is not always an improvement, one has to
admire the courage of an unidentified first-grade teacher who asked
her students to rewrite the second half of the following well-known
proverbs:
</P>
<P>
   As You Shall Make Your Bed, So Shall You ... Mess It Up
</P>
<P>
   Undeniably true, and a possible explanation as to why
first-graders are so reluctant to make their beds in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Better To Be Safe Than ... To Punch A Fifth Grader
</P>
<P>
   Also undeniably true. Better to hire a sixth-grader to do it for
you.
</P>
<P>
   Strike While The ... Bug Is Close
</P>
<P>
   The heel of a shoe would probably suffice for all except Florida
bugs, which require something heavier, like an anvil.
</P>
<P>
   You Can Lead A Horse To Water But ... How?
</P>
<P>
   Good question. But a better question might be, Why? Given the
temperamental nature of horses, it's probably best to let them find
water on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Don't Bite The Hand That ... Looks Dirty
</P>
<P>
   Nor the foot, knee, elbow or head, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   No News Is ... Impossible
</P>
<P>
   Brother, isn't that the truth. In fact, the problem with the
news nowadays is that the impossible has become commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   You Can't Teach An Old Dog ... New Math
</P>
<P>
   Nor would it be wise to try, in my opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Love All, Trust ... Me
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's epitaph, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   The Pen Is Mightier Than The ... Pigs
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about this one, especially if the pigs have been
elected to high office. Time will tell, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   An Idle Mind Is ... The Best Way To Relax
</P>
<P>
   I can certainly vouch for that, but we'd probably better not let
this get around as we already have too many idle minds as it is.
</P>
<P>
   It's Always Darkest Before ... Daylight Savings Time
</P>
<P>
   The best argument I've heard yet for year-'round Daylight
Savings Time.
</P>
<P>
   A Miss Is As Good As A ... Mr.
</P>
<P>
   Feminism knows no age limits, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   Never Underestimate The Power Of ... Termites
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that this first-grader's dad owns a pest control
company? Either that or the kid has a great future in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   A Penny Saved Is ... Not Much
</P>
<P>
   But save 1,000 pennies and ... well, you still don't have much.
</P>
<P>
   Laugh And The Whole World Laughs With You, Cry And ... You Have
To Blow Your Nose
</P>
<P>
   Which could cause the world to laugh even harder. Either way,
it's a good argument for carrying a handkerchief with you at all
times.
</P>
<P>
   Where There's Smoke, There's ... Pollution
</P>
<P>
   Is the EPA aware of this?
</P>
<P>
   Children Should Be Seen And Not ... Spanked Or Grounded
</P>
<P>
   Or deprived of sugary cereals, electronic video games, Nike
footwear and designer jeans.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   And sometimes not even that.

</P>
<P>
   Yeah, probably, but think about the poor dogs.

   Hey, Uncle Bob's no bright light, either.

<P>
   Bill Clinton says he knew Monica Lewinsky eventually would talk
about their relationship. Who'd know better that she had loose
lips?
</P>
<P>
   In his taped grand jury testimony, Mr. Clinton sipped lots of
pop and water. With his raspy voice, he probably was trying to
avoid any oral hex.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Clinton video tape, Congress released 3,183
pages of evidence. That works out to about one for each question
about sex the president was asked in his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   On the grand jury tape, Mr. Clinton says he had ``inappropriate
intimate contact'' with Monica Lewinsky. So remember: s-e-x is now
spelled i-i-c.
</P>
<P>
   What odd balance to this story. The president first gets well
known for his saxophone but later gets famous for his sexophone.
</P>
<P>
   While Mr. Clinton's grand jury testimony was first being
televised, he was giving a speech to the U.N. Which, we bet, was
full of diplomats wishing they were watching the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts thought Mr. Clinton came off looking better than
expected in the taped testimony. If nothing else, he'll at least
get a post-presidential talk show offer out of this.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other evidence released in the Lewinsky case was a
photo of the famous dress. We saw the picture and can confirm it
looks like a dress.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton said in his testimony that he wouldn't go into
specifics about his Lewinsky relationship ``in an effort to
preserve the dignity of the office I hold.'' Too late.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken's record of consecutive games played is remarkable,
but Aunt Ilse from Oelwein says she'd be (ital)really(end-ital)
impressed if he did it again.

 &HT;    FEMA PREPARES FOR POSSIBLE GEORGES STRIKE IN FLORIDA
 &HT;    w/HURRICANE-GEORGES
 &HT;    BY NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Spurred by weather predictions that Hurricane
Georges could descend upon Florida by Friday, Federal Emergency
Management Agency officials planned to mobilize experts Wednesday
to assess the region's needs in the event of a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   With relief efforts already under way for the hurricane-ravaged
Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands, FEMA officials will open a regional
operations center in Atlanta on Wednesday to help them remain in
contact with Florida officials.
</P>
<P>
   The center will allow Florida officials to keep FEMA
representatives updated on what resources might be needed in the
event of a disaster, said agency spokesman Marvin Davis. Such
resources would include energy, transportation, medical and
search-and-rescue needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is anything they need, we will get it to them,''
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Davis said, the agency is cautious about sending in too
much aid too soon. Pointing out the unpredictable nature of
hurricanes, he said FEMA is waiting for a hurricane watch to be
issued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything could happen,'' Davis said. ``It could make a turn
and hit Carolina for all we know. We don't want to put all our
resources in southern Florida and have it not hit.''
</P>
<P>
   When preparing Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands for Georges,
FEMA helped supply water, plastic sheeting, tarps, blankets, cots,
tents and other emergency materials. The agency also set up more
than 300 government shelters and deployed several medical and
search-and-rescue teams before the hurricane struck.
</P>
<P>
   Such a massive effort will likely not be needed in Florida
because, unlike Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, many of the
necessary resources are already in place, Davis said.

 &HT;     A PROVERB SAVED ... IS A PROVERB REWRITTEN  
 By DAVID GRIMES   Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   c.1998 N.Y.
<TEXT>
Times News Service &LR;  &QC;  If there is one fault with old sayings, it's
that they're, well ... old.
<P>
   While modernization is not always an improvement, one has to
admire the courage of an unidentified first-grade teacher who asked
her students to rewrite the second half of the following well-known
proverbs:
</P>
<P>
   As You Shall Make Your Bed, So Shall You ... Mess It Up
</P>
<P>
   Undeniably true, and a possible explanation as to why
first-graders are so reluctant to make their beds in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Better To Be Safe Than ... To Punch A Fifth Grader
</P>
<P>
   Also undeniably true. Better to hire a sixth-grader to do it for
you.
</P>
<P>
   Strike While The ... Bug Is Close
</P>
<P>
   The heel of a shoe would probably suffice for all except Florida
bugs, which require something heavier, like an anvil.
</P>
<P>
   You Can Lead A Horse To Water But ... How?
</P>
<P>
   Good question. But a better question might be, Why? Given the
temperamental nature of horses, it's probably best to let them find
water on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Don't Bite The Hand That ... Looks Dirty
</P>
<P>
   Nor the foot, knee, elbow or head, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   No News Is ... Impossible
</P>
<P>
   Brother, isn't that the truth. In fact, the problem with the
news nowadays is that the impossible has become commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   You Can't Teach An Old Dog ... New Math
</P>
<P>
   Nor would it be wise to try, in my opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Love All, Trust ... Me
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's epitaph, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   The Pen Is Mightier Than The ... Pigs
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about this one, especially if the pigs have been
elected to high office. Time will tell, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   An Idle Mind Is ... The Best Way To Relax
</P>
<P>
   I can certainly vouch for that, but we'd probably better not let
this get around as we already have too many idle minds as it is.
</P>
<P>
   It's Always Darkest Before ... Daylight Savings Time
</P>
<P>
   The best argument I've heard yet for year-'round Daylight
Savings Time.
</P>
<P>
   A Miss Is As Good As A ... Mr.
</P>
<P>
   Feminism knows no age limits, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   Never Underestimate The Power Of ... Termites
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that this first-grader's dad owns a pest control
company? Either that or the kid has a great future in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   A Penny Saved Is ... Not Much
</P>
<P>
   But save 1,000 pennies and ... well, you still don't have much.
</P>
<P>
   Laugh And The Whole World Laughs With You, Cry And ... You Have
To Blow Your Nose
</P>
<P>
   Which could cause the world to laugh even harder. Either way,
it's a good argument for carrying a handkerchief with you at all
times.
</P>
<P>
   Where There's Smoke, There's ... Pollution
</P>
<P>
   Is the EPA aware of this?
</P>
<P>
   Children Should Be Seen And Not ... Spanked Or Grounded
</P>
<P>
   Or deprived of sugary cereals, electronic video games, Nike
footwear and designer jeans.
</P>
<P>
   You Get Out Of Something What You ... See Pictured On The Box
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes not even that.
</P>
<P>
   If You Lie Down With The Dogs, You'll ... Stink In The Morning
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, probably, but think about the poor dogs.
</P>
<P>
   There Is No Fool Like ... Aunt Eddie
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Uncle Bob's no bright light, either.
</P>
<P>
   When The Blind Leadeth The Blind ... Get Out Of The Way
</P>
<P>
   The most astute commentary on American politics I have read in a
long time.

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton says he knew Monica Lewinsky eventually would talk
about their relationship. Who'd know better that she had loose
lips?
</P>
<P>
   In his taped grand jury testimony, Mr. Clinton sipped lots of
pop and water. With his raspy voice, he probably was trying to
avoid any oral hex.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Clinton video tape, Congress released 3,183
pages of evidence. That works out to about one for each question
about sex the president was asked in his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   On the grand jury tape, Mr. Clinton says he had ``inappropriate
intimate contact'' with Monica Lewinsky. So remember: s-e-x is now
spelled i-i-c.
</P>
<P>
   What odd balance to this story. The president first gets well
known for his saxophone but later gets famous for his sexophone.
</P>
<P>
   While Mr. Clinton's grand jury testimony was first being
televised, he was giving a speech to the U.N. Which, we bet, was
full of diplomats wishing they were watching the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts thought Mr. Clinton came off looking better than
expected in the taped testimony. If nothing else, he'll at least
get a post-presidential talk show offer out of this.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other evidence released in the Lewinsky case was a
photo of the famous dress. We saw the picture and can confirm it
looks like a dress.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton said in his testimony that he wouldn't go into
specifics about his Lewinsky relationship ``in an effort to
preserve the dignity of the office I hold.'' Too late.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken's record of consecutive games played is remarkable,
but Aunt Ilse from Oelwein says she'd be (ital)really(end-ital)
impressed if he did it again.

 &HT;    FEMA PREPARES FOR POSSIBLE GEORGES STRIKE IN FLORIDA
 &HT;    w/HURRICANE-GEORGES
 &HT;    BY NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Spurred by weather predictions that Hurricane
Georges could descend upon Florida by Friday, Federal Emergency
Management Agency officials planned to mobilize experts Wednesday
to assess the region's needs in the event of a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   With relief efforts already under way for the hurricane-ravaged
Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands, FEMA officials will open a regional
operations center in Atlanta on Wednesday to help them remain in
contact with Florida officials.
</P>
<P>
   The center will allow Florida officials to keep FEMA
representatives updated on what resources might be needed in the
event of a disaster, said agency spokesman Marvin Davis. Such
resources would include energy, transportation, medical and
search-and-rescue needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is anything they need, we will get it to them,''
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Davis said, the agency is cautious about sending in too
much aid too soon. Pointing out the unpredictable nature of
hurricanes, he said FEMA is waiting for a hurricane watch to be
issued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything could happen,'' Davis said. ``It could make a turn
and hit Carolina for all we know. We don't want to put all our
resources in southern Florida and have it not hit.''
</P>
<P>
   When preparing Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands for Georges,
FEMA helped supply water, plastic sheeting, tarps, blankets, cots,
tents and other emergency materials. The agency also set up more
than 300 government shelters and deployed several medical and
search-and-rescue teams before the hurricane struck.
</P>
<P>
   Such a massive effort will likely not be needed in Florida
because, unlike Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, many of the
necessary resources are already in place, Davis said.

INTEL TO CUT 675 JOBS AT BAY STATE PLANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A nationwide wave of job cuts at computer chip giant Intel Corp.
has finally reached the Bay State.
</P>
<P>
   About 675 manufacturing workers at Intel's Hudson, Mass.
chip-making plant will be laid off &UR;  &LR;  over the next year, but Intel
vows there will be no reduction in output at the plant, which
manufactures the advanced Alpha microprocessor chip and several
other product lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson plant employs 1,600 workers. Intel purchased the
facility from Digital Equipment Corp. for $700 million last year,
as partial settlement of a patent dispute between the two
companies. The settlement required Intel to manufacture Alpha chips
for Digital at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Digital has since been acquired by Houston-based Compaq Computer
Corp., but the Alpha deal is still in force. In fact, Compaq said
last week that it will begin using Alpha chips to power its
high-end Himalaya computer systems used by banks and
telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't change in any way our commitment to manufacture
Alpha under the agreement with Digital,'' said Intel spokesman Bill
Calder. ``What has changed is we think we can operate this
manufacturing facility more efficiently.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel has been on a nationwide efficiency drive this year, as it
contends with dramatic decreases in computer prices and competition
from chip making upstarts like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and
Cyrix Inc. Computer makers are tapping a huge market for
ultralow-priced machines, and chips from AMD and Cyrix, with their
lower prices, are beginning to steal business from Intel's
premium-priced Pentium II line.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has responded by bringing out its own low-cost line of
chips called Celeron, and also by launching companywide efforts to
reduce costs, so the company can charge less for Pentium II chips
while still making a profit.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Intel vowed to cut its worldwide headcount of 65,000
by 3,000 workers this year, mostly by attrition. Even before then,
in January, Intel laid off about 1,100 workers at a chip plant in
Arizona. And in May, the company cut 600 more jobs by shutting a
plant in Washington state that made private-label computers for
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   At the Hudson plant, Intel is cutting back on employees who
actually make the chips _ process engineers, technicians, and
testers, among others. Product development and marketing workers
won't be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Like most chip plants, the Hudson facility runs 24 hours a day
on three shifts. The affected workers got the bad news Tuesday as
they reported for their shifts, but the actual layoffs won't begin
until January, with a second wave scheduled for next fall. Laid-off
workers will receive four months' pay, plus 1.25 weeks of pay for
each year of service with either Intel or Digital.
</P>
<P>
   To Argeo R. Cellucci Jr., chairman of Hudson's Economic
Development Commission and the father of Acting Governor Paul
Cellucci, the news came as a disappointment, but not a surprise.
``We don't like what happened but we knew this when Digital sold
out,'' said Cellucci. Digital's management had overstaffed the
plant, Cellucci said, and layoffs were inevitable under the new
owners.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci predicted the lost jobs would have little impact on
the region's economy, and that most workers would quickly find
other jobs in any case.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Blazar, executive assistant of the city of Hudson, said the
layoffs would mean lower sales for some businesses in the city. But
he added that the that as long as the plant continues operating &UR;  &LR; 
and contributes to the city's tax base, the overall effect of the
layoffs will be slight.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the Alpha processor, other products made at the
Hudson plant include StrongARM, a low-power processor chip designed
for portable electronic devices, and chips used in computer
networking devices.

people had realized. (Dart, Cox News Service).
</P>

   CLINTON-CANDIDATES _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton may or may
not escape impeachment, but the path to high office has been
drastically changed by his ordeal. Now that a mechanism exists to
extract politicians' secrets via private lawsuits, future
candidates for the White House _ and perhaps lower offices _ may
think twice before running. The result may be a process that places
a higher premium on purity than competence. (Shepard, Cox News
Service).

   CLINTON-CHARACTER _ WASHINGTON _ Using psychological theories
that attempt to describe how such traits as integrity, ambition,
the ability to relate to other people develop to make up a person's
character, a New York psychoanalyst and political scientist
concludes that as a child President Clinton was alternately adored
and neglected by his mother and gradually taught that rules and
restrictions don't matter _ at least not for him. Stanley Renshon,
in the book, ``High Hopes, the Clinton Presidency and the Politics
of Ambition,'' attempts to set forth a theory by which voters can
systematically evaluate the character of candidates for president.

   LAWPROFS-CLINTON _ In the halls of academe, President Clinton's
performance before the Kenneth Starr grand jury rated less than an
A but better than an F. Experts in law and communications were
analyzing the president's responses to questions about his sex
life. Like much of the public, they came away with a mixed review
of the president's performance. (Keilman/Bennish, Dayton Daily
News) MOVED.

<P>
   MEDIA-CLINTON _ The media is taking a lashing from a large part
of the American public for its long-running and uncomfortably
detailed coverage of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. But newspapers,
TV networks and cable news stations have no choice but to call the
nation to an unwilling jury duty, according to media ethicists.

   HURRICANE-GEORGES _ MIAMI _ HHurricane Georges' 120 mph winds
knocked out power and forced residents into shelters in the densely
populated Dominican Republic today, after plowing through Puerto
Rico and leaving at least eight dead in the northeast Caribbean.
Georges' powerful thunderstorms Monday left all of Puerto Rico
without electricity and 80 percent of its people without water. The
storm spawned tornadoes as it slowly ripped through the island of 4
million people, turning trees into missiles, flipping small planes,
exploding car windows and forcing tens of thousands into shelters.
Many areas, including the islands of Culebra and Vieques, had yet
to be heard from. (Emling, Cox News Service).

   BUILDING-WASTE _ WASHINGTON _ The federal government is moving
toward contracting for a new Patent Office building that critics
have dubbed the ``Taj Mahal,'' complete with plans for $250 shower
curtains. What's more, after 20 years and at least $1.3 billion in
costs, the building won't belong to the government because it's
being leased. Sponsors of the project have already defeated an

   NIEMAN-SUIT _ ATLANTA _ A woman who frequently shopped at Nieman
Marcus and went there one day and tried on some lingerie in the

But she had not. The woman filed a federal civil rights lawsuit

   UNDERGROUND _ The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center
in Cincinnati will make its public debut this weekend with the
start of its civil rights lecture series and the first presentation

FIREFIGHTERS STRIKE FOR SAFE DELIVERY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Firefighters picketing for a new contract outside the
main station in Wellesley got a bonus they never expected Tuesday
morning when Peter Houde pulled into their driveway.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife's having a baby,'' the Wayland expectant father
yelled, as he jumped out of his Jeep. ``Do you have an ambulance?''
</P>
<P>
   In the back seat, Caroline Owen-Houde was in labor. &UR;  &LR; Already,
the top of the baby's head was protruding.
</P>
<P>
   The men broke out of their picket line and rushed to help. While
firefighters Mark Ritchey, Paul Delaney, and Lieutenant Joe Keough
tended to the mother, others alerted paramedics Gary Rogers and
Mike Doyle, who were stationed at the fire-house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will we make it to the hospital?'' the expectant father asked
anxiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' firefighters replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy smoke!'' said Houde, no pun intended.
</P>
<P>
   As Rogers checked on the mother, he became concerned. ``She was
almost too calm,'' he said. ``The baby's head was sticking out but
it didn't look like it was making any progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Worried that something might be wrong, they decided to transfer
the mother to a stretcher and head to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the jostling helped her along, because she delivered
right there on the stretcher in the ambulance'' before it even
pulled out of the driveway, Ritchey said.
</P>
<P>
   At Newton-Wellesley Hospital Tuesday afternoon, Christina
Elizabeth, 8 pounds, 5 ounces, and her mother were both doing well.
``I wanted a natural childbirth, but I didn't expect it to be quite
so natural!'' said Owen-Houde.
</P>
<P>
   Christina, the couple's first child and a real scene stealer,
had arrived on their eighth wedding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   For the firefighters, the delivery was ``a highlight of our
careers,'' Ritchey said. ``So often we deal with people who are
suffering after a fire. When you're able to bring a life into the
world like this, you feel really happy and proud.''
</P>
<P>
   And then the firefighters returned to their picket line.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: MURALS THAT EVOKE `CHAGALLIZATION' OF THEATER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN RUSSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Among the major works of 20th-century art, none have
traveled more widely in the 1990s than the panoramic murals that
were painted by Marc Chagall in January 1920 for the new Jewish
Theater in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Like that theater itself, and like many of those who had worked
for it, they had been proscribed, suppressed, and in danger of
being destroyed in the Soviet Union. If Stalin could order the
murder of Salomon Mikhoels, the Jewish Theater's greatest actor,
what hope was there for the paintings?
</P>
<P>
   The decorations _ the largest of which was about 13 feet high
and 39 feet wide _ had, in fact, been taken away, rolled on big
drums and kept in a secret place at the Tretyakov Museum in Moscow.
In 1973, Chagall went back to Russia after years of absence and was
allowed to see them under supervision. In 1985, when the policies
of glasnost prevailed, work began on their restoration.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, the murals have been shown at the Gianadda
Foundation in Martigny, Switzerland (which had helped substantially
toward their restoration); the Schirn Kunsthalle in Frankfurt,
Germany; the Guggenheim Museum in New York; the Art Institute of
Chicago; and the Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Invariably, the effect they produced was of irresistible
jubilation, not unmixed with mischief. This was in large part
because of the enormous painting called ``Introduction to the
Jewish Theater,'' which is both an encyclopedia of traditional
Yiddish motifs and a fast-forward autobiography by Chagall himself.
(Scholars have disentangled no fewer than 54 separate motifs in its
wonderfully fanciful and yet always incisive intimations.)
</P>
<P>
   The murals also include four tall, commanding panels titled
``Drama,'' ``Music,'' ``Dance'' and ``Literature''; an immensely
long and narrow frieze called ``The Wedding Feast'' and a large
square painting, ``Love on the Stage.'' At once a delight for the
eye and an education in the humanities, they were completed by
Chagall in a remarkably short time.
</P>
<P>
   There was much to celebrate when those murals were first seen in
Moscow in 1920. In 1883 the czar had imposed a total ban upon the
Yiddish-language theater, which, thereafter, led at best a
clandestine life. There appeared to be more promising times in
1919, when the new regime took cognizance of the fact that 97
percent of Russia's Jewish population spoke Yiddish and should no
longer be subjected to deprival.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it may be that only now, at the Royal Academy of Arts in
London, where the murals are on view until Oct. 4 in the exhibition
``Chagall: Love and the Stage,'' do visitors experience their
original impact. To achieve this, the viewers need to feel that
they are in an enclosed and quite small space.
</P>
<P>
   At the Royal Academy that need is met. In the unornamented
upstairs spaces of the academy's Sackler Gallery, there is no
distraction. Plain ideas about installation are worked out on plain
white walls. There is plenty of auxiliary material, and much of it
is very telling, but it never strays from the point. Even those
visitors who long ago gave up on later Chagall smile in bemusement.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, but separate, are drawings and sketches that show with
what an instantaneous fidelity Chagall could note down whatever
might suit him for future work. A prime instance of this is ``The
Jewish Wedding,'' a drawing done with gouache and India ink, pen
and brush, mounted on cardboard, on loan from a private collection
in St. Petersburg, Russia. For energy, vivacity and sharp
observation it would be hard to beat.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Chagall said in his memoirs: ``This was to be a real Yiddish
theater, a temple of joyous creation, where prayers are chanted in
the Yiddish language. We were building a world theater in which
only the language separated us from other theaters. How would it
be? What gods should we worship? We could not yet answer these
questions. We didn't yet know our goals. To search for them was our
main object.''
</P>
<P>
   The theater in question had a tiny auditorium, with no more than
90 seats; it was originally part of a large private house. Chagall
was determined that in this theater, painting should take
precedence. The theater should be a picture gallery as much as an
auditorium, and the audience should have had an all-enveloping
theatrical experience before the play had even begun.
</P>
<P>
   Chagall himself was to be preacher and poet, storyteller and
dramatist. The theatergoers could watch the actors, if they liked.
But he, Chagall, was ready to occupy their whole attention.
</P>
<P>
   During the four weeks it took him to complete his work, he
allowed no one else to enter the theater. Food was passed to him
through a crack in the door. If anyone spoke to him of rehearsals
onstage, he groaned. (``If only we didn't have to have people
around,'' he said.) When he saw how members of the audience might
have to back into the walls to let others pass, he feared that some
damage might occur to his paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he wanted every one of the actors to be
``Chagallized.'' They were to leave the ``real'' world at the stage
door. There was to be nothing of the naturalistic theater that
Stanislavsky and the Moscow Art Theater had brought to perfection.
To help his actors avoid that, Chagall wanted them, in effect, to
merge with his murals.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, he covered every inch of their costumes with paint.
He would fall upon them almost at curtain time, with brushes and
palette in hand. Frock coats and peaked caps were transformed at
breakneck speed. Tiny houses with tiny gardens appeared on their
trousers. Birds and little pigs appeared on their hats. Anything
that smacked of realism was outlawed, and even their faces were not
exempt from transformation just before (or after) curtain time.
</P>
<P>
   Even Salomon Mikhoels, whom Chagall worshipped as an actor,
could not escape. Chagall would hold him back even when he was late
on cue and the audience was calling out for him. ``If only I could
tear out your right eye, what a wonderful mask I could make for
you,'' the artist once said to the actor.
</P>
<P>
   When the murals were first seen, they did their work almost too
well. The audience was so fascinated by them that it refused to let
the play begin until someone came onstage and explained what the
murals were about. But before long, the love affair between Chagall
and the Jewish Theater curdled, and Aleksei Granovsky, the
theater's director, decided that there must be limits to
``Chagallization.'' Chagall had taken over the auditorium, but he
simply could not be allowed to take over the stage.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Chagall's friend and champion, Amos Efron: ``We
had to fight for our right to perform theater over Chagall's dead
body, almost. Everything that we did to try and make theater upset
him. He even accused the stagehands of deliberately scratching the
scenery that he had painted himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Chagall was bound to look for a larger audience for his murals,
and in February 1921 he wrote to the management of the Jewish
Theater: ``I can find no inner peace until the `masses' can see my
work. At present it can be seen, at best, by one hundred Jews at
close quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I like the Jews very much, and have proved it many
times over, but I also like the Russians, and people of many other
nationalities, and I have been used to painting serious things for
all of them.'' He therefore asked the theater to show his murals
for two hours a day during which anyone who wished could see them.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Marc Chagall has had his way. His murals are welcome
the world over, and nowhere more so than in the limpid spaces of
the Sackler Gallery at the Royal Academy of Arts in London at this
moment.

US RETRENCHES AFTER MODERATE CANDIDATE LOSES IN BOSNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stunned after a pro-American, moderate candidate
conceded defeat Monday in the recent Bosnian elections, the Clinton
administration now must consider what to do next in the fledgling
country.
</P>
<P>
   The painful answer may be nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Several specialists who helped the administration forge the
Dayton peace accords in 1995 and now oversee deployment of
peacekeeping troops say that the election results prove that the
West cannot micromanage Bosnia. Indeed, it must accept the apparent
winner of the contest for the Serbian presidency, extreme
nationalist Nikola Poplasen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like Serbia to be a multi-ethnic, prosperous, democratic
country,'' said Ivo Daalder, who coordinated the peace negotiations
and the first stages of the Dayton accord as director of European
affairs of the National Security Council at the White House from
1995-97. ``But if the people themselves don't want it, who are we
to tell them what to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Daalder called the election a ``defeat of the strategy that if
we just pump in enough money and side with one side, then that side
would win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 12-13 vote, deemed fair by independent observers was a
sharp rebuke to Washington and its European allies, who had openly
supported incumbent Bosnian Serb president Biljana Plavsic. Plavsic
is a former hard-liner who moderated her views and talked of unity
in the war-torn country. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had
visited her to show support, and US officials had all but promised
that trade and aid would follow her re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Plavsic acknowledged defeat Monday even before the
final vote tallies had been completed.
</P>
<P>
   Poplasen has rebuffed plans to integrate Serbs, Muslims and
Croats in Bosnia, and has appealed instead to Serbian unity. He is
considered sympathetic to war criminal Radovan Karadzic and has
made no secret of his suspicions of the West.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department now finds itself caught between two
contradictory impulses: recognition of the legitimacy of the
elections and condemnation of Poplasen for his divisiveness and
suggestions that ethnic fighting might resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing more sacred than the preservation of the
integrity of someone's elections,'' said Major General William L.
Nash, visiting lecturer at the Shorenstein Center at Harvard
University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. Nash, who
commanded the first US ground troops in the Bosnia peacekeeping
force, also hopes that Washington will be measured in its responses
to Poplasen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have been a little too public in our intervention in
their election system,'' Nash said. ``I think there was a reaction
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Serbian part of the Bosnian presidential elections was
a setback for the West, analysts saw positive signs in other
results. Zivko Radisic, a moderate, is thought to have defeated a
hardliner in the race for the Serb seat on the three-man collective
presidency. And Plavsic's Unity coalition apparently ousted several
ultra-nationalist incumbents from the Bosnian Serb parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that we're not able to summon the will to do what
we want, to impose a unified state,'' said Jack Seymour, a retired
State Department official who oversaw foreign policy for the former
Yugoslavia. ``We'll have to try to support the moderates, the
people who want to get on with their lives, and try to isolate the
extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   Some specialists who follow Bosnia blamed the West for doing too
little, not too much. Morton Abramowitz, a senior fellow at the
Council on Foreign Relations and an expert in Bosnia, said the
United States and other countries ``dawdled'' on a project to make
elections more fair in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Abramowitz believes that the West cannot retreat from Bosnia
now. Peacekeeping troops will have to stay for years, and the West
must help enact reforms such as laws for determining ownership of
property, he said. Anything less could trigger a new outbreak of
the fighting that raged from 1992 to 1995.

   ``I believe it's it's going to be costly and it's going to last
a long time but we have no more alternative than persist,'' he
said. But Abramowitz also cautioned against too much pessimism.
``The world hasn't ended,'' he concluded.

   Non-governmental groups that have worked with Bosnian refugees
were the most critical of the new political landscape in Bosnia.
``The west didn't do the things it said it would,'' said John Fox,
president of the Open Society Institute, a non-profit democratic
advocacy group in Washington. ``They didn't arrest the big fish war
criminals. They went after the small and middle fry. They took half
measures and they got half results.''

 &HT;    FOES CHARGE FEDERAL BUILDING WILL BE MORE COSTLY THAN ESTIMATED
 &HT;    Restores dropped word ``million'' in 11th graf.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Opponents plan to charge Wednesday that a proposed
2.1 million-square-foot Patent and Trademark Office headquarters
will cost more than the $1.3 billion estimated by the government
and could become a federal extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen buildings come and go for 30 years, and the same
mistakes are made,'' said Pete Sepp, an official with the National
Taxpayers Union who is scheduled to testify at a Senate hearing on
the controversial project. ``With this one, we have a chance to
make changes before the concrete is poured.''
</P>
<P>
   The building that has been dubbed by some a ``Taj Mahal''
because of amenities such as a sculpture garden and landscaped park
planned for the still-undetermined suburban Virginia site.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters point to government studies concluding that a new
consolidated complex would save $72 million over the costs of
remaining in 18 older buildings scattered in Arlington, Va., across
the Potomac River from the capital.
</P>
<P>
   However, opponents were set to fire back at Wednesday's hearing
with a new private study by the Arthur Andersen consulting firm
projecting that, rather than a saving money, the move would
increase costs by $47.7 million. The review was ordered by Charles
E. Smith, the current landlord, which is fighting to keep the
Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) in his buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The new study concluded that government estimates had not
anticipated cost overruns or delays that occur with most federal
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the very least, the Andersen study means more analysis is
necessary,'' Sepp said. ``If this much money is at stake, what's
the harm in taking a few more months to see if the option PTO wants
to pursue is the best one?''
</P>
<P>
   The new Patent headquarters has already cleared most of the
obstacles in Congress, with backing from Sen. John Warner, R-Va.,
whose transportation and infrastructure Subcommittee has set
Wednesday's hearing. The government schedule calls for a contract
to be awarded by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   The project has been lampooned for lavish plans outlined in a
government study for furnishing the new headquarters. A list of
``budgeted furniture expenditures'' included $250 shower curtains,
$1,000 for a coat rack, $13,298 for a modular table, and $83 each
for waste baskets, not to mention cribs at $750 apiece and desks
costing as much as $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Patents and Trademarks Commissioner Bruce A. Lehman wrote Warner
recently that this list was a ``worst-case scenario'' and added,
``I personally assure you, we have never contemplated nor will we
spend $250 for a shower curtain, $750 for a crib, or $1,000 for a
coat rack.''
</P>
<P>
   His spokeswoman, Brigid(cq) Quinn said Tuesday that the cost for
the project would go no higher than $1.3 billion for rent plus $135
million in relocation costs for the Patent office, whose work force
is expected to expand to 7,100 by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no unanticipated costs,'' she said, citing a
congressional ceiling for the project.
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics are not convinced. ``Virtually every project has
some kind of ceiling on it, and those ceilings are full of holes,''
said Sepp, noting that NASA had a ceiling for the space station but
keeps asking Congress for additional funding.
</P>
<P>
   Critics often compare the Patent building to the recently
completed Ronald Reagan Office Building, a massive 3
million-square-foot structure down the street from Capitol Hill
that was first estimated to cost under $400 million. It came in at
$800 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan building has a distinct advantage, however. It was
built to last 200 years and is owned by the government. The
proposed PTO building would cost $1.3 billion in rent over 20
years, and after that, the government would have only an expired
lease.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the decision to lease instead of own, Quinn said it
was because of the way the federal government budgets. ``We'd spend
perhaps $700 million to build it, and it would have to be taken
from one year's budget,'' she said. ``The determination was made
that a long-term lease was the way to go.''

TODAY'S POETS DON'T ECHO LONGFELLOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No disrespect for modern poetry is intended when I say what many
others know, that poetry no longer connects with the body public.
</P>
<P>
   Those who compose poetry in English today, whether in our
country or across the Atlantic, write only for a small audience of
other poets. Recognition of today's poets is commensurate with the
negligible revenue derived from the sale of their ever-more-oblique
verse.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the poets starve. The gifted and canny ones obtain
lucrative grants or seats in universities as poets in residence,
often socking away six-figure incomes while teaching one course.
Yet few outside the hermetically sealed literary community know who
these poets are.
</P>
<P>
   Quite recently but no longer, in America they were such as
Robert Lowell, Elizabeth Bishop, John Berryman, Marianne Moore,
James Merrill and Amy Clampitt. They still are such veterans as
Archie Ammons, John Ashbery and W.D. Snodgrass; and the vaguely
established younger poets _ Edward Hirsch, Denis Johnson, Mary Jo
Salter, Diane Ackerman and scores of others at the same recognition
plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Not any of these is as familiar to the general public as Sylvia
Plath, a growing legend because death (by her own hand) snuffed out
her exceptional promise.
</P>
<P>
   Not even such extraordinarily creative poets as William Carlos
Williams and Wallace Stevens became household names. The last such
may well have been Thomas Stearns Eliot. (In Joseph Heller's
``Catch-22,'' Pfc. Wintergreen says ``T.S. Eliot'' in response to a
rude question if any poet ever made money, and it sets off a panic
among the brass, who have no idea what T.S. Eliot may indicate.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Eliot may be seen as a demarcation point for the
intellectualization of verse. The poems of Edwin Arlington
Robinson, Robert Frost and Carl Sandburg never were mindless, but
common folk could understand and like them. They were the last
``people's poets'' in our country, along with Edna St. Vincent
Millay and Stephen Vincent Benet.
</P>
<P>
   In 19th-century America, poetry was consumed as readily as prose
by the workaday society. People who read the novels and tales of
James Fenimore Cooper and Nathaniel Hawthorne and Edgar Allen Poe
also read (and recited) poems by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and
John Greenleaf Whittier and William Cullen Bryant and Oliver
Wendell Holmes; and by Walt Whitman and Sidney Lanier a little
later on.
</P>
<P>
   The saintly, folksy Whittier may have been the best-loved
American poet, but the most memorized one was Longfellow, here and
in an England that exalted him. Longfellow's reputation, like
Whittier's, is now somewhat diminished; but it is easy to
understand his tight grip on the imaginations of contemporary
readers.
</P>
<P>
   Narrative was the key to Longfellow's heavy vogue. He told
stories in verse, not only in distended romances such as
``Hiawatha'' and ``Evangeline,'' but in shorter,
ripe-for-memorizing verses such as ``The Village Blacksmith'' and
``The Children's Hour.'' By 1858, when Longfellow had attained his
peak of fame, his narrative poem ``The Courtship of Miles
Standish'' outsold every new American novel.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Allan Poe in critic raimant came down hard on Longfellow
as a plagiarist, citing the indebtedness of ``The Wreck of a
Hesperus'' to an old English ballad, among other pilferings. But
after Poe was safely entombed, Longfellow in 1855 duplicated in
``Hiawatha'' the quirky, unusual meter of the Finnish epic
``Kalevala''; and beginning in 1863, he borrowed the basic scheme
of Chaucer's ``Canterbury Tales'' and the ``Decameron'' of
Boccaccio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tales of a Wayside Inn'' finds seven men exchanging stories in
an actual inn in Sudbury, Mass., near Boston. Each man tells three
stories, and of the total of 21, the first and best-known one is
Paul Revere's Ride, as familiar and exciting as it is historically
imperfect.
</P>
<P>
   But Longfellow is never quite a joke. Poets in search of an
audience may look to him and learn.

 &HT;    VETERANS COMPLAIN THAT GOVERNMENT BROKE MEDICAL CARE PROMISE
 &HT;    Photos are now available in the National folder on the Cox
server.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A small group of retired members of the U.S. armed
forces rallied outside the Capitol on Tuesday to insist that the
federal government keep what they contend is a broken promise of
free medical care for the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Although they were recruited with promises of lifetime care for
themselves and their dependents if they made careers of military
service, retired members of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines
are now told they are eligible for military medical care on a
``space available'' basis only.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew when we signed up that part of our contract was going
to be a life of trouble and war on foreign shores,'' said retired
Air Force Col. George (Bud) Day, wearing the Medal of Honor he won
during two terms as a prisoner-of-war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``But another part of our contract was that when we came to the
end of the line, we would have medical care for the rest of our
lives,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to fewer than 200 members of an impromptu organization
calling itself ``The Class Act Group,'' Day said the government
reneged on its part of the contract in 1956, when Congress passed
the Medical Care Act, imposing the ``space available'' condition on
medical care for retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have admitted that even after passage of the
1956 law, recruiters continued for years to promise young men and
women free medical care in return for commitments to 20-year career
service.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends those promises do not constitute binding
contracts. Day, now a Fort Walton Beach, Fla., lawyer has filed a
class action lawsuit, seeking to force the Pentagon to honor the
recruiting pledges.
</P>
<P>
   The ``space available'' condition has become an issue in recent
years, as downsizing forced closure of many military hospitals.
This caused many retirees to find that space was no longer
available for them _ at a time when their own advancing years
caused them to become dependent on it.
</P>
<P>
   To receive any military medical care, they are forced to
purchase Tricare, the Defense Department's health care coverage
plan. And when they become eligible for Medicare, they no longer
can obtain Tricare.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on folding chairs at one end of the Washington Mall, an
area that routinely sees demonstrations attracting 100,000 people
or more, the small Class Act Group seemed dwarfed by the Capitol
and the monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing hearing aids and old medals, they vowed to keep up their
fight, while tourists strolled by.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was interrupted briefly by a summer downpour. Members
of the Class Act Group huddled under trees and against Capitol
walls until it was over, then continued their rally while they
waited, wet and determined, for members of Congress who had agreed
to meet with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to tell the government that you made a promise and
we carried out our part of the contract,'' Day said. ``It's time
you stepped up to yours.''

<P>
   KRASNOYARSK, Russia _ With the rugged stoicism that typifies
this vast Siberian territory, Nina Popova thought she could ride
out Russia's economic storm.
</P>
<P>
   But last week tax inspectors barged into her small food shop.
After poring through her ledgers, they warned her she had violated
Governor Alexander Lebed's new ``anti-crisis'' decree.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said we can only charge 10 percent more than we pay for
the food,'' she said. ``But we have to pay for electricity and
heat. We have to pay for security, and we have to pay salaries. If
they force this decree on us we simply won't survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's financial crisis has not only rocked Moscow's political
establishment. It has also stirred many of Russia's far-flung
regions to set their own economic course and establish price
controls.
</P>
<P>
   A former general, presidential hopeful and the new governor of
this Siberian region, Lebed has led the charge. Angry at the
soaring prices that have stunned Russians, Lebed has not just
declared war on inflation. He has tried to make it illegal.
</P>
<P>
   He is hardly alone. From the northwestern city of Novgorod to
the western territory of Yakutia, authorities are taking a page out
of the socialist playbook and intervening to set prices.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is fast becoming a crazy quilt of zones with Draconian
price controls, territories with milder price restrictions and
regions with no controls at all.
</P>
<P>
   The populist decrees have brought a measure of comfort to
consumers shocked by sharp jumps in prices for food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may infringe on the rights of people but it is in their
interest,'' Lebed said in interview. ``The strict measures have
played their role and soon will be abolished.''
</P>
<P>
   But the stop-gap controls also contain the seeds of new
problems. Stores and factories complain they are being denied the
profit they need to weather Russia's raging economic storm.
Shortages have emerged, as producers ship their goods to regions
where prices run free.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually nobody thinks the controls are a substitute for a
national strategy to rescue Russia from its economic malaise.
</P>
<P>
   But with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov still struggling to
form a national Cabinet, there is no overarching plan.
</P>
<P>
   Lebed owes his job to Krasnoyarsk's economic distress. Tapping
the deep well of discontent, Lebed scored an upset victory over the
region's incumbent governor in a bitterly contested race last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   An immense region one-fourth the size of the United States,
Krasnoyarsk has some of the nation's largest factories along with
Siberia-size economic problems. But Lebed assured the voters that
the region need an experienced crisis manager, not an economist.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Lebed has been sorely tested.
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of the ruble, tax revenues plummeted. Panic
buying cleared the shelves of baby food and cold medicine, leaving
the region with dangerously small reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, residents in the city of Krasnoyarsk, the
administrative capital of the region, found themselves without hot
water when the authorities ran short of coal.
</P>
<P>
   The only bright spot came when Lebed hosted a glitzy popular
music festival, which was sponsored by one of Russia's leading
television networks _ a brief distraction in what promises to be
one of the toughest winters in years.
</P>
<P>
   Chastened by his region's economic woes, Lebed no longer talks
confidently about single-handedly turning the situation around.
Krasnoyarsk, he says, needs a greater share of the nation's tax
receipts and lower rail and electricity tariffs to thrive over the
long term.
</P>
<P>
   It is Lebed's short-term plan, however, that has led
Krasnoyarsk's citizens to draw the political battle lines. Anxious
to quell the economic turmoil sweeping the nation, Lebed has
decreed controls on the price of meat, fish, bread, flour, cereal,
pasta, beverages and coal.
</P>
<P>
   The measures officially took effect a week ago when the order
was published on the front page of the regional newspaper
Krasnoyarsk Worker.
</P>
<P>
   Under Lebed's system, producers who want to raise the wholesale
price of goods need to appeal to a panel of government officials at
least five days in advance. Officially, no ceiling on wholesale
prices was set. But a Lebed aide has proclaimed that producers
should be satisfied with a profit of 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Retail prices are regulated according to a formula. Shop owners
are not be allowed to sell their food and beverages for more than
10 percent more than what they paid for them. And Krasnoyarsk's tax
inspectors are conducting spot checks to make sure.
</P>
<P>
   Lebed has emerged in recent weeks as the most popular
alternative to the Communists in the public opinion polls. But his
brand of capitalism is both populist and exceedingly vague.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am certainly on the verge of breaking the law, but I think
my measures are justified,'' Lebed said earlier this month. ``The
emergency situation is compelling me to take emergency measures.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Defending his price controls, Lebed said they were needed to
head off a wave of frenzied buying by consumers desperate to stock
up before prices soared even further.
</P>
<P>
   Another goal, he said, was to stop profiteering by local
producers, who were taking advantage of the crisis to ratchet up
their prices even though they have been somewhat insulated from the
effects of Russia's falling currency. The aim, he insisted, was not
to set the price of imported goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should milk become more expensive? Has the price of cows
gone up?'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Lebed is not the only one to turn to price controls. Kaliningrad
has declared a state of emergency. The tax police in Novgorod have
prowled through the city, fining shops for exorbitant prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern Russian city of Stavropol, fights broke out when
consumers and merchants banded together against government
inspectors, who they complained were interfering with local trade.
</P>
<P>
   Even pricey Moscow has imposed a 20 percent limit on the markup
for basic staples, though city officials insist it is more of a
guideline than a law.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lebed's decree has been assailed by his critics, who say
it shows his penchant for simplistic and authoritarian solutions to
complex economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that no member of the Lebed team thinks in economic
terms,'' said Aleksei Kleshko, a member of the Krasnoyarsk City
Council.``They only know how to deal with the crisis through
administrative means.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many local factory directors and shop owners are
unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government acts just like it did in the days of Soviet
power, when business people were considered bourgeois
speculators,'' said Yevgeniya Kuznetsova, the president of Pikra, a
local beverage company and the first factory to be privatized in
the Krasnoyarsk region.
</P>
<P>
   After the ruble collapsed, the upgrading of the factory's beer
production unit was stopped in mid-stream after a German factory
refused to provide any more equipment on credit.
</P>
<P>
   That has increased the factory's need for cash. Meanwhile, sales
have fallen, as consumers have cut back on their purchase or beer
and soft drinks so that they can stock up on flour, grain and
cooking oil.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kuznetsova said her company will be skating too close to the
edge if it is restricted to a profit rate of 2 percent. Already,
she has gone to a four-day work week to reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government does not seem to worry about the collapse of
small and medium business,'' she said bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   At her small shop down the street from Pikra, Ms. Popova is more
distressed than angry. A sturdy woman with an engaging manner, she
voted for Lebed because of his promises to bring order to
Krasnoyarsk.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Popova is already something of a survivor. She set up her
food store in a working class district earlier this year after the
investment company she was working for went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Her store sells sausages, bread, alcohol and cooking oil.
Saleswomen receive just 360 rubles a month (about $24 at current
exchange rates) for their 12-hour-a-day jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Because the volume of sales is low and because her store also
has to pay for utilities and an alarm system, Ms. Popova needs to
mark up her goods by 20 percent just to break even, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Krasnoyarsk tax police, however, were not impressed by her
arguments. After shuffling through the shop's balance sheets, they
told her the store was exceeding the 10 percent mark-up allowed for
salt, sugar and cereal. No fines were levied yet, but Ms. Popova
was summoned to the local tax office to do some explaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``All summer long I told our saleswomen they should be patient
and that I would increase their salaries a little bit in the
fall,'' she said. ``Now, I may have to fire some of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Popova is reluctant to assign the blame to the
gruff-talking governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pinned hopes on him because I thought he would be tough,''
she recalled. ``But he turned out to be too tough. He's not an
economist, though, and this was probably done by his team. I still
hope to prove to him that this is not right, and I might even vote
for him again.''

COMMENTARY: PIG VS. PRIG  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not only our president who has a certain genius for, as the
Starr report puts it, refusing to achieve ``completion'' in sex.
Look at the media. From the moment the All Monica bell went off in
January _ with Sam Donaldson's immortal prediction that ``If he's
not telling the truth, I think his presidency is numbered in days''
_ the press has been promising a national orgasm in the form of the
resignation, impeachment or tarring-and-feathering of Bill Clinton.
But, in the eternal Groundhog Day that is Monicagate, the
consummation, however devoutly wished, never arrives.
</P>
<P>
   The teasingly orgiastic buildup is always the same. The Paula
Jones case document dump, the Kathleen Willey ``60 Minutes''
interview, the Aug. 17 presidential ``apology,'' the Starr report,
and now the televised grand jury inquisition were all hyped like
the Super Bowl _ only to come and go, leaving the essential civic
equation unchanged. Most Americans suspected early on that the
president had had sex with Monica Lewinsky and most long ago
concluded he lied about it, under oath and not. And yet two-thirds
of the country doesn't want him to leave office.
</P>
<P>
   Why? It's certainly not that anyone loves Bill Clinton or
believes he's capable of honesty. His personal approval numbers are
in the toilet. Nor is his presidency more than an empty shell, even
for those who agree with his politics; an unfocused lame duck
before the Lewinsky story broke, he has been stripped of the moral
and political authority to accomplish anything, at least in the
domestic arena, in what months he has left.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a theory to explain a self-stained and humiliated
president's illogical hammerlock on his office, the Clinton lynch
mob, talking heads and politicians alike, blames the public. The
American people, we're repeatedly told, are whores who will not
only sell out their principles to the Dow Jones average (never mind
its recent decline) but who may have abandoned moral judgments
entirely (if we are to believe William Bennett's new screed, ``The
Death of Outrage''). Last week an exasperated James Dobson, head of
the GOP's powerful family-values auxiliary, Focus on the Family,
went so far as to declare ``that our greatest problem is not in the
Oval Office _ it is with the people of this land.''
</P>
<P>
   But the people of this land whom he sees as the ``problem'' are
also, as it happens, an American majority that sees people like
Dobson as the problem: preacher-politicians who want to legislate
the most intimate acts of human life _ sex and religion. And
Kenneth Starr, by his own actions, not those of his political foes,
has signaled that he is one of those politicians _ by speaking
under Pat Robertson's auspices while serving as independent
counsel, by dropping all the other Clinton scandals to fixate on
Monica, and finally by producing both a report and a grand jury
interrogation that chill the rest of us not so much with their
salacious detail as with their vision of what America might be like
if the Starrs, Robertsons and Dobsons were in power beyond this one
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Americans sense that the government prosecutor who uses his
office not merely to catalog repetitive sex acts but to
gratuitously determine if (and how) they reached ``completion'' is
an avatar for the political movement that wishes to revive punitive
divorce laws, enforce state sodomy statutes (especially against
homosexuals), roll back Roe vs. Wade and police libraries, TV,
movies and the Internet for smut (unless it's state-sanctioned,
like the Starr report). The two-thirds of the people in this land
who reject such invasive politics, many of them far more honorable
than Bill Clinton, would rather have a piggish president they don't
admire, and perhaps actively deplore, in the White House than lend
any vindication to the crusade of a zealous prig out of ``The
Crucible.''
</P>
<P>
   Monicagate will yield more Super Bowl events _ the Linda Tripp
tapes, more bimbo eruptions and perhaps even impeachment hearings
in which the mob is treated to the spectacle of Congress
interrogating Ms. Lewinsky to nail the president on his sworn lies
about his contact with her breasts and genitalia. But Starr was and
is Clinton's best insurance policy. No matter how many doomsdays
the media predict, the only way the public is likely to give the
president the boot is if the independent counsel abdicates first.

TOO SOON FOR U.S.-IRAN DIALOGUE, IRANIAN LEADER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Mohammed Khatami of Iran said Tuesday that
Iran has no intention of opening an official political dialogue
with the United States until Washington takes concrete steps to
change at least its policies toward his country.
</P>
<P>
   In a hastily-arranged, 90-minute breakfast and news conference
with a score of journalists, Khatami also made his first statement
as president on the fate of novelist Salman Rushdie, who was
condemned to death by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
suggesting that the time had come to bring the troublesome human
rights issue to a close.
</P>
<P>
   The bearded cleric also reiterated his country's desire to avoid
going to war to stop the Taliban militia who control most of
neighboring Afghanistan, despite the Iranian troop buildup and
planned military maneuvers on the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iran is ready to defend its security and territorial
integrity,'' said Khatami. ``But we are making all efforts so that,
God willing, there will not be a war.''
</P>
<P>
   The media gathering with Khatami was described by his aides as a
way for him to get to know American journalists during his first
trip to the United States, and indeed, some of America's leading
journalists attended, including the anchors of all three networks,
Peter Jennings of ABC, Dan Rather of CBS and Tom Brokaw of NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because the news conference was expected to be broadcast
on Iranian television, the Iranian delegation struggled to
redecorate a conference room at the U.N. Plaza Hotel, laying down a
huge Isfahani carpet borrowed from Iran's mission to the United
Nations, and planting a large Iranian flag beside the president.
</P>
<P>
   Female reporters were not required to cover their heads, as they
must do in Iran, although no members of the all-male Iranian
delegation shook their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, who spoke in Persian, made an effort to charm his
guests, smiling easily, showing flashes of humor and telling them
how he started out as a journalist and editor himself. He spoke
about how he admired the American Puritans, summarized the
definition of justice in Plato's Republic and said that he wished
he could be a tourist and spend up to a month in America.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his friendly manner, Khatami said that his initiative
for cultural exchanges between Iran and the United States had been
misunderstood and did not include any government-to-government
talks, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Even visits to Iran by American congressman and mayors are not
under consideration, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately there seems to be a misinterpretation of what
I've tried to say in this respect and that is not to confuse a
dialogue among people and cultures with political dialogue,'' he
said when asked what specific steps the United States had to take
to break the impasse. ``But it seems there is a lot of confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami welcomed what he called a ``change in speech'' by
American officials towards Iran. But he criticized the American
economic embargo against Iran, American opposition to the
construction of a pipeline to transport oil from the Caspian Sea
through Iranian territory and American criticism of Iran's
behavior. He also faulted the United States for what he called its
failure to return the remaining assets belonging to Iranians that
were frozen by the U.S. government and for allocating money to
``hurt the government of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is opposed to the creation of a Persian-language surrogate
radio station based in Prague and in the past has criticized the
United States for launching a covert program to destabilize Iran's
government.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, Khatami, in an interview with CNN, announced the
launching of cultural exchanges as a way to break down what he
called the ``wall of mistrust'' between the two countries. But
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader who wields more
power than the president, made clear within days that America was
still Iran's arch-enemy and the initiative did not signal the
beginning of a warming of relations.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called on Iran
in a speech to the Asia Society to work with the United States to
draw up a ``roadmap'' for the establishment of relations between
the two countries. But she did not offer any specific incentive or
policy change to entice Iran to move.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi, will
deliver a speech at the Asia Society in what Iranian officials say
is Iran's formal response to Albright's proposal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Khatami also made his first statement as president on the fate
of novelist Salman Rushdie, who was accused of ``blasphemy'' and
condemned to death in a religious decree by the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini shortly before his death in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The official position of the Iranian government is that the
decree by Khomeini, who was Iran's supreme religious leader, cannot
be revoked, but that Iran has no intention of carrying it out.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami suggested that Khomeini was expressing his own view as
an Islamic jurist and that Iran wants to put the matter behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should consider the Salman Rushdie issue as completely
finished,'' Khatami said. He added that Khomeini ``as an Islamic
jurist gave us his opinion about this matter and many other
religious leaders have told us their opinions in this respect. The
Iranian government has officially announced that in practice it has
made no decision to act on this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's words contrasted sharply with a statement by Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei, Khomeini's successor, in 1993, in which he said,
``The fatwa is irreversible. Rushdie should be and will be
executed. It is the duty for all Muslims who have access to the
mercenary to carry out the sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   According to some Islamic scholars, Khamenei has the authority
to revoke the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami was similarly relaxed and expansive in an
invitation-only reception Sunday with about 800 Iranians living in
America, some of whom had held positions in the regime of the late
Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi or had fled Iran during the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami said little about Islam but appealed to their sense of
Iranian nationalism instead. He told the story of two of the heroes
in the 11th century Persian epic poem, The Shahnamah, adding that
even in battle Iranians treated each other with respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationhood is not a piece of land,'' he said. ``It's in your
blood.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged those with special skills to return home to help
reconstruct the country. ``You can't expect a hero from outside to
come and change things,'' he said. ``You yourselves are the
heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the recent closure of a popular Iranian newspaper by
a revolutionary court, Khatami said, ``We have a long way to go
toward freedom in our country, until the government respects other
people's ideas and other people respect the government's ideas
also.''
</P>
<P>
   When one Iranian guest asked what could be done to help prevent
war in Afghanistan, Khatami replied, ``Just pray.''

entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, Sept. 27,
1998. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   WRITERS-FILMS (Undated) _ James Ivory, the director of the new
film ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,'' based on Kaylie Jones'
novel about her father the novelist James Jones, boasts about the
fact that in the many movies he has made about authors, he has
almost never shown one writing. ``I never even for one second
thought of him writing,'' said Ivory of his latest character. The
image of the miserable outsider, an alcoholic tormented by writer's
block, facing a forbidding black Remington portable in a seedy
hotel room, is a commonplace of films about writers, and Ivory has
always strived to avoid it. The difficulty in portraying a writer's
life is that ``There is nothing to be seen,'' said Ivory. The
typical writer's activities are limited, at best. In fact, there is
a long tradition of movies about writers, and they present
directors with a number of unique kinds of technical and artistic
challenges _ not the least of which is how do you depict what is
essentially an interior, solitary, intellectual process in a visual
medium like film? By Dinitia Smith.
</P>
<P>
   HIT-ME-FILM (Undated) _ I'm basically drawn to defeated,
injured, hurt, barely walking characters,'' said Steven Shainberg,
35, the director of ``Hit Me.'' Little wonder, then, that he would
choose a bleak, gritty Jim Thompson novel, ``A Swell-Looking
Babe,'' for his first feature film. Shainberg has regarded Thompson
as something of a soul mate ever since college. ``Hit Me'' _ whose
script was written by his longtime writing partner, the novelist
Denis Johnson _ tells the story of Sonny, a frustrated bellhop in a
seedy hotel in Tacoma, Wash. The film opens Oct. 2. By Annette
Insdorf.
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   CIVIL-WAR-MUSICAL (Houston) _ The first sing-through of ``The
Civil War,'' the musical extravaganza that opened to enthusiastic
audiences and positive, if qualified, reviews at the Alley Theater
here on Sept. 16, took place in the Alley's only rehearsal space, a
windowless room beneath the stage. It is a space more suitable for
a chamber group than for the 28 singers and 9 musicians who crammed
it that day in late August, belting out the sentimental ballads and
calculated, 11-o'clock show stoppers that are the specialty of the
composer, Frank Wildhorn. By Bruce Weber.
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   MAGUY-MARIN-DANCE (Lyons, France) _ Ms. Maguy Marin has moved
her modern-dance troupe, the Compagnie Maguy Marin, from the
Parisian suburb of Creteil to Rillieux-La-Pape, a tougher immigrant
suburb of Lyons. She has also stopped doing commissioned works for
major ballet companies and is concentrating on her own company,
which will present her 1995 ``Ramdam'' at the Joyce Theater from
Tuesday through Oct. 11. Nonetheless, it was the Lyons Opera Ballet
that presented some of the highly elaborate productions for which
she is best-known: ``Cendrillon,'' a doll-house version of
``Cinderella,'' seen in New York in 1987 and ``Coppelia,'' in a
modern-dress, mixed-media staging performed at Lincoln Center
Festival '96. By Anna Kisselgoff. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   GEWANDHAUS-ORCHESTRA (Leipzig, Germany) _ Music has contributed
to Leipzig's internationalism: less because of the city's past
association with Bach, Mendelssohn and other luminaries than
because of the Gewandhaus Orchestra itself. The conductor Kurt
Masur has elevated the two-century-old orchestra from postwar
mediocrity into an internationally viable, and internationally
active, body that tours several months a year around the globe, and
is arguably East Germany's most prominent orchestra. By Anne
Midgette.
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   PHOTOGRAPHY-ROOTS (Undated) _ On the verge of a filmless,
digital revolution, photography is moving forward into its past.
Photographers are polishing daguerreotype plates, coating paper
with egg whites, transforming entire trailers into pinhole cameras
and mixing emulsions from 19th-century recipes in order to coax new
expressive effects from old photographic techniques. By Lyle Rexer.
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN-SITCOMS-TV (Undated) _ By all accounts, the women on
television (at least in sitcoms) are increasingly at odds with the
women in the audience, but who's to blame? Advertisers chasing a
demographic? Networks too frightened to take chances? Writers
without talent? Pressure from sydicators who know that shows about
women don't do as well in reruns? It depends on whom you talk to.
In the lightning-fast world of television development, everyone
passes the buck. But one thing is clear: in a season viewed as one
of the most moribund in memory, the rhetoric is heated almost to
the boil. By Nancy Hass.
</P>
<P>
   FELICITY-TV (Undated) _ Focus groups swooned over the pilot of
the WB's ``Felicity.'' Industry analysts _ even executives at rival
networks _ declared ``Felicity,'' a new hourlong drama, the only
sure hit of an otherwise unpredictable fall season. Spotting their
latest It Girl, magazine and newspaper editors rushed to give the
kiss-and-hug treatment to the show's star, Keri Russell, 22, a
former Mouseketeer with an innocently open gaze and angelically
backlit blond curls who seems incapable of taking a bad photograph.
``Felicity'' is the tale of an intelligent, introspective and
usually obedient rich girl who rejects her parent's plans to send
her to Stanford University and medical school so that she can
follow a tousled-haired hunk she hardly knows to a college in New
York City. By Margy Rochlin.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   GLASS-FUSION-ANTIQUES (New York) _ Toots Zynsky produces fantasy
forms in glass that look as fragile and festive as crepe-paper
objects _ ruffled, puckered, pinched and drenched with color. She
uses a revolutionary technique to create the multicolored tuliplike
works: instead of blowing or casting these pieces, she fuses
thousands of glass threads into entire vessels. She began exploring
this technique in 1982, when she lived in Manhattan. Ms. Zynsky
(born Maryann but called Toots since infancy), 47, is back in New
York for her second solo exhibition here, ``Toots Zynsky: Chaotic
Fusion,'' at the Barry Friedman gallery on 67th Street, through
Oct. 24. By Rita Reif.

CAMPAIGN TO BAN PEANUT BUTTER IN SCHOOLS IS GROWING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Conn., Mass., Calif., N.J., Canada)  (lb) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As any parent can testify, there is probably no surer
staple of childhood than peanut butter; a pure product of America,
consumed at an annual rate of 3 pounds per person, invented by
George Washington Carver, the brown-bag-and-grape-jelly backup for
millions of schoolchildren who gag at peas and pre-emptively detest
anything cooked in a school cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Now peanut butter is under attack at the schoolhouse door.
Cheap, nutritious, popular and traditional, it has nonetheless
taken its place on the list of substances _ like asbestos and lead
_ that send shivers down the spines of school administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by parents warning of lethal allergies, by the
contentions of some researchers that peanut allergies are on the
rise and, not least, by a fear of litigation, growing numbers of
public and private schools across the United States have banned
peanut butter from their cafeterias. Others have declared
peanut-free zones or set up committees to figure out what to do.
</P>
<P>
   School officials find themselves balancing the rare risk of
death against the danger of being swept up in a faddish hysteria
and of trying to anticipate potential legal repercussions of the
1990 Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who wonder if the bans have gone too far fear that if
they do not act aggressively, they may face liability lawsuits and
accusations of discrimination against children disabled by a peanut
allergy.
</P>
<P>
   Children are well aware of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you can't take chances,'' said Alex Goldschmidt, a
fifth-grader eating pizza in the lunchroom at Trevor Day School, a
private school in New York. ``I mean, if you kept it here, then
they might eat like some kind of food with nuts in it, then
something bad would happen, then the next thing you know there
would be somebody in the cafeteria that's dead, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to ban peanut butter is happening in scattered
places where an assertive parent or two _ supported by the Food
Allergy Network, an 8-year-old advocacy group in Fairfax, Va. _ has
raised the alarm in schools, contending that peanut allergies are a
disability that schools must accommodate under the disabilities
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mother at Trevor became a real activist,'' said Alexandra
Peters, president of the Trevor Board of Trustees. The debate, she
said, boiled down to ``my child's life or your kid's lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control report only 88 deaths among all
Americans from allergies to food, including peanuts, between 1979
and the end of 1995. But allergists supported by the food allergies
network contend that fatalities are underreported, and that 0.5 to
1 percent of all Americans suffer from peanut allergies. The
network estimates that every year 125 people die from food
allergies, the majority from peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wesley Burks, a pediatric allergist at the University of
Arkansas who is supported by the network, said the centers'
statistics reflect underreporting.
</P>
<P>
   While network officials say they are not forcing schools to take
any particular action, the schools say that anything less than a
total ban seems inadequate to satisfy the critics.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first full year of the peanut ban at Trevor lower
school, where children who once ate peanut butter sandwiches now
can choose from a sandwich bar including cheese, cold cuts or just
plain jelly.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen cooks with olive and canola oil. A memorandum sent
to staff this month warns that some foods, like plain M&AMP;Ms, might
be contaminated by machinery used to make peanut candies; a similar
letter, administrators said, will be sent home with students before
Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other schools, Trevor, which has two peanut-allergic
children among its 240 students, has stored Epipens, injectable
epinephrine, an antidote to the asthmalike reaction that can be
caused by peanut butter, in strategic spots throughout the building
and has trained teachers and cafeteria workers in how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   In rare cases, a peanut allergy can cause a sudden drop in blood
pressure and the closing of the breathing passages. An injection of
epinephrine or adrenaline can prevent death if administered quickly
enough, Burks said.
</P>
<P>
   In its milder form, a peanut allergy can cause itching,
swelling, hives, wheezing, coughing, vomiting and diarrhea, doctors
say.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Several private schools in New York City, and Greenwich Academy
and the Stanwich School in Connecticut, have declared peanut-free
cafeterias and implore parents to check labels before sending in
snacks or birthday treats.
</P>
<P>
   At Horace Mann, in Bronx, peanut butter sandwiches are made
ahead of time, snugly wrapped in plastic, clearly marked and placed
in a designated area so that allergic children can steer clear of
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Fairfield Country Day School, in Fairfield, Conn., still
serves peanut butter but has eliminated peanuts from its dessert
menu, banning them from brownies, cookies and ice-cream sundaes.
``Who would have thought an old-fashioned favorite like peanut
butter and jelly could be considered so dangerous?'' said Robert
Vitalo, the Fairfield headmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Among public schools, Mount Kisco Elementary School in
Westchester County, and the Cos Cob, Conn., Elementary School have
set aside a peanut-free table that is scrubbed down before and
after meals. Similar preventive measures have been taken at schools
in Buffalo; North Andover, Mass.; Orange County, Calif.; and
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite end of the spectrum, the New York City public
school system, the nation's largest with more than a million
children, has remained immune to the peanut phenomenon _ largely
because no one has complained.
</P>
<P>
   In city schools, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are still
offered as a cold-lunch option in every school nearly every day,
said a spokesman, J.D. Larock. When peanut butter is not the choice
of the day, it is available on request, he said. ``There's peanut
butter aplenty in our system'' Larock said. Peanuts are not served,
but that's because they are a choking hazard, he added.
</P>
<P>
   While peanut butter has been slow to become an issue at New York
City public schools, the city's private schools have fallen in line
like so many dominoes.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Brossman, a lawyer who represents many New York City
private schools, said schools are concerned that peanut allergies
might qualify as a disability that must be accommodated under the
Americans with Disabilities Act. Neither Brossman nor the Food
Allergy Network knew of any litigation on peanut allergy that has
resulted in a court decision.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent directive by the U.S. Department of Transportation
construed peanut allergies as a disability and ordered airlines to
set up peanut-free zones. That decision may set a precedent for
schools, advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond bans, schools are wrestling with questions like whether
to provide individualized supplies _ say, blocks and sets of wooden
rods for solving math problems _ to children with severe peanut
allergies so they will not be contaminated by the peanut-smeared
hands of classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that a child who has just eaten peanut butter might
hold hands with an allergic child, schools now encourage children
to become compulsive hand-washers.
</P>
<P>
   Another allergist, Dr. Hugh Sampson of Mount Sinai Medical
School in New York City and Burks' collaborator, said that fears of
death from secondhand contamination _ by breathing peanut fumes or
touching peanut residue _ are exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Like the post office putting up the FBI's Most Wanted list,
school kitchens now post pictures and medical profiles of
peanut-allergic children.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of allergic children comb school menus and inspect
cupboards for suspect ingredients, even shadowing their children at
lunch or on field trips.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Food Consultants in Ridgewood, N.J., which supplies meals
to 17 independent schools in New York City and two in New Jersey,
has stopped making peanut butter sandwiches. Instead, the company
supplies schools with ``individually sealed, portion-controlled
packets'' of peanut butter and plastic knives, said Joseph Civita,
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Children make their own sandwiches and throw away the knives to
avoid the risk of sharing contaminated utensils; do-it-yourself
sandwiches are less likely to be picked up inadvertently by
allergic children, the company reasons. It also solicits letters
from manufacturers ensuring that their food is peanut-free.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with other causes of childhood death or illness, the
number from peanut allergies is tiny. In 1995, according the most
recent CDC statistics, 2,880 children died in car accidents and
2,944 in other accidents. Some 200,000 children were hospitalized
with asthma-related illnesses, according to the Department of
Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Max van Gilder, a Manhattan pediatrician, said he had had
only one child with the most severe form of peanut allergy in a
practice spanning 25 years and 2,500 patients. While describing the
reaction as ``a sudden, dramatic and horrible type of death,'' van
Gilder suggested that banning peanut butter was missing the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's peanut butter in the world,'' van Gilder said. ``I
think the issue is that food should be properly labeled.''
</P>
<P>
   Most allergic children, except perhaps the very youngest,
understand that they should not eat peanut butter, he said. It is
the hidden sources that are dangerous, he said, like the chili
laced with peanut butter that killed a Brown University student in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor's shift to a peanut-free school came last spring, at the
instigation of Diane Schechter, whose daughter, now a first-grader,
is severely peanut-allergic, she said. Ms. Schechter approached the
school nurse and administration and canvassed other parents in her
effort to institute the ban. Her argument was that a schoolwide
effort would lessen the anxiety for students worried that they
might unwittingly make her daughter sick, while reducing the stigma
for her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schechter asked that her daughter not be named, for fear of
a backlash. She said the child's allergy had been detected when she
was 8 months old. ``My husband ate a peanut butter sandwich,'' she
said. ``He must have touched her face, because she blew up as if
she had been boxed.''
</P>
<P>
   The child wears a fanny-pack equipped with epinephrine at all
times. Ms. Schechter has made up a list of safe foods, inspected
the cafeteria and called suppliers to ensure their products are
safe.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Alberti, director of the Trevor elementary school, said
that despite some grumbling, the ban was worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it easier on us to be this clear-cut about it,'' she
said. ``We're not talking about her getting the sniffles.''

LEWINSKY STATEMENT COULD HELP CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid the thousands of pages of evidence released by
the House Judiciary Committee is this line from Monica S.
Lewinsky's grand jury testimony: ``I would just like to say that no
one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job for my
silence.''
</P>
<P>
   From the White House point of view, that could turn out to be
one of the most important statements for President Clinton's
defense, undercutting allegations that he suborned perjury and
obstructed justice. But Lewinsky's statement was not quoted in the
original report by independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, although
it was paraphrased.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials Tuesday seized upon such omissions from
the Starr report to show that the prosecutor was presenting a
one-sided story.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that is abundantly clear...is how grossly unfair the
Starr report was in presenting a very one-sided account of the
evidence,'' White House spokesman Michael McCurry said. Starr
``found room for hundreds of salacious details that titillated this
country and embarrassed this country in the world...but it didn't
find room'' for a key quote that helped Clinton's case.
</P>
<P>
   The president's attorneys Tuesday wrote an angry letter to the
House Judiciary Committee, which is considering impeachment
proceedings, saying Starr's report ``significantly distorted''
Lewinsky's testimony and ``is stunning in its silence about
evidence that supports the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, written by Clinton's private lawyer David E. Kendall
and White House counsel Charles Ruff, continued, ``The decision by
Mr. Starr to specifically exclude Ms. Lewinsky's exculpatory
statements and express denials raises grave questions about the
fundamental fairness of the Starr referral.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is true that Starr didn't quote Lewinsky's statement,
that ``no one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job
for my silence,'' his report did paraphrase Lewinsky as saying
``the president never explicitly told her to lie.''
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report then drew its own conclusion: Clinton and
Lewinsky ``both understood from their conversations that they would
continue their pattern of covering up and lying about the
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be a classic case of the White House trying to find a
silver lining in the darkest storm clouds. The evidence released
Monday is filled with damaging statements and other material that
some Republicans say prove that Clinton committed impeachable
offenses. Indeed, the Starr report makes clear that prosecutors
believe Clinton and Lewinsky had an understanding that they would
deny having sexual relations. Even if Clinton never told Lewinsky
to lie, the prosecutors allege that lies occurred as a result of
the understanding.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Lewinsky was pressed by prosecutors on whether
the president encouraged her to lie, she put it this way: ``The
best way to explain how I feel what happened was, you know, no one
asked or encouraged me to lie, but no one discouraged me either.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, with so much focus on the evidence against Clinton,
White House allies have spent much of the last two days trying to
find something good for the president in the more than 3,000 pages
of evidence released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best news for Clinton is that Lewinsky, in her grand
jury testimony, expressed anger at early reports that someone at
the White House helped her write the so-called ``talking points.''
That is the document in which Lewinsky instructed her onetime
colleague Linda R. Tripp to say she did not know anything about an
inappropriate advance by Clinton toward Kathleen Willey, a former
White House volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky told the grand jury that she wrote the talking points
on her own, without help from Clinton or anyone else at the White
House, according to the following excerpts of her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Did you talk with anyone in an effort to get assistance
editing or writing or getting approval for what is in the talking
points?
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you ever talk with the president about the talking
points?
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky: No.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Lewinsky is asked whether she talked with
Bruce Lindsey, the White House deputy counsel. Earlier this year,
some media reports suggested Lindsey helped Lewinsky write the
talking points or had done something else to help the president in
the Lewinsky case. But Lewinsky denied ever talking with him
substantively.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you ever talked to Bruce Lindsey?
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky: No. I may have said hello to him in the hall, but I _
but _ just in passing.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky reportedly implied in secretly recorded conversations
with Tripp &UR;  &LR; that another Clinton friend, Vernon E. Jordan Jr., was
helping her get a job in order to keep her quiet. But Lewinsky told
the grand jury: ``I attributed things to Mr. Jordan that weren't
true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (Tripp) that, you know, at various times, the President
and Mr. Jordan told me I had to lie,'' Lewinsky testified. ``That
wasn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat, said
Tuesday that Starr excluded a lot of exculpatory, or exonerating,
evidence from his report that could help the president. Moreover,
Meehan said there is much more such evidence in the 16 boxes of
evidence yet to be released.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was a normal legal case, I think the prosecution would
be potentially cited by a judge for withholding exculpatory
evidence,'' said Meehan, a former prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what happens when you have a prosecutor with no limits
to budget and authority and leak out information that presents
their best case,'' Meehan said. ``They leaked everything they had
that reflected poorly on the president. I thought they would have
saved something.''

LEGENDARY GUITARIST JIMMY PAGE SPEAKS OUT, TOURS WITH LED ZEPPELIN
MATE 
</HEADLINE>
 PAGE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY RODGERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask any rock musician with a few years under his or her belt for
the short list of truly legendary guitarists, and the name Jimmy
Page is sure to be mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage in the '70s with his monster band, Led Zeppelin, Page
was a force to be reckoned with. Clad in black or white outfits
adorned with flaming dragons or celestial bodies, he attacked his
instrument with such speed that his fingers blurred.
</P>
<P>
   With a flair for the dramatic, Page would saw on the strings of
his Les Paul with a violin bow on occasion, and prance about as he
launched booming musical missiles into the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Page had the licks and chutzpah to go toe-to-toe
with the orgasmic vocals of Robert Plant (who joins Page for a
performance in Phoenix on Thursday).
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two decades after Led Zeppelin's demise, Page and Plant
are on tour together _ their second in four years.
</P>
<P>
   This outing ostensibly supports the pair's energetic new album,
``Walking Into Clarksdale.'' But as Page explained in a recent
interview with ``The Republic,'' it also reprises Zeppelin's
classic catalog in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   Page, 54, spoke via phone from a tour stop in Vancouver, B.C.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUESTION: On your ``Walking Into Clarksdale'' album and current
tour, you and Robert have stripped things back to a four-piece
band. What inspired you to move in that direction?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANSWER: It was the most obvious thing to do, really. We'd
always played that way; it felt (like) the most natural combination
of all, to play as that unit. It is basically a four-piece. . . .
The whole meat and potatoes of the show really is improvisation.
Not lengthy improvisation _ the songs change shape. They're totally
recognizable but then people can see, hey, they're thinking about
that and that's cool. . . . What we're really doing now is really
going out there and doing a serious rock and roll set. . . . Every
set's different every night. If you think about it, that's what
I've done all the way back to the Yardbirds.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: You've loaded up your set list on this tour with Led
Zeppelin classics as well as some tunes from your new album. Why
the decision to go that way?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: We teamed up for the last tour, ``Unledded,'' and we went
around with the orchestras and the ethnic musicians. . . . We
revisited a lot of numbers like ``Kashmir'' and gave them new
colors and new textures. . . . In the (current) set, we're doing
two numbers that one would have assumed would have been on the
``Unledded'' tour _ ``Going to California'' and ``Tangerine.''
Everything seems to work to the opposite of what people would
expect of you! Now, having done the new album, the songs that are
employed from it fit well within the set. They're presented in the
best places, so it doesn't differ at all within context. And the
rest of the material obviously is the songs that we wrote and
performed from the past and the songs that we feel good playing.
That's the most important thing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Reports from the tour indicate that you two are in your best
musical form in years. Any reason behind that? Perhaps working a
bit of rust off the last time around, and now you're really in
stride?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: No, there was no rust on the last time around; the only
problem was that there was so much information for the audience to
take in with two orchestras going at once with the rock band
underneath. . . . But now it's back to how I've always been used to
playing, which is exploring the dynamics of the guitar so they can
hear every nuance, every subtlety and every attack. . . . It's now
totally up front, and you can't miss it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: I'm curious about the chemistry between you and Robert these
days, as opposed to when you worked together years ago. With the
passage of time, is it still the same basic feeling?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: It's probably more focused now because we've learned from
the past. We know what we are, and we know how to get the best out
of each other, really.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: That's on both a personal and a musical level?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: Oh, absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: How far did the two of you drift apart during that period
(1980 to 1994)?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: About as far a you could go. . . . If you look at what one
was doing and what the other was doing, it was pretty obvious that
we'd gone that far, and we sort of came back around.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: On a personal level, too?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: I would say in every way. But as it came together, like
walking around the edge of a circle in two different directions, we
bonded up.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: It must have been an imposing feeling going into that
rehearsal studio in north London that first day (Page's first
studio session with Plant in 14 years).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: It was sort of a make or break day, but it didn't bother me.
I knew what could be done, what would be done.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: You've been at this game more than 30 years. Is it more of a
challenge to motivate yourself to compose and tour?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: There are certain dates as you go through a tour _ key
dates, magical dates, and they're so good. The most important thing
for me is to keep re-creating that and getting better and better.
That's the prime motivation for me, to keep topping the previous
show. You keep building to a point where it gets scary.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: You've always seemed like a guy who doesn't mind sitting in
the studio and twisting knobs, and you're a wonderful performer.
Does one or the other pull at you stronger as you get a bit older?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: I'm sort of addicted to the adrenaline buzz that you get
playing live. I realize now that it's such a part of my addictive
personality that I have to do that. . . . When you're in the studio
working with the remasters (of Led Zeppelin material), that's
purely technique.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: You've brought so many musical influences to the table over
the years; I understand you traveled to Brail before this tour.
What types of music currently intrigue you?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: In Brazil, there's the sort of music that most people are
aware of . . . those beautiful chord sequences and melodies which
are astonishing. . . . But really beneath it all, there's this sort
of trance drumming. Where I go in Brazil, there's a river that
intersects a village, so there's a hill on each side of it. And
where I stay is on the far side, where you can hear the drums going
on all night, where they're having their . . . magical ceremonies,
healing ceremonies. And you can't escape it. There's two things
there, really: rhythm and sex. And you breathe it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Over the years, a Middle Eastern flavor has crept into your
music. What are the roots of that for you and Robert?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: Again, it's rhythm. What we're talking about now from Brazil
and Morocco is basically African. It's what came over here to be
blues and then rock and roll. . . . We found that within Arabic
music, Moroccan music, there were some extremely seductive lines _
especially when they started to bring in strings and orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: In the years since Zeppelin broke up, you've teamed with
Paul Rodgers in The Firm as well as David Coverdale. Were those
outings satisfying and/or frustrating?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: Working with Robert Plant, Paul Rodgers and John Miles as
well, on the ``Outrider'' tour . . . and then David Coverdale _
they're all tremendous singers and I've been lucky to work with
people like that.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Was there a reason that you came full circle back to Robert
Plant?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: It was obvious that the two of us had a chemistry which I
didn't have with the other people, though we worked well together.
There was a particularly special chemistry that Robert and I had
together. . . . It was clearly evident when we came back together
and wrote two songs on the first day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Led Zeppelin broke so many rules and set so many precedents
as to how rock and roll is performed and marketed. You ignored the
singles charts and tipped the financial scales toward the artist
and away from the concert promoter. What possessed you to push the
status quo instead of playing it safe?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: Because the music was more important than the business. . .
. The music said more than what the business was going to say. In
those days, we didn't want to break up an album and have singles.
These days, singles are really of the utmost importance. But in
those days, you have to see it as what it was: We just believed
collectively and individually in what we were doing. . . . We
didn't want to be sidetracked with any sort of nonsense. The album
would go out, and we'd just do the concerts, and that was that.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: With the ``Clarksdale'' album getting good airplay and the
two of you in fine form, have you and Robert looked past this
current tour?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: We've got a couple of plans, actually, and they're
diametrically opposed. Not that we're disagreeing, it's just that
there's two different things to do. . . . Both projects are very
interesting, but I'd rather it come as a bit of a surprise.

WHITE NEIGHBORHOODS BIGGEST CAMPAIGN GIVERS, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The vast majority of campaign contributions comes
from neighborhoods that are populated predominantly by white
people, according to a report to be released today.
</P>
<P>
   The study, called ``The Color of Money,'' was conducted by
Public Campaign, a national citizens group that is pushing for
overhauling the campaign-finance system. A spokeswoman for the
group said that while the results were not surprising, this was the
first time a study has been done by zip codes and racial makeup.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, for example, 49 percent of the residents or
workers in one upper-income, mostly white zip code area _ 02110 in
downtown Boston _ made contributions, which totaled $1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, only 0.11 percent of the residents the state's 14
minority-dominated zip code areas made contributions totaling
$384,831, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Public Campaign said the calculations are based on 1995-96
campaign figures and census data. The group counted
African-Americans, Asian-Americans, Indian-Americans and Hispanics
as ``people of color,'' or minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``People of color are largely absent from what has become one of
the most crucial elements of the election process, namely, campaign
financing,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at 2,500 zip codes nationwide in which
minorities make up more than 50 percent of the population. In those
areas, only eight out of every 10,000 people give contributions of
$200 or more, the study said. By comparison, four of every 100
people in the top-giving zip codes gave such a contribution, the
study said.
</P>
<P>
   Independent analysts said Tuesday that 80 percent of federal
campaign contributions come from about 0.50 percent of the
population. Thus, the finding by Public Campaign that most
contributions come from areas dominated by whites is ``certainly
what you'd expect,'' said George Pillsbury, director of the
Massachusetts Money in Politics project.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign contributors do not identify themselves by race, thus
making it impossible for Public Campaign to determine the race of
the specific donors in the various zip codes. But Public Campaign
officials noted that one recent survey of major 1996 contributors
found that 95 percent were white and 81 percent were male.

TJC COS. SAYS WARM WEATHER COULD TRIM CLOTHING SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of TJX Cos. fell nearly 16 percent Tuesday after the
offprice retailer warned Wall Street that unseasonably warm weather
in the country could hurt fall clothing sales.
</P>
<P>
   The stock of the Framingham, Mass. operator of such chains as
T.J. Maxx and Marshalls dropped 3 3/8 to close at 18 3/16 on the
New York Stock Exchange Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, TJX remains confident that it will beat its
third-quarter performance of last year, when it earned 31 cents per
share.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very comfortable with analysts's earnings estimates''
for this year's third quarter, said Sherry L. Lang, TJX's manager
of investor and government relations.
</P>
<P>
   TJX is expected to earn 37 cents per share for the quarter,
according to a poll of 11 analysts surveyed by First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Going into September, TJX had projected that sales this month
would rise 3 percent at stores open at least a year, but
preliminary data suggest only a 1 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   September sales in the Northeast and Midwest have been hurt by
unseasonably warm weather, but in regions where the weather hasn't
been a factor, sales have been far stronger _ up a projected 8
percent on the West Coast, Lang said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of recent volatility on Wall Street, investors have been
quick to react to any news that might affect a company, said
Raymond James analyst Michael T. Glover.
</P>
<P>
   Glover noted that several retailers have warned that
third-quarter results might not meet expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investor confidence is very vulnerable now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that TJX is ``modestly behind plan'' is in no way
``any reason to panic,'' Glover said.

ALLISON FACES DECISION ON BRUINS' OFFERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It has reached ``take it or leave it'' time in the
Jason Allison saga.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Bruins rejected a counterproposal put forth by
Allison and his representative, Bob Gerow. Tuesday the player who
led the Bruins in scoring last season turned down the club's latest
offer. Assistant general manager Mike O'Connell said there are
three offers on the table _ for a one-year deal, for a year plus an
option, and for three years. That's it, said O'Connell: He can take
his pick of those or take nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choices are 1, 2, or 3 or don't play for us,'' said
O'Connell. ``We don't feel there's any need to go any further. He
can pick the one with security, some security, or no security. We
feel we're giving him good options and the ability to make a good
living.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerow said he and Allison will now begin looking at other
opportunities _ namely, playing in the International League or
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those terms, I guess we're leaving it then,'' said Gerow.
``It would be nice if another team in the NHL would sign him to an
offer sheet or trade him, which Mike said they won't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Bruins' four unsigned Group 2 free agents, Allison is the
most important. Coach Pat Burns, who has remained silent on the
subject since camp opened, for the first time expressed his
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't replace Jason Allison; we can forget that,'' said
Burns. ``This guy proved a lot last year and was one of our top
centermen. I don't have anybody to replace him. We're going to have
to find a way to play around that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had somebody I could take in this lineup here and say,
`Now you do exactly what Jason Allison did last year,' I'd be
kidding myself and I'd be kidding the player. The guy accomplished
a lot, and we have to recognize that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating for us, but we have to turn the page and
continue going. I think it's going to be even more frustrating if
we ever do sign him a couple of days before the start of the season
and he hasn't had these intense workouts like everybody else. He's
going to be four, five steps behind everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed late last week that defenseman Kyle McLaren would
agree on a one-year deal, but that has fallen through. O'Connell
said the sides are divided by philosophy more than money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened,'' said O'Connell. ``We're not that
far apart.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said management has had no contact with the
representative for unsigned forward Anson Carter. Ted Donato, also
a Group 2 free agent, remains at home waiting to be traded.

CLINTON STRESSES `EFFECTIVE ACTION' TO SPUR RECESSION-WEARY JAPAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With economic turmoil spreading, President Clinton on
Tuesday pressed the new prime minister of Japan to spur growth and
shore up its banks with public money so the world's second-largest
economy can lead an Asian recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel for three hours with
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, Japan's sixth leader in six years.
</P>
<P>
   No concrete plan emerged from the session but Obuchi
acknowledged that actions by recession-weary Japan could have
``major implications on economies in Asia as well as the whole
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The president told reporters before the session that Japan faces
an ``increasingly complicated political situation'' because of its
politically divided Diet, the sole law-making authority. ``So they
have to work out what is politically possible,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The divided parliament in Japan has left financial reforms in
limbo even as the Asian recession spread across the Pacific Rim,
nearly capsizing Russia and edging toward Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton in recent days has stepped up calls for a coordinated
international plan to stave off a deepening economic downturn and
warned that the United States cannot remain immune. Western nations
repeatedly have pressured Japan to cut taxes to jumpstart economic
growth and to assist its financially troubled banks to help lead
the world out the downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think steps we take in Japan to address the issue of (the)
financial system has very large implications worldwide,'' Obuchi
said. ``So I think with this understanding, I intend to make my
very best effort at addressing this issue. I am convinced that we
will be able to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Summers, Clinton's deputy treasury secretary, said
Clinton ``stressed the urgency of swift and effective action to
stimulate domestic demand-led growth and strengthen the financial
system in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers said Obuchi assured Clinton that ``it was his intention
to take appropriate measures to secure an early turnaround in the
Japanese economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers said Clinton also cited the United States' own history
to ``emphasize the need for the Japanese financial authorities to
infuse public money swiftly and in sufficient amounts into Japanese
banks to ensure they were able to continue lending on a strong and
sustainable basis.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said Clinton also
pressed for continued deregulation in the Japanese economy. She
said the U.S. this month will send Japan a list of steps it would
like to see taken in sectors such as telecommunications,
pharmaceutical, energy, housing and construction.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Obuchi met privately for nearly one hour before
being joined by staff members for an extended two-hour session. The
initial meeting for tea was scheduled for only 10 minutes but ran
long as the two men struck up a friendly tone, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The president invited Obuchi to come to Washington next year for
an official visit.
</P>
<P>
   The two met in a hotel suite at the Waldorf Astoria after foggy
weather canceled a planned meeting in nearby Terrytown at the
Rockefeller family estate.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi replaced Ryutaro Hashimoto two months ago amid a
political churning that left few people happy with his selection.
Obuchi even joked to Clinton about ``cold pizza,'' which was how he
was described, prompting Clinton to say he had cold pizza the night
before, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Obuchi also discussed North Korea's recent missile
launch, which they deemed a ``matter of serious concern.'' The
launch indicated that North Korea's multi-staged rocket has the
ability to hoist weapons at least as far as Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In his meeting with reporters Clinton was peppered by questions
about the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal, but he refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important that I focus on what I'm doing for the
American people and that's what I intend to do,'' the president
said.

REPUBLICANS VOTE DOWN MINIMUM-WAGE INCREASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., S.C., Fla., N.Y., Pa., Utah, Iowa, Vt.)  (mk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans Tuesday killed any chance of
increasing the minimum wage this year, voting down a bill they said
would hurt small businesses because it would extract too much too
soon after the wage increase of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   They also said that Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., the measure's
sponsor, was using the vote as a political trap to force them on
the record against a wage increase in an election year. Kennedy
ceded the point. ``It is a defining issue,'' he told reporters
after the vote. ``It ought to be an election issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would have raised the minimum wage by 50 cents in
January and another 50 cents the following year, taking it to $6.15
an hour from $5.15 over two years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans expect any public-relations fallout from this vote
to be blunted in the next couple of weeks by their passage of a tax
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's vote was 55-44, with 53 Republicans and two Democrats
_ Ernest Hollings of South Carolina and Bob Graham of Florida _
voting against the wage increase. Forty-two Democrats and two
Republicans _ Alfonse D'Amato of New York and Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania, both up for re-election in heavily unionized states _
voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, who also voted for the 90-cent-an-hour wage increase
approved in 1996, has been careful to support an array of
consumer-related issues as he faces re-election this year. He has
courted labor unions, even if that has meant turning his back,
temporarily, on the business and banking interests that have
traditionally supported him and given him millions of dollars since
he became chairman of the Banking Committee in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard-working people are entitled to make a living wage,''
D'Amato said after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said his bill would have raised wages for 12 million
Americans who worked 40 hours a week and still made only $10,700,
which is $2,900 below the poverty level for a family of three.
</P>
<P>
   In an impassioned speech on the Senate floor before the vote,
Kennedy characterized the issue as one of ``fairness, decency and
equity.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kennedy spoke, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, observed with
some amusement, ``I always enjoy listening to wealthy members of
Congress talk about how the minimum wage is going to benefit
society.'' He added, ``Some of us have actually worked for the
minimum wage in our lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans characterized the measure as a cynical move by
Kennedy, who, they said, had two motives: to make it appear that
Republicans opposed helping low-income families and to try,
procedurally, to kill a bill to overhaul the bankruptcy system,
which Kennedy strongly opposes. That bill, to which the minimum
wage issue was attached, is expected to pass the Senate on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who is pushing the bankruptcy
measure, urged his colleagues to defeat the minimum-wage increase
not on the merits but because of the danger it posed to his bill.
``This is a poison pill to destroy the bankruptcy-reform
legislation,'' Grassley warned.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, little groundwork had been laid to build public or
congressional support for a minimum-wage increase this year.
President Clinton mentioned it in his State of the Union address in
January, but as the Monica Lewinsky scandal began to engulf him, he
did little to follow up. This was in stark contrast to his actions
in 1996, when he twisted arms and triumphantly pushed through the
Republican-controlled Congress the first wage increase in six
years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton issued a statement Tuesday saying he was disappointed in
the vote. But virtually no one expected the measure to pass the
Senate, and House Democrats had not even bothered to introduce
corresponding legislation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With so little organized support for the bill, the multiple
business lobbyists who usually swarm around to defeat measures like
this had a fairly easy time disposing of this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you can defeat a hike in the minimum wage six weeks
before an election, that's impressive,'' said R. Lee Culpepper, a
lobbyist for the National Restaurant Association, which represents
restaurant owners and had a deep stake in preventing the bill's
passage.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in a room just off the Senate floor, Culpepper wore a
sticker on his lapel that said ``Too much too soon,'' an easily
digested message that many senators endorsed.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., made this point in the debate.
Noting that he had supported wage increases in the past, he said he
opposed this one because, combined with the 1996 increase, it would
raise the minimum wage by 45 percent in less than five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we raise the minimum wage,'' Jeffords argued, ``we make
it more difficult for these businesses to justify hiring
inexperienced, unskilled and untrained workers.''

RUSSIA OPPOSES KOSOVO INTERVENTION, NEW FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS AT
U.N.  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Moscow is opposed to any efforts to use outside
force to end the war in the Serbian province of Kosovo, Russia's
new foreign minister said Tuesday in his first speech to world
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Igor Ivanov, the minister, also warned against the use of
military force on Iraq, and raised the possibility that Russia will
argue in the coming Security Council debate that the Iraqis are no
longer a threat to their neighbors and therefore deserve some
relief from economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Both Iraq, which has ended most cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors, and Kosovo, the subject of a resolution proposed by
France and Britain that would authorize the use of NATO forces, are
urgent matters before the Security Council. Diplomats involved in
the negotiations surrounding the Kosovo resolution are focused on
how to get the measure through the Council without provoking a
Russian veto.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov is a former deputy to Yevgeny Primakov, the new Russian
prime minister, who some Western diplomats expect to take a
consistently harder line on foreign policy issues of importance to
Moscow. Primakov, a former foreign minister, has had a long
relationship with Iraq, and the Russians consider themselves
indispensable players there and go-betweens with Iraq's enemies.
</P>
<P>
   On the former Yugoslavia, Russians have long been opposed to the
intrusion of NATO, which is now threatening to intervene as the
forces of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia carry out an
increasingly deadly campaign against ethnic Albanian separatists.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the 53rd session of the U.N. General Assembly
Tuesday, Ivanov, a 53-year-old career foreign ministry official who
is regarded as a loyal Primakov associate, spoke out generally
against military solutions and seemed to be indirectly criticizing
the United States for usurping the power of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have in mind are attempts to undercut the
Charter-stipulated powers of the Security Council to use coercive
measures,'' he said. ``We must not allow creation of a precedent
involving the use of military power in a crisis without the support
of the Security Council.''
</P>
<P>
   Narrowing in on Kosovo, Ivanov said that ``political logic must
prevail'' in solving the civil conflict. American officials agree
that they would prefer a political solution, but take the position
that Washington and NATO have the authority to use force without a
Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of power to resolve the Kosovo conflict might lead to
a big war with unpredictable consequences for the Balkan region and
Europe at large,'' Ivanov said. In his speech, he went out of his
way to praise regional organizations that he said are useful in
problem-solving, mentioning the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States,
but conspicuously leaving out NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to Iraq, Ivanov said that Russia was concerned about
rising tensions in the region, where Iran and Afghanistan are now
armed against each other over a common border. In this context, the
Russian foreign minister called for a new look at the embargo that
has crippled Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt, Iraq must fully travel its part of the road, resume
full cooperation with the United Nations Special Commission and the
IAEA and implement relevant Security Council resolutions,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, the Security Council must adequately assess
the situation related to the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction and answer the question whether or not that country
still poses a threat to regional and international security after
seven years of work carried out there by U.N. inspectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov also made a strong plea to India and Pakistan, without
naming them, to adhere to treaties banning the testing and spread
of nuclear weapons and arms technology.
</P>
<P>
   He repeated Primakov's pledge to press the lower house of the
Russian Parliament for ratification of the Start II arms treaty
with the United States. Until that arms-reduction pact is ratified,
there is little likelihood of opening new talks on further cuts in
the two nations' arsenals.

   CLINTON-ASSESS (Washington) _ Throughout his hours of testimony
broadcast on Monday, Clinton dodged and weaved and bobbed. It was a
spectacle that would have destroyed most politicians, beamed across
television screens with labels warning of its explicit sexual
content and rife with literally incredible details and denials. It
was recorded in the most secret forum in Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence,
then released to the world by the president's political enemies in
the hope that it would damage him severely. Yet on Tuesday morning,
as he has so often before, Clinton once again bobbed up, buoyed by
a bipartisan consensus among politicians that after months of
bleeding, the president may have finally had a good day. By Todd S.

AMERICAN AIRLINES TRYING TO SPICE UP AIRBORNE FARE
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: Story also moving in ``f'' financial category) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL BOURGEOIS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Although it's doubtful anyone will ever say, ``Oh
honey, what say we book a flight for dinner?'' Fort Worth-based
American Airlines is at least making an effort to improve the state
of airborne fare.
</P>
<P>
   The airline giant Tuesday opened its 10th Chef's Conclave, a
two-day gathering of 15 of America's premier cooks aimed at finding
ways to make air-cruiser cuisine tastier and healthier.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Britton, American's new director of food and beverage
services, agrees it is a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the problem: Try taking food that was prepared half a day
and a thousand miles away, keep it warm or cold, avoid turning it
into something resembling rubber, cardboard or mush, and serve it
with a smile at 35,000 feet to tired, cranky travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Many say that it's a miracle it's as good as it is, and many
food professionals would take the route of that Dallas-based
airline and say, ``Nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are keenly interested in generating a dialogue about what's
happening in the restaurant business and about larger trends about
eating in the United States and about what they see evolving in
food and food service,'' Britton said.
</P>
<P>
   From the conclave's start 10 years ago, the chefs' general
advice has been: Do only what can be done well. Keep it simple,
fresh and recognizable.
</P>
<P>
   But within that context, Britton said, the goal is to keep up
with trends, update menus, improve quality and service.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, he said, the chefs' input has led to healthier,
lighter meals, meatless entrees and more regional cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some suggestions from last year led to some new entrees in
first and business class across the Atlantic. Some of the chefs
worked quite intensely with us,'' Britton said.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Douglas, director of menus for American, said the airline
is looking at the possibility of giving passengers more choices of
food, such as salad bars and sandwich bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want more control,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for what the airline hopes to gain through this week's
conclave, Britton said it's a trade secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission is really safe, reliable transportation,'' Britton
said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, as one of the top air carriers in the world there
is an expectation of good food and good service.
</P>
<P>
   ``There also is an expectation among our customers that we will
continue to try and get better. There is a higher expectation level
than with the so-called low-cost, low-fare carriers even if our
prices are competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Britton said American spends $10 to $20 per meal for domestic
first-class flights. It's a little higher for overseas flights, and
considerably less for meals in business class or in coach _ an area
the airline refers to as ``the main cabin.''
</P>
<P>
   Across all classes, the airline spends an average of $8 on food
and beverages for each passenger, Britton said. Other major
carriers typically spend $4 to $5 per passenger, and the nuts-only
carriers spend about 20 cents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The chefs include Texas range-meisters Robert Del Grande of
Houston's Cafe Annie and the Dallas duo of Dean Fearing from The
Mansion on Turtle Creek and Stephan Pyles of Star Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   The Left Coast/Southwestern contingent includes Alice Waters of
Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif.; Bradley Ogden of The Lark Creek
Inn in Larkspur, Calif.; Wolfgang Puck of Hollywood's Spago
Restaurant; and Mark Miller of the Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   Other notables include: Allen Susser of Allen's Restaurant in
Aventura, Fla.; Jasper White of Legal Sea Foods in Boston;
Chicagoans Nancy Barocci of Convito Italiano and Michael Foley of
Printer's Row; and the New York City medley of Larry Forgione of An
American Place, Douglas Rodriguez of Patria Restaurant and Jonathan
Waxman of Bryant Park Grill.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans' Paul Prudhomme of K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen
provides the Cajun/Creole influence.

 &HT;      SENATE SCRUTINIZES BP-AMOCO MERGER
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Ron Eckstein  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Sept. 22 -- Downtown Chicago, now the refining and
marketing home base of the Amoco Corporation, would retain the
American headquarters of one of the world's largest petroleum
companies if British Petroleum's proposed purchase of Amoco is
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Steven W. Percy, chairman and chief executive officer of BP
America, told a U.S. Senate subcommittee Tuesday that he expects
the deal to be approved by the end of this year -- allowing BP
America to close its offices in Cleveland as the new BP-Amoco
transfers its corporate offices to Chicago by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is expected to displace about 6,000 BP and Amoco
employees in more than 30 offices around the world, said George S.
Spindler, senior vice president of Amoco. About 1,000 BP employees
in the Cleveland area will lose their jobs, and offices in Houston
and London are expected to be the next hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing brought about mixed emotions in Ohio Republican Sen.
Mike DeWine, chairman of the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Business
Rights and Competition. While DeWine did not oppose the
acquisition, he expressed concerns about future petroleum mergers,
consumer choice, foreign policy issues, and the loss of a major
employer in his state's largest city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The petroleum industry is one of the most important sectors of
our economy, both in terms of its economic impact and our national
security. Accordingly, it is the responsibility of Congress to
carefully monitor structural changes in this market to insure
consumers have as many choices as possible,'' DeWine explained.
``As a senator from Ohio ... I am particularly troubled by BP's
decision to move its corporate headquarters out of Cleveland.''
</P>
<P>
   Percy said BP is offering a severance package to its employees
in Cleveland that may be the best in the industry. The company is
also creating a $1 million economic development fund to stimulate
job growth in the city, and will make $2 million worth of
contributions to Cleveland community programs through the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine went on to discuss the trend of consolidation within all
levels of the petroleum industry, including exploration,
production, refining and retail. For example, Texaco and Shell have
consolidated their retail operations, and British Petroleum and
Mobil have an alliance in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As these companies consolidate, many are also beginning to
specialize on only one area of the industry. DeWine said the
BP-Amoco merger appears to be another step in the direction of that
trend.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine and Democrat Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, ranking member of
the committee sent a letter documenting their concerns to Federal
Trade Commission Chairman Robert Pitofsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned bout the possible impact of the proposed
BP-Amoco deal and its competitive implications for the petroleum
industry,'' DeWine and Kohl wrote. ``We are especially anxious
about its possible effect on local retail markets. Accordingly, we
urge you to give careful scrutiny to this deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a spokesman for DeWine said the deal is expected to
approved.

<P>
   BP announced its $48-billion-dollar deal on August 11 -- which
would create the largest industrial merger in history. Once the
merger is completed, BP service stations throughout the U.S. would
be re-branded, making Amoco the national brand in this country for
BP Amoco. The new company will employ about 90,000 people worldwide
and about 40,000 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   American shareholding could be as high as 50 percent when the
transaction closes, Percy said.
</P>
<P>
   The American branches of both companies are the descendants of
John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil trust in Cleveland, established
in 1870. By 1881, Rockefeller's empire controlled about 90 percent
of the petroleum industry in the United States. In 1911, the
Supreme Court forcibly separated Standard Oil into 34 separate
businesses, claiming it violated antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   The largest fragment was Standard Oil of Ohio, or SOHIO, which
became BP America in 1987 when BP purchased it. Standard Oil of
Indiana became Amoco in 1985.

   About 22.5 million people watched the videotape of President
Clinton's Aug. 17 grand jury testimony when it was broadcast Monday
on the three major broadcast networks and three all-news cable
networks, according to Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen estimated that for the hours from 9 a.m., when most
networks began their coverage, to 2 p.m., when the broadcasters
returned to normal soap operas, the sum of the average household
rating for all six networks was an 18.8, which translates into 18.6
million homes.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the cable networks, the daytime television average
last season was an 11.3 rating (about 11.1 million homes) for the
hours from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. The average for the three broadcast
networks was 13.0 Monday during the testimony hours.
</P>
<P>
   More people watched CBS News' coverage than any other. CBS had
an average rating for those hours of 5.2, while NBC averaged a 4.5
rating and ABC a 3.3 rating (each rating point represents 994,000
homes).
</P>
<P>
   Although NBC has the highest-rated show leading into the 9 a.m.
time slot, in ``Today,'' CBS has the highest daytime television
ratings generally, so it is possible that people who tuned in for
``The Price Is Right'' or ``The Young and the Restless'' at their
normal hours on CBS stayed tuned to that channel to watch Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cable networks, ratings were roughly nine times higher
than normal. CNN had about 4.1 million homes tuned in, MSNBC 1.1
million and Fox News Channel 650,000.
</P>
<P>
   Coverage of the president's testimony gave CNN its highest-rated
day of the year, for the total day, and the rating for the time
period of the videotape itself was second only to the rating for
the prime-time telecast of Clinton's Aug. 17 speech to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   A comparable recent news event _ a lengthy daytime legal
proceeding of national interest _ was the second day of the O.J.
Simpson murder trial, in 1995 (ABC did not cover the first day).
That drew a combined three-network average of a 14.5 rating from
1:30 to 3 p.m. Eastern time (before the lunch break in the Los
Angeles-based trial) and a 15.0 rating from 4 to 6:30 p.m. Eastern
time.

`SHADRACH': UPLIFTING LESSONS IN A SWEET, TUMBLEDOWN WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(JT) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than half a century after the full employment during World
War II put an end to the Great Depression, that agonizing era is
serving a new generation as a fount of wisdom: Hard times teach
hard but useful lessons.
</P>
<P>
   In films like ``The Grass Harp'' and a new arrival,
``Shadrach,'' a generation raised in prosperity turns to a
difficult past, suffuses it with a romantic glow and gazes with
something like envy on its simple ways while tapping its people for
insights into life's eternal verities, like death.
</P>
<P>
   On more than one level, the slight, sweet, sentimental
``Shadrach'' is a labor of love by Susanna Styron, the film's
director and co-writer, from an autobiographical tale by her
father, William Styron, published in Esquire in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The events of ``Shadrach,'' which unfold in the Tidewater
country of Virginia in 1935, are seen through the eyes of
10-year-old Paul Whitehurst (Scott Terra), a clean-cut,
well-brought-up only child of respectable parents whose best friend
is Little Mole (Daniel Treat).
</P>
<P>
   Little Mole is one of the Dabney clan, descendants of pre-Civil
War tobacco plantation owners who have now plummeted to the
category popularly known as white trash. The boys are unwashed, and
the girls are slatternly, except for young Edmonia (Monica
Bugajski), the apple of Paul's eye. Presiding over this brood are
Trixie Dabney (Andie MacDowell), the beer-swilling, warmhearted
mother (Deborah Hedwall) and Vernon Dabney (Harvey Keitel), the
embittered, foulmouthed, unemployed sire who ekes out a living as a
moonshiner.
</P>
<P>
   For young Paul, life is about to become complicated. His mother
is in the early stages of illness. His parents are called away to a
distant family funeral, and the boy wins permission to spend a few
days with the Dabneys. At the same time, a footsore old black man
is making his weary way north from Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Shadrach (John Franklin Sawyer), and when he reaches
the Dabneys' littered yard after a 600-mile journey, he reveals
that he is a 99-year-old former Dabney slave who has come back to
die and asks to be buried on the grounds of the old plantation,
where the Dabneys still maintain a tumbledown shack.
</P>
<P>
   So Paul and the Dabneys and the incontinent Shadrach set out in
Vernon's rickety car to fulfill the old man's wish, only to be told
by the not unfriendly local sheriff that laws have changed, and it
is now illegal to bury someone on private property.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the sheriff imply that he will shut down Vernon's
still if he is disobeyed; he also puts Vernon in the position of
having to come up with the near-impossible sum of $35 to pay for a
funeral and burial in a cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   As Shadrach sinks toward death and the Dabneys and Paul take
turns tending the old man, the question hangs in the air: Will the
Dabneys (Vernon, that is) honor their promise?
</P>
<P>
   And for Paul, these few days foreshadow his mother's impending
death.
</P>
<P>
   While confronting life and death and growing up, Ms. Styron does
not shy from dealing with segregation, with black and white
children separated in a theater while watching a Stepin Fetchit
comedy, and white men like Vernon using uninhibited language to
designate blacks and President Franklin D. Roosevelt as the source
of their woes.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she evokes the simple decency of people who
manage to retain their fundamental humanity in the face of
hardship.
</P>

HOLLYWOOD LOVES WRITERS (IF THEY SUFFER)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Ivory boasts about the fact that in the many movies he has
made about authors, he has almost never shown one writing. ``I
never even for one second thought of him writing,'' said Ivory of
his latest character, the novelist James Jones, in the new film ``A
Soldier's Daughter Never Cries.''
</P>
<P>
   The image of the miserable outsider, an alcoholic tormented by
writer's block, facing a forbidding black Remington portable in a
seedy hotel room, is a commonplace of films about writers, and
Ivory has always strived to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is a long tradition of movies about writers, and
they present directors with a number of technical and artistic
challenges _ not the least of which is, how do you depict what is
essentially an interior, solitary, intellectual process in a visual
medium like film?
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty in portraying a writer's life, Ivory said, is
that ``there is nothing to be seen.'' The typical writer's
activities are limited, at best. ``Would his eyes narrow, then he
leans forward?'' Ivory asked. ``Then he is not satisfied and he
tears it up?'' Or, ``There's some dramatic thing he witnesses? He
flies into action. He tears his hair out.'' Sometimes, for the sake
of action, the director shows the writer reading his work out loud
to people. ``My experience is writers would rather die than do
that,'' Ivory said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet directors are obviously drawn to these characters: There are
literally dozens of movies about writers, including ``The Life of
Emile Zola,'' ``Henry and June,'' ``Tom &AMP; Viv,'' ``Barton Fink,''
and ``The Shining.''
</P>
<P>
   And now there is ``Permanent Midnight,'' with Ben Stiller as a
heroin-addicted television writer. Woody Allen's latest comedy,
``Celebrity,'' which opened the New York Film Festival on Friday,
centers on a grasping, confused writer played by Kenneth Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   Then, ``Shakespeare in Love,'' with a script by Mark Norman and
Tom Stoppard, about Shakespeare as a young man with writer's block,
is due to be released Dec. 4.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the figure of James Jones, played by Kris
Kristofferson in ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,'' which was
based on Kaylie Jones' novel about her father and opened earlier
this month, is atypical of the form. Jones is apparently untroubled
by self doubt and creative blocks, and cares as much about his
family as his work. Though, like most writers on screen, he
definitely drinks.
</P>
<P>
   The stereotypical writer in movies, said Morris Dickstein,
Distinguished Professor of English at the Graduate Center of the
City University, ``is a person who stays at home a lot and never
goes off to the office, and becomes very moody at unexpected
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the lack of action in most authors' lives is one reason
filmmakers seem to choose alcoholic writers as subjects _ and, of
course, there has been no shortage of boozing writers to portray.
</P>
<P>
   F. Scott Fitzgerald in the 1959 movie ``Beloved Infidel,'' for
instance, and Dorothy Parker in ``Mrs. Parker and the Vicious
Circle'' are only two among many who stagger across the screen.
Drinking makes for ``a much better scene _ whether a cliche or
not,'' said Ivory.
</P>
<P>
   In most films about writers, the artist, by definition a
subversive figure, is somehow punished by failure, both sexual and
commercial, for his outsider status _ something of a German
Romantic notion. ``Henry and June'' (1990) is based on a love
triangle involving the writer Henry Miller, his bisexual wife,
June, and another writer, Anais Nin.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, living in Paris in dire poverty, watches, sometimes with
tears streaming down his face, as June makes love to other men, and
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does have something to do with the status of intellectuals
in our culture,'' said Robert Sklar, professor of cinema studies at
New York University and the author of ``Movie-Made America: A
Cultural History of American Movies.'' In a society that values
enterprise and making money, he said, ``Just living the life of the
writer is a critique of social values. He becomes an ambiguous
figure.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Barton Fink,'' John Turturro, playing a Clifford Odets-like
character, goes to Hollywood to earn money to support his grand
ambitions to found ``a living theater of, about and for the common
man,'' as he puts it. Barton is assigned to write a wrestling
movie. ``Big men in tights, you know the drill,'' the producer
tells him.
</P>
<P>
   Barton seeks the advice of the girlfriend of a Faulkner-like
novelist who is also toiling in the Hollywood fields. ``Bill's
wrestling scenarios are morality tales,'' the woman, played by Judy
Davis, tells Barton. ``He'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot
man-child.'' Finally, Barton gets something down on paper and he
phones his producer. ``I think it's really big _ and important!''
he cries, words most writers have uttered at one time or another.
</P>
<P>
   Dickstein, who is writing a book on the 30s, when many novelists
were lured to Hollywood, said that these films often take the form
of ``the revenge movie, where the writer has been called to
Hollywood and isn't properly used and appreciated, despite the
gigantic amount of money he receives.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer character seems a surrogate for the director who,
too, has inevitably been humiliated by Hollywood. He plays out the
director's own struggle between art and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a sense of failure or opportunism if you go to
Hollywood,'' said Robert Sklar. ``It's a reciprocal disdain.'' In
the 1950 movie ``In a Lonely Place,'' Humphrey Bogart portrays a
writer-turned-Hollywood-hack who is so bitter that when he is asked
to write a screenplay based on a book, he hires a young girl to
read the book to him out loud _ and the girl is murdered.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in almost all movies about writers, Hollywood is a
metaphor for a writer's hell. In ``Barton Fink,'' Barton works in a
dingy hotel room with the wallpaper oozing and peeling ominously
off the walls as he types. At one point, John Goodman, the devil
disguised as an insurance salesman, appears in Barton's doorway
literally engulfed in flames.
</P>
<P>
   The primary punishment for the writer in hell, be it Hollywood
or some other place, is writer's block. ``In `The Shining,'
writer's block leads to insanity,'' said Dickstein. The writer in
the film, played by Jack Nicholson, who has taken a job as the
caretaker of an immense, empty hotel, goes mad and types the same
sentence over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writer's block often seems to be implicitly about impotence,''
Dickstein added. And release from writer's block is often
concurrent with sexual release. In ``Beloved Infidel,'' based on
the book by the gossip columnist Sheilah Graham about her love
affair with Fitzgerald, it only takes a few chaste kisses from her
before Fitzgerald is typing away madly.
</P>
<P>
   It could be the technical difficulties of showing what writers
do, or the self-seriousness of the practitioners, but movies about
writers are often littered with unintentional howlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``An artist should remain poor,'' Cezanne (Vladimir Sokoloff)
says solemnly to his friend, Emile Zola (Paul Muni), in ``The Life
of Emile Zola.'' ``Otherwise his talent, like his stomach, grows
fat and stuffed. I'm sorry, Emile, but I had to say it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They say an author reveals himself subconsciously in his
writings,'' the Sheilah Graham character, played by Deborah Kerr,
says in ``Beloved Infidel.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle,'' Dorothy Parker
recites her poetry to the camera in an incomprehensible drawl,
meant to emphasize her dissoluteness and depression. ``Oh, do you
enjoy Swinburne?'' she asks someone at what is supposed to be a
typical literary cocktail party.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the best howlers of all are in ``Total Eclipse,''
the 1995 film about the love affair between the French poets Paul
Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Rimbaud as a
bratty teen-ager with grandiose ambitions. ``I want the sun! I want
the sun!'' he cries to Verlaine, played by David Thewlis. ``Do you
understand me! I want the sun!''
</P>
<P>
   The most successful of movies about writers are those that make
fun of the form's cliches, like ``The Shining.'' ``I'm outlining a
new writing project,'' Nicholson says, with a smile that is a
mixture of the bland and the mad. ``And five months of peace is
just what I need.''
</P>
<P>
   Every writer, of course, longs for time to write. And, of
course, the audience senses that it's going to be five long months
of horror.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, ``The Shining'' becomes a dark parody of films about
the domestic lives of writers. ``I'm really into my work!''
Nicholson snarls at his wife when she timidly interrupts him. She
ends up paying for her timorous demands on him _ in a big way _
when he axes her to death.
</P>
<P>
   The forthcoming ``Shakespeare in Love'' mocks cliches that
abound in writer films. Shakespeare, played by Joseph Fiennes
(Ralph Fiennes's younger brother), writes frantically with his
quill, scratches his ear while he tries to drum up inspiration and
falls asleep over his desk. ``Where is my play!'' Shakespeare's
producer demands. ``As soon as I find my muse,'' Shakespeare
replies. ``We're at least four acts short, Will, a recipe for
disaster!'' the producer tells him.'' What writer hasn't heard some
version of those words?
</P>
<P>
   When Shakespeare goes to his ``weekly confession'' with an
astrologer-apothecary, he lies down on the couch and complains as
his ``therapist'' says, ``Interesting, interesting,'' and sand
trickles through the hourglass marking the time. ``Words, words,
words,'' Shakespeare moans. And what writer hasn't said that?

STUDY DETAILS COSTS OF RAISING A FAMILY IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With housing and day care consuming half their income,
working parents in Massachusetts earn far less than they need to
cover their families' minimum needs under new standards for
subsistence wages being proposed today.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, for example, a single parent of one infant must earn
$47,244 a year to provide adequate food, housing and full-time care
in the home or in day care facilities, according to the study
released by the Women's Educational and Industrial Union in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   A family of four with two children, one of preschool age and one
attending school, must earn $42,564. The larger family spends less
for basic necessities because it costs less to care for two older
children, one of them in school, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum standards are well beyond the reach of at least 40
percent of low-wage workers in Massachusetts who take home pay
averaging between $14,000 and $35,000 a year, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   Countering the myth that families living outside Boston are
better off, the study found that a subsistence wage for families in
other cities or in rural areas starts around $25,000 and can be
much higher due to high costs of keeping a car running for
transportation to work.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The study is the first to document, by geographic area in
Massachusetts, the true costs of raising a family by providing just
enough for rent, basic meals _ no fast food _ child care and
necessary expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The study _ one of seven state studies in a series being
coordinated by Wider Opportunites for Women, a Washington advocacy
group _ highlights the inadequacy of the minimum wage. It also
shows that such measures of income as the federal poverty
guidelines used to determine food stamp eligibility are outdated at
a time welfare reform has required that women who had been on
public assistance enter the work force.
</P>
<P>
   The findings could be an important tool in crafting policies to
help working families, said Mary Lassen, executive director of the
Women's Educational and Industrial Union, an organization
supporting women and families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that self-sufficiency isn't achieved through
stop-gap measures or short-term solutions,'' she said. ``Strategies
that are going to create ladders to help families move to
self-sufficiency are going to require efforts on the part of many
constituencies within the Commonwealth.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, US workers are benefiting from this country's
seven-year economic boom. Employers are competing for workers,
especially entry-level and service jobs. The unemployment rate has
reached new lows _ Massachusetts jobless rate was 3 percent in
August.
</P>
<P>
   The WEIU study comes weeks after another study that showed many
working families are, nevertheless, losing ground. The study, by
the Tax Equity Alliance for Massachusetts, or TEAM, showed growing
inequality between low-wage earners and the well-paid. Since the
late 1980s, the bottom 20 percent of all wage earners have seen
yearly incomes decline by 9.3 percent, to $14,299 a year. The top 5
percent saw yearly wages rise 10.7 percent, to $233,110.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a deterioration in the quality of life for too many
working families,'' said Jim St. George, TEAM's director. ``If a
recession comes and families still haven't recovered to where they
were in the late 1980s, there'll be a lot of families in really
tough shape.''
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic finding in WEIU's study is the huge impact of
day care costs on the family budget.
</P>
<P>
   As more women have entered the work force since the 1970s, child
care issues _ both finding day care and paying for it _ has become
a pressing issue for more and more single- and two-parent families
at a time rent, health care and other expenses are soaring.
</P>
<P>
   The study estimated subsistence wages needed by four types of
families in 40 different geographic areas.
</P>
<P>
   The two-parent family in Boston with one preschool and one
school-age child must pay $985 a month, or $11,820 a year, for
adequate child care _ that is 28 percent of their subsistence wage
of $42,564, according to the study. Child care expenses exceed rent
payments, which are $839 per month.
</P>
<P>
   It is even more difficult for single parents to make ends meet
on one paycheck. Day care for a single parent with one infant is
$1,445, or $17,340 a year. That is 37 percent of a subsistence wage
of $47,244 a year, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   State subsidies were provided in 1996 to care of some 35,000
children in Massachusetts. Yet while the the Legislature added
about $50 million to state funding for child care over the past two
years, 13,000 children remain on waiting lists due to inadequate
resources to meet the growing demand, said Elaine Fersh, executive
director of Parents United, an organization that seeks grassroots
support from parents.
</P>
<P>
   Fersh stressed that the issue of raising a family should be
thought of not in terms of high child care costs but in terms of
the inadequacy of wages to pay for it. ``While we call (state
funding) a child care subsidiary, it really is a payment that
enables somebody to work. Families, to be self-sufficient, need to
make a higher wage to pay for housing and child care,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fersh said many more families do not qualify for the subsidies
and are barely able to pay for costly child care.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation is also unappreciated as an issue for families
who lack access to public transportation. Transportation costs for
families who ride Boston subways are below $100 a month, but
families outside the city who drive must spend far more _ about
$277 a month _ to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   Adopted in the early 1960s, federal poverty guidelines are
calculated by multiplying a family's food budget by three _ today,
food costs are far less than a third of household budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal guidelines, at least 10 percent of families are
considered ``poor'' by one estimate, said Laura Russell of WEIU,
who wrote the study with Diana Pearce, professor at the University
of Washington in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The federal guidelines, Russell said, are ``irrelevant to
today's society and economy.''

GOVERNOR DECRIES PLEA DEAL IN SHOOTING OF POLICE OFFICER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Gordon Perry pleaded guilty Tuesday to the
August 1997 murder of 24-year-old Epsom Police Officer Jeremy T.
Charron.
</P>
<P>
   Although the plea means that Perry will spend the rest of his
life behind bars with no possibility of parole, it also means he is
spared the ultimate penalty _ death by lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   And that has infuriated the governor and the family of the slain
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, who appointed Attorney General Philip
McLaughlin last year, lashed out in a statement: ``If the brutal
murder of a law enforcement officer in the line of duty is not a
case for capital punishment, I don't know what is.''
</P>
<P>
   Charron's parents were not at the Rockingham County Superior
Court hearing, but were outspoken about the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gordon Perry was allowed to decide to plead guilty and save
his life and Jeremy was not given that option,'' said Fran Charron,
Jeremy's mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction is one of sadness, disappointment, '' said Bob
Charron, Jeremy's father. ``It's my personal feeling and belief
that a grave injustice has been done. We as a society continue to
lose sight of how to punish people for their actions. The judicial
system today compromised itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is pending a judge's approval, which seems likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``He entered into this plea bargain to save his life,'' Perry's
lawyer Richard Guerriero said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Superior Court Chief Judge Joseph Nadeau if he had
anything to say, Perry said, ``I'm sorry for what I did and the
pain I caused the Charron family and friends. I hope you all will
accept my apology.''
</P>
<P>
   The court recently ruled inadmissable incriminating statements
made by Perry to a State Police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the status of the case, the status of the evidence
and considering our primary witness was a co-conspirator, and given
the fact that his testimony would be subject to substantial
attack...it was my judgment that (the agreement) was a reasonable
result in the case,'' McLaughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Asst. Attorney General John Kissinger, a prosecutor in the case,
believes ``a jury would have convicted the defendant of the
underlying defense of capital murder. There are always risks
associated with trials and this case is no exception.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry pleaded guilty to capital murder, a charge of being a
career criminal and four other charges involving theft or robbery,
some of them relating to a Manchester robbery two days before
Charron was shot. The agreement called for sentences totaling 55 to
110 years. Both sides also agreed that Perry would be imprisoned
out of state.
</P>
<P>
   The last execution in New Hampshire was 1939, when Howard Long
of Alton was hanged for the murder of a 10-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   Charron was murdered only hours after returning from the
funerals of two state troopers killed in a shooting rampage in
Colebrook. He had stopped to check a parked car at a swimming hole
in Epsom at about 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Perry was behind the wheel and Kevin Paul, 19,
of Concord, was a passenger. Perry got out and shot Charron three
times, then he and Paul fled as Charron fired back before he died,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Perry and Paul stole a pickup truck, fled north
on Interstate 93, robbed a Campton convenience store, and shot at
pursuing police. They were caught in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   Paul, accused of robbing the store and shooting at officers
during the chase, agreed in June to testify against Perry in return
for reduced charges. He pleaded guilty to armed robbery and
reckless conduct and was sentenced to 16 to 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Perry had a string of robbery and burglary convictions and had
been paroled 10 weeks before Charron's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Epsom Police Chief Roger Amadon said he, for one, would not
accept Perry's apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gordon Perry's belated remorse and sympathy will not return
Jeremy to us, nor will it help heal the scars left by his vicious
act of violence,'' Amdadon. ``Mr. Perry took the life of a vibrant
young police officer without any show of emotion or compassion. A
police officer who devoted his life to commitment and dedication
without compromise.''

<P>
   The release of President Clinton's videotaped grand jury
testimony produced no immediate shifts in public opinion about
Clinton or the issues surrounding his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, according to several polls conducted just after the tape
was televised on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The public is still divided over Clinton's trustworthiness, and
a majority of those polled remain of the opinion that he has lied
under oath about his contacts with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But he continues to receive strong public support for his job
performance. In fact, one poll conducted by Gallup for CNN and USA
Today and one conducted by CBS News showed an increase in the
president's approval rating since the telecast. In the CBS News
poll, 68 percent approved of the way Clinton was doing his job, up
from 59 percent just since the weekend. An ABC News poll showed
Clinton's job approval holding steady at 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Public reaction as to how Clinton had appeared on the videotape
was mixed. Only a quarter of those in an NBC News poll said they
believed that Clinton had told the ``whole truth,'' while 60
percent said they did not. In the Gallup poll, 62 percent said the
president had appeared ``more as someone who is guilty of a crime
and trying to hide something,'' and only 26 percent described his
demeanor as that of someone ``wrongly accused of a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   But while respondents generally felt that the prosecutors had
treated the president ``fairly'' during his testimony, his
avoidance of some questions was deemed ``appropriate.'' Seventy
percent of those questioned by ABC News said he had been right not
to talk about sexual details, and 59 percent said the prosecutors
had been wrong to ask. His anger at repeated questions about his
sexual activity with Ms. Lewinsky was seen as justified by 63
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the CBS News poll, only a fifth of those who watched at least
some of the testimony said it had been more damaging to the
president than expected, and a third said it had been less
damaging. Two-thirds of the viewers said the testimony had had no
effect on their view of him.
</P>
<P>
   But in the NBC News poll, 42 percent said the videotape would
hurt Clinton, while 16 percent said they thought it would help him
and 29 percent said it would have no effect.
</P>
<P>
   The polls were all conducted nationally by telephone on Monday.
NBC News interviewed 508 adults, Gallup 631 adults, and ABC News
523 adults; CBS News interviewed 696 adults who had also been
interviewed over the weekend. The margin of sampling error for each
poll was from four to five percentage points in either direction.
But polls taken on just one day, as these were, are subject to
additional error because of the limited time to reach people.

WHITE HOUSE CHARGES STARR WITH DISTORTING FACTS AND OMITTING
EVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON-REPUBS, CLINTON-REACT, CLINTON-PANEL,
CLINTON-TV-RATINGS, CLINTON-GORE, CLINTON-POLLS) 
(JT) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House and President Clinton's lawyers
complained to Congress Tuesday that Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent counsel, had distorted facts and omitted exculpatory
evidence in his impeachment report against the president.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing letter to the Republican and Democratic leaders of
the House Judiciary Committee, Clinton's lead private attorney,
David Kendall, and the White House counsel, Charles Ruff,
complained that the 445-page Starr report was ``a one-sided and
unfair manipulation of the evidence and the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said that the ``true goal'' of Starr's report was
``to embarrass the president and inflame the public.'' They warned
the Judiciary Committee, which must decide whether to initiate
impeachment hearings against Clinton, to beware of Starr's
selective and faulty presentation of a case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers said that Starr deliberately omitted any
evidence that might undermine his charges of perjury, obstruction
of justice and witness tampering against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff and Kendall specifically cited the testimony of Monica
Lewinsky in her second appearance before a federal grand jury on
Aug. 20, in which she said that no one ever asked her to lie about
her relationship with Clinton and that she was never promised a job
in exchange for her silence.
</P>
<P>
   Those allegations form the basis of two of the 11 potential
grounds for impeachment cited in Starr's referral to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is plain now,'' the president's lawyers wrote, ``that the
Office of Independent Counsel has significantly distorted the
testimony of Ms. Lewinsky, quoting it when it suited the OIC's
purposes and downplaying it or ignoring it when it did not.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter continued, ``The OIC ignored all reasonable standards
of fairness in preparing and drafting its referral. The referral is
stunning in its silence about evidence that supports the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael McCurry, the White House press secretary, pressed the
attack in a briefing in New York, saying that Starr did ``grievous
wrong'' to the president by his selective presentation of facts.
Starr's report ``found room for hundreds and hundreds of salacious
details that, you know, titillated this country and embarrassed
this country in the world,'' McCurry said, ``but it didn't find
room for one sentence from the testimony of Monica Lewinsky, quoted
Tuesday, `I would just like to say that no one ever asked me to lie
and I was never promised a job for my silence.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Charles G. Bakaly III, the spokesman for Starr, declined to
comment on the letter, saying that the issues raised by the White
House and Clinton's lawyers were addressed in the report to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not directly quote Ms. Lewinsky's statement to
the grand jury that she had not been asked to lie. Rather, Starr
summarized her testimony by saying, ``Ms. Lewinsky has stated that
the president never explicitly told her to lie. Instead, as she
explained, they both understood from their conversations that they
would continue their pattern of covering up and lying about the
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The report likewise does not quote her denial that anyone
promised her help finding a job in exchange for her silence. But in
a footnote to the section describing the job search for Ms.
Lewinsky _ which Starr called evidence of an attempt to obstruct
justice _ the report states: ``The arrangement may not be
explicitly spelled out. In this case, for example, there is no
evidence that Ms. Lewinsky received an explicit proposal where
someone said, `I'll give you a job if you lie under oath.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who chairs the Judiciary Committee,
said that he had received the Kendall-Ruff letter and welcomed
future correspondence from Clinton's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the committee's staff told him the lawyers' central
charge of unfair editing of the evidence ``just is not so.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House official said that Clinton's lawyers are still
reviewing 3,200 pages of evidence gathered by Starr during his
seven-month investigation of the Lewinsky affair and made public by
Congress on Monday. The official said that the White House likely
would offer further analysis and criticism of the independent
counsel's case when the review is completed later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a brief picture-taking session in New York with
Keizo Obuchi, the Japanese prime minister, said that he had not
read the Starr report or the rebuttals from his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked whether he was paying attention to the coverage of
the release of the videotape of his grand jury testimony or other
materials from the Starr investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not much,'' the president replied. ``Believe it or not, I
haven't read the report or my lawyers' replies. I think it's
important that I focus on what I'm doing for the American people
and that's what I intend to do.''

PLAN TO KEEP RUSSIAN SCIENTISTS FROM AIDING ASPIRING NUCLEAR POWERS
ANNOUNCED  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian and American officials agreed Tuesday on a
program to discourage Russia's nuclear scientists from leaving for
Iraq, Iran or other aspiring nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to create commercial projects in Russia's closed
nuclear cities, which are off-limits to foreigners and Russians
without special permission.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War, the cities produced nuclear material
and weapons for the Soviet nuclear arsenal, but since the breakup
they have fallen on hard times.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear workers have found themselves without jobs, and wages
have been delayed for those who are employed. Earlier this month,
nuclear workers demanding back pay demonstrated in front of the
atomic energy ministry here.
</P>
<P>
   Under the accord, the United States will help the cities start
commercial, non-military ventures. Up to $30 million is to be
provided through the 1999 budget year.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement covers all 10 of the closed cities. The initial
assistance, however, will concentrate on three: Arzamas-16 near the
Volga river city of Nizhny-Novgorod, Chelyabinsk-70 in the Urals,
and Krasnoyarsk-26 in Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   The accord was signed Tuesday in Vienna by Bill Richardson, the
american energy secretary, and Yevgeny Adamov, the Russian atomic
energy minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to us all that
economic hardship not drive Russian nuclear weapon scientists into
employment in places like Iran and North Korea,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Some specialists, however, said the program was far too limited
given the scale of the problem, which has been aggravated by the
collapse of the ruble and soaring inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Luongo, a former Energy Department official who heads a
non-profit group focusing on Russian security issues, said it would
take months before the first funds can be dispersed because of
congressional reporting requirements in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He said the assistance should be expanded to include, not just
the development of new businesses, but joint efforts to develop
environmental technology and other forms of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the accord, a joint American and Russian panel will pick
the commercial projects that will receive money. American officials
said it was too soon to provide specifics but that the type of
project they had in mind was under way at Arzamas-16, where the
Russians plan to convert a warhead production plant to produce
automotive parts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to investing in commercial ventures, the fund will
be used to train Russian nuclear specialists in business planning.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides also signed a parallel agreement designed to
smooth the way for the United States to purchase uranium removed
from Russian nuclear weapons, another potentially important source
of income for the cash-strapped Russian nuclear complex.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is converting highly enriched uranium from nuclear
warheads into low-enrichment uranium under a 1993 agreement with
the United States. The low-enriched uranium is to delivered to the
United States for use as reactor fuel.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal has snagged over disputes about the terms of sale.
Tuesday's agreement does not resolve all the outstanding
differences, but the Energy Department hopes that it will lead it
commercially-viable arrangement.

THREE HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS KILLED WHEN CAR SKIDS IN RAIN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PEMBROKE, Mass. _ They were field hockey players, nursing home
volunteers, church lectors, and cherished baby sitters. In the
summer, they played teacher, recruiting neighorhood tots for the
desks of their make-believe schoolhouse.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, on the soggy last morning of summer, they were
victims _ three friends, two of them sisters, killed on a slippery
road, their red, green and blue bookbags lying along rain-soaked
Route 53, just south of St. Thecla's Church.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen M. Clancy and Erin M. Darling, both 17, and Erin's
younger sister, 14-year-old Allison Darling, students at Notre Dame
Academy in Hingham, were killed in the early morning accident.
Police said their car spun out of control and into the path of a
pickup truck driven by an off-duty police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never gave anybody any reason to worry,'' said Edward
Clancy said of his oldest child. ``I mean she never went out on
weekends. It's not like you would worry about her in a car. And I
definitely wouldn't worry about her going off to school. You would
think she's just going up the road to school and that there would
be no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The off-duty officer, police sergeant Richard Simmons, and a
fourth passenger in the car, Shannon Courtney, were being treated
at area hospitals last night.
</P>
<P>
   The 7:03 a.m. crash, which the town's police chief described as
the worst he'd ever seen, touched off heart-rending scenes of grief
across the Notre Dame campus, where young girls in parochial school
plaid skirts wept and received counseling, and in the neighborhoods
of the victims, where friends and relatives carried trays of food
and tried to stifle sobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those girls were the kind of kids that you'd want your own
children to emulate,'' said Tina McCabe, who lives across the
street from the Darlings in a handsome neighborhood with basketball
hoops in the driveways and potted flowers on the doorsteps.
``They'd play school in the summer and the little kids would be
their students. They put on plays. You just couldn't ask for a
nicer family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine what they're going to do now. Those kids were
their life and to have them taken away like this is just
unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities, relatives and friends gave this account of the
fatal crash that one eyewitness called ``horrifying, horrifying.
The worst accident I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Erin Darling, Colleen Clancy and Shannon Courtney, all high
school seniors, had been friends for three years, a bond formed at
school and in the carpool their parents established before the
girls learned to drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took turns driving and I can remember when I was in the car
they would ask each other questions about their homework on the way
to school,'' Clancy recalled Tuesday, red-eyed and sipping from a
can of tonic in front of his home. ``We all shared the driving
until they got their licenses and they were all very responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Erin's sister Allison became the group's youngest member late
last month when she enrolled as a freshman at Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, Erin was driving a 1992 Toyota station wagon,
registered to her mother, and after the Darling girls collected
their passengers, Shannon and Colleen, the girls made off for
Hingham, about 15 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Erin and Shannon sat up front, both wearing seat belts, Allison
and Colleen rode in back. Police are not sure whether they were
wearing belts.
</P>
<P>
   They were traveling north on Route 53 in a moderate to heavy
rainfall, when they hit a slightly inclined patch of road, which
Pembroke Police Chief Gregory Wright described as nearly
stream-like in some rain storms.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Simmons was headed south and, conscious after the
crash, told police that the Toyota hydroplaned, sliding across the
double-yellow line and directly into the path of his pickup. The
nose of the pickup slammed into the Toyota's passenger side.
</P>
<P>
   Edith Tracy, who lives down the street from the scene, said she
knew immediately that the ``slap-like'' sound she heard was a car
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing else it could have been at that hour in the
morning,'' Tracy said.
</P>
<P>
   At Notre Dame Academy, school officials called teachers out of
their classrooms and into meetings with grief counselors and clergy
who helped them prepare to deliver the news to their homeroom
students. It was met with stunned silence _ and then an avalanche
of grief.
</P>
<P>
   At the homes and in the neighborhoods of the victims, relatives
and friends began attempts to come to grips with how a day that
began with a routine off-to-school commute could deliver such
life-changing horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just the nicest family,'' said Paul Cina, who lives
two doors down from the Darlings and had been summoned home from
work by his wife after the crash. ``The girls babysat for our kids.
The Darlings have always worked for their kids. Their kids are what
they lived for.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town, Edward Clancy, a state engineer, recited the
academic and civic achievements of Colleen, who was attending
school on an academic scholarship and looked forward to pursuing a
legal career in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``On her learner's permit she had put down that she wanted to be
an organ donor, something I never would have done and I couldn't
believe it,'' Clancy said, between receiving hugs of condolances
from relatives and friends. ``So we called today and we told them
that she would have liked to do that and I think they're working on
that now. She gave to people even in death.''
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame Academy, renowned for its active student body and
competitive curriculum for girls, draws on 40 communities, and
officials said said most students who have their license drive to
school. There is no bus service.

   WASHINGTON _ He began with careful answers about his
understanding of ``the whole truth.'' He ended by saying he wished
he had even more time to answer grand jurors' questions. Throughout
his four hours of sworn testimony broadcast on Monday, President
Clinton dodged and weaved, feinted and bobbed.
</P>
<P>
   It was a spectacle that would have destroyed most politicians,
beamed across television screens with labels warning of its
explicit sexual content and rife with literally incredible details
and denials. It was recorded in the most secret forum in
Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence, then released to the world by the
president's political enemies in the hope that it would damage him
severely.
</P>
<P>
   And yet on Tuesday morning, as he has so often before, Clinton
once again bobbed up, buoyed by a bipartisan _ if sometimes
grudging _ consensus among politicians that after months of
bleeding, the president may have finally had a good day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's his life,'' said Alan Simpson, the retired Republican
senator from Wyoming who now directs the Institute of Politics at
the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. ``His life is
bounding from precipice to precipice like a huge mountain goat,
bridging crevasse after crevasse and people shooting at him with
high-powered rifles and the other side crumbling as he lands, just
like in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's interesting to me is did anybody believe that this man
would testify for four hours and not do well, when it was his
decision to do it?'' Simpson asked.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a big part of Clinton's achievement had to do with
expectations. For days, allies of Kenneth Starr and then
congressional Republicans _ perhaps out of wishful thinking _ had
spread the word that Clinton had lost his cool and raged at his
questioners. Instead, he held his anger mostly in check, and even
seemed broken and humbled at times, as when he confessed, ``I'd
give anything in the world not to have to admit what I've had to
admit today.''
</P>
<P>
   But another part had to do with Clinton himself, and with his
inveterate ability to appear revealing while actually concealing,
to seem to acknowledge even as he technically denies, to control
the terms of discourse even at the hands of dogged prosecutors. In
sum, Clinton is a master communicator and, more than any flat
printed page, the monitor remains his medium.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the president simultaneously testified that he
considered his old friend Vernon Jordan a truthful person and that
he could not remember Jordan's ever telling him that Monica
Lewinsky thought the president might leave the first lady some day.
Jordan testified that he told the president that Ms. Lewinsky
believed just that _ something no ordinary husband would be likely
to forget.
</P>
<P>
   But as the nation long ago learned, Bill Clinton is no ordinary
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good confidence man,'' said William Bennett, the former
education secretary whose new best-selling book, ``The Death of
Outrage,'' bemoans a national moral climate that would overlook
Clinton's misdeeds. ``He's good at what he does, and he wouldn't be
where he is if he weren't very smart.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Bennet added, ``The public likes him.''
</P>
<P>
   So it does. Some overnight polls showed that the president's job
approval ratings held steady or actually rose a bit, even if _ as
the polls also show _ the public does not share his moral code, or
even his highly conditioned view of what constitutes sexual
relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of a wash,'' said former Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas,
summing up the prevailing view. ``He probably helped himself a
little. I told my wife, `He knew that was going to be made public.
He was talking to the people.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is by no means out of trouble. Some of the most
important people he was talking to _ House Republicans _ show no
signs of slowing their review of impeachment proceedings against
him, and few seemed inclined to cut him any slack, much less a deal
on censure or some lesser punishment.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Clinton insisted that it was not his job to be
``particularly helpful'' to Paula Jones' lawyers in their sexual
misconduct suit against him, he once again reminded his adversaries
that he will not make things easy on them, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's opponents keep yearning for the magic bullet, and
they have for years, going way back before Lewinsky,'' said William
Kristol, the Republican theoretician who is editor and publisher of
the Weekly Standard. ``They keep hoping that some deus ex machina
will arrive on stage and rid them of this horrible guy. It hasn't
happened, and it's unlikely that anything's going to show up to do
that work for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Kristol said, ``The president is not going to
surrender, and his opponents are going to have to do the hard work
and persuade people to move ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The public view of the president remains profoundly split, but
hardly undiscerning. An ABC News poll on Monday found that nearly 7
in 10 respondents who had actually watched his testimony found it
evasive, although an identical number felt he was right not to talk
about sexual details.
</P>
<P>
   So once again, Clinton, who staked his political claim on
finding a ``third way'' between liberalism and conservatism, may
have found a way of squaring the circle of truth and falsehood, at
least when it comes to sex. No one who watched the president's
testimony could doubt that he was acknowledging that he had lied to
some of his closest aides about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
Yet even in describing that behavior _ when he was not under oath
and not subject to charges of perjury _ Clinton steadfastly refused
to utter the word ``lie,'' ever sensitive to its political
ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is the politicians of both parties, who know Clinton
best and have never especially liked him, who remain most sensitive
to his months of misrepresentations. For Clinton has misled many of
them before, in negotiations over legislation or the budget, and
they are wary to their core.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a history here,'' Bennett said. ``The people who are
paying attention are angrier. The closer you are, the angrier you
are.''

FANTASIES IN GLASS AWASH IN COLOR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 27) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Toots Zynsky produces fantasy forms in glass that
look as fragile and festive as crepe-paper objects _ ruffled,
puckered, pinched and drenched with color.
</P>
<P>
   She uses a revolutionary technique to create the multicolored
tuliplike works: instead of blowing or casting these pieces, she
fuses thousands of glass threads into entire vessels.
</P>
<P>
   She began exploring this technique in 1982, when she lived in
Manhattan and worked in an experimental workshop, now called Urban
Glass. That year, her pieces caught on: the Corning Museum of Glass
bought the first piece she had ever made out of fused glass
threads, a work showing the threads rolled into a solid mass.
</P>
<P>
   It was introduced at her first solo show, which was held at the
Theo Portnoy gallery. Later, the Museum of Modern Art acquired two
of her glass-thread pieces, and the White House and 40 other
museums also bought her works.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ms. Zynsky (born Mary Ann but called Toots since infancy),
47, is back in New York for her second solo exhibition here,
``Toots Zynsky: Chaotic Fusion,'' at the Barry Friedman gallery in
Manhattan through Oct. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 pieces in the show reveal the radical differences between
her work from a decade ago and from now. The early ones are
monochromatic and incorporate thick glass threads; the later pieces
are multicolored and use hair-fine threads. The pieces range from
$4,500 to $19,500.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, glass was the last thing on Ms. Zynsky's mind in 1971
when she enrolled in art classes at Rhode Island School of Design.
But the freshman courses in art proved disappointing to her so she
switched to glass. She was attracted to the craft because very few
modernists were working in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like walking to the edge of a beach and looking out,''
she said. ``Everything seemed possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zynsky became absorbed in glassmaking at the school. ``If
you wanted to, you woke up at 4 in the morning and went to watch
Dale Chihuly and others blow glass,'' she said. ``There was a real
choreography to blowing glass, a rhythmic motion akin to dancing
that appealed to me. It's very alive. You have to keep moving, you
can't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   She mastered the techniques of the craft _ blowing, fusing,
casting and slumping of heated glass. After graduation she spent
several years helping her husband, Duan Hall, an architect, build a
stone house by hand in Vermont and later running a restaurant while
raising their son, Diau. ``We were hippies and did not worry about
making too much money,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the late 1970s, she returned to art, creating barbed-wire
sculpture. She later made blown-glass works wrapped in barbed wire
mesh and called the pieces the ``dust collector series.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbed wire inspired me to use hot glass thread,'' she said.
``Both were all about camouflage and hiding, and about them being
the same thing sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, after her marriage had ended, she took her son and
moved to Amsterdam. She has worked there for 15 years and traveled
extensively abroad, picking up ideas for her art along the way. The
chaotic street scene she found in Paris inspired the twisted forms
and explosive coloring in the current show.
</P>
<P>
   The glorious color combinations she saw in Ghana convinced her
to ignore what she had learned in elementary school about mixing
colors. The endless arrays of delicate and brilliant colors that
transfixed her in medieval and Renaissance paintings in Italy are
indelible memories.
</P>
<P>
   Making objects with glass threads goes faster today than it did
when she started. In 1982, a Dutch inventor, Mathijs Teunission Van
Manen, visited her studio to see how she made the pieces. He was
shocked at how much labor pulling threads from glass canes
required.
</P>
<P>
   ``In less than 24 hours, he had mechanized the process,'' she
said. ``He took a bunch of things that he found in my studio _ an
old beat-up drill, a worn-out hacksaw blade, some bearings and
rollers, a bicycle chain and a wheel. And he devised a Rube
Goldberg-like machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she makes far more diverse pieces in a fraction of the time
it once took. And she lays out each one, using threads of varying
colors and lengths, and placing groups of threads side by side in
layered color patches that she then arranges on a board.
</P>
<P>
   To fuse the glass threads, she moves the board to an oven. Then,
at several stages, she takes the glass from the oven, and, in
seconds, shapes the thin softened mass into a vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Next month Ms. Zynsky returns to the United States with her
husband, Ernesto Aparicio, a graphic designer, and their daughter
Julia, 8, to work in Providence near family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernesto needs to be in an urban environment,'' she said. ``I
need to be by the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, she's unsure. ``I don't know where my work will
go,'' she said. ``I've been thinking about some early pieces that
are like very fine net and I was tempted to make one for this show
a few threads thick, something almost impossibly fragile.''

CLINTON SEEKS DEAL TO APPEAR BEFORE JUDICIARY PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY AND BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The White House is trying to negotiate a deal with
Congress in which President Clinton would voluntarily testify
before the House Judiciary Committee in exchange for guarantees
that the impeachment process would either be expedited or replaced
by a censure vote, administration and congressional officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials began privately approaching key lawmakers
with the vague offer of Clinton's testimony late last week,
officials said, and the concept gained momentum over the weekend
when Massachusetts Senator John Kerry championed the idea on
national television.
</P>
<P>
   An increasingly emboldened group of White House strategists and
their Democratic allies on Capitol Hill believe a historic
appearance by Clinton before Congress, coming either next month or
early next year, would force the Republican leadership towards a
rapid vote on Clinton's fate, one that many Democrats believe the
president would win.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the national airing of Clinton's August grand jury
testimony, many Democrats expressed relief at his performance and
pointed to public opinion polls which showed little momentum for
Clinton's impeachment or resignation and, in one CNN poll,
indicated that his job approval rating jumped to 66 percent. Such
polls, Democrats said privately, strengthen Clinton's bargaining
position as he tries to strike a deal on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of a proposal that is still being formed,
Clinton's lawyers and the Judiciary Committee would reach agreement
on a set of facts in the case, including multiple concessions of
wrongdoing on the part of the president in his affair with Monica
Lewinsky and its coverup, according to officials familiar with the
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would then appear before the committee to defend himself
on areas not under agreement, such as perjury and obstruction of
justice allegations, and to argue his case to remain in office,
said the officials, who talked on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Following that appearance, the House would schedule a rapid vote
on impeachment, officials said. The plan would require the Congress
to forego what are now expected to be lengthy impeachment hearings
that could extend well into next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``An accelerated, streamlined effort to help the country deal
with this in a much more decent way so the nation doesn't feel this
is being exploited for political purposes,'' said Kerry. ``Most
Americans don't have a lot of questions about what happened. Most
people of common sense don't have a lot of questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Several key Republicans have expressed initial interest in the
concept of Clinton's testimony, though they have offered little in
the way of concrete concessions in return. House Speaker Newt
Gingrich telephoned Kerry at a Manhattan restaurant Monday night to
discuss the possibility. And Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said
Tuesday, ``Any time the president comes forward and comes clean in
a formal setting ... it would probably be a positive development.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with his telephone conversations with both Gingrich and
Lott, Kerry has held private discussions with senior Clinton aides
over the last two days, including White House Chief of Staff
Erskine Bowles and Capitol Hill liasson Greg Craig, as well as
House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a series of private conversations with colleagues
on the concept,'' Kerry said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
``It's met with considerable interest from some. Others are
skeptical, but we will keep talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the White House, some key aides believe that before
Clinton volunteers his testimony, he must receive some concessions
from Congress or at least an indication of timing and schedules of
congressional action.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens if we come up, we do our thing, and we leave, and
they say thank you and go on with what they're doing,'' asked one
senior White House official Tuesday. ``And what framework, what
structure? The right move is to ask what actions we can take to
bring this to closure, but it can't be one-sided, it has to be
bipartisan.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton advisers declined to address the issue of testimony or
discuss the specifics of a possible deal Tuesday. Asked about the
prospect of Clinton appearing before a congressional panel, White
House press secretary Michael McCurry said Tuesday, ``What we want
to do is work with Congress to find a course of action that is the
correct one, that will have bipartisan support, that the people of
Congress together agree is the right course for our nation and that
the people of the United States of America will support.''
</P>
<P>
   Added White House communications director Ann Lewis: ``What the
American people want is to get to the end. How do we get to the
end, to allow people to express disapproval for his personal action
while allowing him to continue being president?''
</P>
<P>
   As a variation on the deal, some Democrats are also discussing
the possibility of Clinton testifying before the Judiciary
Committee in exchange for a preordained agreement for a
congressional censure and a sizable fine tantamount to a plea
bargain. The Democrats privately conceded, however, that Clinton is
not in a strong enough position to pose the possibilty to
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would depend on whether Republicans were sincerely
interested in ending this embarrassing fiasco sooner rather than
later,'' said Democratic Representative Martin Meehan of
Massachusetts, a member of the Judiciary Committee. Meehan added
that only Gingrich and Lott could convince GOP members of the
Judiciary Committee to agree to such an expedited process.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are dissenters on both sides of the aisle.
Republicans may be loathe to allow Clinton to appear on Capitol
Hill before the November midterm elections, for fear that he may
help his own cause and hurt GOP prospects at the polling booths.
Some Republicans also believe a full airing of charges and a
lengthy hearing could further harm an already weakened president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the entire constitutional issue that Congress
is now facing can be resolved by the single appearance of any one
witness,'' said Representative James E. Rogan, a California
Republican on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry J. Hyde of Illinois said he
would ``welcome'' Clinton's appearance before the panel, but that
the Congress would probably not be prepared to begin hearings and
hear testimony until next year, as part of a formal and elaborate
impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't invite him because I wouldn't want him to think we
were trying to embarrass him,'' Hyde said, ``But if he wants to
testify we will certainly hear from him.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee is expected to recommend in early
October that the full House approve a formal impeachment
investigation of Clinton. If the House approves the inquiry, the
panel would then spend several weeks reviewing Starr's report and
conducting its own investigation in a precursor to hearings.
</P>
<P>
   And even some Democrats have expressed opposition to his
testimony if it ultimately means an expedited process.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Democratic and Republican staffs on the Judiciary
Committee have reached an agreement on how much material to black
out in 12 of the remaining 16 boxes of Starr documents. The panel
is under House orders to decide which of the material to withhold
before it releases the rest, no later than Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The material includes transcripts of grand-jury testimony from
more than 60 witnesses, including Vernon Jordan, Clinton's
confidant; Betty Currie, the president's secretary; and Linda R.
Tripp, the former Lewinsky friend who tipped off Starr to the
illicit affair. The boxes also contain transcripts of the secretly
recorded audiotapes of Tripp's conversations with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, which is deeply divided along partisan lines over
how much of the material to make public, is scheduled to meet
Thursday to renew the debate. However, members of both parties said
the remaining boxes contain no additional damaging information
involving the allegations against Clinton.

BUILDING INSPECTIONS LAWS IN NEW YORK CITY SEEN AS INEFFECTIVE AND
USELESS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDY KENNEDY and JOHN SULLIVAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the summer of 1996, an engineer using binoculars
and a high-powered camera inspected the brick facade of a 44-story
office building in midtown and declared it safe, satisfying the
requirements of a city law intended to guard against crumbling
masonry.
</P>
<P>
   But out of the engineer's sight and hidden behind the building's
brickwork, critical metal ties that held the bricks to the walls
were corroding.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two years later, on Aug. 10, the ties gave way and a
masonry panel the size of a boardroom table came loose from the
40th floor of the building, showering brick shards onto Lexington
Avenue and punching a jagged hole through the top of a bus.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse is perhaps the most dramatic example, but only one
of many, construction experts say, of glaring problems with the
city's 18-year-old effort to require inspections and repairs of
tall buildings.
</P>
<P>
   City officials acknowledge that laws governing facade
maintenance have long allowed for ineffective, sometimes useless,
inspections of buildings. And while the officials have made recent
efforts to strengthen the laws, inspection records and interviews
with city officials, engineers, architects and landlords indicate
that problems persist.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious problem, experts say, is that the laws
encourage visual inspections, which engineers generally perform
with binoculars or cameras with telephoto lenses from the street,
from nearby buildings or from ledges on the building itself. They
are the least expensive inspections and the most widely used by
owners, but they can fail to detect numerous problems that more
comprehensive inspections could catch.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the expert say, even when private inspections
detect such problems as loose bricks or telltale cracks, there is
no strong enforcement mechanism to require owners to make repairs.
In some cases the owner simply accumulates fines, sometimes for
more than a year. While the city has the power to seek criminal
charges against the owners, it rarely does.
</P>
<P>
   Even critics of the inspection system stress that it has been
largely successful, leading to repairs of thousands of aging
buildings. Before it, the city had no system for regular facade
inspections. But the critics add that the laws now in place remain
mostly a way of guiding responsible landlords and is ill-equipped
to deal with those who are not. And when the system fails the
results can be catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say they are now trying to fix the flaws. But it
remains unclear whether the changes will address the problems,
which city officials say have existed since the inspections were
mandated in 1980 following the death of a Barnard College student
struck by falling concrete. The laws _ which cover about 10,000
buildings, mostly in Manhattan _ now require inspections every five
years of all exterior facades of buildings taller than 6 stories.
The law primarily rests on the theory that owners will make
necessary inspections and repairs to avoid the potentially huge
costs of liability suits if damage or injuries result from a facade
collapse.

 NEW YORK: facade collapse.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``In no real world could the city go out and inspect 10,000
buildings on a regular basis,'' said Gaston Silva, the city's
buildings commissioner. ``That's the responsibility of owning
property in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest collapse, at the headquarters of the brokerage
firm Bear Stearns on Lexington Avenue and 46th Street, the owners
had complied with the inspection law and hired a private engineer,
Raphael Bassan, in 1996 to inspect the facade. Bassan inspected the
building on two days in August 1996, using binoculars and a camera
with a telephoto lens, according to the report he filed with the
city.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, Bassan declared the building safe, but he
encouraged the owners to perform periodic inspections of trouble
spots on the building, including caulking around the windows and
brick panels adjacent to the windows.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Aug. 10 of this year, as workers made
waterproofing repairs on the 39th floor, one of the brick panel, a
section 12 feet high and 4 feet wide, came loose. Brick shards
plummeted to Lexington Avenue and two bricks smashed through the
roof of the bus, narrowly missing a woman inside. Silva said in a
recent interview that the corroded ties caused the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   While the accident is still under investigation, recent
inspections of the building have found that several other panels,
each weighing tons, have shifted outward by as much as an inch,
suggesting that more metal ties could be rusted away.
</P>
<P>
   Bassan's inspection met city guidelines, and there is no
indication that it was flawed, city officials said. Construction
experts say it is possible that the building deteriorated in the
two years after he inspected it. In a recent interview, Bassan said
that he saw no problems with the facade that merited a closer look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can put you in front of this wall,'' he said. ``You want to
bang on it with a hammer? You can bang on it with a hammer, and it
will look fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts differ on what type of inspection could have found the
problems at the Bear Sterns building _ some go so far as to say it
would have been necessary to remove bricks to detect the problem
with the metal ties. But they say that for most buildings, a close
inspection from a scaffold can determine far more than a visual
inspection from a distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sort of like going to the doctor,'' said Rene Testa,
chairman of the civil engineering department at Columbia
University. ``He can look at you from a distance and see a few
things, but he is much more effective if he can touch you and use
some instruments.''
</P>
<P>
   The city has already made some far-reaching changes in the
inspection laws. After a ton of bricks fell from a Madison Avenue
office building last December, closing down parts of one block for
months, the Giuliani administration shepherded a bill through the
City Council that expanded the law to require inspection of all
exterior walls, not just walls facing streets.
</P>
<P>
   Silva, the city's buildings commissioner, said that the city has
also recently assigned a group of inspectors to make random checks
of building facades throughout the city, including smaller
buildings not covered by the facade inspection law.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Silva said he planned to rewrite his own
departmental rules to encourage closer inspections from
scaffolding. Specifically, he plans to delete words from the rules
that refer to visual inspections and add that the city prefers
close facade inspections performed from scaffolding.
</P>
<P>
   And within the next few months, the Buildings Department plans
to issue new rules calling for close-up inspections of at least one
specific type of building, terra cotta, on which Silva said visual
inspections through binoculars are likely to miss important
problems.
</P>
<P>
   To put teeth into the changes, Silva said the city plans for the
first time to send its own inspectors to spot-check a percentage of
private inspectors' work, as it does now with plumbing inspections,
for example. For the last several years, he said, ``if something
smelled bad, we would send out an inspector, but he acknowledged
that ``it wasn't terribly well organized.'' Five new building
inspectors will be hired and assigned to the task.
</P>
<P>
   But the changes will only apply the next time a building must be
inspected. And since inspections are only required every five
years, many months will pass before some landlords are force to
make more aggressive efforts.

 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

<TEXT>
<P>
   APPLETON, Wis. _ Like millions of other Americans on Monday,
Vice President Al Gore watched parts of President Clinton's
videotaped testimony before the grand jury that heard evidence in
the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   And like many of them, Gore said Tuesday that Clinton's answers
to four hours of questions added little to what people already knew
from the report by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent
counsel, which Congress made public last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My overall impression was that it was much ado about not much
new,'' Gore told reporters traveling with him here, where he
appeared with Democratic U.S. Rep. Jay Johnson of New Franken at a
community discussion on public education.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has said that he has not read the full Starr report,
on Tuesday added: ``The videotaped testimony was not particularly
new in light of the report that had previously been released, and
the report does not serve as a basis for impeachment. And that
wasn't changed by anything that people saw yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout recent weeks, in which scandal developments have
collided with his campaign efforts around the country for
Democratic candidates, Gore has tried hard to avoid the topic
altogether, a strategy that allows him to demonstrate loyalty to
the president through his policies and not his behavior, an
important distinction for a Democratic presidential hopeful, which
Gore clearly is.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, he has reacted to a question barked at him by a
reporter in close range. But generally, his staff orchestrates
events, like those here at Appleton Central Alternative High
School, with such detailed care that reporters have no opportunity
to bark, lest the barker appear to the audience as rudely
intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, Gore has made a brief statement about the scandal
before the cameras and has granted interviews to local reporters,
as he did last week in New Hampshire, which stages the first
primary each presidential year.
</P>
<P>
   But his talk with reporters on Air Force 2 on Tuesday was the
first of its kind as he agreed to speak on the record, even if
briefly, in the wake of the extraordinary events on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he watched some of the testimony ``as it was aired
live, some of it as it was aired by networks, but mostly I saw
excerpts on the news.'' Aides said Gore had a light schedule on
Monday and watched the testimony from his residence, about two
miles northwest of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   None of Clinton's testimony, Gore predicted, was compelling
enough to change a political equation in which Republicans
generally feel that Clinton should resign or be impeached and
Democrats are generally willing to let him finish his second term.
Gore also said he had not discussed the testimony with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it has much effect or changes things very
much,'' Gore said. ``I'm traveling to almost all of the competitive
House races, Senate races and governors' races and almost without
exception, I find people anxious to hear a discussion of the issues
that are at stake in this election.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with an expectation that the House Judiciary Committee will
vote along party lines to initiate impeachment proceedings, Gore
said he had ``not been involved in an outreach effort to members''
of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's visit to Wisconsin included a reception that raised
$70,000 for Johnson, a first-term House member who is facing Mark
Green, a Republican state assemblyman, in what is considered the
most competitive of Wisconsin's nine House races.

TWO POLITICAL LEADERS ASK IRA TO DISARM 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland and
David Trimble, the first minister of the new Northern Ireland
Assembly, called on the Irish Republican Army Tuesday night to
agree to begin a phased disarmament to allow the Northern peace
effort to advance.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders, after an hourlong meeting here, sought to end the
impasse over the IRA refusal to disarm or to say when it might
begin to do so. They asked Sinn Fein, the IRA political wing, to
provide ``in a credible way'' a disarmament plan in the coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Tuesday, Trimble discussed the problem in Belfast
with Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president. Adams' position has been
that disarmament would come only as part of an overall enactment of
the political provisions of the new peace accord that is to give
Roman Catholics added power in the northern province.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction by Sinn Fein or the IRA. The
leaders' call was an urgent effort to end a growing sense of crisis
in the peace effort caused by the IRA insistence on keeping its
arsenal, estimated at 100 tons of weapons.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As any parent can testify, there is probably no surer
staple of childhood than peanut butter; a pure product of America,
consumed at an annual rate of 3 pounds per person, invented by
George Washington Carver, the brown-bag-and-grape-jelly backup for
millions of schoolchildren who gag at peas and pre-emptively detest
anything cooked in a school cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Now peanut butter is under attack at the schoolhouse door.
Cheap, nutritious, popular and traditional, it has nonetheless
taken its place on the list of substances _ like asbestos and lead
_ that send shivers down the spines of school administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by parents warning of lethal allergies, by the
contentions of some researchers that peanut allergies are on the
rise and, not least, by a fear of litigation, growing numbers of
public and private schools across the United States have banned
peanut butter from their cafeterias. Others have declared
peanut-free zones or set up committees to figure out what to do.
</P>
<P>
   School officials find themselves balancing the rare risk of
death against the danger of being swept up in a faddish hysteria
and of trying to anticipate potential legal repercussions of the
1990 Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who wonder if the bans have gone too far fear that if
they do not act aggressively, they may face liability lawsuits and
accusations of discrimination against children disabled by a peanut
allergy.
</P>
<P>
   Children are well aware of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you can't take chances,'' said Alex Goldschmidt, a
fifth-grader eating pizza in the lunchroom at Trevor Day School, a
private school in New York. ``I mean, if you kept it here, then
they might eat like some kind of food with nuts in it, then
something bad would happen, then the next thing you know there
would be somebody in the cafeteria that's dead, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to ban peanut butter is happening in scattered
places where an assertive parent or two _ supported by the Food
Allergy Network, an 8-year-old advocacy group in Fairfax, Va. _ has
raised the alarm in schools, contending that peanut allergies are a
disability that schools must accommodate under the disabilities
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mother at Trevor became a real activist,'' said Alexandra
Peters, president of the Trevor Board of Trustees. The debate, she
said, boiled down to ``my child's life or your kid's lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control report only 88 deaths among all
Americans from allergies to food, including peanuts, between 1979
and the end of 1995. But allergists supported by the food allergies
network contend that fatalities are underreported, and that 0.5 to
1 percent of all Americans suffer from peanut allergies. The
network estimates that every year 125 people die from food
allergies, the majority from peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wesley Burks, a pediatric allergist at the University of
Arkansas who is supported by the network, said the centers'
statistics reflect underreporting.
</P>
<P>
   While network officials say they are not forcing schools to take
any particular action, the schools say that anything less than a
total ban seems inadequate to satisfy the critics.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first full year of the peanut ban at Trevor lower
school, where children who once ate peanut butter sandwiches now
can choose from a sandwich bar including cheese, cold cuts or just
plain jelly.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen cooks with olive and canola oil. A memorandum sent
to staff this month warns that some foods, like plain M&AMP;Ms, might
be contaminated by machinery used to make peanut candies; a similar
letter, administrators said, will be sent home with students before
Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other schools, Trevor, which has two peanut-allergic
children among its 240 students, has stored Epipens, injectable
epinephrine, an antidote to the asthmalike reaction that can be
caused by peanut butter, in strategic spots throughout the building
and has trained teachers and cafeteria workers in how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   In rare cases, a peanut allergy can cause a sudden drop in blood
pressure and the closing of the breathing passages. An injection of
epinephrine or adrenaline can prevent death if administered quickly
enough, Burks said.
</P>
<P>
   In its milder form, a peanut allergy can cause itching,
swelling, hives, wheezing, coughing, vomiting and diarrhea, doctors
say.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Several private schools in New York City, and Greenwich Academy
and the Stanwich School in Connecticut, have declared peanut-free
cafeterias and implore parents to check labels before sending in
snacks or birthday treats.
</P>
<P>
   At Horace Mann, in Bronx, peanut butter sandwiches are made
ahead of time, snugly wrapped in plastic, clearly marked and placed
in a designated area so that allergic children can steer clear of
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Fairfield Country Day School, in Fairfield, Conn., still
serves peanut butter but has eliminated peanuts from its dessert
menu, banning them from brownies, cookies and ice-cream sundaes.
``Who would have thought an old-fashioned favorite like peanut
butter and jelly could be considered so dangerous?'' said Robert
Vitalo, the Fairfield headmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Among public schools, Mount Kisco Elementary School in
Westchester County, and the Cos Cob, Conn., Elementary School have
set aside a peanut-free table that is scrubbed down before and
after meals. Similar preventive measures have been taken at schools
in Buffalo; North Andover, Mass.; Orange County, Calif.; and
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite end of the spectrum, the New York City public
school system, the nation's largest with more than a million
children, has remained immune to the peanut phenomenon _ largely
because no one has complained.
</P>
<P>
   In city schools, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are still
offered as a cold-lunch option in every school nearly every day,
said a spokesman, J.D. Larock. When peanut butter is not the choice
of the day, it is available on request, he said. ``There's peanut
butter aplenty in our system'' Larock said. Peanuts are not served,
but that's because they are a choking hazard, he added.
</P>
<P>
   While peanut butter has been slow to become an issue at New York
City public schools, the city's private schools have fallen in line
like so many dominoes.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Brossman, a lawyer who represents many New York City
private schools, said schools are concerned that peanut allergies
might qualify as a disability that must be accommodated under the
Americans with Disabilities Act. Neither Brossman nor the Food
Allergy Network knew of any litigation on peanut allergy that has
resulted in a court decision.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent directive by the U.S. Department of Transportation
construed peanut allergies as a disability and ordered airlines to
set up peanut-free zones. That decision may set a precedent for
schools, advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond bans, schools are wrestling with questions like whether
to provide individualized supplies _ say, blocks and sets of wooden
rods for solving math problems _ to children with severe peanut
allergies so they will not be contaminated by the peanut-smeared
hands of classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that a child who has just eaten peanut butter might
hold hands with an allergic child, schools now encourage children
to become compulsive hand-washers.
</P>
<P>
   Another allergist, Dr. Hugh Sampson of Mount Sinai Medical
School in New York City and Burks' collaborator, said that fears of
death from secondhand contamination _ by breathing peanut fumes or
touching peanut residue _ are exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Like the post office putting up the FBI's Most Wanted list,
school kitchens now post pictures and medical profiles of
peanut-allergic children.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of allergic children comb school menus and inspect
cupboards for suspect ingredients, even shadowing their children at
lunch or on field trips.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Food Consultants in Ridgewood, N.J., which supplies meals
to 17 independent schools in New York City and two in New Jersey,
has stopped making peanut butter sandwiches. Instead, the company
supplies schools with ``individually sealed, portion-controlled
packets'' of peanut butter and plastic knives, said Joseph Civita,
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Children make their own sandwiches and throw away the knives to
avoid the risk of sharing contaminated utensils; do-it-yourself
sandwiches are less likely to be picked up inadvertently by
allergic children, the company reasons. It also solicits letters
from manufacturers ensuring that their food is peanut-free.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with other causes of childhood death or illness, the
number from peanut allergies is tiny. In 1995, according the most
recent CDC statistics, 2,880 children died in car accidents and
2,944 in other accidents. Some 200,000 children were hospitalized
with asthma-related illnesses, according to the Department of
Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Max van Gilder, a Manhattan pediatrician, said he had had
only one child with the most severe form of peanut allergy in a
practice spanning 25 years and 2,500 patients. While describing the
reaction as ``a sudden, dramatic and horrible type of death,'' van
Gilder suggested that banning peanut butter was missing the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's peanut butter in the world,'' van Gilder said. ``I
think the issue is that food should be properly labeled.''
</P>
<P>
   Most allergic children, except perhaps the very youngest,
understand that they should not eat peanut butter, he said. It is
the hidden sources that are dangerous, he said, like the chili
laced with peanut butter that killed a Brown University student in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor's shift to a peanut-free school came last spring, at the
instigation of Diane Schechter, whose daughter, now a first-grader,
is severely peanut-allergic, she said. Ms. Schechter approached the
school nurse and administration and canvassed other parents in her
effort to institute the ban. Her argument was that a schoolwide
effort would lessen the anxiety for students worried that they
might unwittingly make her daughter sick, while reducing the stigma
for her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schechter asked that her daughter not be named, for fear of
a backlash. She said the child's allergy had been detected when she
was 8 months old. ``My husband ate a peanut butter sandwich,'' she
said. ``He must have touched her face, because she blew up as if
she had been boxed.''
</P>
<P>
   The child wears a fanny-pack equipped with epinephrine at all
times. Ms. Schechter has made up a list of safe foods, inspected
the cafeteria and called suppliers to ensure their products are
safe.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Alberti, director of the Trevor elementary school, said
that despite some grumbling, the ban was worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it easier on us to be this clear-cut about it,'' she
said. ``We're not talking about her getting the sniffles.''

CLINTON AND OBUCHI FAIL TO REACH ACCORD ON CURE FOR JAPANESE
ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Clinton and Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of
Japan met for the first time on Tuesday and struggled to reassure
the markets that they agree on a common strategy to pull the
world's second-largest economy out of a recession that is fueling
economic turmoil on three continents.
</P>
<P>
   But after nearly three hours of meetings in New York, the two
leaders emerged with no agreement about what Japan will do about
the trillion dollars in bad debts that have acted like an anchor on
the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   Their chief areas of agreement, aides said, were a shared
concern about North Korea, a decision to meet again early next year
and the politically mandatory promise to call each other by their
first names.
</P>
<P>
   While trying to sound upbeat, American officials acknowledge
that they emerged from the meeting with no better sense of how
Obuchi planned to resolve a politically paralyzing debate over the
bank debt that is already threatening the prime minister's loose
grasp on power.
</P>
<P>
   The bad bank debts now overshadow trade disputes and growing
security concerns in the Pacific as the No. 1 issue between the two
countries. The tower of debt has frozen economic activity, forced
Japan to keep insolvent banks afloat and set off waves of turmoil
far beyond Japan's own shores.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief and carefully stage-managed appearance with Obuchi,
Clinton acknowledged that an ``immensely complicated political
situation'' in Japan limited the prime minister's options.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the divisions among the political parties in Japan are
so complex that Obuchi was unable to address Clinton's main
concern: Tokyo's vow to use tens of billions of dollars in public
funds to prop up some of the world's largest banks.
</P>
<P>
   As the two men met, a political deal to merge or nationalize the
virtually insolvent Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, a huge
financial institution, appeared to be unraveling in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prime minister made it clear that they were working very
hard on this legislation, that there are a lot of moving pieces,
and he did not make a commitment,'' Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers said on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Meetings with American presidents are always important for
Japanese prime ministers. No matter what the subject of the
session, it is critical for a new Japanese leader to demonstrate
that he can hold his own with the president and fend off, when
necessary, the incessantly demanding Americans.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster the prime minster, the White House planned to fly the
two leaders to the Rockefeller estate in Tarrytown, N.Y., where
they could hold their meeting in a rural setting. But fog kept
their helicopters grounded, and the meeting was held at the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on Park Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   What made this meeting unusual was that it was also important
for Clinton, at several levels. Without resolving Japan's problems,
Clinton's hopes of calming the world financial turmoil _ a task he
committed himself to in a speech last week at the Council on
Foreign Relations _ would be greatly impaired, if not doomed.
</P>
<P>
   More immediately, the session was the latest opportunity for
Clinton to demonstrate that he is focusing on substantive issues
despite the continuing jockeying in Washington over impeachment
proceedings or a possible censure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted to reporters at one point on Tuesday that he
had ignored the televised deluge of testimony and commentary.
``Believe it or not, I haven't read the report,'' he said,
referring to Kenneth Starr's referral to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But as a political diversion, the meeting with Obuchi did not
amount to much.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of progress came as little surprise to the
administration. This was the fourth time in 18 months that Clinton
has urged a Japanese prime minister to act quickly on resolving the
banking crisis that has frozen lending and investment throughout
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the series of running meetings between the two
countries in Tokyo, San Francisco and Washington, there is little
to show in the way of progress _ beyond resentment of American
pressure in Japan and frustration at Japanese intransigence in
Washington.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The American strategy for dealing with Japan has been to
coordinate a series of increasingly urgent-sounding warnings _
first from Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Summers, then from
Germany and other European countries, and most recently from the
International Monetary Fund. The problem is how to direct those
critiques.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Monday and at a press conference on Tuesday,
Obuchi appeared to agree with the broad outlines of the American
strategy: to pump money into viable banks and force the sale of
real estate that has been sitting on the banks' books _ mostly
unsold, because the banks do not want to have to confront how far
prices have fallen.
</P>
<P>
   But striking that deal involves finding common ground among the
strongest political forces in Japan. Among them are banks and
companies that finance the country's political parties,
particularly Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party. And then there are
the opposition leaders, in control of the upper house of
Parliament, who reflect the popular distaste for bailing out badly
run banks and real estate moguls.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi seemed to reflect the difficulty of weaving through that
minefield on Tuesday when he said he was ``neither optimistic nor
pessimistic'' about the chances of getting financial reforms
through parliament. Taking a line from Clinton, he said that ``this
is not only an issue for Japan, but something that has major
implications on economies of Asia as well as the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   In his interview on Monday, Obuchi acknowledged that he had yet
to convince the Japanese public or parliament that the issue went
beyond Japan's domestic interests. But he argued that he had been
underestimated, a point he made obliquely to Clinton on Tuesday
when he noted that he had been compared in the American press to
``cold pizza,'' a slight that clearly annoyed Japanese bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, his aides said, reassured Obuchi that he had eaten cold
pizza the night before in his hotel.

THE SELLING OF `FELICITY' (IN A 70-CHANNEL UNIVERSE)

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 27)  
 (Margy Rochlin writes from Los Angeles about film and television.) 
(af)  
 By MARGY ROCHLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Focus groups swooned over the pilot of the WB's ``Felicity.''
Industry analysts _ even executives at rival networks _ declared
``Felicity,'' a new hourlong drama, the only sure hit of an
otherwise unpredictable fall season.
</P>
<P>
   Spotting their latest It Girl, magazine and newspaper editors
rushed to give the kiss-and-hug treatment to the show's star, Keri
Russell, 22, a former Mouseketeer with an innocently open gaze and
angelically backlit blond curls who seems incapable of taking a bad
photograph. The WB couldn't have bought better  &UR; insider &LR;  buzz.
</P>
<P>
   But how do they clue in the rest of the country? How do they let
them know that in a season of female leads who are self-absorbed
whiners, ``Felicity'' is the tale of an intelligent, introspective
and usually obedient rich girl who rejects her parents' plans to
send her to Stanford University and medical school so that she can
follow a tousle-haired hunk she hardly knows to a college in New
York City?
</P>
<P>
   That accomplished, how do they make sure that viewers don't
think the series is about a foolish child of privilege, but about
all that is good and bad about what occurs in the wake of her
blunder?
</P>
<P>
   If the WB were to follow in the footsteps of the big three
networks, the answer to these questions would simply be to
broadcast catchy ``Felicity'' promos in between their most popular
shows. But the upstart network has a problem: not everyone watches
the WB.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a 70-channel universe, your own on-air reach isn't enough
to bring in new viewers; we have to use alternative media,'' said
Garth Ancier, who is the WB's president for programming and
operates in tandem with a marketing staff that has enterprisingly
redefined the term ``alternative media'' to mean anywhere your gaze
might land outside of your television set.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the show makes its debut Tuesday night at 9, the
``Felicity'' advertising campaign may challenge the total
permeation level of last year's Spice Girls, bombarding city
dwellers with close to $5 million worth of billboards, subway
posters and the sides of buses.
</P>
<P>
   If moviegoers assume that their last reminder of the show will
be the ``Felicity'' poster in the foyer and the ``Felicity'' mobile
dangling over the popcorn counter, inside the theater will be a
``Felicity'' trailer with slow-motion footage and an insinuating
theme song by Madonna called ``The Power of Goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Will the carpet-bombing work? If the WB's last two seasons are
any indication, the foundation has been laid for this tactic to
produce results. After all, this was how the WB managed to hook
18-to-34-year-old America on its witty pulp melodrama ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, they did it again, using the image of an
idealistic-looking young man standing alone in a rowboat on a
ripple-free body of water to sell its soul-searching evening soap
``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the WB didn't invent outdoor advertising; cable and
major networks are increasingly reliant on similar methods. But the
WB may be the most sophisticated, detail-consumed practitioner of
this technique.
</P>
<P>
   To CBS, for example, the billboard is a space best filled with a
glorified head shot of, say, the actress Faith Ford, alongside the
title of her new sitcom, ``Maggie Winters.''
</P>
<P>
   To the WB, the same 14 feet by 48 feet is a blank canvas upon
which to suggest as much as it possibly can about Felicity Porter
and the universality of her quest to become her own person.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's the slogan: ``She's just made the best mistake of
her life.'' Then there is the dominant illustration of the beatific
Ms. Russell, head aimed slightly heavenward, flanked by two
boyishly good-looking male co-stars whose glances subtly convey
their feelings about her.
</P>
<P>
   One is already smitten; the other appears distracted. There to
communicate all the fears and exciting possibilities that come with
leaving home, a tiny illustration has been placed in an upper
corner: in near-silhouette, a suitcase-lugging Ms. Russell is
depicted before an expansive Manhattan skyline. The skyline was
softened at the edges and given an orangey-golden glow after it was
discovered that a sharp, realistic gray backdrop sent the wrong
message to focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were in trouble when it came out in the research
that people thought she was a teen-age runaway or very `Looking for
Mr. Goodbar,' '' said Bob Bibb, who is the WB's co-executive vice
president for marketing with Lewis Goldstein. Goldstein also noted
that they felt that the girl-before-skyline logo contained such
crucial information that almost every element was tweaked via
digital retouching. Not only was the cityscape made more invitingly
Oz-like but Ms. Russell's pants were changed, her hair brightened
and her worn-out sneakers replaced with platform shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Originally at NBC, then at Fox, both Goldstein and Bibb moved to
the WB in 1994 along with three other high-level Fox employees,
including Jamie Kellner, now the WB's chief executive officer.
Working out of offices at Warner Ranch, roughly a mile and a half
from the famed Warner Brothers back lot in Burbank, the pair were
inspired by the proximity of their parent company and its Hollywood
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They decided ``to market each of our dramas like a feature
film,'' said Bibb, who hired Rick Frey, a creative director from
Paramount Pictures, to achieve a top-dollar movie elegance. On the
relatively paltry WB budget, the department managed innovative
touches like the installation of black letterbox bands on the
promos and the listing lengthy credits on the posters.
</P>
<P>
   It also hired fashionable photographers like Frank Ockenfels to
produce a black-and-white series of George Hurrell-style portraits
that transformed the WB's roster of cutie-pie headliners into swank
30s-style matinee idols.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these splashy efforts may explain why a cult following
is already poised to rally around the series, even though episode 1
hasn't been broadcast yet. (At least the critics who have lauded
the show's fine writing and quality production values had
 &UR; something &LR;  to base their opinions on.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, good reviews and a worshipful fan base couldn't save
``My So-Called Life,'' an ABC youth drama that was canceled after a
single season (1994-95) and that ``Felicity'' happens to resemble
in style, emotional texture and target audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always ask ourselves, why didn't that work?'' Bibb said
about a show that can serve as a reminder of how even the most
promising product can wither and die. ``What we figured out about
`My So-Called Life' was that it was existing on ABC without any
compatible programming. `Dawson's' exists because of `Buffy,' and
`Felicity' could probably not exist without both of them. Besides,
their promotions never hit the right demographic.''
</P>
<P>
   About a month ago, Goldstein and Bibb and their six-man creative
team could be found in Bibb's modest corner office, watching
``Felicity'' trailers on a television set.
</P>
<P>
   In one, the title character is shown clashing with her father
over her decision to move to Manhattan. As he berates her, Ms.
Russell's eyes slide to one side and her brows knit together in a
way that makes her appear almost maniacal. Although the expression
passes over the actress's face so fleetingly it has to be captured
in freeze-frame, the men still debated whether it helped or hurt
their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looks pouty,'' said Bibb, whose primary concern was that
some might see their heroine as ``a brat with a lot of options,''
as opposed to a 17-year-old who is ``trying to break away from a
father who is putting shackles on her and trying to guide her
life.''
</P>
<P>
   To Goldstein, she looked like ``a spoiled daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph Lee, vice president for special programming at the
WB, almost hidden behind a thicket of charts and bar graphs,
defended the Look as a quick burst of defiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's perfect,'' he kept insisting, until it was agreed that
the Look should stay in. ``You see enough shots of her smiling. It
shows strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether this fine-tuning will lead to high Nielsen ratings or
Zeitgeist popularity may not be known for months. But one of the
reasons J.J. Abrams and Matt Reeves, co-creators and co-executive
producers of ``Felicity,'' were attracted to the WB was its
reputation for supporting a show until it was discovered by
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   However, turning their beloved product over to be dissected,
packaged and retailed by Goldstein and Bibb has left them slightly
agog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been through this before,'' said Abrams, who is a
newcomer to television, although both he and Reeves have witnessed
the impact of marketing, for better or worse. (Abrams was one of
the writers on ``Armageddon''; Reeves directed ``The Pallbearer.'')
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone at the ``Felicity'' production office in
Culver City, Calif., Abrams was asked if he was ready to drive
through the streets of Los Angeles surrounded by all things
``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I regret is that there's not a chance of having
people discover `Felicity' for themselves,'' said Abrams, sounding
genuinely conflicted. ``Having said that, I understand the
realities of marketing. The fact is that I love this show and I am
confident about it. But if people get sick of it before they've
even seen it, I'll be upset.''

PUERTO RICO BATTERED BY WORST STORM IN 70 YEARS

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ Battered overnight by what
meteorologists describe as the strongest storm to hit this
Caribbean island in 70 years, Puerto Rico struggled Tuesday to
begin repairing at least a billion dollars in damage inflicted by
Hurricane Georges, which continued its slow march westward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a major onslaught,'' Gov. Pedro Rossello said
Tuesday morning, as the last traces of the storm were still
pounding the western coast. ``We have severe damage, impassable
roads, no power and a high probability of flooding. We are going to
have to start from zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as residents were cleaning up their homes and businesses,
Georges swept across the neighboring island of Hispaniola,
battering both the Dominican Republic and Haiti. A hurricane watch
may be issued for south Florida as early as Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello described the hurricane, the eighth to strike Puerto
Rico in the past 100 years, as the worst in decades. Local
forecasters said the storm was the most powerful to strike the
island since the San Felipe hurricane of Sept. 13, 1928.
</P>
<P>
   Winds of 115 mph left the island virtually without electricity.
Nearly 80 percent of its 3.8 million residents were without water,
and many also had no telephone service, especially on the southern
coast. In the U.S. Virgin Islands just east of here, similar
problems were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Radio and television stations here said that five people were
killed during the hurricane's passage across Puerto Rico on Monday
night and early Tuesday at a leisurely 14 mph pace, three in a
landslide and two as a result of heart attacks. Police and other
security officials said they could not yet confirm the deaths, but
acknowledged they had received reports that people were missing.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hurricane Service in Miami said mountain ranges in
those countries were dissipating some of the storm's strength, but
warned that Georges could regain force once it gets out over the
warm open waters of the Caribbean again.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's future path remains uncertain. Meteorologists said
Georges, a dangerous category 3 storm with winds now at 120 mph,
could strike anywhere from central Cuba to the Bahamas, which along
with Turks and Caicos are already under a hurricane warning.
</P>
<P>
   According to Steve Feuer, a meteorologist with the Hurricane
Research Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, Georges is expected to leave Hispaniola by early
Wednesday morning. Asked if and when it would hit Florida, he said,
``It is very uncertain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a less than 20 percent chance at this point,'' he
said. ``We have no great certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   As a precautionary measure, authorities in Monroe County, Fla.,
which includes Key West and most of the Everglades, declared a
state of emergency and ordered a mandatory evacuation as of
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're an island community,'' said Mary Reich, a county
commissioner. ``We're used to these things.'' There are no
hurricane shelters in the Florida Keys, she said, and only one
highway that connects with the rest of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Georges caused extensive damage to housing and public buildings
on the eastern Caribbean islands on Sunday, with 70 percent of the
homes in St. Kitts and Nevis, the smallest country in the Western
Hemisphere, said to be affected. The storm was reported to have
killed three people there and two more in nearby Antigua and
Barbuda.
</P>
<P>
   After an inspection tour Tuesday, Rossello estimated the damage
in Puerto Rico at about a billion dollars. Government officials
said total damages are likely to exceed the cost of Hurricane Hugo,
which struck northeastern Puerto Rico in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has declared both Puerto Rico and the Virgin
Islands to be disaster areas, but the flow of emergency assistance
was slowed because Luis Munoz Marin International Airport here was
still being cleared during the day. American Airlines said,
however, that it expects commercial flights to resume on Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, Rossello and a representative of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency made a swing through the San Juan
metropolitan area, home to about one-third of Puerto Rico's
population. Nearly everywhere they turned, they encountered scenes
of destruction and flooding, combined with instances of rapid
rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   In San Juan, thousands of trees had toppled, taking street
lights and power and other utility lines with them, while near the
eastern suburb of Loiza, a river had overflowed its banks. Streets
were littered with debris, much of it metal signs, shutters and
awnings ripped from windows and walls by the force of the storm.
But residents were already out with brooms, carts and pickup trucks
to haul the rubble away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had had 300 people in shelters during the hurricane, but
that's going to change dramatically,'' said Victor Soto, mayor of
the San Juan suburb of Toa Baja. ``A lot of people here have lost
the roofs on their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardest-hit region was said to be the mountainous interior
of the island. There as much as 20 inches of rain fell during
Georges' slow passage across houses of wood and zinc.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was much worse than Hurricane Hugo,'' said Juan Marrero,
a resident of the San Juan suburb of Catano, which experienced
extensive flooding. ``Just in the area around where I lived, we've
got more than 30 houses that have no roof anymore. I'm all right,
thank God, except for some damage to the store I own, but those
people have lost everything.''

   Hurricane Georges cut off cell phone and phone communication to
the south coast ``This is the worst storm that Salinas has seen in
its history,'' said the mayor of Salinas, Basilio Baerga, on
Tuesday morning, as he was trying to assess the damage to his town.
Baerga said there was at least one death in his town attributed to
Georges _ a blind man who apparently suffered a heart attack as
Georges began hitting this south coast town. He could not provide
further details.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane also damaged the town's popular harbor district
and the town's marina. ``The only thing left is the piling,'' said
67-year-old Bill Williams, who lives on a sailboat docked here.
</P>
<P>
   Many barrio residents took refuge in one of the town's municipal
shelters. ``I lost everything,'' said 46-year-old Onelia Malave of
Barrio Carmen, who rode out the storm at a shelter in the Luis
Munos Rivera school with her three children. ``We have no roof and
everything is wet.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not an easy night at the shelter, however, as heavy rains
flooded rooms, and heavy winds uprooted a huge banyan tree beside
the school. ``That tree has been there since 1925, the year the
school was built,'' said school director Lillian Torres. ``It was a
frightening night.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cayey, in the mountainous part of the island, the lush
vegetation had been turned into greenish-brown confetti by Tuesday
morning. All along highway 1, its main road, houses and businesses
were torn down or turned into twisted hulks of metal and wood.
</P>
<P>
   By 2 p.m., residents seeking to file damage claims had already
formed a long line that wrapped around the municipal stadium, which
was also damaged significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the eye passed over, it was silent. And then you could
hear it coming again. It sounded like a tractor-trailer running
down the highway, said 46-year-old Frank Vega of the storm's
approach. The storm toppled Vega's truck, filled with hay and eggs,
and sent his car sliding into a cement building. ``We got hit
bad,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A warehouse for the town's medical center was also destroyed in
the storm, along with the medicine inside it. Civil Defense
officials were evacuating residents of an old-age home which was
also damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is wet, everything is ruined,'' said Brunilda
Milian, 43, who passed the storm in her wooden home with her
husband and 10 children. The yard behind her house was filled with
the carcasses of dead poultry, which were raised commercially by
her husband. With a machete in hand, he was still trying to
calculate the extent of his loss.

<P>
   MASERU, Lesotho _ South African troops rolled into this tiny
mountainous kingdom early Tuesday morning to put a quick end to
political turmoil that had brought the government to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, the invading force met surprisingly heavy
resistance from Lesotho soldiers who oppose the government. They
took to the hills and trained relentless sniper fire on the South
Africans.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day perhaps 30 people were dead, including as
many as 10 South African soldiers. Fighting could still be heard
near the army barracks northeast of this city, where the Lesotho
soldiers had set fire to the tall grass and then escaped into the
craggy hills nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the South Africans tried to lift their wounded into
helicopters near the base, they came under heavy fire and had to
stop the evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the South African soldiers also triggered a day
of looting and burning like none other in the history of Lesotho.
By early afternoon, virtually every other building was on fire and
thick plumes of acrid smoke darkened the streets and rose high
above the city. The pavements were littered with what looters had
dropped, a brand-new sneaker here, a pink sofa pillow there. It was
clear that no matter what the outcome of South Africa's action,
much of Maseru had been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's action in this country _ a state the size of
Maryland completely surrounded by South Africa _ marked the first
time that President Nelson Mandela's government has taken part in
military intervention beyond its borders. Under apartheid, South
Africa made a name for itself by meddling in its neighbor's
business. But since 1994, South Africa had stuck to a policy of
looking for negotiated solutions to Africa's conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   South African officials said they had sent more than 600
soldiers into Lesotho because they were asked to by the country's
prime minister, Pakalitha Mosisili, who believed a coup was
imminent. For weeks the country had been crippled by
anti-government protesters who believed that the country's August
elections were rigged.
</P>
<P>
   But the presence of South African soldiers here seemed to elicit
nothing but rage among Lesotho citizens. South African-owned
businesses were specifically targeted and cars with South African
license plates were stoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not the way to solve our problems,'' said Mohamed
Yunes, who was standing in front of a building he owns on Kingsway
Street here, watching looters breaking windows and setting fires.
``We've never had anything like this before. What are they doing
here? What is their plan? We will all be ruined when they are
through.''
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's minister for safety and security said at a news
conference in Pretoria that the intervention, under the auspices of
the Southern African Development Community, had been on the drawing
board for weeks and would continue until ``all the parties involved
had agreed that stability had returned.'' Botswana is also supposed
supply troops for the action.
</P>
<P>
   Mufamadi said that six Lesotho soldiers had been killed in the
fighting so far. But later reports counted as many as 17. Army
officials said there had been heavy fighting near the barracks and
the Lesotho dam, which supplies electricity to the country.
</P>
<P>
   At least five civilians have also been reported dead. By
mid-afternoon, a steady stream of refugees, mostly foreigners,
could be seen trying to get across the border into South Africa,
their cars crammed with belongings. On the South African side,
police officers said they would be setting up tents for some of the
refugees in the town of Ladybrand.
</P>
<P>
   Lesotho, an impoverished country greatly dependent on South
Africa, had been in political turmoil since results of elections
were contested by the losing party almost immediately after the
count was in.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Lesotho Congress Party won 79 of 80 Parliament seats.
But a report by a commission of representatives from South Africa,
Botswana and Zimbabwe last week cited ``serious concerns'' about
the voting. It did not however call for new elections. South Africa
has been trying to negotiate between the two parties, but to no
avail.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the chaos in the country had been escalating.
Anti-government protesters had been hijacking government vehicles
to use them to block traffic downtown. And one army general had
been forced to resign at gun point. But rioting and violence had
been at a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the opposition party, Vincent Malebo, condemned
South Africa's action as unwarranted, and a ``heartless'' attempt
by South Africa to beat Lesotho into submission. He also said the
military action was poorly thought out, and had failed to cope with
the burning and looting of shops in Maseru.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly hours went by when there was little sign of a South
African presence in downtown Maseru. Fires roared unattended and
the heat caused glass windows to explode onto the sidewalk. Lesotho
police officers walked by looters without uttering a word.
</P>
<P>
   South African soldiers also appeared stunned by the level of
resistance they encountered. On the road leading to the barracks, a
dozen South African armored vehicles seemed to be patrolling
without much purpose, taking heavy fire from many directions.
Amidst the fire, an armored medical unit was treating a half dozen
wounded soldiers. Three were dead.
</P>
<P>
   One of the wounded soldiers said the Lesotho soldiers had so far
outmaneuvered them. ``They lit all these fires and then they
scattered to the hills,'' the soldier said. ``They are at home in
those hills, we are not.''

MODERATE SERBS IN BOSNIA REMAIN A POLITICAL FORCE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE O'CONNOR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ Reassessing what seemed to be a
disaster for the Western strategy to stabilize Bosnia, many foreign
diplomats here are now saying the results of the national election
this month are not as bad as they first thought.
</P>
<P>
   Others still see the results as terrible, but say they now think
the problems may be handled.
</P>
<P>
   Returns from the voting two weekends ago are still preliminary.
But Biljana Plavsic, the Bosnian Serb president on whom the West
placed its hopes for isolating the more nationalistic Serbian
political forces, has conceded defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the presidency of the Bosnian Serb part of the
country is Nikola Poplasen, a man whose hard-line history and
campaign statements made many foreign officials and Bosnian
politicians believe that the Bosnian Serb voters had rejected
moderation by electing him.
</P>
<P>
   Judging Poplasen's support to reveal an intractable vein of
nationalist sentiment among a majority of Bosnian Serbs, many
diplomats reasoned that Western efforts here _ nearly three years
since the war ended, and after more than $3 billion in aid projects
_ had failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Poplasen in office there is no point in staying,'' a
Western ambassador said last week. ``It's good-bye and good luck,
at least as concerns the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   But as results come in showing that less hardline politicians
across the country are doing well, there is a belief that Bosnian
voters are more complicated than had been realized and that they
may vote for a militant in one race while voting for moderates in
others.
</P>
<P>
   In the half of Bosnia governed by a federation of Muslims and
Croats, as well as in the election of the national legislature,
unofficial returns indicated that hardline parties were slipping in
support.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a clear change in the mood of despair that
prompted foreign diplomats to say their governments would not be
able to continue their efforts here in any important way.
</P>
<P>
   Four days ago a European official was trying to see how his
country could extract itself from a number projects that it was
financing. But today the official said: ``The initial reaction was
that we had lost the struggle and we should let the Serbs suffer
for a period to see if that made them easier to deal with. Now it
looks as if there may be still something to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially hopeful, say diplomats with access to unofficial
voting results, is that in the Bosnian Serb republic, candidates
who oppose Poplasen's most militant views will probably have a
majority in the legislature, requiring Poplasen to negotiate with
them on the appointment of government ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Results now indicate that the same Bosnian Serbs who supported
Poplasen also voted against the most prominent wartime Bosnian Serb
nationalist still in office, Momcilo Krajisnik. His post as the
Serbian representative on Bosnia's three-member presidency went to
Zivko Radisic, foreign officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Radisic is seen by Bosnian politicians to be far more moderate
and has started to form a coalition with a political party whose
members are predominantly Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   ``My people are finally opening their eyes and now want life to
return to normal,'' said Rade Pavlovic, a leader of Radisic's
party, the Serb Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is the emotional bruising from the war, and there is
still fear of the other side,'' he said, ``so you get people voting
for a madman who says he will protect them at the same time they
vote for more moderate politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavlovic is perhaps the most popular man in the bucolic town of
Teslic, an agricultural center three hours' drive from Sarajevo and
a place from which Muslims and Croats were brutally expelled during
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Pavlovic's popularity comes from the fact that he tried
to protect minorities from hardline Bosnian Serb officials in
wartime and today is working to help people come home.
</P>
<P>
   Drago Djuric, the owner of a new radio station on the town's
outskirts, said: ``There are people on both sides of Bosnia who
want to make the country work again. They just haven't learned how
to do it yet.''

ALL HAIL THE FIRST GRAMMARIAN!  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID LEIBOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED -They say the man frets over his place in history. Now
we know. Forevermore, Bill Clinton is the Language President,
master of syntax and tense.
</P>
<P>
   All hail the First Grammarian!
</P>
<P>
   This is not such a bad thing, really. If you play close
attention and practice, practice, practice, you too can learn to
talk like a president. At home, at work _ or in front of a federal
grand jury _ this can save you serious heartache.
</P>
<P>
   All you need do is master a few concepts and words. Grab a
pencil. You'll be an amateur Clinton in no time flat.
</P>
<P>
   First, we have to work on your verb tenses, particularly the
present. This trick works best when used with the verb ``is'' and
its conjugations. An example:
</P>
<P>
   In the Paula Jones case, lawyer Bob Bennett told the judge
``there is absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or
form, with President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   This Clinton defended in his Lewinsky grand jury deposition:
``But that statement in the present tense ... is not inaccurate, if
that's what Mr. Bennett meant. That is, at the time that he said
that, and for some time before, that would be a completely accurate
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   You see the beauty, no? Because Clinton was not having sex in
the present tense _ that is, at the deposition _ technically
Bennett wasn't lying.
</P>
<P>
   Master this trick and you're golden. Imagine that next speeding
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Officer: ``Do you know how fast you were going, buddy?''
</P>
<P>
   Pseudo Clinton: ``With all due respect, there's no way I'm
speeding there!''
</P>
<P>
   Completely true. At the precise moment of that locution, you
were stopped!
</P>
<P>
   It works in the future too. Say your boss asks about that big
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Jerko: ``Smithers, where's the Colan gelo presentation? Jerry
will gnaw my leg off if it's late.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Wannabe: ``That's not going to be a problem, sir. Not at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bingo! It is a problem (begin ital) now (end ital) _ but it's
not going to be, because once snapperhead leaves, you'll get to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a true president.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do you have to be an adult to benefit from Clinton's legacy.
One word every 7-year-old should know is ``alone.'' Confronted with
his statement that he and Lewinsky were never alone, Clinton
contorted like so:
</P>
<P>
   ``But there were also a lot of times when, even though no one
could see us, the doors were open to the halls, on both ends of the
halls people could hear. ... So there were a lot of times when we
were alone, but I never thought we were.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, kiddies. Say mom issues this familiar direct order: ``Play
in front of the house. You're not old enough to cross the street
without an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross to your heart's content. The line to use if you're busted?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK, ma. I didn't cross (begin ital) alone.'' (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Sure, no adults were within 500 feet _ but there were loads of
'em in nearby houses, any one of whom could've come outside at any
minute to help you cross I-10. They were with you.
</P>
<P>
   In spirit. That's close enough.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton Age, closeness _ to the truth, or an intern _ is
all that counts. This is great news for every horny 17-year-old boy
in America.
</P>
<P>
   Who doesn't recall the frustration of being young and trying
desperately to get to third base with a JV cheerleader _ only to
hear that last-second ``No!''
</P>
<P>
   Now, courtesy of the Language President, comes the perfect
response:
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, Muffy. Please! It's not sexual relations.''
</P>
<P>
   So says Clinton: ``I'll bet the grand jurors, if they were
talking about two people they know, and said they have a sexual
relationship, they meant they were sleeping together, they meant
they were having intercourse together.''
</P>
<P>
   Ain't words grand?
</P>
<P>
   They turn the truth to putty, and leave even jagged facts silky
smooth. Master words like Clinton, and there's no telling what
you'll get yourself into, or out of.
</P>
<P>
   If you fail, well, take solace. You tried. It's like they say in
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Close, but no cigar. &QL;

U.S. TRADE OFFICIAL SAYS CHINA MARKET IS CLOSED TIGHTER
</HEADLINE>
   (jw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A senior American trade official Tuesday criticized
what he called China's unwillingness to open its markets to foreign
companies and accused the Chinese of tightening some restrictions
on foreign businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by the official, David Aaron, undersecretary of
commerce for international trade, reflected what has become an
increasingly tense trade relationship between Beijing and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron said China's policies had helped produce a
$1-billion-a-week trade deficit for Americans. He said the United
States would look for new ways to press China into allowing
improved access for American businesses to the nation's 1.2 billion
people if the situation did not improve. ``They have taken this
relationship for granted,'' Aaron said, adding later, ``The list of
barriers is just getting bigger and we're not crossing anything off
the list _ that's the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron, who was in Beijing to attend a conference and meet with
Chinese officials, offered hope that the huge trading partners
could ultimately cooperate. But the polite discussions on trade
that surrounded President Clinton's visit here this spring have
evidently given way to exasperation and blunt talk. Aaron
characterized his meetings with the Chinese as ``somewhat somber.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that the Chinese have lots of difficult problems
to face,'' Aaron told a small group of reporters, listing the broad
Asian economic crisis, troubled state-owned enterprises and this
summer's disastrous floods. ``But my job is to make sure that on
that list of problems is this trade deficit and the treatment of
businesses here.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. figures show the trade deficit with China exceeding $50
billion annually, and growing.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron's admonitions came after a tense few weeks in which new
American regulations banned imported goods from China that were
packed in untreated wood crates or pallets, a ban that may well
affect more than half of Chinese exports to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say the new requirements are necessary to
prevent further invasions by the Asian long-horned beetle, which in
the last two years has emerged from Chinese raw-wood packing
material to kill thousands of trees in New York and Chicago. But
Chinese trade officials say the regulations were motivated not by
bugs but by protectionism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unilateral action taken by the United States could impact
the normal development of Sino-American trade,'' China's Ministry
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation said in a statement last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States has for years wanted Beijing to
further open its markets, it had hoped China's stated desire to
join the World Trade Organization would take care of the problem,
since free markets are a condition of membership. But the Chinese
government has apparently accepted that it will not gain admission
to the trade organization now, and the United States has been left
to apply pressure on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron said that barriers to American business in China seemed to
be multiplying rather than shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   He said, for example, that authorities here had generally not
let foreign companies develop a distribution network for their
goods, and he complained of China's unwillingness to grant licenses
to foreign companies in such service businesses as insurance. In
the last few years, a number of American companies have established
offices in Beijing, anticipating that such licenses would be
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron also complained that the huge Chinese telecommunications
market was mostly off limits to foreign companies and noted that
the government was contemplating banning the few foreign companies
that had indirect investment in that industry.
</P>
<P>
   China has created many more subtle barriers as well, Aaron said,
such as increasingly cumbersome regulations on foreign currency
transactions. He cited a resurgence in counterfeiting that was now
so professional that copycat goods even carried fake Underwriters
Laboratories seals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If WTO isn't moving us toward market access and opening, we're
going to have to find other methods,'' he said, adding that the
Clinton administration was now ``looking at other options.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Aaron was in Beijing to attend a conference on
Chinese energy needs and to talk to officials in preparation for
the annual meeting of the Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade, a
Chinese-American panel, in Washington next month. He said he was
still optimistic that such joint forums could help resolve trade
disputes, at least in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials say the American trade deficit is not nearly
as large as U.S. officials contend, maintaining that it is closer
to $20 billion than $50 billion.

HONEYWELL COURTS MINORITY-, WOMEN OWNED FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Rich Jones remembers the small housekeeping service
that was eager to take on more work at Honeywell Inc.'s Phoenix
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Decision making at the giant electronics and aviation systems
company, however, was ticking to a much slower clock. It wasn't
ready.
</P>
<P>
   The small company pushed.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Why not? Give us some reasons, they asked.' And we didn't
have very good reasons,'' Jones recalls with a laugh. ``It was just
the way we did things.''
</P>
<P>
   Today that small business has saved Honeywell significant sums,
says Jones, vice president of supply management in the Space and
Aviation Control division. More importantly, he said, the
experience pushed the giant to respond more quickly to the
companies it deals with.
</P>
<P>
   With benefits like that mind, Honeywell has launched plans to
spend $76 million more with women- and minority-owned businesses by
the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't go on ignoring a particular segment of our society
any more than we can go on ignoring a particular part of our
market,'' Honeywell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael
Bonsignore told more than 200 small-business owners last week.
</P>
<P>
   The company invited the women and minority business owners,
mainly from the Phoenix area, to an open house and sessions on
doing business with Honeywell. More than 100 buyers representing
Honeywell offices from Phoenix to Clearwater, Fla., were available
to meet with them.
</P>
<P>
   The company logged contacts between buyers and would-be
suppliers and will track their future meetings and results, Jones
said.
</P>
<P>
   Minority-business leaders said the event was the first time
they'd seen a major Valley corporation go to such lengths to
recognize and recruit suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a model for other corporations,'' said David Cavazos,
manager of the Phoenix's small-business assistance office.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the head guy says, `This is our goal and go for it,' it
tells the troops they mean business,'' said Joe Castillo, executive
director of the Grand Canyon Minority Supplier Development Council.
</P>
<P>
   Small-business owners hope Castillo is right. Scottsdale-based
Spirit Electronics Inc. has Honeywell as a very small customer now,
President Vickie Wessel said. But when Texas Instruments held a
similar event five years ago, ``we got business out of it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell is the Valley's ninth-largest employer, with 7,500
people working in its Industrial Automation and Control and Space
and Aviation Control divisions here.
</P>
<P>
   The Minneapolis-based company figures it buys $90 million in
goods and services _ 6 percent of its total purchases _ from
minority- and woman-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Bonsignore wants that share up to 8 percent by 2000. That would
be significantly higher than the average 6.2 percent spent by
companies polled this spring by the National Center for Purchasing
Management's Center for Advanced Purchasing Studies in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate spending with minority suppliers in the Phoenix area
ranges from 3 percent to 11 percent, depending on the industry,
Castillo said. And spending is heading up, he said, as companies
become concerned about their future customers, their staffs'
diversity and ``the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonsignore said Honeywell's drive contradicts what many large
corporations are doing in the effort to be competitive _ slashing
the smallest suppliers off their lists. That affects minority- and
women-owned businesses the most, he said, because they tend to be
newer, less experienced and more thinly capitalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has to push back on this tendency to take less
risk with minority suppliers,'' he said. ``Somebody needs to prime
this pump to make sure this whole initiative doesn't go backward.''
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell's needs are wide open, Jones said. It has bought
everything from office supplies and catering services to high-tech
products and engineering services from small businesses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Phoenix suppliers are not restricted to the Honeywell plants
in their own back yard, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, with transportation, logistics, they can provide
products and services all over the nation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say corporations diversify mainly for the
public-relations effect or to comply with regulations on federal
contractors. But some regard it as good business strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Minority- and women-owned companies bring in a fresh voice,
creativity, and breakthrough thinking, Bonsignore said, even to a
battleship-size corporation that he defends as a ``turbo-charged
Stealth battleship.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with companies Honeywell's size, small firms are
fleet-footed, use technology extensively and adapt quickly,
Bonsignore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just by interfacing with companies like that, we find that a
lot of their management methods, albeit different from ours, are
contemporary, creative and time- and cost-effective,'' he said.
``And those are lessons we'd like to see reapplied in a big
organization like Honeywell.''
</P>
<P>
   Women and minority-business owners have additional
``institutional hurdles'' that other companies don't face.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can survive in that environment, it seems to me they
can bring a lot of value to helping us go on surviving in an
increasingly complex world,'' Bonsignore said.

YELTSIN GIVES LOUDER VOICE TO RUSSIAN REGIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin gave shape to Russia's new
Cabinet on Tuesday with a decree that created an inner cabinet, or
presidium, made up of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and his six
top deputies. The decree also offered a greater voice to regional
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Under the decree representatives from eight broadly drawn
geographic regions of Russia would fully participate in the
``activities of the government.'' Giving Russia's increasingly
powerful regions a greater role in federal policy making has been a
theme that Yeltsin and Primakov have repeatedly emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's decree elevates to Cabinet status the newly named head
of the Central Bank, Viktor Gerashchenko, and Yuri Osipov, head of
the Russian Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, who won a quick confirmation vote 10 days ago in
Parliament, is having trouble assembling a government and finding a
program to pull the country out of its deep economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   With Tuesday's naming of Valentina Matviyenko, Russia's current
ambassador to Greece, as deputy prime minister for social issues,
Primakov finally found a candidate willing to take a portfolio that
at least three leading politicians have turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Matviyenko, 49, will be the first woman to serve in a top
government position. She comes to the job with a reputation as a
highly regarded professional diplomat. Her appointment has yet to
be confirmed by Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   The job was abruptly refused late last week by Vladimir Ryzhkov,
a member of the centrist Our Home Is Russia faction in the
Parliament. Ryzhkov bowed out two days after his appointment became
official with a decree that Yeltsin signed. Ryzhkov's refusal dealt
an embarrassing blow to Primakov's attempt to give his Cabinet a
broad political base and undercut Yeltsin's authority.
</P>
<P>
   News reports said several regional governors had also rejected
job offers, signaling wariness toward a government that is weakened
by internal contradictions over economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons for the growing mistrust toward Primakov is
his excessive orientation toward striking compromises,'' the
Independent Newspaper, a daily here, wrote Tuesday. ``Deputy prime
ministers and Cabinet ministers are being picked at random,
practically from anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In reaching for compromise Primakov runs a risk of failing to
put together the team of professionals that he promised when he
took office, the paper said. ``The government is very close to
becoming a discussion club that is supervised by a kind of
minipolitburo in the form of a presidium, or inner Cabinet, stuffed
with governors,'' the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Yuri Maslyukov, a Communist named as first deputy prime
minister in charge of economic policy, Primakov has enlisted Vadim
Gustov, a Communist and governor of the Leningrad region around St.
Petersburg, as his second top lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   A parliamentary deputy from the left-leaning Agrarian party,
Gennady Kulik has been tapped for the agricultural portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov has yet to name a finance minister, although acting
Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov, a liberal economist, has shown
no signs of leaving his post. Alexander Shokhin, a former economics
minister and leader of the centrist faction, is deputy prime
minister in charge of financial policy. Shokhin, who like Zadornov,
strongly opposes the free-spending policies that Maslyukov
espouses, has been charged with representing Russia in
international financial discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Fyodorov, another free-market reformer and a former
finance minister who returned to the government last spring, is
reported to be remaining as head of tax collection.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview this week Shokhin spoke favorably of
an economic plan put forward this month by Fyodorov, then an acting
deputy prime minister. The two-part strategy called for an easing
of the crushing burden of internal debt and, after January,
installing strict currency controls.
</P>
<P>
   To relieve pressures caused by unpaid salaries, pensions and
other debts, Shokhin said, the government should turn abroad for
help rather than risk inflation by printing money. He acknowledged
that Russia would have difficulty regaining international
creditors' trust, but added that an initial round of talks with the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and representatives
from the European Community had left him hopeful that help might be
forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible to find some variants of solving these
problems,'' Shokhin said. ``But I regret to say that we are in time
bind. We are so short of time that we cannot say if we will manage
to come to some agreement by the end of the month.''
</P>
<P>
   The Central Bank last week offered Russian banks a plan that
would allow them to pay backed-up debts by dipping into their
reserves and tapping into a small emission of new credits from the
Central Bank. Those banks that did not partake in the plan,
apparently for fear of revealing the extent of their debts, have
been barred from trading their rubles for dollars on the Moscow
Interbank Currency Exchange.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House and prominent Democrats say they
have opened an aggressive behind-the-scenes campaign to save
President Clinton from impeachment hearings by seeking to build
support among politicians of both parties for the president to be
harshly rebuked by Congress and perhaps pay a large fine.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats involved in the effort said that thus far
there was not much appetite on Capitol Hill, particularly among
Republicans, for short-circuiting the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they said, their strategy involves back-channel
contacts with respected former Republican lawmakers like Bob Dole,
the former Senate Republican leader and his party's nominee for
president in 1996; former President George Bush, and Howard Baker,
also a former Senate Republican leader.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has begun calling party leaders and Democrats in
Congress to signal that he would be open to a censure deal. ``The
president wants to end this as soon as possible,'' said one adviser
who spoke by telephone to the president. ``He wants to get back to
governing and running the country. If a reasonable deal can be put
on the table, he will accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity,
say they are advancing several possible forms of a censure, which
would be a formal scolding from Congress. Most options, they say,
involve a large financial penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some Democrats involved in the talks described the
appropriate rebuke as a ``sanction'' rather than a censure, and are
pressing for ways to make the punishment harsher, like requiring
that Clinton stand in the well of the Senate as he is being
condemned. They are also discussing the possibility of Clinton
delivering a personal appeal to the House Judiciary Committee, and
agreeing to stop parsing the term ``sexual relations'' in his
public remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Dole said in an interview Tuesday that he discussed the scandal
with Clinton when the two met at the White House on Friday to talk
about his trip to Kosovo, Yugoslavia. But he said that the
president did not raise the possibility of his being an envoy to
help broker a censure deal, and that he was not sure he wanted to
play that role.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I told the president, `Let the process work,''' said Dole,
explaining that he was not ready to call for censure or impeachment
or anything else. ``We've just had the first tip-off and
everybody's scrambling.''
</P>
<P>
   He said censure was ``a dead option right now.'' But while he
said, ``It's pretty difficult to give your former colleagues
advice,'' Dole did not rule out the prospect of a deal, or of his
role brokering one, saying that ``there could be windows of
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers said they had sent feelers out to Dole from
people outside the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say their most convincing pitch to Republicans to
support a deal is, in the words of Leon Panetta, ``pure politics.''
Panetta, a former Clinton chief of staff who is pushing a censure
option, made this pitch to Republicans: ``You don't want Al Gore to
get into office to have a head start on 2000. What do you gain
politically by continuing to let this run itself out?''
</P>
<P>
   These Democrats also argue that Republicans could appear above
politics and concerned about the well-being of the country if they
pursued a move that would halt a prolonged impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who said he would go along with
a censure and a fine, agreed that the Gore argument to Republicans
could have powerful appeal. ``It's irresponsible to make that
judgment on that basis,'' he said. ``But I'm not naive enough to
think that isn't a significant factor.''
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the effort say they have the tacit approval
of the two Democratic leaders in Congress, Rep. Dick Gephardt and
Sen. Tom Daschle, to explore a possible deal. In fact, Panetta
said: ``Dick Gephardt suggested the idea. He called me up and said
it was something worth pursuing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One person who is deeply involved is a longtime adviser to
Gephardt, Robert Bauer, a Democratic lawyer. At the White House,
officials said, John Podesta, the deputy chief of staff, is the
point person.
</P>
<P>
   George Mitchell, the former Senate Democratic leader, said in an
interview Tuesday that two week ago he told Clinton that he was
unable to join his staff as an envoy to Congress to deal with the
scandal but that he would help him informally. Mitchell said he
recently had spoken to several congressional Democrats about
censure and thought there was growing support for such a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did _ it was indefensible,'' Mitchell said. ``But I
think the country should be spared a long-drawn-out ordeal that I
believe in the end should not and cannot end in the president's
being removed from office.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the drive for a deal has involved mainly informal
discussions initiated by Clinton's friends and advisers. They
acknowledged that the effort was uphill at best: Before they can
persuade outside Republicans to come on board, Clinton's backers
face a struggle in getting the support of Democrats on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the president has not signed on to elements of a
proposed end game. And some Democrats said they feared that Clinton
did not understand that a simple censure would not satisfy even
Democrats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure he's come to terms realistically with what may be
required here,'' said one Democrat who is pushing for a deal.
``It's got to have major teeth in it.''
</P>
<P>
   But former Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York said a simple censure
was appropriate. ``I do favor some device for making clear that we
do not condone his conduct. It's absolutely essential to do that,
and that could be censure,'' he said. ``I do not favor sanctions,
because I do not know what penalty could be put on a man who
already owes $6 million. And what else are you going to do? Flay
him in the marketplace? The public square? That's been done; he's
taken a terrible beating in the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole cautioned that he did not expect that there would be a
quick resolution to the scandal or that the president would shrink
from fighting for his survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this rather strong feeling that Clinton's not eager to
leave,'' said the man who took on the president in 1996. ``I don't
see anybody packing over there.''

 REPUBLICANS DISMISS TALK OF LESSER PUNISHMENT FOR CLINTON AS
`PREMATURE'

 By ALISON MITCHELL

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans vowed on Tuesday to press
ahead with their consideration of an impeachment inquiry even
though the broadcast of President Clinton's grand jury testimony
about Monica Lewinsky did nothing to shake his national standing,
and may even have strengthened it.
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing that Clinton's job approval ratings had gone
up after the release of his videotaped testimony, White House aides
sent strong signals that the president would accept some kind of
censure, and possibly a fine, to end the threat of impeachment. But
Republicans in both the House and the Senate flatly rejected the
idea of a deal as premature, preferring to see the outcome of the
November elections and whether the Whitewater independent counsel,
Kenneth Starr, will follow up with indictments.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the video's release, members of both parties
now consider it inevitable that the House Judiciary Committee will
quickly recommend a full impeachment inquiry. Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., who is chairman of the committee, said on Tuesday that if
the House voted for an inquiry he would like to open hearings
shortly after the midterm election.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde waved off discussion of some lesser punishment for the
president as ``very premature to talk about,'' and indicated that
such negotiations could come only if the House decided to impeach
the president and try him before the Senate. ``That's a decision,
if it ever gets there, for the Senate to make,'' he said. ``But
we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Republicans also widely dismissed any effort to
short-circuit an impeachment inquiry. ''We have a constitutional
process to follow,'' said Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the
majority whip. ``I don't think you should say, `Well, here is what
we decided should be the outcome _ it should be impeachment, it
should be censure, it should be reprimand, it should be nothing.' I
don't think we should guess what the solution should be and then
work to build it.''
</P>
<P>
   With manuevering intensifying in Congress, the White House
opened a new counterattack against Starr. Having seen the 3,200
pages of documentation made public by the House Judiciary
Committee, the president's lawyers accused the independent counsel
of distorting the evidence against Clinton in his report citing 11
possibly impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the House Judiciary Committee, David Kendall,
Clinton's private lawyer, and Charles F.C. Ruff, the White House
counsel, said Starr ``ignored all reasonable standards of
fairness'' and left out evidence that supports the President.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry, the White House press secretary, cited the
exclusion of Ms. Lewinsky's statement to a grand jury that ``no one
ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job for my
silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the charges, Hyde said, ``My staff tells me that's
just not so,'' but added that ``we welcome any correspondence''
from White House lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Republican dismissal of any deal, the White House and
prominent Democrats also worked feverishly behind the scenes to
craft a punishment for Clinton short of impeachment that could have
appeal within their own party and to respected Republicans outside
Capitol Hill. Over the weekend, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., suggested
that Clinton should testify before the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said on Tuesday that he would welcome an appearance by
Clinton before his committee, but said the ``orderly procedure''
would be for the president to appear after a formal impeachment
inquiry had begun. Sen. Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader,
said he was not certain he would recommend that the president take
such a course. ''I have questions about the kind of fair hearing he
would get,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House
minority leaer, were to meet on Tuesday with the leaders of the
House Judiciary Committee to discuss the next steps in the Clinton
investigation. The deliberations have become increasingly partisan
since the House voted 363-63 to make public Starr's report, with
Democrats accusing the Republicans of seeking to embarrass the
president.

WHITE HOUSE RETURNS FIRE WITH SHOT AT STARR REPORT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House on Tuesday fired back at
independent counsel Kenneth Starr, contending that the prosecutor
selectively omitted testimony favorable to President Clinton in his
impeachment report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republicans met to determine whether to proceed with
a presidential impeachment inquiry stemming from Starr's report and
to set a timetable for release of more material from the
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The White House salvo came one day after the extraordinary
airing of Clinton's grand jury testimony before Starr's
prosecutors. With overnight polls showing that the testimony did
not damage Clinton's job approval rating, the White House went on
the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the top Democrat and Republican on the House
Judiciary Committee, lawyers for President Clinton charged that
Starr's initial report recommending impeachment amounted to a ``one
sided and unfair manipulation of the evidence and the law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The referral is stunning in its silence about evidence that
supports the president,'' stated attorneys Charles Ruff and David
Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   The president's attorneys complained that Starr's report
excluded Monica Lewinsky's testimony that the president did not ask
her to lie about their sexual affair or try to buy her silence.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's comments were made public Monday when the House
released more than 3,000 pages of supporting documents and evidence
gathered by Starr, including a transcript of Lewinsky's testimony
before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just like to say that no one ever asked me to lie and
I was never promised a job for silence,'' Lewinsky testified.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry, traveling with the president
in New York, said it was ``grossly unfair'' that Starr had not
included that testimony in his summary report, which concluded that
Clinton should be impeached because he lied to the grand jury and
urged others to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also examined whether Clinton's friend Vernon Jordan had
helped Lewinsky obtain a job around the time she was subpoenaed to
testify about their relationship in a sexual harassment case
brought by Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said that the independent counsel ``found room for
hundreds and hundreds of salacious details that, you know,
titillated the country and embarrassed the country in the world.
But it didn't find room for one sentence in the testimony of Monica
Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's deputy counsel, Robert J. Bittman, replied to the
criticism, sending his own letter to Judiciary Committee chairman
Henry Hyde. He said the White House contention was ``so clearly
wrong that the (Ruff-Kendall) letter is obviously an intentional
effort to mislead the committee and the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Bittman said the report had noted Lewinsky as saying ``the
president did not expressly instruct her to lie'' but that Clinton
``did suggest misleading cover stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Bittman said that although Lewinsky said she was ``not promised
a job for my silence,'' the report noted that employment assistance
``may not be explicitly spelled out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde. R-Ill., said that if the White House is unhappy with Starr
they should direct their complaints to Attorney General Janet Reno
or the three judge federal panel that has authority over the
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Hyde and other Republicans on the Judiciary Committee
met to determine what documents to release next now that the most
sensational material, including the widely broadcast videotape of
the president's testimony, has been made public.
</P>
<P>
   The House leadership is expected to meet Wednesday and the
Judiciary Committee Thursday to discuss the next step.
</P>
<P>
   All of the Starr material must be released by next Monday,
according to a resolution passed by the House.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has yet to release former Lewinsky friend Linda
Tripp's now famous taped conversations with her as well as
testimony from a number of others called before the grand jury,
including Clinton's secretary Betty Currie, Clinton friend Jordan
and Secret Service agents.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the Judiciary Committee have complained that the
process has not been fair, with Republicans overruling any of their
objections to releasing certain testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde denied that he was being partisan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their (Democrats) strategy is to look for arguments. My
strategy is to smile,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a number of lawmakers continued to float the idea
that the president might come to Capitol Hill and testify before a
congressional committee about allegations in the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats have quietly talked about cutting a deal where
Clinton might testify, then be censured by Congress instead of
facing prolonged impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said Clinton would ``be welcome'' to testify before his
committee. He said that any talk about ``cutting a deal was very,
very premature.''
</P>
<P>
   While many Republicans hoped the release of the Clinton
videotape would build public support for impeachment proceedings,
the overnight polls dispelled such notions.
</P>
<P>
   A USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll found that attitudes toward Clinton
did not change significantly after the broadcast of the videotape.
While the poll found that four out of five respondents believed
that Clinton lied to the grand jury about his sexual relationship
with Lewinsky, 56 percent said he should not be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also showed Clinton's job approval holding steady, with
66 percent of those surveyed giving the president high marks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meeting with Japanese prime minister Keizo Obuchi,
declined to comment on the airing of his videotaped testimony. ``I
don't have any contributions to make,'' he said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Contradicting investigators for the Whitewater
independent counsel, Monica Lewinsky told a grand jury in August
that they had asked her to wear a wire to secretly record Vernon
Jordan Jr. and possibly President Clinton, according to a
transcript of her testimony released by the House on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly III, the independent counsel's spokesman, said
Tuesday that the investigators had never suggested that Ms.
Lewinsky secretly record conversations with Clinton or Jordan, and
that he could not explain the discrepancy between his denial and
her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators for the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, have
stood by their position since the outset of the Lewinsky inquiry on
Jan. 16, when they initially confronted Ms. Lewinsky with evidence
of possible perjury and obstruction of justice. (The investigators
have not disputed reports that they suggested she secretly record
lower-level employees like Betty Currie, the president's
secretary.)
</P>
<P>
   But in her testimony to the grand jury, Ms. Lewinsky had a
different recollection of that first meeting with the
investigators. The confrontation occurred shortly after she had
been captured on audiotape at a lunch with her Pentagon colleague
Linda Tripp discussing how she would deny a sexual relationship
with Clinton in the Paula Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, prosecutors urged Ms. Lewinsky to agree to
cooperate with them, Ms. Lewinsky and officials in Starr's office
have said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them what cooperating meant, it entailed, and they
told me that _they had _ first they had told me before about that,
that they had had me on tape saying things from the lunch I had had
with Linda at the Ritz Carlton the other day and they _ then they
told me that I, that I'd have to agree to be debriefed and that I'd
have to place calls or wear a wire to see _ to call Betty and
Jordan and possibly the president,'' Ms. Lewinsky testified before
the grand jury two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky said she told the prosecutors she would not do it.
</P>
<P>
   Plato Cacheris, one of Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers, said he did not
know who had asked Ms. Lewinsky to wear the wire or the precise
nature of the request.
</P>
<P>
   By her account, Ms. Lewinsky was brow-beaten by the prosecutors
to try to reach an agreement to cooperate with them. She testified
she was discouraged from calling her Washington lawyer, Francis
Carter, or her mother, and that while she was free to leave at any
time, she feared she might be arrested. She said she was also told
that the prosecutors were preparing to make a case against her
mother.
</P>
<P>
   But officials from Starr's office familiar with the
confrontation have painted a different picture of it. They have
said that, while waiting for Ms. Lewinsky's mother to arrive from
New York, the investigators had gone to dinner with Ms. Lewinsky,
spent time at shopping at a mall, and watched a movie on
television. They also permitted Ms. Lewinsky to call a lawyer in
California, William Ginsburg, and repeatedly told her she was free
to leave at any time.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they tried to reach a quick cooperation
agreement because they knew that a reporter from Newsweek knew
about their inquiry and feared it would become public in a matter
of days. Once it became public, Ms. Lewinsky's utility as a
cooperating witness would sharply decline, they said.

 &HT;    Tiger sends his regrets
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Have you noticed the interesting relationship Tiger
Woods has with Georgia tournaments? Weird, isn't it? Seems he
either snares them or snubs them. There's no in between.
</P>
<P>
   Woods walks out in 1996 at Callaway Gardens. He wins at Augusta
in 1997. He takes the trophy in May at Atlanta's BellSouth Classic.
Six weeks later, Woods and his International Management Group
announce that he won't be back to defend at the TPC at Sugarloaf in
1999. Because the BellSouth has been switched to April, the week
before the Masters, Woods does not want to make his favorite major
his fourth tournament in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Kaplan, the BellSouth's executive director, hardly had time
to celebrate Woods' win in May before the 1999 rug was pulled out
from under him. He got the call from IMG on June 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had barely cleaned up the golf course,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods clearly regrets the situation but apparently did not
realize when making comments about returning to defend that it
would entail playing three straight tournaments before the Masters.
He has an obligation to play Bay Hill as both an IMG client and
Orlando resident. The Players Championship comes the next week,
followed by Atlanta and the Masters. Woods also remembers the
fatigue he felt last year from navigating Sugarloaf and would be
concerned about doing it back to back with hilly Augusta National.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not me (to miss a defense),'' Woods said, ``but being the
fourth week in a row, that's the main thing. It's just an unusual
situation. If it was in the same time slot as it was last year, I
wouldn't have any problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kite once failed to defend at Atlanta, but that was because
of injury. When Mark Calcavecchia didn't defend at Vancouver last
month, it was because he qualified for a more prestigious
concurrent event, The NEC World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unprecedented, but it's certainly unusual,'' said Bob
Combs, the PGA Tour's senior vice president of public relations and
communications. ``We did speak with (Woods) before his statement
(July 20). We did encourage him to come back. But obviously, in
this instance, he had some compelling reasons not to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed,'' Kaplan said. ``It's kind of out of
character for what normally happens on the PGA Tour. Looking from
his perspective, I realize it would be four tournaments in a row.
But he's a young man. He's going to play a lot more Masters in the
future. . . . This is not something the Tour is happy with. I think
they feel it's a champion's duty to defend.''
</P>
<P>
   While Kaplan still expects to sell out the event _ and, in fact,
did so last year long before Woods committed _ it has made for some
awkwardness. Woods' photo will be used on promotional material, but
tournament organizers will be unable to say, ``Come see Tiger Woods
defend his BellSouth Classic title.'' Interestingly, Kaplan will be
one of the No. 1-tee starters at East Lake next month when Woods
plays in the Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger Woods is certainly a part of our tournament history,''
Kaplan said. ``We're not saying he's the defending champion. We're
just saying he's the '98 champion. I don't think from a corporate
standpoint there will be any effect as to whether Tiger Woods is
playing or not playing. I think where it has an effect is on your
individual sales.''

 &HT;    The allure of sports drugs hard for women to resist
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's no longer a secret. Many male athletes are
supplementing their fitness techniques of chugging milk and lifting
weights with performance-enhancing drugs. The temptation also is
becoming too great for some female athletes to resist. Substances
such as anabolic steroids have a more dramatic effect on them than
on men, because the testosterone in their bodies gets a bigger
boost.
</P>
<P>
   _ According to the most recent Youth Risk Behavior Survey
conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2.4
percent of female high-school students acknowledged using the
illegal steroids, compared with 4.9 percent of males.
</P>
<P>
   _ A survey of youngsters at four Massachusetts middle schools,
published this spring in the journal Pediatrics, found that 2.6
percent of girls were users, barely behind the 2.8 percent rate for
boys.
</P>
<P>
   _ In his book, ``The Steroids Game,'' Penn State professor
Charles Yesalis estimates the use of steroids among female college
athletes at 5 percent in swimming, 6 percent in basketball and 10
percent in track and field.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is increased competition and more at stake,''
Yesalis said, ``potential pro outlets and potential scholarships
because of Title IX, you're going to see more people willing to
cheat to gain an advantage over their opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're seeing an increased number of parents, similar with
teenage boys, that get carried away. They don't provide their kids
with a moral and ethical foundation, where they know there are
certain boundaries you shall not cross in pursuit of victory.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no mistaking the dangers of steroids for women, with
documentation provided by recent trials involving trainers and
coaches from the former East German sports empire.
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Krieger, 1986 European shot put champion, was given
mysterious blue pills that she thought were vitamins. She developed
facial hair and a dramatically enlarged Adam's apple.
</P>
<P>
   Krieger recently announced plans to sue the coaches and trainers
for allegedly force-feeding her steroids without her knowledge.
Krieger had a sex-change operation and changed her first name to
Andreas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trusted them, but they took advantage of me,'' Krieger
testified at a trial of East German officials, some of whom
admitted to supplying drugs to athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Some sports leaders in the former Soviet Union and, more
recently, China also have incorporated steroids into building
strong women's programs. The carrot dangling in front of them is
the relative newness of women's sports, which allows countries to
make inroads more quickly than in men's athletics. ``We think it is
easier for the women to shoot into international fame,'' said
professor Tian Maijiu, vice president of the Beijing Institute of
Physical Education.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials adamantly deny existence of a state-run doping
program, claiming instead that individual coaches push too hard.
The fact is that at least 23 Chinese athletes, mostly women, have
tested positive for steroids since 1990. When the Chinese women's
swim team arrived in Australia for the world championships in
January, customs officials uncovered 13 vials labeled ``growth
hormone'' in an athlete's luggage. Four of those swimmers were
banned this summer for two years.
</P>
<P>
   A case study on the striking influence of steroids on women is
the East German runner Marita Koch, whose 47.60 seconds for the 400
meters in 1985 is a world mark that still stands.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Koch had been doping with Oral-Turinabol, a
testosterone-based steroid, for at least four years leading up to
her record run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have relatively little (testosterone) and now, with
testosterone-based anabolic steroids, you can double, triple, even
increase by 10 times the amount (in their bodies),'' said Jaci Van
Heest, director of exercise physiology for U.S. Swimming. ``The
bang for the buck is much greater than doing it to a guy because
they already have the natural amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, you have the huge growth in women's sports, and there
are a lot of issues that make it fertile ground for any kind of
cheating.''

 &HT;    ONE WOMAN'S VOICE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jackie Joyner-Kersee, 36, recently completed a two-decade career
as an Olympic champion track star. She talks about whether female
athletes are better off being coached by men or women:
</P>
<P>
   I can understand both sides, but I feel there are a lot of great
male coaches out there working with females. And they've been very
successful with those females. I don't think they should be
criticized or lose their job because they're not a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Some women might work better with a female coach. I never saw
any difference. Whoever was coaching me, I respected them as my
coach. If I had a concern, I took it to them. I never felt the
people working with me would put me in position to cause me any
harm.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a great coach, you should be able to coach anyone or
anybody. I think Pat Summitt can coach me in basketball. If there
are jobs available and you qualify, I think you should be given
every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to see us get in a battle where we start to fight
among ourselves and our own peers. Some of those males we might be
criticizing are some of the same males that are trying to put us in
position of power and make sure we get those jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Louisiana Tech and Georgia. They have done great jobs
with women's basketball programs, and both being coached by males.

 &HT;    Pregnancy a big hurdle for athletic careers
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just as Shalonda Enis was ready to tear it up on the
basketball court, her career nearly came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through her sophomore season at Celeste (Texas) High
School, Enis had to leave the team. She was expecting a child, but
waited until the seventh month of her term to tell coaches, friends
and family. She was embarrassed and felt she had let her family
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was over,'' Enis, a sleek 6-foot-1 forward, said.
``It was a disappointment to my family, but they told me that they
would help. They told me that one mistake shouldn't keep me from
doing what I loved. From then on, I didn't even think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Enis took that advice. For seven years _ through the University
of Alabama, where she made All-America, to the ABL's Seattle Reign,
where she was named rookie of the year _ Enis traveled a lonely,
sometimes sorrowful road toward fulfilling her basketball talent
and hoping it would become a way to raise her son.
</P>
<P>
   As career opportunities in athletics arise for women, many are
forced to face questions that never occur to their male
counterparts. Can I start a family and continue playing ball? What
about an unplanned pregnancy?
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, schools, franchises and leagues must balance
consideration for the athlete with the needs of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Swoopes, the WNBA's centerpiece player entering the 1997
season, missed much of the regular season while giving birth. She
came back in time to help her team, the Houston Comets, win the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA spun her absence into a positive by showing Swoopes'
family _ son Jordan, husband Eric _ in the stands at games.
</P>
<P>
   When ABL player Carla McGhee, formerly of the Atlanta Glory,
announced last fall that she was sitting out the season because of
her pregnancy, she received the vocal and unqualified support of
the league and the manangement of her team, the two-time champion
Columbus Quest.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Suzie McConnell Serio of the WNBA's Cleveland Rockers is
the mother of four children who have been prominently featured as
part of the league's publicity efforts. In the ABL, Enis has plenty
of company in the mommy brigade, as Taj McWilliams, Yolanda
Griffith and Edna Campbell have generated similar attention for
their roles as parents and players.
</P>
<P>
   It was only this summer that Enis was reunited full-time with
her son, Chase, and moved him into a new home in the Seattle area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised by my grandmother. We're kind of used to taking
care of each other,'' she said. ``Chase has been surrounded by love
all around him. But this is what I've been working toward for so
long.''
</P>
<P>
   But Enis knows how fragile that balance can be and is mindful of
the sacrifices that often have to be made, especially for a single
mother.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing high school, she enrolled at a junior college
and made All-America. In 1995, she moved on to Alabama, and
suddenly the weekend visits home to see Chase were no longer
possible. Even while playing on a tight-knit Crimson Tide team that
was supportive of her situation, the separation at times was
painful.
</P>
<P>
   She has missed hearing Chase's first words, watching him walk
for the first time and seeing him off for his first day of school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him on holidays and during the summer,'' Enis said.
``That was the hardest part of all. There were times when I was
depressed and he felt a million miles away. Talking to him on the
telephone helped me get through it.''

TUREK CONTENT THIS SEASON TO BE STARS' BACKUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roman Turek's age, his standing in the NHL and, maybe, most
important, his agent, say he has to become a No. 1 goalie soon.
</P>
<P>
   But Roman Turek's smile says otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Turek, the Stars' talented 28-year-old backup, has rolled
through training camp and preseason with not so much as a hint of
confrontation with No. 1 goalie Ed Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   While Turek's play has been solid, his demeanor is that of a
role player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, yeah, I want to be a No. 1 goalie. But Eddie is big
name, and he played so well last year,'' said Turek, from the Czech
Republic. ``I am backup, I know that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Turek has a top-level reputation in the NHL and his
6-foot-3, 190-pound frame has many teams drooling. That led his
agent, Rich Winter, to say this summer, when Turek signed a
one-year contract, that by next season, ``He'll either be the No. 1
in Dallas or he'll be the No. 1 in \Rexpansion\S Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars know full well they might lose Turek next season _
either to the expansion draft, to a potential contract holdout or
to a trade _ so they've prepared by loading up with minor-league
goalies. Longtime Stars No. 3 goalie Manny Fernandez will play with
the Houston Aeros of the International Hockey League this season,
while recently acquired minor-league veteran Mike Bales and rookie
Marty Turco will play for the Stars' IHL affiliate in Kalamazoo,
Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a situation where we know the things that could happen,
and we want to be best prepared,'' Stars general manager Bob Gainey
said. ``With Roman's \Rone-year\S contract, we know there could be
some options that both sides will have to study.''
</P>
<P>
   Turek was 11-10-1 in 23 games last season, while Belfour
dominated the playing time with 61 appearances and a 37-12-10
record. Belfour earned his starts; he finished with a league-best
1.88 goals against average. Turek had a 2.22 GAA.
</P>
<P>
   But Turek said he knows he could improve his numbers if he could
play on a more consistent basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played best when I played three or four games in a row; you
get in groove,'' he said. ``But playing one game and then sitting
and playing one game and then sitting, that is hard on any
goalie.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Winter is trying to move things along for his
client. Turek will turn 29 on May 21 and is just two years shy of
being eligible for unrestricted free agency. He spent much of his
formative years playing in the Czech Republic and now wants to
follow in the path of a more famous Czech goalie _ two-time NHL
most valuable player Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see in Roman a lot of the same things as Dominik Hasek,''
Winter said. ``And when Dominik Hasek was the backup to Ed Belfour
in Chicago, the only way for him to get his chance was to be traded
\Rto the Buffalo Sabres\S.''
</P>
<P>
   But while all signs say Turek will leave the organization after
this season, Turek said he can't think that far in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play more games, I want to get better,'' he said.
``I am better goalie now, and I want to get even better, but I am
backup here. I just want to help.''
Stars reassign six
The Stars yesterday sent six players to their IHL affiliate.
Assigned to the Michigan K-Wings were goalie Mike Bales, defensemen
Frederic Bouchard, Evgeny Tsybuk and forwards Lee Jinman, Marty
Flichel and Jeff Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   The moves bring the Stars' roster to 37 players. They must be
down to 24 by Oct. 10.

 &HT;    WOMEN IN SPORTS: '...without regard to sexual orientation....'
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The subject crops up early in the recruiting process.
A female high school athlete, or mom or dad, Mom or Dad, will raise
it to a college coach.
</P>
<P>
   Are there lesbians on your team? On your coaching staff?
</P>
<P>
   If so, does it cause problems?
</P>
<P>
   How do you deal with it?
</P>
<P>
   Andy Landers, longtime women's basketball coach at the
University Georgia, says the topic is brought up with about half of
the players he recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sexuality thing is a very important issue,'' Landers said.
``You hear comments like, 'We've just been really turned off at
some of the AAU tournaments by the way some of the (women) look and
dress. We're just really concerned about that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be a parent, that could be a kid. But they want you
to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Landers says he declines to answer directly to avoid being
labeled as homophobic or as someone who runs a program that goes
out of its way to welcome lesbian players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   How should a coach respond? ``Most don't even know (about their
players' sexuality),'' said Betty Jaynes, CEO of the 4,000-plus
member Women's Basketball Coaches Association. ``It's such a
sensitive issue that they take it just like religion: You're not
really supposed to ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Some coaches are not neutral. Penn State's Rene Portland once
said she does not want lesbians on her team, a declaration that
sparked gay_rights advocates to demonstrate at games and outside
her house. They tied up telephone lines and occupied the school's
administration building in protest. Penn State has since instituted
a university_wide policy against discrimination based on sexual
orientation, and Portland refuses to discuss the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Other programs tend to be classified as consciously welcoming
lesbian players, sometimes by rival coaches engaging in gutter
recruiting tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Two campuses this past spring felt the sting from the issue.
Southern Colorado basketball coach Sherry Winn survived an ouster
attempt by half of her roster because of her perceived sexual
orientation, a controversy that she believes cost her three
recruits who went elsewhere. LSU softball coach Cathy Compton
wasn't so lucky, losing her job in part because of an ``unhealthy
relationship'' with one of her players, according to athletics
director Joe Dean.
</P>
<P>
   Recruitment of top athletes long has been the life blood of
men's college athletics, but rarely does a high_school boy or his
parents express concern about whether a program welcomed homosexual
athletes or discouraged them from enrolling.
</P>
<P>
   For the women, it's a different story, as parents and their
children deal with reality and perception _ in some cases,
misperception _ about what it means to play for a lesbian coach and
play alongside a lesbian athlete.
</P>
<P>
   When Chris Gobrecht reflects on growing up in Huntington Beach,
Calif., in the early 1970s, she pictures the afternoons on her
driveway, draining jump shots while nervously peering over her
shoulder to see who might be watching.
</P>
<P>
   At 15, she loved the sport. But Gobrecht, now the women's head
coach at Southern Cal, kept her game secret for fear of being seen
as unladylike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just the perception that I would be less desirable to a
man,'' said Gobrecht, who is married and the mother of two. ``I
didn't want to be seen as taking it seriously. So if I was
shooting, I would go hide if I saw a car come around the corner. I
cared what the opposite sex thought of me, and I felt I had to hide
my sports interest.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, girls involved in sport often drew smirks and
wisecracks. They were called anything from the benign ``tomboy'' to
the derogatory ``butch'' _ and worse. ``You're told by _ in most
cases, mean_spirited people _ that you look like a boy,'' said
Teresa Edwards, former University of Georgia star and four_time
Olympian. ``Or you're acting like a boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some young women heard crazy notions about why they should stay
out of sports. You'll get bulging muscles. You're frail and you'll
get hurt. You won't be able to have babies.
</P>
<P>
   Those distortions have not disappeared. Pro basketball star
Rebecca Lobo remembers first hearing her sexuality questioned on a
Springfield, Mass., playground, the summer before her sophomore
year of high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``This girl on the other team called me a 'dyke,''' recalled
Lobo, who is heterosexual. ``I had to ask my mother what it was.
She laughed, and said it was another word for 'lesbian.' She said,
'You're scoring on her so she had to call you a name.' `` How
people deal with lesbians in women's sports, as they continue to
flourish, probably will become an issue, because most parties agree
that their numbers are significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be ridiculous to try and dispute that,'' said Kate
Kendell, executive director of the National Center for Lesbian
Rights.
</P>
<P>
   If disproportionate numbers of lesbians have found comfort in
athletics, it's because most women historically were discouraged
from participating and many who did were already social outcasts,
say women who have studied the history of sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``In part, being lesbian means living against the tide, and
living against a stereotypical gender role,'' Kendall said.
``Complementary of that is choosing a career or activities that are
not rigidly gender_type.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stereotypes about why lesbians prefer certain things and gay
men prefer certain things start with some germ of truth. It clearly
appears to be the case, at least anecedotally for me and my
friends, that many more lesbians like sports than do my gay male
friends. Part of it is aptitude, part is not buying into
traditional gender type and part is that unknown biological,
genetic, scientific question of how the genes are formed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariah Burton Nelson, a former basketball player and the author
of several books on the subject of lesbianism in sports, said, ``It
used to be, in the old days, that in order to play sports you had
to be willing to buck huge social trends. You had to be willing to
put up with a lot of pressure and social stigma. In the '40s and
'50s, and even the '60s, lesbians were willing to do that. So those
brave lesbian women opened the doors, made it socially acceptable
for women in general to play sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now straight girls play sports.''
</P>
<P>
   With the enactment of Title IX legislation a quarter-century ago
that outlawed gender discrimination in schools that receive federal
funds, women's sport is attracting from a wider group. Increased
participation has helped soften the stereotype of the female
athlete, and studies reveal that girls who participate have greater
self-esteem and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   While girls are benefiting from sports, conflicts over
lesbianism could become a deterrent to growth. When all women need
to be working in conjunction to promote their sport, a coach or
athlete's sexual orientation can be divisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``My real beef is the polarization that I see it causing,'' said
Gobrecht, who welcomed a lesbian booster club when she coached at
Washington. ``We don't want to polarize our fans, our coaches, our
athletes. We're choosing up sides, and it's a real threat to our
profession.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fellowship of Christian Athletes set up a booth at the
women's NCAA Final Four in April, passed out brochures and, when
asked, expanded on the group's sexual-purity statement. The FCA
considers any homosexual activity unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   FCA director of national programs Julie Brown, a former
assistant coach at Florida State and Tulsa, said she has counseled
lesbian players who have become ``too wrapped up in a
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   To some, the lesbian label is simply a tactic used by a
male-dominated society to keep women from invading what was once an
all-guys sports fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   Jaynes said she is shocked at comments she hears in meetings
with influential leaders of men's college basketball. She refused
to name names.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically say, '(Lesbianism) is a terrible thing to be in
women's sports.' Or, 'Why can't we get rid of them?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never expect them to make those blanket comments about
blacks or Asians. If you look at attendance of women's basketball,
sponsorship and money generated, (lesbanism) hasn't hurt women's
basketball that much. But . . . with some of the high_profile
males, I can't do anything to change their minds. They're too set
in their ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Because lesbianism in sports is largely closeted, when it
bubbles over to the public, it often creates uneasiness.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, University of South Carolina coach Pam Parsons was
pressured to resign after a Sports Illustrated article revealed her
relationship with player Tina Buck, a graduate of the former
Briarcliff High in DeKalb County. Parsons sued the magazine and
lost. She and Buck later were convicted of perjury. Such cases
instill concerns that young athletes could be ``seduced'' by
lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Flynn, coach of a Philadelphia_based women's AAU team and
operator of a recruiting service, says parents would be shocked if
they knew what awaited their daughters when they arrive on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pervasive and extensive, and you either walk away or
accept it,'' Flynn said. ``I tell kids it's not about the coach
being gay, it's about whether your teammates are and whether
they're going to come after you.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're around this four years non_stop, there is a certain
amount of pressure. It's one thing to come out, another to have a
gauntlet of lesbians leading you down the path.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say such fears are unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the stereotype is out there, but parents
shouldn't have a fear that, if their daughter plays sports, they'll
turn into a lesbian,'' Lobo said.
</P>
<P>
   Winn, the Southern Colorado coach, finds the notion that women
are ``recruited'' into a lesbian lifestyle as preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't exist,'' she said. ``Young women don't go away to
college and make a decision to become lesbians. But at college,
they often have opportunity to discover who they are because they
have left home _ whether it's to drink or not, whether to make a
decision to have sex with a partner or not, whether they change
their religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things happen when young men and young women go to
college, and they get freedom to experience who they are. And it
doesn't have anything to do with recruiting. Sexual preference is
not a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Some heterosexual players say lesbians at least can make them
feel uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rude awakening for Gergana Branzova when a few of her
Florida International basketball teammates expressed an attraction
and asked her for a date. Branzova had come from Bulgaria, where
she says lesbianism in sport is not as prevalent and where
homosexuality carries more stigma than in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to be very straightforward,'' said Branzova, a
first_round pick of the WNBA's Detroit Shock. ``I said, 'Listen, I
can be your friend as long you don't touch me.' There has to be a
boundary, a certain distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, then, we became good friends. I respect what they are. .
. . It's funny now. Then, it was scary.'' Pat Griffin, a lesbian
activist, says the worried athletes and parents are dreaming up a
``lesbian bogeywoman,'' a sexual predator.
</P>
<P>
   What's a father to do? Harvey Catchings, whose daughters Tamika
(Tennessee) and Tauja (Illinois) are college standouts, is
sensitive to the world his daughters inhabit, one in which he
believes lesbanism is ``pretty prevalent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been able to handle it,'' Catchings said, ``because
they say, 'I've got to play with these people on the court. When
I'm off the court, then it's my choice.' It's no different than
when I played in the NBA. You may not have liked everybody on the
team, but you had to function as a unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Another unfortunate trend of big-time men's sports is negative
recruiting, but nothing has approached the down-and-dirty tactic of
coaches painting their rivals of being a ``lesbian'' program.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Texas has been so tagged since the early
1990s, in part because current WNBA star Sheryl Swoopes quit the
program days into her freshman year, reportedly because she was
bothered by the presence of lesbians on the team. Coach Jody
Conradt was ambushed on the recruiting trail after Swoopes
defected. The Lady Longhorns fell out of favor with state high
school coaches and coveted players, and Texas has disappeared from
the national picture, failing to contend for an NCAA title since
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes says now she left to be closer to home, but the rumor
lives on, as does the label.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge problem,'' said Griffin, a University of
Massachusetts professor and author of ``Strong Women, Deep Closets:
Lesbians and Homophobia in Sport.'' ``You know there are lesbian
athletes and coaches, and there is no one who feels safe enough to
be publicly visible. So you have a lot of negative recruiting that
coaches do, trying to slander rival teams by telling a prospective
athlete there are lesbians on the team or the coach is a lesbian.''
</P>
<P>
   Ex-NBA player Jim Chones has a daughter, Kareeda, who just
finished her career at Marquette, and another, Kaayla, a high
school senior and a top recruit. He perceives the lesbian label as
nothing more than ``scare tactics,'' another instance of a coach
using any means possible to gain an edge.
</P>
<P>
   When Kaayla makes her college decision, he says, it'll come down
to the prospects for winning games and titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it like this _ it's in our society,'' Chones said.
``I'm not going to go out there and make judgments against somebody
because of their lifestyle. All I hope and pray is that my daughter
will be the best person she can be. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Like my oldest daughter says, 'Dad, you just can't run from
it. It's everywhere in society. But what I found out, Dad, is a lot
of them are good people. They're just trying to make a living. And
they may have a preference, but it doesn't necessarily mean I'm
like them or they're like me. But we respect each other and we have
a common goal _ to win.' ``

 &HT;    Danger zones: Some male coaches pay too much attention
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Diana Nyad was 14, a high school freshman. It was 34
years ago, long before she had become a famous ultra-distance
swimmer going from the Bahamas to South Florida and around
Manhattan Island.
</P>
<P>
   Nyad said she was resting at the house of her coach in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., on the day of the state high school meet when he
ripped off her swimsuit and sexually assaulted her.
</P>
<P>
   It happened again, two years later, in his office, according to
Nyad.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these years later, as I think I'm a pretty together,
fairly happy person in life, I can still get upset and angry, and
even have those little-girl hurt feelings over what happened,''
Nyad, 48, said in a recent interview. ``In a very brief and violent
couple of minutes, probably more like five minutes, he came in and
molested me. I threw up all over the sheets and bled. It was a real
scene. I was shaking. I probably was literally in some state of
shock, with loss of breath and dizziness.''
</P>
<P>
   The target of her accusations is Jack Nelson, a former Olympic
swimmer who went on from Pine Crest School to coach the 1976 Games
women's team and gain induction into the International Swimming
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Nyad, a Fox sports correspondent and National Public Radio
commentator, has spoken often of the alleged incidents, sometimes
in public forums, but has rarely mentioned Nelson by name.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who has not been charged, has heard the accusations
before and denies them, saying Nyad has long suffered from a
fixation with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is really sick,'' Nelson, 66, said in an interview.
``There is absolutely nothing to it. I've been investigated by
everybody known to man. How long does this continue?
</P>
<P>
   ``She is completely and totally known as a great actress. You
follow me? The more times she tells the story, the more dramatic
she gets.''
</P>
<P>
   The accusations illustrate the hot-button issue of how the
situation of adult men coaching young women can turn into something
tawdry.
</P>
<P>
   For Nyad, her story is not unusual. She said some young women
who have heard her tale offer thanks for freeing them from the
shame and isolation from their own experiences with male coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The most notorious known case occurred overseas. This summer,
the Irish government concluded that two coaches, including former
Olympic coach Derry O'Rourke, had for decades sexually abused girls
in the country's Amateur Swimming Association. The government
recommended some 100 reforms to protect athletes, and O'Rourke was
sentenced to 12 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Role makes coach an authority figure
</P>
<P>
   By the nature of the position, the coach is the dominant,
controlling authority. Many sports involving women are individual
in nature, not team, and one-on-one attention is common.
</P>
<P>
   The American Swimming Coaches Association is believed to be the
country's only sports federation or association that spells out how
far coaches can go with their athletes. Its code of conduct says:
``A (coach) shall not engage in sexual relations with athletes that
they coach, even of legal age.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the effectiveness of the code is debatable. Six years
since the clause was added, the 5,500-member association hasn't had
a single complaint from an athlete come to its review board. John
Leonard, executive director of the association, confirmed that some
incidents in recent years never were brought before the board,
largely because the swimmer or her parents didn't want to create a
stir.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a young lady is with a male coach, the parents will think
about it and say, `This doesn't make sense (to pursue),''' he said.
``Frequently, it's not a sexual harassment issue, but a . . .
fall-in-love sort of thing. And the parents say, 'No, this isn't
appropriate because it's a 25-year-old coach and a 16-year-old girl
or whatever,' but nobody ever makes an issue out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, University of Florida women's swim coach Mitch Ivey,
then 44, was fired after ESPN reported that he had been sexually
involved with his athletes _ some under the legal age for consent _
and verbally abused others to the point of constituting sexual
harassment. The incidents occurred before Ivey was hired by
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Ivey was 29 when he made advances
toward a 15-year-old on his California club team. The girl said
they began having sex when she was 17, which led to an abortion.
They married when she was 18 _ only to divorce, she said, when she
caught him having sex with a 17-year-old swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 33, Ivey allegedly began a relationship with a
16-year-old swimmer. They got engaged a year later, but she broke
it off after graduating from high school.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ivey was not accused of being sexually involved with
University of Florida swimmers, one told ESPN that he spoke
numerous sexual slurs to her.
</P>
<P>
   And attorney Nancy Hogshead, an Olympian who trained with Ivey's
club team, said this week she was repulsed by Ivey's behavior and
would have left him had she not retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, he used me to make his girlfriend jealous,'' she
recalled. ``He was telling her that I was interested in him. He's a
great coach. He got me my Olympic gold medal. But personally . . .
``
</P>
<P>
   She paused, then continued, ``I don't want to finish that
sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivey said he did nothing wrong and was fired by the university
so it would avoid bad publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard said coaches have become far more aware of crossing the
line than when he began coaching. ``If my memory isn't faulty,
there were a lot more coaches involved with swimmers 30 years ago
than there are now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Essick, former head of U.S. Swimming, acknowledged that the
problem in his sport has not disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff is happening in American society today, and it
probably has happened forever,'' said Essick. ``If the Boy Scouts
of America and the Catholic Church are having those problems, I
don't feel like we're the lone ranger.''
</P>
<P>
   Swimming is not alone in the sports world.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, two former tennis players at Syracuse University
filed a lawsuit alleging they were sexually harassed by coach Jesse
Dwire. Kirsten Ericson and Dacia Kornechuk are seeking $25 million
each in damages, claiming Dwire insisted on performing full-body
massages on them and repeatedly made inappropriate sexual comments
aimed at initiating a sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The university suspended Dwire for three months without pay in
the summer of 1997 for remarks to athletes that violated the
school's sexual harassment and discrimination policies, but a
hearing panel found that other accusations against Dwire were not
violations. Dwire is back on the job.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar suit filed last month, two former North Carolina
soccer players, including 1996 women's player of the year Debbie
Keller, accused coach Anson Dorrance of sexual harassment and other
misconduct. Keller and Melissa Jenings are seeking a combined $12
million in damages against Dorrance, UNC administrators and women's
assistant coaches.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina has been the nation's most dominant women's
soccer program, winning 14 of the 16 NCAA titles contested.
Dorrance is the only coach in the program's 20-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The most damaging charge was brought by Keller, a member of the
U.S. women's national team, who accused Dorrance of having made
``uninvited, unauthorized and offensive physical contact'' during
and after her college career. In October 1996, Keller alleged,
Dorrance coerced her into meeting him at a secluded area where he
made an ``uninvited sexual advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorrance has denied the charges, saying, ``I am shocked and
saddened by these allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   Former tennis great Billie Jean King is among those who maintain
that male coaches acting inappropriately with young female athletes
is a much greater problem than female coaches involved in lesbian
relationships with athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you it's pervasive,'' she said. ``I know a couple
of tennis situations that are just horrendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Other alleged victims wouldn't cooperate
</P>
<P>
   Nyad acknowledges that she did not report Nelson when the
alleged incidents occurred. Later, she informed administrators at
Pine Crest and the University of Miami, both times shortly before
Nelson left jobs at the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Former Pine Crest headmaster Bill McMullen confirmed hearing the
allegations from Nyad and refused further comment. Sam Jankovich,
then the Miami athletics director, said he asked Nelson to resign
but declined to say if Nyad's accusations were a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson went on to coach the Fort Lauderdale Swim Team at the
Hall of Fame complex, where he is today.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Swimming officials once spoke to Nyad about her
allegations. ``We were aware of what she had said, but until it
went to a certain point we couldn't do anything,'' said Essick,
adding that other women Nyad alleged to have been involved with
Nelson refused to cooperate with investigators. ``We determined
there wasn't anything we could pursue.''
</P>
<P>
   The swim community wonders why Nyad never filed charges or why
Nelson never responded legally to accuse her of scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to sue him, because the statute of limitations
has run out,'' Nyad said. ``I looked into a number of loopholes,
but I don't want to spend 10 years of my life in a stupid court
process spending my money.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said, ``I have a very happy life, and some beautiful
young people who depend on me. I don't need for them to be thinking
of me as something other than their coach.''
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, Tim McDermott, says he might have sent Nyad a
cease-and-desist letter several years ago, but he cannot remember
for certain.
</P>
<P>
   As for bringing a lawsuit against her, McDermott said, ``Jack is
not vindictive or nasty. Jack is a very understanding, forgiving
kind of fellow.''

 &HT;    Nation can work through scandal, Carter says
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Kurylo
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former President Carter said Tuesday that he hopes Congress will
decide quickly how it wants to handle independent counsel Kenneth
Starr's report, but he would not comment on whether he thinks
President Clinton should resign or be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think its been a deplorable absorption by the public, the
news media, the Congress and the White House in this unfortunate
circumstance,'' he said in an interview in his office at the Carter
Center in Atlanta. ``My hope is that we'll resolve it (quickly) and
overcome it if possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he hasn't discussed the scandal with Clinton since
he visited him in the Oval Office in January, shortly after the
story broke about Clinton's relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky. Carter did not elaborate on what they
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he thinks the nation will be able to work through
whatever happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation is so strong, so powerful, so self-assured, so
diverse in its character and its responsibilities that no
peccadillo of a president or mistake of a president, even the one
that resulted in Nixon's (resignation), can seriously and adversely
affect our nation's character or strength,'' Carter said.

 &HT;    Wider world for wireless devices
 &HT;    By Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff writers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the technology world, hardware _ the ever more
powerful computers, the slimmer hand communicators, the tiny but
potent processors _ get the most attention.
</P>
<P>
   Lost sometimes is the importance of software, which drives,
bolsters, and extends the reach and power of the hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Convergence Corp., a small private Norcross software developer,
is a player in the software game, manufacturing a timely product to
enhance a new breed of digital cell phones, as well as text pagers
such as ones being marketed by BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   The Telebrowser is a Convergence pet project, which as the name
suggests, empowers the user to access the Internet with a hand-held
device. It capitalizes on the power of the Internet to provide
continuously updated information to keep business people informed
from anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently the system permits a customer armed with a sky
pager to keep up with stock portfolios, movements in company sales,
news developments, announcements by competitors, and even the
approach of a hurricane that could threaten business operations.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Robinson and Robert Frederick, two designers of the
browser, emphasize that the system can be more than a communicator.
It can be an imposing tool as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a weapon for the shark, not just the bystander,'' said
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes it different,'' added Frederick, ''is that it can
take action if it is instructed in advance to watch for certain
developments.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Telebrowser software, which is placed within the
company network or at the server can be programmed to watch for
certain signals from the pager, and to look at certain Web sites
for pertinent information.
</P>
<P>
   It can watch for announcements on the business news wire by
competing companies, allied companies or government regulators.
</P>
<P>
   And in two-way applications, the system can contact lawyers,
publicists, executives within moments and print out information on
tiny screens.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers can pull up additional information by typing on tiny
keyboards on the pagers or cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   If programmed to do so, the pagers can tap into the Internet and
pull up very specific kinds of information.
</P>
<P>
   I watched Frederick use his pager to fetch the closing stock
price of a company on a specific day during the summer, and the
answer came back in a minute.
</P>
<P>
   The unique power of the software is the way it guides devices to
look at preassigned areas or databases on the Web, pull up
information and present it in a format that can be reproduced on
hand-held devices.
</P>
<P>
   The Norcross company's customers are mostly businesses.
Eventually institutions or any organizations that can gain from
being on top of certain kinds of information could become customers
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Convergence's business is part of a global effort, dubbed
Bluetooth, that seeks to establish worldwide standards to permit
seamless communication among wireless devices, partly to extend the
reach of computing.
</P>
<P>
   Harald Bluetooth was a 10th-century king whose great
accomplishment was to unify the country we now call Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   In an approach that may not delight all phone companies and
others who own wires, cables and dedicated channels, Bluetooth
would dramatically facilitate and expand many forms of wireless
communication between devices.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Napier, marketing vice president of Convergence, said,
``Bluetooth will enable mobile professionals as well as consumers
to use each product to its fullest capability and automatically
connect with nearby devices as desired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Likewise, manufacturers can focus on their product strengths
and not worry about which cellular or PCS radio technology to
incorporate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bluetooth group, convened this year by Intel, encompasses
many manufacturers, including IBM, Ericsson, Nokia and Toshiba.
</P>
<P>
   Portable computers stand to be a big beneficiary of the
converging wireless technology.

 &HT;    Cuba, U.S. in Georges' path
 &HT;    By Shelley Emling
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Hurricane Georges, the deadliest storm of this hurricane
season, pounded the island of Hispaniola, shared by the Dominican
Republic and Haiti, and pushed late Tuesday toward Cuba and the
U.S. mainland, threatening to hit South Florida by late Thursday or
early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Packing winds of 120 mph when it slammed into the Dominican
capital of Santo Domingo, Georges was expected to leave Hispaniola
devastated. The two-nation island is home to 15 million people,
many of whom live in substandard housing.
</P>
<P>
   At least 13 deaths have been attributed to Georges during its
surge through the northern Caribbean. On Tuesday, the formidable
storm knocked out power and forced residents into shelters across
the densely populated Dominican Republic, where two people were
killed by downed electrical lines and a third by a collapsing wall.
</P>
<P>
   The storm already had claimed at least 10 lives in the
Caribbean, including five in Puerto Rico, where it left widespread
damage Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials expected to issue a hurricane watch some time todayfor
South Florida, where residents packed the stores in search of
supplies such as batteries, flashlights and water.
</P>
<P>
   Georges was expected to weaken somewhat as it moved off the
shore of Hispaniola, but not below hurricane strength. As of 5 p.m.
EDT Tuesday, Georges had sustained winds of 110 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Still, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predicted
that Georges would pack much less of a punch than Hurricane Andrew,
which caused billions of dollars in damage in densely populated
South Florida in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, workers placed shutters over the windows at City
Hall in Key West, while authorities advised all visitors and
non-residents of the Florida Keys to evacuate the island chain,
whose only connection to the mainland is a two-lane highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate most of the evacuations will occur on
Wednesday,'' said Billy Wagner, an official with the Monroe County
Emergency Management Service. ``Anyone who's got plans to visit the
Keys should postpone them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Caribbean, Georges had paralyzed Santo Domingo, a city of
3 million, by mid-afternoon, flooding streets, uprooting trees, and
whisking away tin roofs and satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, officials expected a high death toll in Haiti due to
the unsafe living conditions of thousands of desperately poor
Haitians. In Haiti's capital of Port-au-Prince, which is surrounded
by slums, fragile communities of cardboard homes cling to slippery
hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   ``People die here even when we just get a heavy downpour, one
that's not even a tropical storm, so this could be catastrophic for
us,'' said Michelle Karshan, a spokeswoman for Haiti's President
Rene Preval.
</P>
<P>
   When Tropical Storm Gordon, a much weaker system than Georges,
struck Haiti in 1994, hundreds of people were killed in mudslides.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane warnings were posted Tuesday for Haiti, eastern Cuba,
the southwestern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands, and a
hurricane watch was in effect in parts of Cuba and the Bahamas on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday and early Tuesday, Georges wreaked havoc across the
northeast Caribbean. With gusts of up to 130 mph, the hurricane
dumped two feet of water in the mountains of Puerto Rico, while
bending palm trees and flipping small aircraft like they were
pancakes.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, all of the U.S. territory's 3.8 million people were
without power, and 80 percent of people were without running water,
while more than 25,000 people sought refuge in shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico was able to operate Tuesday
for relief flights, but remained closed to other traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are starting from ground zero,'' Puerto Rico's Gov. Pedro
Rossello said of recovery efforts.

 &HT;    Threat of storm has big names cancelling travel plans
 &HT;    By Shelley Emling
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For Haiti, it was to be the delegation of its dreams.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the impoverished nation had planned to host first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, media mogul Ted Turner, investor
George Soros, and William Gates II, the father of America's richest
man, Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, the well-heeled notables have big bucks, and Haiti
desperately needs them.
</P>
<P>
   But now the ferocious Hurricane Georges has crashed the party
before it even began.
</P>
<P>
   The visit by the Clinton-organized, 75-member
delegation_officially dubbed ``Civil Society's Contribution to
Democracy''_has been postponed to some time in October due to the
storm, according to Haitian government officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought all of these people were going to come visit here,
Ted Turner and Hillary Clinton, and we were excited,'' said
Michelle Karshan, a spokeswoman for Haiti's President Rene Preval.
``These people were going to talk about giving money and support to
various projects in Haiti, which we really need.''
</P>
<P>
   David Harwood, a spokesman for the United Nations Foundation,
the Washington, D.C.-based charity created to designate U.N.
programs to receive Turner's funding, said Turner had planned to
send a foundation representative to Haiti, rather than go himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foundation has some activities going on that might relate
to Haiti and the Caribbean, and we wanted to talk about these,''
Harwood said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Clinton said she was not sure that the trip
would be postponed, adding that a final decision would be made by
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's visit to Haiti would have been the first time
many of the delegation members, including Clinton, have visited the
country.
</P>
<P>
   However, Soros, the Hungarian-born international financier,
opened a foundation in Haiti last year_the Knowledge and Freedom
Foundation_to promote democracy and youth projects with a $2
million annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   The economy in the country of seven million people has foundered
since 1994, when a U.S.-led invasion ousted military dictator Raoul
Cedras and restored the democratically elected Jean-Bertrand
Aristide to power.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Haiti's annual per-capita income is $250, about one-tenth
the average of Latin America and the Caribbean. Infant mortality is
almost twice the regional average, while malnutrition affects about
half of all children.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear exactly what the delegation planned to do during
its visit besides meet with non-governmental groups to discuss
judicial reform and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   But what was clear was that Haiti would be picking up a carpet
of debris left by Georges rather than rolling out a red carpet for
its much-anticipated guests.

 &HT;    Firm gains with phone number portability
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Allegiance Telecom has won an important battle in its
effort to offer competitive local telephone service in metro
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas-based telecommunications company can now offer its
customers the ability to keep their old telephone number if they
switch to its service.
</P>
<P>
   In industry jargon, this is called local number portability and
it's considered crucial if competitive carriers are to win
customers from BellSouth. Not only does number portability allow
Allegiance to let people keep their same numbers but it also lets
them offer enhanced services such as caller ID and call forwarding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having full-fledged permanent local number portability at this
early stage positions Allegiance to take advantage of the
tremendous market opportunity available,'' says Royce Holland,
Allegiance's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Allegiance, which entered the Atlanta market in April, has 530
customers, most of which are small to mid-sized businesses. It has
2,600 local telephone customers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Allegiance is one of a dozen-plus carriers who are trying to
compete against BellSouth, a $22 billion telecommunications giant
that dominates the market in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   By law, BellSouth must provide local number portability to all
its competitors. But it's a complicated process. In addition, some
carriers such as Allegiance have said that they didn't believe
BellSouth has been as aggressive in providing local number
portability as some other regional telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Allegiance and the other competitive carriers haven't
made much of a dent in BellSouth's dominance. BellSouth estimates
it has lost 111,1000 lines _ out of a total of 4.86 million.

   Some bugs are just nastier

<P>

</P>

   STAFF WRITER
</P>
<P>
   Surprise: Not all Y2K date problems need to be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   By targeting only critical date operations, a Waltham, Mass.,
company enables its customers to save money and quickly repair
mainframe software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional methods require changing 5 to 10 percent of
software code, but only 0.5 percent of code really needs to be
repaired,'' said Benton Burgess, vice president of development for
Data Integrity Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only operations that really need to be fixed are
subtractions, logical comparisons, and sortings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Addition functions for dates and equal date comparisons don't
have to be fixed because they don't need a century value in order
to be correct _ two digits are sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Data Integrity makes PC-based software that investigates
mainframe source code.
</P>
<P>
   The product identifies operations that need to be fixed and
fixes them automatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The costs run from 7 cents to 14 cents per line of code,''
Burgess said. A large company customer, he noted, recently paid
$200,000 for a 6 million line fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normal costs, using other methods, usually run from 70 cents
to $1.60 per line of code, so these guys could have spent upwards
of $6 million to $10 million.''
</P>
<P>
   A second benefit is speed. Another customer, he said, tested his
product against some others and found Data Integrity did in 15
minutes what took its closest competitor 14 days.
</P>
<P>
   Data Integrity was founded in 1984. Its customers have included
CitiBank, NationsBank, and the U.S. Department of the Interior. The
company can be reached at 1-888-792-2001 or at its Web site
(http://www.dii2000.com).

Doraville's Tec America, alleging $65,000 worth of cash registers
and credit card verification machines from that company
malfunctioned when cards bearing the year ``00'' expiration dates
were used to pay for groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Tec America, the American subsidiary of Tokyo Electric Co.,
which is part of Toshiba, blamed the glitch on All-American Cash
Register of Inkster, a suburb of Detroit. That company installed
the system in 1995. The statement said Tec America's equipment has
accepted credit cards with 00 expiration dates since May 1997.
Fewer than 24 of the Tec systems are still in use nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with All-American Cash Register could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Yarsike, Produce Palace co-owner, said the system crashed
more than 100 times in the first 500 days after the store opened in
1995. Yarsike and co-owner Sam Katz filed suit in July 1997 asking
for $1.8 million in damages, Yarsike said. Tec America lawyer
Joseph Hoover said the pair asked for as much as $5 million during
negotiations. The trial was to have started Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   The Produce Palace suit, filed in July 1997, was the first
individual Y2K suit filed in this country, said Dean Morehous,
chairman of the technology practice for the San Francisco offices
of Thelen Reid &AMP; Priest.
</P>
<P>
   Tec attorney Hoover contends the suit is not a Y2K issue. He
said the cash registers malfunctioned because Michigan banks issued
credit cards with 00 expiration dates before most banks, and that
the system's software was not updated soon enough. Hoover said
All-American did a poor job installing the system. Tec America is
suing All-American, which has counter-sued.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem, or Y2K, prevents older software and
millions of embedded chips from reading the correct date after Dec.
31, 1999. In an era when memory was scarcer, programmers developed
computer systems that read dates in two digits. Unless fixed, older
systems will read the year 2000 as 00, which they consider to mean
1900.
</P>
<P>
   Produce Palace attorney Brian Parker, a Detroit-area lawyer who
specializes in automobile product liability, said Y2K is nothing
more than a high-tech lemon law matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all Y2K is,'' he said. ``They sold a product that you
didn't tell me was flawed. Now I have losses. People see computers
or technology and think it's confusing, but it's not. Y2K just
means someone screwed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarsike said the credit card problem usually would cripple the
system for 10 or 15 minutes, backing up checkout lines. The longest
the system was down was one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened continually,'' Yarsike said. ``We eventually
learned to do some things ourselves. Like reboot it and start it
back up. Most of the shutdowns were quick shutdowns, but they were
enough to create aggravation and havoc and things of that nature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We got attorneys because they wouldn't repair the system,'' he
said. ``We got an attorney and it woke them up.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, Produce Palace sent the system back
to Tec America. Yarsike said Produce Palace bought their new system
from NCR.

A `MUSICAL EVENT' THAT'S BUCKING FOR, YES, A PROFIT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The first sing-through of ``The Civil War,'' the
musical extravaganza that opened to enthusiastic audiences and
positive, if qualified, reviews at the Alley Theater here on Sept.
16, took place in the Alley's only rehearsal space, a windowless
room beneath the stage.
</P>
<P>
   It is a space more suitable for a chamber group than for the 28
singers and 9 musicians who crammed it that day in late August,
belting out the sentimental ballads and calculated, 11-o'clock show
stoppers that are the specialty of the composer, Frank Wildhorn.
</P>
<P>
   The room was so full of sound and musical emotion that several
of the performers, hearing the songs sung live for the first time,
were in tears. And it could be said that the scene was emblematic
of the Alley itself, a regional theater so bursting with grand
ambition for national, even international, notoriety that it can't
contain itself.
</P>
<P>
   Its striving has been evident in its recent productions, notably
the world premieres of Tony Kushner's ``Hydriotaphia,'' a
co-production with Berkeley Repertory Theater, where the play is
currently being performed; and ``Not About Nightingales,'' the
early Tennessee Williams play, a well-received collaboration with
England's Royal National Theater and the Moving Theater (founded by
Vanessa Redgrave and her brother, Corin), directed by Trevor Nunn,
for which the Alley is now seeking an appropriate home in New York.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of shows _ serious dramas that add to the
literature _ that have been the bread and butter of American
resident theaters during the past decade as the commercial
viability of such works has diminished. But ``The Civil War,''
which is Broadway-bound and being launched with the kind of
multi-media synergy more characteristic of the Disney company than
of a regional theater, is another animal entirely, a determinedly
middlebrow musical on a grandiose theme with a composer of
commercial pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   (Wildhorn has written dozens of pop anthems for the likes of
Whitney Houston and Natalie Cole, as well as the Broadway and
touring hit ``Jekyll and Hyde'' and the tenaciously lingering
Broadway show ``The Scarlet Pimpernel.'' The lyrics for ``The Civil
War'' were written by Jack Murphy, who has collaborated with
Wildhorn on many songs but never before on a musical.)
</P>
<P>
   At $2 million, ``The Civil War'' is the Alley's biggest
production in its 51-year history. It isn't strictly a book
musical; it's essentially a song cycle with text _ a la Ken Burns _
based on period poems, letters and other documents, and a set
consisting largely of projections by Wendall K. Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   Its songs, including ``I Never Knew His Name,'' a lamentation
crooned by a nurse about a soldier who died as she sat at his
bedside; ``Tell My Father,'' the last words of a dying soldier, and
``River Jordan,'' a gospel chorus about living in slavery, draw on
a variety of American idioms but are largely in a country music
mode, and they tend, like country music, toward gut-wringing.
</P>
<P>
   The theater is calling the show ``an epic musical event
encompassing the passion, breadth, romance and emotional power of
America's most defining moment,'' neither standard fare nor
standard promotion for a nonprofit theater.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Livent, the troubled Toronto-based entertainment
company, has turned to an artistic director with a nonprofit
background _ Todd Haimes of the Roundabout Theater in New York _ to
help right itself financially, the Alley's production of ``The
Civil War'' is another clear signal that the traditional divide
between commercial and nonprofit theater production is blurring.
And in Houston as elsewhere, such merging of art and commerce has
become a source of debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a musical and heading it for Broadway seems to me
unnecessary,'' said Ann Holmes, who covered theater for The Houston
Chronicle for 40 years and has written a history of the Alley. ``In
all the arts, all over the country, everything is being dumbed to
death. It's always what they try to do to bring in new crowds, but
in our overall artistic product we're experiencing a lessening,
which is exactly what you're seeing at the Alley.''
</P>
<P>
   No one, not even Ms. Holmes, questions that the Alley's ambition
has been earned. Since the 1989-90 season, its first under the
artistic director Gregory Boyd, the theater has added three
artistic associates _ an eclectic triumvirate of Edward Albee,
Robert Wilson and Wildhorn _ and produced 10 shows a year on its
two stages, an 824-seat auditorium and a 296-seat box with the
audience surrounding the stage (where the Alley recently presented
``Long Day's Journey into Night,'' with Ellyn Burstyn).
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Boyd's programming has featured a wide range of shows,
from Wildhorn's ``Jekyll and Hyde'' and ``Svengali'' to ``The
Greeks,'' a large-scale adaptation of works by Aeschylus,
Sophocles, Euripides and Homer, directed by Boyd, and Wilson's
``Hamlet: a Monologue,'' along with the expected classics and
regional premieres of new plays that have made their names in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd, 46, came to the Alley from Stage West, a company in
Springfield, Mass. He spent 11 years as an actor and director at
the Williamstown Theater Festival in the Berkshires and had
previously run the theater program at the University of North
Carolina (where, he is fond of recalling, he taught Michael
Jordan).
</P>
<P>
   A native of Berkeley, Calif., he came to theater consciousness
in the late 1960s, a time when the most influential theater guru in
the Bay Area was William Ball, the energetic artistic director of
the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco; Ball, Boyd
said, along with ``the Peters _ Hall and Brook'' are his models for
artistic directorship. Like them, he believes that a theater should
use the classics to train a company for a spectrum of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to do is really mix it up,'' he said. ``I'm
either blessed or cursed with a catholicity of taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd is widely given credit for engineering the theater's
rebound from a disastrous decade, which saw the death of its
founding director, Nina Vance, in 1980; the failure and dismissal
of her successor, Pat Brown, who subsequently sued the board for
$20 million (the suit was eventually settled); the abandonment in
mid-construction, when the oil industry went bust, of a 500-seat
proscenium theater on the 15th floor of a parking structure behind
the Alley building, and, in a gruesome tragedy, the murder, in the
theater, of Ms. Brown's managing director, Iris Siff, by a
disgruntled former employee.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Vance, a genuine pioneer in the cultural life of the city,
oversaw the theater from its inception in a small dance studio (at
the end of an alley, hence the name), through the move to its
current building, an almost windowless castle-like fortress, in the
late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, she earned the status of legend here, along with the
admiration of The New York Times's influential critic, Brooks
Atkinson, and that of the visionary vice president of the Ford
Foundation, W. McNeil Lowry, who called the Alley ``the most
significant professional theater outside New York'' and who was
behind the mammoth grant _ $2.1 million _ in 1962 that spurred the
construction of the new theater. Vance was still running the Alley
at the time of her death, and it floundered for nearly 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery has been both artistic _ it won the Tony Award in
1996 for outstanding regional theater _ and, particularly in the
last four years under the guidance of the managing director Paul R.
Tetreault, financial.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Alley's 50th, the company retired a debt that
had climbed to $2.5 million by the time Tetreault came aboard in
1994. And plans are once again under way to complete the new
theater, which would include additional offices and, for the first
time, sufficient rehearsal space.
</P>
<P>
   Subscriptions have held steady at about 17,000, but with a new
marketing plan _ unusually if not uniquely, the Alley has made
heavy use of radio and billboard advertising _ single-ticket sales
have risen some 12 percent, and fundraising has increased to $2.9
million a year ago from $2.2 million in 1994. They support an
annual budget of about $9 million, the 11th largest of any
nonprofit theater in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no great change in the art since I got here,''
Tetreault said. ``To be honest, Greg has always said, `I want the
people who go to the tractor pull and the people who go to the
opera to come to the Alley.' And that's what you get here. Tractor
pull? `The Civil War.' Opera? Robert Wilson.''
</P>
<P>
   What has been missing during Boyd's tenure is the development of
new work by new writers, a failing that Boyd acknowledges, albeit a
bit uncomfortably.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sensitive about the criticism, yes,'' he said. ``But I'm
hip to it as well. I read 500 new plays a year, and 99.99 percent
of them are not good. I see no reason to do a new play just because
it's new. It's like kissing your sister, a virtue, but so what? It
seems to me more worthwhile to take a proven playwright and say,
`Write something for us.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His choices are also beholden, he said, to the nature of the
Alley, which maintains one of the country's few repertory companies
and whose identity, Boyd said, ``is as a group of artists, not so
much as a developer of new plays.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, you need to develop new playwrights,'' he said, ``but you
need to develop actors by doing classical work, by doing our
version of X by Chekhov, or Y by Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Alley is perhaps unique among regional theaters for
its role in its city's cultural establishment. The building sits
downtown in Houston's impressive cultural center, among the mammoth
homes of the symphony, the opera and the ballet, and not far from
where a new music hall and a new baseball stadium are being
constructed as part of the city's planned downtown renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   This is an old theater in a new city; the Alley is considered
mainstream, not fringe, Houston. And theatrically speaking, it
exists in a near vacuum. Houston is the nation's fourth-largest
city, but there are fewer theater companies here than in Seattle,
San Francisco or Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   If the Alley does not present ``How I Learned to Drive'' or
``Angels in America'' or ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane,'' Boyd
said, chances are Houstonians will not get to see them.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has left the Alley vulnerable to the charge of being
unadventurous. (A particularly critical article, titled ``Mixed
Review,'' appeared last year in Texas Monthly.) But its defenders
see the theater's programming as both suitable and challenging for
a city that sees itself as growing in sophistication and emerging
nationally as both a business and cultural center.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in Houston are pretty good at what they do,
and they're secure in themselves and interested in other people who
are good at what they do,'' said Meredith J. Long, an art dealer
who over the last 40 years has served on the boards of several arts
institutions and is chairman emeritus of the Alley board. ``They
appreciate that the Alley is much more cosmopolitan, that the bill
of fare is constantly at a higher level, that the Alley knows where
it is financially. Greg has been able to bring in highbrow
performances, and his success is not so much from a revenue
standpoint as from the standpoint of increasing audiences. If you
can't get them into the schoolhouse, you can't teach them to read.
A lot of these people are seeing some very tough theater along with
some great entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Civil War'' _ which The Houston Chronicle reviewed as
lacking the impact of a standard book musical but as ``an ambitious
piece whose strengths outweigh its weaknesses'' _ is clearly at the
nexus of this debate. This is largely because of the music of
Wildhorn, 39, a self-described ``frustrated ex-jock'' with a pop
music background and a penchant as a composer, a la Sir Andrew
Lloyd Webber, for critic-proof, audience-pleasing melodies,
swelling arrangements and big voices.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The cast of ``The Civil War'' includes Linda Eder, the star of
``Jekyll and Hyde'' (who also happens to be Wildhorn's wife) and
Michel Bell, who was last heard on Broadway in ``Show Boat,''
delivering a memorable version of ``Ol' Man River.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't want to be Stephen Sondheim,'' Tetreault said of
Wildhorn, though he compares Wildhorn's aims with those of George
Gershwin, Cole Porter and Richard Rodgers, whose celebrated songs,
whether written for the theater or not, constituted the popular
music of their day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The songs they were writing for the theater transcended
theater,'' Wildhorn said. ``I don't know why in their day it was
O.K. to be a pop writer and now it's not.'' When Rodgers was
writing ``Some Enchanted Evening,'' he said, ``I can't believe he
didn't say to himself, `Boy, that's a pretty good hook.' He didn't
say: `This is getting too melodramatic. I better make it more
obscure.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Wildhorn is, admittedly, unmoved by either conventional
theatrical storytelling or the conventional expectations of a
theater audience. ``There's a lot more drama in sports,'' he said.
``The kind of stuff that an audience gives you in a sports event,
or a Bruce Springsteen concert, that's what I love. It's more
visceral and honest to me. I try to do that, write songs that go
right to the heart and transcend the moment onstage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Civil War,'' he added, ``is by far the most emotional and
dramatic show I've ever written. You don't get back story, or
development. A dying soldier singing to his father? We don't even
have to know the guy's name and we get emotionally involved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Civil War,'' which after its Houston run is to make a
brief stop in New Haven in February before its scheduled opening at
the St. James Theater in April, is not the first original Broadway
musical to be developed in a nonprofit theater _ ``Tommy'' came out
of the La Jolla Playhouse and, most famously, ``A Chorus Line'' was
the product of the New York Shakespeare Festival _ but the
calculatedly commercial nature of the production is decidedly new.
</P>
<P>
   The show has the financial backing of the Pace Theatrical Group,
the nation's biggest tour organizer, and the ancillary support of
Atlantic Records, which, in addition to the planned cast album, is
releasing two recordings of the show's music, one featuring country
music stars like Travis Tritt and Trisha Yearwood, the other a
double-CD set featuring a range of performers including Hootie and
the Blowfish, Patti LaBelle and Betty Buckley.
</P>
<P>
   A television special is also in the works. It is a measure of
the show's commercial prospects that Enron, the locally based
energy company, chipped in $200,000, quadrupling its largest annual
contribution to the theater's coffers in exchange for, among other
things, its name above the title during the Houston run.
</P>
<P>
   The cynical view is that the Alley has sold out, that it expects
to collect royalties on ``The Civil War'' for a long time as it
runs on Broadway and tours the country, if not the world; that it
hopes to use the show to create a revenue stream like the $25
million or so that ``A Chorus Line'' produced for Joseph Papp and
the Shakespeare Festival. The Alley denies this, saying that like
all new musicals, this one's prospects are unproven.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the reasons for `The Civil War' are all that
financially strategic,'' Tetreault said. ``We have to sell more
than $1.3 million in tickets to break even'' _ more than the Alley
has ever earned from any show. ``It's a mild risk,'' he added,
``though if it takes off, the Alley may have a windfall.''
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, said Boyd, who wrote the book for the show,
is that ``The Civil War'' falls completely within the Alley's view
of itself. The show was conceived as a big event, he acknowledged,
as part of the Alley's 50th-anniversary celebration (even if it
arrived a year late).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pop piece, no question,'' he said. ``But I'm not afraid
of that at all. If all we did was pop musicals, then we could point
a finger at ourselves. Our task is to make it a compelling theater
experience and not just a song cycle of very hooky songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the audience for `Civil War' will come back for Brecht
and Kushner. I have to think that it's all part of a continuum. The
great thing about the Alley right now is that there's nothing we
can't do.''

 &HT;    Clinton makes first trip to Capitol Hill since Starr reportBy
Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton visits Capitol Hill today to
honor South African President Nelson Mandela as House leaders
huddle behind closed doors to decide whether to take the next step
to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who will award Mandela a Congressional Gold Medal in
the Capitol Rotunda, has not appeared on the Hill since independent
counsel Kenneth Starr's massive report landed in the hands of the
House Judiciary Committee on Sept 10.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's report alleges that Clinton committed perjury,
obstructed justice and abused his powers as president in an attempt
to conceal the relationship he now admits having with Monica
Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 10 a.m. ceremony with Mandela, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, Majority Leader Dick Armey, Democratic leader Dick
Gephardt and the leaders of the Judiciary Committee will meet to
discuss the impeachment review.
</P>
<P>
   A similar meeting two weeks ago produced pledges of
bipartisanship, but no such result is expected today in the
increasingly partisan climate in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republican members of the panel, who have been saying
for some time that taking the next step and approving an
impeachment inquiry is ``inevitable,'' predict the matter may go to
the House floor within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press, quoting GOP sources and one committee
member _ all speaking on condition of anonymity _ said the
committee could be empowered to go into the material submitted by
Starr earlier this month, as well as any additional evidence that
surfaces in the future. It was unclear whether this would mean that
other House committees _ a panel investigating 1996 campaign
fund-raising by the president, for example _ could bring their own
uncompleted probes under the impeachment umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has set an Oct. 9 target for adjournment, and senior
Republican officials are eager for a floor vote before then, in
part to force rank-and-file Democrats to go on record on the
matter, according to GOP sources quoted by the news service.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers sent a letter Tuesday to the Judiciary
Committee complaining that Starr omitted key portions of Lewinsky's
testimony from his report that substantiated the president's
contention that he never asked Lewinsky to lie on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   In that letter, White House Counsel Charles Ruff and David
Kendall, the president's personal attorney, claim that Starr failed
to include Lewinsky's statement to his investigators that Clinton
never told her to lie about their affair nor promised her a job in
exchange for her silence.
</P>
<P>
   Press Secretary Mike McCurry, who was traveling with Clinton in
New York, said the omission shows how ``grossly unfair'' Starr is.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report states: ``Ms. Lewinsky has stated that the
president never explicitly told her to lie.'' But it quickly
discounts that statement by concluding that both the president and
Lewinsky understood from their conversations that they would
``continue their pattern of covering up and lying about the
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's report does not include the following quotation from
Lewinsky's grand jury testimony: ``No one ever asked me to lie and
I was never promised a job for my silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Most House members have not seized the opportunity to comment on
Monday's release of the videotape of the president's August 17
testimony before a federal grand jury convened by Starr and
thousands of pages of supporting documents.
</P>
<P>
   But key Republicans in the Senate said they would like the House
to move forward with an impeachment inquiry, the
information-gathering stage of the process where hearings would
likely be held.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating a call made Sunday by Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.),
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) said the president
should come to Capitol Hill to answer questions about his affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time the president comes forward and comes clean in a
formal setting ... it would be a positive development,'' Lott told
reporters. ``The whole thing is demeaning to the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee's investigative staff continued to
sift through the remaining 16 boxes of material from Starr, which
could be made public as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Committee chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) met with Republican
members of his panel Tuesday afternoon to assess the process to
date. Emerging from that meeting, Hyde said the Democratic
assertion of partisanship on the committee ``isn't fair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing our job, following the mandate, which is to look
at all this stuff and cut out those things that don't really belong
there, for whatever reason, and then release the rest,'' Hyde said.
``It's a difficult job.'' When asked if he was concerned that
Republicans would face a backlash for releasing the salacious
details of the president's affair with Lewinsky, Hyde said he
trusted the public would see the relevance.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee's Democratic spokesman, Jim Jordan, had
a different view of the partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the majority of House Democrats did indeed vote to
release the bulk of the material sent to us by Ken Starr,'' Jordan
said. But those votes were based upon an agreement that the
committee would make all necessary and appropriate redactions, or
editing, to material that was deemed too salacious, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The disputes within the committee have centered on specific
redactions, usually of a highly sexual nature, that have been
proposed by Democrats and rejected by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect to Chairman Hyde, I believe that each of
the Democratic members of the committee would strongly dispute his
characterization of the meetings as bipartisan, cooperative or
consultative,'' Jordan said.

A PASSION IN COLLEGE FOR A MASTER OF PULP FINALLY BEARS FRUIT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 27) 
</HEADLINE>

Columbia, is writing a book on Krzysztof Kieslowski's films.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I'm basically drawn to defeated, injured, hurt,
barely walking characters,'' said Steven Shainberg, the director of
``Hit Me.'' Little wonder, then, that he would choose a bleak,
gritty Jim Thompson novel, ``A Swell-Looking Babe,'' for his first
feature film.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, though decidedly cheerful during an interview, Shainberg
has regarded Thompson as something of a soul mate ever since
college.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he had graduated from Yale in 1985, with a degree in
both English literature and East Asian studies, he had devoured all
of Thompson's work. Within a year, as he tried to carve out a
career as a filmmaker. ``I had five of his books under option for
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my then-producing partner, the idea was to do a whole
series of movies from these books, but then I decided to go to the
American Film Institute. It didn't make sense to hold on to the
option for five books if I was committing to film school, so I made
a deal to retain the rights only to a `A Swell-Looking Babe.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Enrolling in the institute's directing program, Shainberg, now
35, went on to make award-winning shorts, including ``The Prom''
and ``The Secretary'' _ both starring Jennifer Jason Leigh and J.T.
Walsh _ as well as music videos. But he kept alive his hope to film
``A Swell-Looking Babe,'' particularly as he watched other
directors turn Thompson novels into film _ ``After Dark, My Sweet''
and ``The Grifters.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the fascination with a writer who, when he died in 1977, had
no novels remaining in print in the United States? Shainberg said
he is drawn by ``the intensity'' of Thompson's ``subjective point
of view.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The stories are always told from a disturbed, passionate and
weird protagonist's perspective _ often violent characters who are
lost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hit Me'' _ whose script was was written by his longtime
writing partner, the novelist Denis Johnson _ tells the story of
Sonny, a frustrated bellhop in a seedy hotel in Tacoma, Wash.
(Thompson once worked as a bellhop in Ft. Worth).
</P>
<P>
   With dark humor, the film, which opens Oct. 2, recounts how
Sonny, played by Elias Koteas, tries in vain to escape a numbing
life. He is seduced not only sexually _ by a mysterious young
French hotel guest (Laure Marsac) _ but also financially: the
bellhop is lured into ripping off a high-stakes poker game run by
the local crime boss (Philip Baker Hall).
</P>
<P>
   Shainberg first saw Koteas in ``The Adjuster'' (1991), one of
the actor's many collaborations with the Canadian director Atom
Egoyan. ``He plays a character who does not emote at all, a blank
slate,'' Shainberg recalled over an espresso in midtown Manhattan.
``For some reason, I thought, this is an actor with repressed
energy, waiting to bust out.''
</P>
<P>
   After memorable appearances as the impresario of car wrecks in
David Cronenberg's 1996 movie ``Crash,'' and as the demonic
murderer strapped to an electric chair in this year's ``Fallen,''
Koteas is considered to be on the brink of stardom, a view
reinforced by the buzz about his strong performance in Terrence
Malick's forthcoming ``Thin Red Line.''
</P>
<P>
   Shainberg sees little coincidence in the fact that both he and
Malick _ also an AFI graduate _ gravitated toward Koteas. ``Malick
is obviously interested in isolation, desperation and the figure
lost in the landscape,'' he said about the director of the starkly
beautiful ``Badlands'' and ``Days of Heaven.'' ``There's something
about Elias that is conducive to those themes.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the juiciness of the role in ``Hit Me,'' Koteas was at
first reluctant to take it; he was ``unsure about playing a
loser,'' he said by phone from Los Angeles. ``But,'' he added,
``the script was unlike anything I've read and, luckily, Steve was
insistent. He let me be free and gave me my wings again.''
</P>
<P>
   Koteas credits Shainberg not only with ``a good ear for the
truth _ he doesn't let actors get actory'' _ but with visual
mastery. ``His camera had its own voice'' Koteas said. ``For an
actor to be part of that landscape revitalizes you.''
</P>
<P>
   Shainberg created a visual landscape that recalls the bleak and
lonely paintings of Edward Hopper. When asked if his ``film noir''
was a kind of ``Hopper noir,'' he replied, ``Yes, but it's also
inspired by Mark Tansey, one of my favorite painters, and Eric
Fischl, whose paintings are very filmic.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the look of the movie, I said to the designer, `I want to
make Sonny feel as uncomfortable as possible.' So we used only
synthetic colors in the hotel, colors that don't exist in nature.
In the hallway, he is the only living thing, wearing a jacket the
color of salmon _ a kind of human fish slithering through, running
out of air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Swell-Looking Babe'' attracted him, Shainberg said,
precisely because ``I love moving through long spaces and being
enclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone who hates exteriors _ natural light is
unacceptable to me! _ Thompson's book allowed for total control.''
</P>
<P>
   The very control exerted by the director is what the characters
are missing. Sonny, who is trapped not only by his buddies but
perhaps his destiny, exemplifies for Shainberg that ``there comes a
point for everyone when you finally have to  &UR; do &LR;  something to
change your life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But for a lot of people, it won't change,'' he said. ``There's
a kind of dream that movies sell to people: You can start as the
lowliest person and rise to the top. `Hit Me' doesn't sell this
fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the film begins with Thoreau's observation, ``The mass
of men lead lives of quiet desperation.'' Does a bellhop who serves
an endless succession of strangers also serve as the perfect
embodiment of the quotation? Maybe so. But, as Shainberg quipped,
``Who could be more desperate than filmmakers?''

HARD TIMES FOR STRONG-MINDED WOMEN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Nancy Hass teaches journalism at New York University and writes
frequently about popular culture.)

 By NANCY HASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If transmissions of the new fall television shows were
intercepted by a galaxy far, far away, here is the chillingly clear
picture that extraterrestrials would get of the human female at the
dawn of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   She is young, perennially confused, perpetually underemployed
and adorably confounded by men. In her teens and early 20s, she is
smart and spunky, but approaching 30 she is mysteriously stricken
with an unnamed disease that renders her increasingly incompetent.
Miraculously, her cuteness is left intact.
</P>
<P>
   A few sophisticated aliens may wonder, as many earthlings do,
how these images have come to define femininity in the 1990s.
Although the heroines of this season's ``Maggie Winters,''
``Costello'' and ``Jesse'' are more working class than past
seasons' Caroline, Susan, Veronica and Ally, it's not hard to
imagine them all at a slumber party, scarfing down low-fat Doritos
and competing for Most Charmingly Pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what the data tell us about who we are these days _
older, smarter, fatter, richer, more independent _ on television we
are younger, thinner, poorer and ditsier.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you watch television this season you see a very scary
message transmitted over and over,'' says Bonnie Turner, creator of
``That 70's Show'' on Fox. ``Women are simply adorable dopes.''
</P>
<P>
   Was it only a season or two ago that the pace seemed to be set
by women of a certain age _ ``Murphy Brown,'' ``Cybill,''
``Roseanne,'' ``Grace Under Fire'' _ who raged with self-confidence
and irony? Those shows weren't Shakespeare or Chekhov, but at least
the characters knew who they were.
</P>
<P>
   The joke was rarely on them. (Can you imagine Roseanne or Murphy
sharing pillow talk and bean dip with Jesse and Caroline? Now
there's comedy.)
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the women on television (at least in sitcoms)
are increasingly at odds with the women in the audience, but who's
to blame? Advertisers chasing a demographic? Networks too
frightened to take chances? Writers without talent? Pressure from
syndicators who know that shows about women don't do as well in
reruns?
</P>
<P>
   It depends on whom you talk to. In the lightning-fast world of
television development, everyone passes the buck. But one thing is
clear: in a season viewed as one of the most moribund in memory,
the rhetoric is heated almost to the boil.
</P>
<P>
   The writers blame advertisers, market research and, by
inference, network executives who, they say, kowtow too easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some great concepts don't even make it to a cocktail napkin,''
says Caryn Mandabach of Carsey Werner, the production company,
``because the network makes it clear they aren't looking for shows
that center around a wisecracking 45-year-old woman.''
</P>
<P>
   What are advertisers looking for? Just one thing: young adults.
Older viewers are too stuck in their buying habits, or so goes the
traditional wisdom. The success of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' has
convinced advertisers that women 12 to 34 are an underexploited
market. Networks apparently believe the best strategy to attract
them is to create young female characters who are appealingly
adrift.
</P>
<P>
   An even more prized demographic is men 18 to 34, not only
because they have lots of buying power but because they are
particularly elusive. They channel-surf excessively and are less
loyal than women to specific shows.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why more networks than ever seem to be trawling for
boys. CBS is trying aggressively to appeal to a younger, more male
audience. Fox and the WB are in a dead heat for the same viewers.
ABC's new comedy lineup includes six shows with male leads; its
only new female-oriented series stars the 11-year-old Olsen twins.
</P>
<P>
   That has a direct effect on the sorts of women we see on
television, experts say. Women, it seems, may control more than 50
percent of the purchases but tend to let men control the remote.
NFL viewership, for example, is 40 percent female, though women
rarely watch football alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women will pretty much do anything to get to snuggle with
their boyfriend or husband,'' says Paul Krumins, who writes an
influential newsletter about syndication. ``Advertisers want the
networks to cater to men because they feel they get the women for
free.''
</P>
<P>
   Among this season's new sitcom offerings alone, two-thirds
center on a male character.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people that advertisers want,'' says Dean Valentine,
president of UPN, ``are 28-year-old male millionaires, preferably
living in Manhattan.'' Shows that don't focus on men have to
feature the sort of women that guys might watch. (Ally McBeal isn't
wearing those short skirts for us girls. Ditto Christina
Applegate's St. Pauli Girl get-up in ``Jesse.'')
</P>
<P>
   Some network executives concede that they are under tremendous
pressure. When asked where all the strong women have gone, CBS
Television's president, Leslie Moonves, a man known for his
bravado, hesitantly offered up ``The Nanny'' as an example,
conceding that Fran Drescher's blowsy, sexually ham-fisted
character was hardly a role model for, well, anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until Madison Avenue realizes what we've been saying all
along, that 50-year-old women are as valuable as 19-year-old women,
we are in a bind,'' Moonves says.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Igiel, the Young &AMP; Rubicam advertising agency's powerful
media buyer, disagrees strongly. ``I wish we did have more
influence over these shows,'' he says. ``They'd be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Other networks blame writers for the fallow offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be incredibly happy if we could find a really
dynamic, self-confident female voice that was consistently well
written,'' says Warren Littlefield, president of NBC Entertainment.
``But talent is pretty scarce.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Turner calls such statements ``stunning high arrogance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To say there are no good writers out there is to lie about the
three things that power television these days: deals, deals,
deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Back-end syndication deals may be the most insidious underlying
pressure for the financially pressed networks. Contrary to
perceptions, networks don't make their money up front, by selling
advertising on prime-time shows; the real payback comes when the
series are resold to local stations.
</P>
<P>
   The reruns that fetch the highest prices are sitcoms, and the
sitcoms that seem to do best with ``prime access'' (7:30 p.m.)
audiences are male-skewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What guy is going to sit down and watch reruns of `Friends'
when he comes home from work?'' asks Krumins. In fact, because
syndication success is entirely determined by men (women are much
less picky viewers, according to the research) there is no
correlation at all between how well a female-oriented show does in
prime time and how it does later in reruns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murphy Brown,'' for example, hit records when its original
syndication rights were sold, but its ratings in reruns were a huge
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That affects what shows the networks put on,'' says Krumins.
</P>
<P>
   The other business maneuver that has a sledgehammer impact on
how women are portrayed is the network trend to sign stars long
before there is a sitcom concept to fit them.
</P>
<P>
   Since the financial interest and syndication rules were lifted
in 1995, networks can own a piece of a series outright, which
sometimes means creative decisions take a back seat to matters of
money and control.
</P>
<P>
   A result is often a repeat of NBC's fiasco with Tea Leoni in
``The Naked Truth'': a mercurially charming star jammed
uncomfortably into a jerry-rigged idea.
</P>
<P>
   Still, networks don't seem to learn from their expensive
mistakes. This season, dizzy starlets in mediocre vehicles are
second only to young men seemingly suspended in perpetual
adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that seems to have changed about the female
characters is that they have plunged down the socioeconomic ladder
in direct contradiction with real-world trends. Last season
Everygirl worked in publishing; now she's either unemployed or
tending bar.
</P>
<P>
   Consider ``Maggie Winters.'' Faith Ford (of ``Murphy Brown'')
plays a 32-year-old woman who dumps her doctor husband for cheating
on her. Because she apparently has no money and has never had a
job, she returns to her hometown in Indiana, moves in with her
mother and rekindles relationships with a host of loser high school
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept is a shameless attempt to hark back to nostalgia
for high school,'' observes Susan J. Douglas, author of ``Where the
Girls Are: Growing Up Female With the Mass Media.'' ``It's a
post-feminist downsizing fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse'' offers little more dimension. Christina Applegate, who
became a cult figure among adolescent boys for her role in
``Married ... With Children,'' plays a Buffalo barmaid who is a
single mother. She is in a quandary about whether she should date
the Antonio Banderas look-alike next door.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is hoping to score with ``Costello.'' Built around the
appeal of a gritty Boston stand-up comic, Sue Costello, the lead _
a cute blond in her mid-20s who seems to be channeling a truck
driver _ works, yes, as a bartender and waitress in a South End
dive.
</P>
<P>
   Where are the interesting women on television? Some are on
cable. Lifetime is testing the waters with three new shows, and the
patter of the four women on HBO's ``Sex and the City'' at least
rises above the safe, chirpy drone of most prime-time comedy.
</P>
<P>
   On the networks, the most compelling women seem to be lurking in
the ensemble dramas; see Christine Lahti's portrayal of the
conflicted surgeon in ``E.R.'' Other women of substance, it seems,
aren't women at all but high school girls or aliens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity,'' the WB's nuanced hourlong coming-of-age drama, has
been touted as an early, deserving hit. ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'' showcases a girl who is funny, fearless and, when
necessary, lethal. ``Sabrina the Teen-Age Witch'' could show
Maggie, Costello and Jesse a few things about poise and common
sense.
</P>
<P>
   But like Sally of ``Third Rock From the Sun'' _ another strong,
unpredictable woman _ Buffy and Sabrina function in the world of
the supernatural, easier terrain for tough-minded females.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could never have sold a vital, 6-foot-tall, sexually
inquisitive woman without making her a male alien,'' says Ms.
Turner, who helped create the show.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best illustration of the trajectory of women's
images on television can be found in ``Veronica's Closet.'' In the
original treatment, Kirstie Alley's character was a strong if
flawed businesswoman. But as the show has progressed, Veronica
seems to have lost both her mind and much of her simple motor
coordination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it's true that people don't want to see real life
these days,'' says Littlefield, who contends that NBC has not urged
the shows' creators to make Veronica haplessly daffy. ``Maybe the
days of `Roseanne' and her real-life problems are over.''

LETTER TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE LEADERS FROM CLINTON LAWYERS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following is the letter sent Tuesday to Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and Rep.
John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., the ranking Democrat on the committee,
from President Clinton's lawyers, Charles Ruff and David Kendall.
It was released by Kendall:
</P>
<P>
   When we met earlier this month, you kindly offered to accept
from us any submissions we wished to make that would bear on the
committee's preliminary review of the independent counsel's
referral. We write today to bring to the committee's attention a
critical flaw in the referral _ a flaw that we believe calls into
question the fairness of the entire process underlying the referral
and should lead the members, at the very least, to question the
factual premise on which it rests and the legal conclusions it
draws.
</P>
<P>
   As we indicated to you on Sept. 11 and Sept. 14, we feared, even
before reading the independent counsel's referral, that it would be
a one-sided and unfair manipulation of the evidence and the law.
Yesterday's release of Ms. Lewinsky's testimony made clear that our
fears were, if anything, understated.
</P>
<P>
   It is plain now from the 3,200-page appendices to the Starr
referral that the office of independent counsel (OIC) has
significantly distorted the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky, quoting it
when it suited the OIC's purposes and downplaying it or ignoring it
when it did not. The OIC ignored all reasonable standards of
fairness in preparing and drafting its referral. The referral is
stunning in its silence about evidence that supports the president.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky consistently has maintained that neither the
president nor anyone acting on his behalf ever urged her to lie,
about anything. Aware that this would be her testimony, the OIC did
not ask her any questions that might elicit this exculpatory
testimony in the grand jury and ended its interrogation of her
without clarifying this key point. After the OIC prosecutor
announced ``We don't have further questions,'' it was left to a
grand juror to ask Ms. Lewinsky if she wished to add to, amplify or
clarify her previous testimony, whereupon Ms. Lewinsky stated:
</P>
<P>
   ``I would. I think because of the public nature of how this
investigation has been and what the charges aired, that I would
just like to say that no one ever asked me to lie and I was never
promised a job for my silence.'' App. 1161 (8/20/98 Lewinsky
testimony)
</P>
<P>
   As this plainly indicates, Ms. Lewinsky also testified that the
efforts of Vernon Jordan to find her a job were not part of any
scheme to obstruct justice or buy her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Mr. Starr to specifically exclude Ms. Lewinsky's
exculpatory statements and express denials raises grave questions
about the fundamental fairness of the Starr referral. The OIC chose
to print over 150 pages of gratuitous and graphic sexual detail but
could not find space for a single sentence quoting Ms. Lewinsky's
sworn testimony, which directly undermines the central
obstruction-of-justice allegations in the referral, and, for that
matter, the very basis of the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   We have not yet had a chance to analyze properly the 3,200 pages
released yesterday by the committee, but we think the OIC's failure
to give a fair presentation of Ms. Lewinsky's testimony is
indicative of the one-sided nature of the referral, a document
whose true goal was to embarrass the president and inflame the
public. We hope that you and the other distinguished members of
your committee will proceed with due caution and appropriate
fairness as you move forward to review the materials the OIC
prosecutors have submitted.
</P>
<P>
   We look forward to making additional submissions to the
committee as its review _ and ours _ proceed.

 WASHINGTON: the president.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the broadcast of Clinton's testimony before the grand jury,
showing a president ranging from contrite to argumentative, furious
to crestfallen, seemed in fact to strengthen the president.
</P>
<P>
   Polling conducted by Gallup for CNN and US Today showed a
six-point jump in Clinton's job approval rating, to 66 percent,
after the broadcast, compared with 60 percent on Sunday. And CBS
News found that since the telecast, 68 percent of those polled
approved of the way Clinton was doing his job, up from 59 percent
since the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the job approval numbers, however, the public was still
divided over Clinton's trustworthiness, and a majority of those
polled still believe that he lied under oath about his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress also saw the volatility of public opinion in
their own phone calls from constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, said that on Thursday and Friday,
phone calls to his office were ``as heavy as I'd ever seen it'' and
running 8 to 1 against the president. But on Tuesday, he said the
calls became ``much more favorable'' to the president. ``It was
significantly changed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said he thought little had
changed. ``People who thought the president was a liar felt
vindicated,'' he said. ``People who felt he was being picked on
felt vindicated. And people who hadn't made up their minds were
bored out of their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, one Republican took to the Senate floor on Tuesday to
warn his party against even the appearance of partisanship or a
rush to judgment. ``I think it's very important that there be a
real effort on the part of Republicans _ because we Republicans are
in control _ to not press for every bit of advantage,'' warned Sen.
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans fended off any talk of an early deal with the
president, they moved forward with a timetable that would set a
House vote on whether to open an impeachment inquiry for early
October. Impeachment hearings would then be put off until after the
election.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists said the delay would allow their party to
move cautiously before the election _ neither turning off their own
conservative base by being too easy on the president nor appearing
to be too harsh. Because of Clinton's troubles, Republicans are now
expecting to increase their majorities in both the House and the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican House member who is closely monitoring the
elections said that the volatility of the public mood argued for
caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is in unchartered waters waiting for the fog to lift
and figure out where they are,'' he said, speaking on condition
that he not be identified. ``No one is willing to make a deal until
they know where they stand. The polls are meaningless. The
president's support is a fraction of an inch deep. Every number
besides his favorable rating is ominous for Democrats. And
Republicans know that misplaying their hand is dangerous too.
Everyone's in a state of suspended animation.''

 &HT;    Golf Notebook: Pepper irks Europeans
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley

<P>
   The LPGA needs more players like Dottie Pepper, whose
competitive fires burn hotter than anyone's in women's pro golf.
But as great as she is to have on your side, she's also can
irritate an opponent. A few members of the European team were
clearly miffed about Pepper's fist-pumping, crowd-inciting tactics
in last weekend's Solheim Cup, which ended in a 16-12 American
victory. On Saturday, before Europe's Marie Laure de Lorenzi was to
chip, Pepper riled up the Muirfield Village crowd after teammate
Juli Inkster clinched her par at the 18th. ``Her behavior is
unprofessional and unnecessary,'' England's Laura Davies said. ``It
nearly spurred us on to victory on the final day. She made a big,
big mistake.'' Pepper, who is 12-4-1 in Solheim matches, said, ``I
wouldn't be the same person if I played without emotion. To me,
it's patriotism.'' It didn't stop several European players from
imagining a likeness of Pepper on a punching bag in the fitness
trailer before Sunday's singles matches. ``I take it as a
compliment. Period,'' Pepper said. ``If that's what it takes, I'm
glad to be their punching bag.''

   Woods concerned about Daly's condition
</P>
<P>
   While it was reported that International Management Group wanted
John Daly to withdraw from the Oct. 8-11 Alfred Dunhill Cup matches
at St. Andrews because of his recent medical problems, he remains
on the U.S. team with Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara. On Monday,
during an exhibition in Reno with Lee Trevino, Fuzzy Zoeller and
Tom Watson, Daly was joking about his past problems with alcohol,
making reference to several years when he regularly punched his
fists through car windows ``when I was really mad and drunk.''
Woods knows Daly's value if healthy _ they are playing on the same
ground where Daly won the 1995 British Open _ but has concerns
about his health. ``I mean, is this the best time for him to be
playing?'' Woods said. ``Personally, I'm more afraid for him. He's
an extremely nice guy. It's just that we all feel so sorry for
him.'' Woods said he has no problem with Daly as a teammate ``as
long as he goes out there and gives it 100 percent on every shot.''

   Nick Faldo apparently has ended his 13-year relationship with
coach David Leadbetter. Leadbetter told GolfWeb that Faldo notified
him of the split with a letter sent to the Leadbetter Golf Academy.
He said Faldo decided to work with Chip Koehlke of the Faldo Golf
Institute. ``It's disappointing when you work so hard with a player
for so many years,'' Leadbetter said. ``. . . . Sometimes you need
a fresh outlook, I suppose. Still, it was a bit of a shock.'' . . .
. David Duval, playing in the Trophee Lancome near Paris on Sunday,
failed to do what Billy Andrade managed the week before in Canada _
spend the weekend in the water at an 18th hole and still win. Duval
double-bogeyed the closing 209-yard par 3 Sunday, losing to Spain's
Miguel Angel Jimenez.

SOFTER SCHEDULE FOR BRUINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) (SLANG) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Before he retired this summer, UCLA associate
athletic director Jim Milhorn left his beloved basketball team a
1998-99 schedule custom-made for its unique demographics.
</P>
<P>
   Milhorn knew the Bruins were replacing three unflappable seniors
_ Kris Johnson, Toby Bailey and J.R. Henderson _ with a slew of
wide-eyed underclassmen. Fourteen of UCLA's 16 players will be
freshmen or sophomores. The lone senior, guard Brandon Loyd, played
sparingly last year and is not expected to start. The only junior,
Sean Farnham, is a walk-on.
</P>
<P>
   So Milhorn's schedule does not include a Duke, Illinois, New
Mexico or Las Vegas road trip. Instead, the Bruins will prep for a
rugged Pac-10 _ this year, it might be as good as the ACC _ with
Santa Clara, Delaware State, UNLV, Cal State Northridge, American
and Loyola Marymount at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   There are no nonconference road games in November or December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be too quick to judge,'' coach Steve Lavin
said. ``But in theory, the thinking was we're reloading, and it
would be wise to create a schedule that would let us gain
confidence in the preseason.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Nov. 26-28 San Juan Shootout, the Bruins face San
Francisco in the first round, Maryland in the semifinals (if form
holds) and mighty Kentucky in the finals. A week later, they play
Oklahoma State in the Wooden Classic on Dec. 5 at the Anaheim Pond.
</P>
<P>
   The Louisville series reaches a long-overdue conclusion Jan. 23.
(Next year, North Carolina takes Louisville's spot on the
schedule.) Syracuse has replaced Duke as the February foe.
</P>
<P>
   __ Roster update: Kevin Daley's transfer to Azusa Pacific gives
the Bruins an additional scholarship. They had hoped to add Patreck
Ceresa, a 6-foot-8 forward/center from Switzerland, but he did not
survive the complicated eligibility process for European players.
</P>
<P>
   __ Recruiting update: Lavin has three scholarships available for
the 1999-2000 season and is recruiting five _ oops, make that three
_ players to fill the spots: Alameda power forward Justin Davis and
Cerritos forward Andrew Gooden recently committed to Cal and
Kansas, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Kareem Rush, a 6-4 shooter from Kansas City and
brother of current freshman JaRon Rush; Carlos Boozer, a top
forward from Juneau, Alaska, and Jason Kapono, the masterful
forward from Artesia, on UCLA's short list.
</P>
<P>
   __ Davis update: Baron Davis continues to rehabilitate his
surgically repaired left knee, but UCLA has set no date for his
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's making progress and is on track for a full
rehabilitation,'' Lavin said, declining to give an estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The best guess: mid-December. Whether Davis regains top form by
March, well, that's another matter.

QUARTER PROFIT AT GOLDMAN DECLINES 25 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. said Tuesday that it earned $754 million
before taxes in its fiscal third quarter, a drop of about
one-fourth from the second quarter, as global market turmoil took a
toll on profit and cast doubts on Goldman's own planned public
offering of stock.
</P>
<P>
   Executives acknowledged Tuesday that they were debating whether
to delay the private partnership's much-anticipated initial public
offering, a decision some market analysts look to as a statement on
the stock market's health. If the firm were to delay the offering,
it would suggest that some of the United States' most successful
investment bankers considered it unlikely that financial markets
would significantly recover before year's end.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's six-man executive committee does not have to decide
whether to proceed with the offering until early next month, said
the executives, who spoke on the condition that they not be
identified. It is still scheduled for November. But top company
officials are at least considering the prospect of delaying until
1999, especially since the firm expects its earnings slide to
continue through the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go public if you can't deliver the quarter,'' a
Goldman executive says. ``And you can't fight the tape,'' he said,
alluding to the falling stock prices of financial company rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions in financial markets and the stock prices of Goldman
competitors have deteriorated sharply since June, when the 189
partners voted to take the firm public.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's two main peers, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter, have seen their stock prices plunge by about half from
their peaks in July. They had been trading at high levels in
relation to earnings, on hopes that profit would continue to grow
quickly, but the reverse is turning out to be true.
</P>
<P>
   The Goldman, Sachs earnings decline is indicative of a broader
Wall Street trend, as Goldman is the first of the big securities
firms to report results.
</P>
<P>
   Many financial companies have suffered losses in emerging
markets since August. But the bigger worry now is the health of
bond markets in advanced economies, a far more important source of
profit. Russia's decision to devalue its currency and default on
some domestic debt has wreaked havoc with prices of debt
securities, and the turmoil shows no sign of easing.
</P>
<P>
   John Thain, Goldman's chief financial officer, said in a
statement that the firm's earnings in some areas, including mergers
and acquisitions advising and asset management, remained robust
through the third quarter, which for Goldman means June, July and
August. But trading and underwriting of new equity and debt issues
took a hit, he said, and the slowdown has continued in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increased volatility in the financial markets, the widening of
credit spreads, a decline in liquidity in certain markets and a
reduction in global equity values have adversely affected many
participants in the financial services sector,'' Thain said. ``We
expect these conditions to negatively impact our fourth-quarter
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Goldman's third-quarter earnings were 25 percent less
than in the second quarter and about 20 percent less than in the
quarter a year earlier, results for the year to date remain strong.
</P>
<P>
   For the first nine months of the 1998 fiscal year, the firm
reported pretax earnings of $2.814 billion, compared with $2.447
billion for the corresponding period of 1997. Net revenue for the
first nine months was $7.605 billion and expenses were $4.791
billion. Goldman reports only pretax earnings, as the individual
partners settle their own taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings drop is roughly in line with expectations, said
Raphael Soifer, securities-industry analyst at Brown Brothers
Harriman. But because June and July were relatively strong months,
the 25 percent slump in earnings for the quarter implies a bad
August, he said. And with the slump continuing into September, the
stars are not well aligned for a big Goldman initial public
offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``One wonders how one can bring a big IPO into a market this
volatile,'' Soifer said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Two other securities companies, Morgan Stanley and Lehman
Brothers, will report results this week. Analysts are expecting
Morgan Stanley to show a similar 25 percent drop in earnings
compared with the second quarter. Lehman Brothers, whose profit
depends more on trading and the bond market than does Morgan's or
Goldman's, is expected to sustain even sharper damage, with
operating earnings falling by about half from the second-quarter
level.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all other brokerage firms and big international banks
are expected to report falling quarterly profit, and in some cases,
losses.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street is usually quick to react to changes in market
conditions, and many expect companies to begin laying off workers
in coming weeks. Merrill Lynch and Bankers Trust have already
warned that layoffs are possible.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Moszkowski, who analyzes the securities industry for Salomon
Smith Barney, said that with no quick turnaround for financial
markets in sight, banks and brokerage firms would look for ways to
save money.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will look to cut as much fat as they can as soon as they
can,'' he said. But Moszkowski added that some Wall Street houses
overreacted to the 1994 market downturn and dismissed too many
people, making them ill prepared to profit when markets recovered.
``The lesson from 1994, I think, is that they shouldn't be too
quick to cut muscle.''

COMMENTARY: LEGACY OF LUST  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He couldn't stop thinking about the thong
underwear. He couldn't believe Monica had pulled up her jacket to
show it off. It so inflamed his imagination. At meetings, at
briefings, at the most unlikely times, his mind suddenly reverted
to the image of those straps, quickening his pulse, making him
catch his breath.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the cigar that undid him. He was driven by the
thought of what had been done with it. Suddenly the capital became
a city of cigars. He saw them wherever he went. They ignited his
desire. When he was alone or talking to other people, he took
secret pleasure in letting smoke rings drift through his mind.
</P>
<P>
   There were times when he worried that he might be a sex addict.
He couldn't stop thinking of Monica: what she wore, when she wore
it, where she wore it, or didn't wear it. Her little letters were
so brazen, promising such wild pleasure. Everything she scribbled,
every gift she gave, mesmerized him.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the power of her voice over him. He knew that
he was entering the dangerous territory of obsession. No matter how
much he heard Monica talk about sex, it was never enough.
</P>
<P>
   He was a busy man. A powerful man. A serious man. But there were
times when all he could remember were the sizzling phone
conversations. They filled his head like a drug. People warned him
that he was endangering his legacy. Friends and strangers tried to
pull him back from the brink of his single-mindedness. But it was
too late.
</P>
<P>
   He had become the helpless victim of his cravings for ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   The big picture was lost. He hungered only for the details, all
the stirring and seamy particulars. Nothing was too small or
insignificant for him to consider, to turn over and over in his
unappeasable mind.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to think about her eating cherry chocolates. He
imagined her wrapped up like Cleopatra in the Rockettes blanket or
panting in that Black Dog T-shirt. He kept seeing her in that blue
Gap dress. It was too tight, and he was glad. Again and again he
was visited by images of a man's roving lips. He knew it was wrong.
But he liked to dip into sin. He needed a release from all the
pressure, from the extraordinary responsibilities of a very public
man.
</P>
<P>
   When he went to church on Sundays, he wrestled with his
conscience. He even wondered if he needed professional help.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he worried that he was abusing his power and hurting
the country. He even fretted that the Constitution itself might be
damaged by his obsession.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes it wasn't easy to behold all the human damage that
he already had caused: ruining a young woman's life, dragging all
sorts of people through the muck, wounding reputations and
bankrupting those who came near him. Would the presidency survive
his lust? It didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Every time he heard those words _ inappropriate intimate
contact, sex of any kind in any manner, shape or form, arousing or
gratifying as defined in definition 1 _ he felt a fire burn.
</P>
<P>
   He had his own definition of sex. Still, he was drawn to the
endless discussion of the existential meaning of sex _ its forms,
its uses. He was a lawyer, but this was not just tortured legalism.
This was tortured eroticism. He liked to parse the lurid definition
over and over and over again, gaining pleasure from repetition:
``breasts,'' ``genitalia,'' ``inserted,'' ``stain.''
</P>
<P>
   His acolytes and subordinates became agents of shamelessness. It
seemed that everyone around him, everyone in the city, everyone in
the country, was talking about what he wanted to hear. All of them
had become his collaborators in perversity. He was spending
millions and millions of dollars to drag an entire nation down to
his twisted level.
</P>
<P>
   He knew how strong he was. He was the most powerful man in the
land. He could reach into every recess of the government to satisfy
himself. And the prospect of impeachment didn't frighten him.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the more he fixated on the strap of that thong, the
more certain he was that he could hang Bill Clinton with it. And,
of all those naughty words he loved to hear, none filled him with
more pleasure than ``impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, nobody could impeach him. He was Ken Starr.

A CHANGE OF COURSE TOWARD DANCES FOR THE PEOPLE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYONS, France _ ``I'm no longer interested in spectacle. I now
want my pieces to deal with what is going on today,'' Maguy Marin,
the experimental French choreographer, said recently over lunch
near Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the conversation was clear: a shift in the
47-year-old choreographer's career. Ms. Marin has moved her
modern-dance troupe, the Compagnie Maguy Marin, from the Parisian
suburb of Creteil to Rillieux-La-Pape, a tougher immigrant suburb
of Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   She has also stopped doing commissioned works for major ballet
companies and is concentrating on her own company, which will
present her 1995 ``Ramdam'' at the Joyce Theater from Tuesday
through Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it was the Lyons Opera Ballet that presented some
of the highly elaborate productions for which she is best-known:
``Cendrillon,'' a doll-house version of ``Cinderella'' seen in New
York in 1987, and ``Coppelia,'' in a modern-dress, mixed-media
staging performed at Lincoln Center Festival '96.
</P>
<P>
   But nowadays, she said, her emphasis is different. ``I want my
work to be closer to people,'' she said. ``Members of the public
should recognize themselves in my pieces. I want to discard magic
and spectacle. I had a theatrical period, with its field of dreams.
But a dream must also be real, and one must try to blur dream and
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   It is back to basics for Ms. Marin, whose early acclaim came
with pared-down pieces like ``May B,'' her terse and brilliant 1981
tribute to Samuel Beckett.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marin, who founded her troupe in 1978, said that as time
went by in her work, ``the performer was taking second place to
production values, and I kept using more dancers and more sets. It
was time to step back and reflect.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, she met her current husband, the composer
Denis Mariotte, who created the scores for recent pieces, including
``Waterzooi,'' performed in 1995 at the Joyce. There, dancers in
her company played toy instruments devised by Mariotte. Although
the tone of the piece was abstract, it was actually a clever and
engaging essay about human emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to start with the abstract in order to work on concrete
things,'' Ms. Marin said. ``If you begin with concrete ideas, you
are closed off. There are more possibilities in the abstract where
things are suggested, not stated. Again, between the dream and
reality, there is something not said, which remains open.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she said: ``My subject is always about human
relations. I am not a message choreographer, but I am concerned
with the human condition, especially male-female relations.''
</P>
<P>
   The choreographer, however, rarely begins with a defined
subject, except when she is given a commissioned project as in
Lyons Opera Ballet's ``Cendrillon.''
</P>
<P>
   In her own company, she is apt to start on a formal level of
experimenting with movement, especially articulation of isolated
parts of the body. ``Ramdam'' (``Tumult'') consists of two
complementary works in which Ms. Marin and Mariotte experiment with
dancers' vocalizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The springboard for the first piece, `Ram,' is the voice,''
Ms. Marin said. ``The dancers create rhythmic music as they speak
and dance. But you can't always understand them. And you realize
that for all the talk and information in the world, we don't always
hear each other. What do we really know?
</P>
<P>
   ``The dancers wear standard street dress, which doesn't reveal
the inner person, and we hear voices that don't express true
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the `Dam' section, there is more noise. The dancers play
simple instruments. `Ram' is square, `Dam' is more fluid and
explosive. It made me think of a text from a Beckett book, not a
play, where he speaks of how information is distributed and
deformed. The book is `Comment C'est' but because Beckett did not
want any parts of it staged, we could not get the rights to use
excerpts onstage.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in ``May B,'' Ms. Marin's concern was to extend her
company's performing range. ``I wanted more than a dancer, one who
could act and sing and use his or her entire body.''
</P>
<P>
   But about seven years ago, she felt things were going stale.
When she set up a studio in Sainte Foy-les-Lyons, she was contacted
by town authorities in Rillieux-La-Pape, at the opposite end of
Lyons. She agreed to transfer her company there and seek financing
from four other working-class towns and suburbs east of Lyons to do
outreach work in community centers, especially with minority young
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this experience would revitalize us,'' she said.
``Since January, we have given lecture-demonstrations and classes
with people of all ages. Fifteen years ago, I would not have done
this. I would have said I need the time to choreograph. But today,
we have matured and need this contact with the public, especially a
new public.''

   KRASNOYARSK, Russia _ With the rugged stoicism that typifies
this vast Siberian territory, Nina Popova thought she could ride
out Russia's economic storm.
</P>
<P>
   But last week tax inspectors barged into her small food shop.
After poring through her ledgers, they warned her she had violated
Governor Alexander Lebed's new ``anti-crisis'' decree.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said we can only charge 10 percent more than we pay for
the food,'' she said. ``But we have to pay for electricity and
heat. We have to pay for security, and we have to pay salaries. If
they force this decree on us we simply won't survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's financial crisis has not only rocked Moscow's political
establishment. It has also stirred many of Russia's far-flung
regions to set their own economic course and establish price
controls.
</P>
<P>
   A former general, presidential hopeful and the new governor of
this Siberian region, Lebed has led the charge. Angry at the
soaring prices that have stunned Russians, Lebed has not just
declared war on inflation. He has tried to make it illegal.
</P>
<P>
   He is hardly alone. From the northwestern city of Novgorod to
the western territory of Yakutia, authorities are taking a page out
of the socialist playbook and intervening to set prices.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is fast becoming a crazy quilt of zones with Draconian
price controls, territories with milder price restrictions and
regions with no controls at all.
</P>
<P>
   The populist decrees have brought a measure of comfort to
consumers shocked by sharp jumps in prices for food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may infringe on the rights of people but it is in their
interest,'' Lebed said in interview. ``The strict measures have
played their role and soon will be abolished.''
</P>
<P>
   But the stop-gap controls also contain the seeds of new
problems. Stores and factories complain they are being denied the
profit they need to weather Russia's raging economic storm.
Shortages have emerged, as producers ship their goods to regions
where prices run free.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually nobody thinks the controls are a substitute for a
national strategy to rescue Russia from its economic malaise.
</P>
<P>
   But with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov still struggling to
form a national Cabinet, there is no overarching plan.
</P>
<P>
   Lebed owes his job to Krasnoyarsk's economic distress. Tapping
the deep well of discontent, Lebed scored an upset victory over the
region's incumbent governor in a bitterly contested race last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   An immense region one-fourth the size of the United States,
Krasnoyarsk has some of the nation's largest factories along with
Siberia-size economic problems. But Lebed assured the voters that
the region need an experienced crisis manager, not an economist.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Lebed has been sorely tested.
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of the ruble, tax revenues plummeted. Panic
buying cleared the shelves of baby food and cold medicine, leaving
the region with dangerously small reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, residents in the city of Krasnoyarsk, the
administrative capital of the region, found themselves without hot
water when the authorities ran short of coal.
</P>
<P>
   The only bright spot came when Lebed hosted a glitzy popular
music festival, which was sponsored by one of Russia's leading
television networks _ a brief distraction in what promises to be
one of the toughest winters in years.
</P>
<P>
   Chastened by his region's economic woes, Lebed no longer talks
confidently about single-handedly turning the situation around.
Krasnoyarsk, he says, needs a greater share of the nation's tax
receipts and lower rail and electricity tariffs to thrive over the
long term.
</P>
<P>
   It is Lebed's short-term plan, however, that has led
Krasnoyarsk's citizens to draw the political battle lines. Anxious
to quell the economic turmoil sweeping the nation, Lebed has
decreed controls on the price of meat, fish, bread, flour, cereal,
pasta, beverages and coal.
</P>
<P>
   The measures officially took effect a week ago when the order
was published on the front page of the regional newspaper
Krasnoyarsk Worker.
</P>
<P>
   Under Lebed's system, producers who want to raise the wholesale
price of goods need to appeal to a panel of government officials at
least five days in advance. Officially, no ceiling on wholesale
prices was set. But a Lebed aide has proclaimed that producers
should be satisfied with a profit of 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Retail prices are regulated according to a formula. Shop owners
are not be allowed to sell their food and beverages for more than
10 percent more than what they paid for them. And Krasnoyarsk's tax
inspectors are conducting spot checks to make sure.
</P>
<P>
   Lebed has emerged in recent weeks as the most popular
alternative to the Communists in the public opinion polls. But his
brand of capitalism is both populist and exceedingly vague.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am certainly on the verge of breaking the law, but I think
my measures are justified,'' Lebed said earlier this month. ``The
emergency situation is compelling me to take emergency measures.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Defending his price controls, Lebed said they were needed to
head off a wave of frenzied buying by consumers desperate to stock
up before prices soared even further.
</P>
<P>
   Another goal, he said, was to stop profiteering by local
producers, who were taking advantage of the crisis to ratchet up
their prices even though they have been somewhat insulated from the
effects of Russia's falling currency. The aim, he insisted, was not
to set the price of imported goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should milk become more expensive? Has the price of cows
gone up?'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Lebed is not the only one to turn to price controls. Kaliningrad
has declared a state of emergency. The tax police in Novgorod have
prowled through the city, fining shops for exorbitant prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern Russian city of Stavropol, fights broke out when
consumers and merchants banded together against government
inspectors, who they complained were interfering with local trade.
</P>
<P>
   Even pricey Moscow has imposed a 20 percent limit on the markup
for basic staples, though city officials insist it is more of a
guideline than a law.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lebed's decree has been assailed by his critics, who say
it shows his penchant for simplistic and authoritarian solutions to
complex economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that no member of the Lebed team thinks in economic
terms,'' said Aleksei Kleshko, a member of the Krasnoyarsk City
Council.``They only know how to deal with the crisis through
administrative means.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many local factory directors and shop owners are
unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government acts just like it did in the days of Soviet
power, when business people were considered bourgeois
speculators,'' said Yevgeniya Kuznetsova, the president of Pikra, a
local beverage company and the first factory to be privatized in
the Krasnoyarsk region.
</P>
<P>
   After the ruble collapsed, the upgrading of the factory's beer
production unit was stopped in mid-stream after a German factory
refused to provide any more equipment on credit.
</P>
<P>
   That has increased the factory's need for cash. Meanwhile, sales
have fallen, as consumers have cut back on their purchase or beer
and soft drinks so that they can stock up on flour, grain and
cooking oil.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kuznetsova said her company will be skating too close to the
edge if it is restricted to a profit rate of 2 percent. Already,
she has gone to a four-day work week to reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government does not seem to worry about the collapse of
small and medium business,'' she said bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   At her small shop down the street from Pikra, Ms. Popova is more
distressed than angry. A sturdy woman with an engaging manner, she
voted for Lebed because of his promises to bring order to
Krasnoyarsk.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Popova is already something of a survivor. She set up her
food store in a working class district earlier this year after the
investment company she was working for went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Her store sells sausages, bread, alcohol and cooking oil.
Saleswomen receive just 360 rubles a month (about $24 at current
exchange rates) for their 12-hour-a-day jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Because the volume of sales is low and because her store also
has to pay for utilities and an alarm system, Ms. Popova needs to
mark up her goods by 20 percent just to break even, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Krasnoyarsk tax police, however, were not impressed by her
arguments. After shuffling through the shop's balance sheets, they
told her the store was exceeding the 10 percent mark-up allowed for
salt, sugar and cereal. No fines were levied yet, but Ms. Popova
was summoned to the local tax office to do some explaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``All summer long I told our saleswomen they should be patient
and that I would increase their salaries a little bit in the
fall,'' she said. ``Now, I may have to fire some of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Popova is reluctant to assign the blame to the
gruff-talking governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pinned hopes on him because I thought he would be tough,''
she recalled. ``But he turned out to be too tough. He's not an
economist, though, and this was probably done by his team. I still
hope to prove to him that this is not right, and I might even vote
for him again.''

 ANALYSIS: CLINTON REMAINS THE MASTER COMMUNICATOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 19th graf starting: So once again, etc., for re-editing.)

 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He began with careful answers about his
understanding of ``the whole truth.'' He ended by saying he wished
he had even more time to answer grand jurors' questions. Throughout
his four hours of sworn testimony broadcast on Monday, President
Clinton dodged and weaved, feinted and bobbed.
</P>
<P>
   It was a spectacle that would have destroyed most politicians,
beamed across television screens with labels warning of its
explicit sexual content and rife with literally incredible details
and denials. It was recorded in the most secret forum in
Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence, then released to the world by the
president's political enemies in the hope that it would damage him
severely.
</P>
<P>
   And yet on Tuesday morning, as he has so often before, Clinton
once again bobbed up, buoyed by a bipartisan _ if sometimes
grudging _ consensus among politicians that after months of
bleeding, the president may have finally had a good day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's his life,'' said Alan Simpson, the retired Republican
senator from Wyoming who now directs the Institute of Politics at
the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. ``His life is
bounding from precipice to precipice like a huge mountain goat,
bridging crevasse after crevasse and people shooting at him with
high-powered rifles and the other side crumbling as he lands, just
like in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's interesting to me is did anybody believe that this man
would testify for four hours and not do well, when it was his
decision to do it?'' Simpson asked.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a big part of Clinton's achievement had to do with
expectations. For days, allies of Kenneth Starr and then
congressional Republicans _ perhaps out of wishful thinking _ had
spread the word that Clinton had lost his cool and raged at his
questioners. Instead, he held his anger mostly in check, and even
seemed broken and humbled at times, as when he confessed, ``I'd
give anything in the world not to have to admit what I've had to
admit today.''
</P>
<P>
   But another part had to do with Clinton himself, and with his
inveterate ability to appear revealing while actually concealing,
to seem to acknowledge even as he technically denies, to control
the terms of discourse even at the hands of dogged prosecutors. In
sum, Clinton is a master communicator and, more than any flat
printed page, the monitor remains his medium.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the president simultaneously testified that he
considered his old friend Vernon Jordan a truthful person and that
he could not remember Jordan's ever telling him that Monica
Lewinsky thought the president might leave the first lady some day.
Jordan testified that he told the president that Ms. Lewinsky
believed just that _ something no ordinary husband would be likely
to forget.
</P>
<P>
   But as the nation long ago learned, Bill Clinton is no ordinary
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good confidence man,'' said William Bennett, the former
education secretary whose new best-selling book, ``The Death of
Outrage,'' bemoans a national moral climate that would overlook
Clinton's misdeeds. ``He's good at what he does, and he wouldn't be
where he is if he weren't very smart.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Bennet added, ``The public likes him.''
</P>
<P>
   So it does. Some overnight polls showed that the president's job
approval ratings held steady or actually rose a bit, even if _ as
the polls also show _ the public does not share his moral code, or
even his highly conditioned view of what constitutes sexual
relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of a wash,'' said former Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas,
summing up the prevailing view. ``He probably helped himself a
little. I told my wife, `He knew that was going to be made public.
He was talking to the people.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is by no means out of trouble. Some of the most
important people he was talking to _ House Republicans _ show no
signs of slowing their review of impeachment proceedings against
him, and few seemed inclined to cut him any slack, much less a deal
on censure or some lesser punishment.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Clinton insisted that it was not his job to be
``particularly helpful'' to Paula Jones' lawyers in their sexual
misconduct suit against him, he once again reminded his adversaries
that he will not make things easy on them, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's opponents keep yearning for the magic bullet, and
they have for years, going way back before Lewinsky,'' said William
Kristol, the Republican theoretician who is editor and publisher of
the Weekly Standard. ``They keep hoping that some deus ex machina
will arrive on stage and rid them of this horrible guy. It hasn't
happened, and it's unlikely that anything's going to show up to do
that work for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Kristol said, ``The president is not going to
surrender, and his opponents are going to have to do the hard work
and persuade people to move ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The public view of the president remains profoundly split, but
hardly undiscerning. An ABC News poll on Monday found that nearly 7
in 10 respondents who had actually watched his testimony found it
evasive, although an identical number felt he was right not to talk
about sexual details.
</P>
<P>
   So once again, Clinton, who staked his political claim on
finding a ``third way'' between liberalism and conservatism, may
have found a way of squaring the circle of truth and falsehood, at
least when it comes to sex. No one who watched the president's
testimony could doubt that he was acknowledging that he had lied to
some of his closest aides about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
Yet even in describing that behavior _ when he was not under oath
and not subject to charges of perjury _ Clinton steadfastly refused
to utter the word ``lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is the politicians of both parties, who know Clinton
best and have never especially liked him, who remain most sensitive
to his months of misrepresentations. For Clinton has misled many of
them before, in negotiations over legislation or the budget, and
they are wary to their core.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a history here,'' Bennett said. ``The people who are
paying attention are angrier. The closer you are, the angrier you
are.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee continued Tuesday to
pick through the 16 remaining boxes of evidence turned over by the
independent counsel, flagging portions that may be too private, too
embarrassing or irrelevant for public viewing.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the committee released transcripts and videotapes of
President Clinton's grand jury testimony, Democratic and Republican
aides were pushing to complete by Thursday their screening of
thousands of pages of other documents, many of which contain
sexually explicit references.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the panel's 37 lawmakers, still nursing their
wounds from last week's partisan thrashing over whether to release
Clinton's videotape, will hunker down in closed session to weigh
the staff's suggested cuts from the new, and much larger, batch of
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Under a House resolution, approved by an overwhelmingly
bipartisan vote, the committee must release all remaining material
by Monday, except for those passages deemed too sensitive or
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers were bracing for another bruising showdown later
this week, as Republicans repeated their calls to release as much
information as possible to allow the public to judge Clinton's
truthfulness. ``The people's right to know is very strong,'' said
Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans who have read the material said there were
no bombshells lurking in the transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen anything new,'' Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif.,
told reporters after a 75-minute meeting among committee
Republicans on Tuesday afternoon. ``I haven't seen anything
remarkable above and beyond'' the accusations leveled in Kenneth
Starr's 445-page report.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members declined to describe in detail the remaining
documents or discuss whether the boxes held material favorable to
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the grand jury depositions from central figures like Betty
Currie, Clinton's secretary, as well as the tape-recorded
conversations between Monica Lewinsky and her one-time confidante
Linda Tripp, no doubt will add textured detail to the broad
outlines of what is known about those exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   With the House taking no votes on Tuesday and many lawmakers
still in their districts, about eight or nine Republicans on the
committee met privately to discuss scheduling, procedures and a
summary of the committee staff's suggestions for exclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican who heads the committee,
told reporters afterward that aides had made good progress, going
through all but four of the 16 remaining boxes. Starr sent two sets
of 18 boxes to the House.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said the aides had agreed on some deletions and disagreed
on others. But lawmakers will review all on Thursday. ``It's
laborious, but we made a lot of progress,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said it was possible that some of the remaining documents
could be made public before Monday's deadline, but other lawmakers
and aides said a release earlier than Monday was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the material forwarded by Starr, the committee
now also has the six-hour deposition Clinton made on Jan. 17 before
lawyers for Paula Jones. Hyde said the committee would review ``the
film of the deposition, probably over the weekend or next week''
and then decide whether to make it public.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., said his committee should release
Clinton's deposition in the Jones civil suit, or at least those
parts ``related to Monica Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have long argued that the committee has released more
information than the public needs to judge Clinton's word, and that
the additional disclosures serve only to embarrass the president.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde dismissed criticisms that too much or too little
information was being released. ``It's hard to take the temperature
of the public,'' Hyde said. ``We're just doing what we were
mandated to do by the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also held out hope that despite last week's bitter partisan
wrangling, Democrats and Republicans could bridge their differences
and consider the solemn possibility of impeachment proceedings
without rancor. ``I have not given up on bipartisanship,'' Hyde
said.
</P>
<P>
   But other Democrats and Republicans were less sanguine,
expressing fear that the recriminations would only worsen. Canady
shook his head in an interview and said, ``In light of the position
that Democrats have taken _ that even if true, Starr's allegations
don't constitute impeachable offenses _ it'll be impossible to
achieve a consensus.''

CLINTON SEEKS MORE MONEY FOR MILITARY READINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A week after the nation's military commanders
warned him about growing fiscal strains on the armed services,
President Clinton Tuesday proposed giving the Pentagon an immediate
new infusion of cash and opened the door to a much larger increase
in military spending in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Secretary of Defense William Cohen, Clinton said
he would take ``additional steps'' to plug a series of shortfalls
already envisioned in the Pentagon's $270 billion budget for the
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Those shortfalls, which commanders told the president were
eroding their readiness to fight and win the next war, have led to
shortages of spare parts for warplanes, cuts in training and
difficulties in recruiting and keeping qualified troops.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton specifically pledged to address each of those readiness
problems and promised to avoid similar problems in the 2000 budget
that the Office of Management and Budget will propose early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I commit to you that then men and women of our armed forces
will have the resources that they need to do their jobs,'' Clinton
said in the letter, which Pentagon officials made available on the
condition that they not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The letter did not mention specific figures, but officials at
the Pentagon said the Clinton administration would immediately
propose adding $1 billion to the $4 billion emergency supplement
already proposed for the coming budget.
</P>
<P>
   For the next budget, the president's commitment is less clear. A
spokesman at the White House said Clinton had yet to commit himself
to increasing the overall military budget for 2000, which is set to
grow slightly to $276 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But an administration official said Clinton _ implicitly in the
letter and explicitly in conversations with senior officials at the
Pentagon _ had indicated his support for the first significant
increase in military spending since he took office.
</P>
<P>
   How significant remains to be worked out. The Pentagon's budget
makers have yet to come up with a figure, but analysts have
estimated that an increase could fall between $10 billion and $20
billion, for an increase of 3.5 percent to 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The president's pledges came only a week before the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, led by Gen. Henry Shelton, are to appear before the
Senate Armed Services Committee at a special hearing on problems
with the military's readiness. The pledges will give the chiefs
something to use to respond to Republicans who have become
increasingly critical of the administration's military spending,
accusing Clinton of letting the armed forces weaken.
</P>
<P>
   At their meeting with Clinton at the National Defense University
last week, the joint chiefs and the unified combat commanders
warned that the increasing duties at home and aboard placed heavy
strains on the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps at a time
when budgets have more or less stayed level with inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The readiness strains have led to a series of problems, Pentagon
officials say, from shortages of spare parts to a growing gap
between civilian and military pay that many in the Pentagon believe
is forcing the most qualified troops to leave.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's letter, Clinton wrote, ``Readiness is a perishable
commodity and requires our serious attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Shelton have tried to highlight the shortfalls in
recent months, laying the groundwork for a plea for additional
money. The issue has become more urgent, they have said, because
Congress has refused for two years to agree to close more unneeded
military bases, a step that could save $20 billion over the next
decade.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Republican aides in the House and the Senate said Tuesday that
they were unaware of the president's letter, though they indicated
that any increase in defense spending was likely to receive broad
support. Already there have been bipartisan calls to increase the
Pentagon's budget for everything from new weapons programs to
improvements in the quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how the administration would pay for any increase
in military spending. Another administration official said the $1
billion increase in the immediate future would most likely be
obtained through cuts elsewhere in the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   As for future budgets, Clinton has pledged not to spend any
surpluses until the White House and Congress agree on how to
preserve the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   Without the surplus, the balanced-budget agreement would force
the administration to cut spending elsewhere to pay for any
significant increase for the Pentagon, a move that could lead to
fights within the administration and the Democrat Party over
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which has been overtaken by the booming economy,
capped Pentagon spending at about $270 billion this year, but the
caps come off next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Council for a Livable World Education Fund, an advocacy
group in Washington, said in a statement Tuesday that Congress was
using ``anecdotal evidence'' of readiness problems to justify
pork-barrel increases in weapons systems in their home states. The
council added, ``Congress is more interested in preserving local
jobs than helping to solve any readiness problems.''

SPORTS COLUMN: VALENTINE'S PROGRAM  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bobby Valentine says he doesn't believe in turning
points, but then he keeps ticking off some turning points of this
season and he gets to six or eight without even mentioning John
Franco's life-flashes-before-your-eyes strikeout last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said it was possible that his best moment in managing
this year had not yet happened. Or maybe his worst. He was not
being mysterious or mystical; he just wanted to get ready for
Montreal, trying to hold off the Cubs for the National League
wild-card slot.
</P>
<P>
   There was another turning point that Valentine never even
mentioned, and that was the day he put Texas behind him, and got on
with his life. He knows the stereotype is still festering away in
the hard drives and the minds of some baseball writers and fans who
observed him back when, but Bobby Valentine likes to think he has
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a slow learner,'' he said, ``but I learn. I'm only 48, but
I've had a lot of amazing things happen, and they're not over
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those amazing things could be appearing in a post-season
game for the first time. Valentine has managed 1,939 games in the
majors, counting last night, and he managed another 275 in the
minors, without winning a title.
</P>
<P>
   He set a record he does not want in Texas by managing 1,186
games _ the most by one manager with the same team without winning
a title. Pinky Higgins of the Red Sox managed 1,119 games from 1955
to 1962; he even had Ted Williams for seven of those years.
Valentine passed him, before time ran out in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The image still lingers of the brash, young manager nicknamed
Top Step because that was where he perched, heckling the opposing
players, sometimes quite personally. Even last year, Valentine
unzipped his lip and managed to alienate Todd Hundley, but this
year, ``He's changed, he's done a great job,'' said an admirer
named Nelson Doubleday, who owns half the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine thinks he has learned from the mistakes he made as a
young manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a terrible job one year, horrible,'' Valentine said,
thinking it might have been 1991, or maybe 1990, the years run
together. ``In turning points, the majority of times, I made the
wrong decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to elaborate, Valentine said: ``One time I went into a bar
where some players were drinking. I shouldn't have done that. One
time I reprimanded a player who was in no mood to be reprimanded. I
shouldn't have done that. There was one player I banked on who
didn't do it, who broke down. There were things I should have
addressed and didn't. There was no sugarcoating it. I guarantee it,
I was terrible. But I'm probably doing a better job because after I
had a bad season, I was allowed to have another.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant that Tom Grieve, his general manager then, had the
integrity to say that maybe the Rangers had not been good enough to
win a division, so he wasn't about to fire the manager.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually it was time for Valentine to move on, all the way to
Chiba Lotte. He managed only one year in Japan, but among the
highlights of listening to Valentine are the fine points he learned
from the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   How would Japanese managers handle a race like this? ``They'd be
smoking up a storm,'' he said with a fond smile.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Valentine talked about the pitfalls in Atlanta
this weekend and the potential reward of facing Randy Johnson in a
three-of-five-game series, starting in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our challenges have not ended,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added: ``Winning the wild card was not my goal. I
collect World Series programs.''
</P>
<P>
   So, reaching the World Series is the goal? ``Winning the World
Series is the goal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The World Series programs are all over his office, where all the
Mets' managers, from Stengel to Valentine, have sat. He began
collecting programs when he opened a restaurant in Connecticut in
1979. His father-in-law, Ralph Branca, helped him locate some, and
then there were ``friends' attics, swap meets.''
</P>
<P>
   He's a baseball man. He shuddered Tuesday at the memories of
high school football, where he was an all-state running back for
three years but absolutely hated going six days without a game. Now
he is in a business where you are either a genius or a blithering
idiot every day, albeit a tad remote from his family while thinking
about the next day's game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have been a crisp and spirited team most of this year..
</P>
<P>
   ``I have allowed myself to feel good about the job I've done,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He looked a little remote. The game was two hours away, and he
had a few things on his mind.

REPORT FAULTS BROKERS' USE OF `SOFT DOLLARS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Imagine placing your hard-earned nest egg with an
investment adviser who, in trading for your portfolio, uses a
brokerage firm that pays his rent, gives him vouchers for rental
cars, travel or theater tickets or buys new carpet for his office.
</P>
<P>
   Outrageous? Perhaps. But according to a survey of brokerage and
investment firms released here Tuesday by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the practice is all too common.
</P>
<P>
   In a long-awaited report on the use and abuse of ``soft
dollars,'' the commission rebates that investment firms receive for
steering business to some brokerage firms, the SEC reported that
more than a quarter of the brokerage and investment advisory firms
make questionable use of the money. It did not name the firms.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many investors are probably paying bloated
commissions _ which, in turn, lower their investment returns.
</P>
<P>
   About $1 billion of research and other services are purchased
annually with soft dollars, the report said. The money is supposed
to pay for research that will help investment managers put together
portfolios for clients. It can also go to buy items covered by a
``safe harbor,'' including publications or computer systems through
which research is transmitted to a firm.
</P>
<P>
   But an examination by the commission's Office of Compliance,
Inspections and Examinations of 75 brokerage firms and 280
investment advisers found that 28 percent of investment advisers
and 35 percent of brokerage firms provided or received items
outside the safe harbor.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 firms, or 7 percent of the investment advisers
surveyed, engaged in ``egregious fraud'' by siphoning off
soft-dollar money for undisclosed uses, said Lori Richards,
director of the compliance office.
</P>
<P>
   Under the quirks of securities laws, trading soft dollars for
questionable goods or services is generally not illegal as long as
there is full disclosure to investment clients. But the commission
found that almost none of the 28 percent of advisers who received
questionable goods made adequate disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, only half the advisers examined described their
soft-dollar practices in sufficient detail to allow their
investment clients to understand what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   The use of soft dollars ``is predicated on disclosure to the
client,'' Ms. Richards said, adding, ``But the disclosure is pretty
inadequate.'' At some firms, the people responsible for drawing up
the disclosures were not aware of the soft-dollar deals being made
by the firm's investment managers or other employees, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the questionable uses of soft dollars were as blatant
as buying theater tickets. Others included paying a consultant to
design a Web site and renting a Bloomberg machine for the marketing
department's use. One large investment firm spent $882,000 in
client commissions to pay for 13 analyses of its own performance,
which were then used to market its services to potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommended that the commission adopt new
record-keeping and disclosure requirements for soft dollars. And
the commission's division of market regulation will seek to clarify
which types and uses of electronic equipment bought with soft
dollars conform to accepted ``research'' practices.
</P>
<P>
   But the report stopped short of calling for a ban on any of the
soft-dollar practices, and several of its recommendations were
simply that the SEC ``reiterate'' its current soft-dollar
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our goals is to make firms less likely to buy items
that are outside the safe harbor by increasing their disclosure
burden,'' Ms. Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   That cautious approach angered some critics. Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., the ranking minority member of the House Commerce
Committee, said in a statement that the SEC's recommendations for
addressing the problems exposed by its report ``fall woefully
short.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The SEC has found serious, and in the case of disclosure,
widespread violations and problems in what are known as soft-dollar
practices,'' said Dingell, who previously urged the SEC to examine
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best and strongest recommendation is for better
record-keeping, but this requirement should have been on the books
long ago,'' Dingell said. ``The rest of the commission's
recommendations amount to stern _ and unenforceable _ lectures.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the commission adopts any new rules concerning disclosure
or other soft-dollar restrictions, it must put the proposals up for
public comment. Therefore, some investment and brokerage firms
might soon get a chance to directly comment on the commission's
findings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some industry groups, like the Association for Investment
Management and Research, have already urged their members to
disclose more about their soft-dollar practices. Linda Rittenhouse,
the association's vice president for regulatory affairs, said that
several big investment advisers, including a handful of mutual-fund
companies, objected that some of its recommendations were
``burdensome and overbearing.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC proposals outlined ``are very much in keeping with what
we recommended,'' Ms. Rittenhouse said. ``But I think we haven't
heard the last word from the SEC'' on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the SEC, said in an
interview that the line between good and bad soft-dollar practices
``is much too narrow to suit me.'' He added that he did not believe
that soft dollars could be eliminated altogether, but said, ``I
believe better disclosure and close enforcement attention is a step
in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   One group that emerged from the report looking particularly
clean was the mutual-fund industry. Gene Gohlke, associate director
of the compliance office, said that the examinations found no
mutual-fund firms that had used soft dollars to buy products or
services outside the safe-harbor provisions.
</P>
<P>
   But some fund companies could do a better job of disclosing
their soft-dollar practices, particularly to the funds' boards of
directors, Ms. Richards said.

GAME MAKER COOPERATES WITH SEC PROBE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ AirTouch Communications has the best cellular
service in greater Los Angeles and L.A. Cellular the worst,
according to a survey by consumer research specialist J.D. Power
and Associates.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its annual U.S. wireless customer satisfaction study
released Tuesday, J.D. Power asked 10,249 households in 22 markets
across the country to rate their wireless providers on call
quality, pricing, billing options, customer service and other
categories. The study included results only on providers that hold
10 percent or more market &UR;  &LR; share in a given region. In greater &UR;  &LR; Los
Angeles, only Cerritos-based L.A. Cellular and San Francisco-based
AirTouch qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Based on scores given the two companies by local respondents,
AirTouch scored 101, while L.A. Cellular garnered an 85, making it
the worst performer not only in L.A. but in all of the markets
studied.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, L.A. Cellular thought the results were skewed.
``Our internal reports have always shown us ahead of AirTouch,
PacBell, Sprint and the others,'' said L.A. Cellular spokesman
Steve Crosby. Crosby said that a July survey by another research
group, Emerald Bay Systems Inc., found L.A. Cellular the best
service provider in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're able to retain our customers, so I don't know. Maybe
this is a study AirTouch paid for or is somehow involved in,''
Crosby said of the J.D. Power report.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Dresch, director of telecommunications market analysis at
J.D. Power, said the study was independently conducted and
financed.

BILL CRATTY, 47, CHOREOGRAPHER AND DANCER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Cratty, a choreographer and dancer with the Jose Limon
Dance Company, died on Sept. 9 at his home in London. He was 47.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver cancer, said Trader Selkirk, Cratty's
companion.
</P>
<P>
   Cratty was ``a very pure and concentrated dancer'' with
``integrity of gesture,'' Anna Kisselgoff wrote in 1987 in The New
York Times. Ms. Kisselgoff added: ``Unlike so many others, he knows
how to tell a story and create a character portrait.''
</P>
<P>
   Cratty performed for eight years with the Limon company,
achieving the rank of soloist, during the late '70s and early '80s.
He also danced with Mikhail Baryshnikov's White Oak Project and
appeared in ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway.'' He taught dance at
various colleges. In 1994, he moved to London, where he was
director of Transitions, a troupe affiliated with the Laban Center.
</P>
<P>
   He began choreographing in 1981 and directed his own company,
the Bill Cratty Dance Theater, from 1981 through 1988. His first
piece, ``The Kitchen Table,'' was probably his best-known,
chronicling a family's robotlike preparation of a meal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Selkirk, Cratty is survived by his parents,
Robert and Dorothy, of Cleveland, and two brothers, Scott, of
Cleveland, and Robert, of Boston.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans vowed on Tuesday to press
ahead with their consideration of an impeachment inquiry even
though the broadcast of President Clinton's grand jury testimony
about Monica Lewinsky did nothing to shake his national standing,
and may even have strengthened it.
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing that Clinton's job approval ratings had gone
up after the release of his videotaped testimony, White House aides
sent strong signals that the president would accept some kind of
censure, and possibly a fine, to end the threat of impeachment. But
Republicans in both the House and the Senate flatly rejected the
idea of a deal as premature, preferring to see the outcome of the
November elections and whether the Whitewater independent counsel,
Kenneth Starr, will follow up with indictments.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the video's release, members of both parties
now consider it inevitable that the House Judiciary Committee will
quickly recommend a full impeachment inquiry. Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., who is chairman of the committee, said on Tuesday that if
the House voted for an inquiry he would like to open hearings
shortly after the midterm election.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde waved off discussion of some lesser punishment for the
president as ``very premature to talk about,'' and indicated that
such negotiations could come only if the House decided to impeach
the president and try him before the Senate. ``That's a decision,
if it ever gets there, for the Senate to make,'' he said. ``But
we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Republicans also widely dismissed any effort to
short-circuit an impeachment inquiry. ''We have a constitutional
process to follow,'' said Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the
majority whip. ``I don't think you should say, `Well, here is what
we decided should be the outcome _ it should be impeachment, it
should be censure, it should be reprimand, it should be nothing.' I
don't think we should guess what the solution should be and then
work to build it.''
</P>
<P>
   With manuevering intensifying in Congress, the White House
opened a new counterattack against Starr. Having seen the 3,200
pages of documentation made public by the House Judiciary
Committee, the president's lawyers accused the independent counsel
of distorting the evidence against Clinton in his report citing 11
possibly impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the House Judiciary Committee, David Kendall,
Clinton's private lawyer, and Charles F.C. Ruff, the White House
counsel, said Starr ``ignored all reasonable standards of
fairness'' and left out evidence that supports the President.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry, the White House press secretary, cited the
exclusion of Ms. Lewinsky's statement to a grand jury that ``no one
ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job for my
silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the charges, Hyde said, ``My staff tells me that's
just not so,'' but added that ``we welcome any correspondence''
from White House lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Republican dismissal of any deal, the White House and
prominent Democrats also worked feverishly behind the scenes to
craft a punishment for Clinton short of impeachment that could have
appeal within their own party and to respected Republicans outside
Capitol Hill. Over the weekend, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., suggested
that Clinton should testify before the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said on Tuesday that he would welcome an appearance by
Clinton before his committee, but said the ``orderly procedure''
would be for the president to appear after a formal impeachment
inquiry had begun. Sen. Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader,
said he was not certain he would recommend that the president take
such a course. ''I have questions about the kind of fair hearing he
would get,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia and Rep. Dick Gephardt of
Missouri, the House minority leaer, were to meet on Wednesday with
the leaders of the House Judiciary Committee to discuss the next
steps in the Clinton investigation. The deliberations have become
increasingly partisan since the House voted 363-63 to make public
Starr's report, with Democrats accusing the Republicans of seeking
to embarrass the president.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the broadcast of Clinton's testimony before the grand jury,
showing a president ranging from contrite to argumentative, furious
to crestfallen, seemed in fact to strengthen the president.
</P>
<P>
   Polling conducted by Gallup for CNN and US Today showed a
six-point jump in Clinton's job approval rating, to 66 percent,
after the broadcast, compared with 60 percent on Sunday. And CBS
News found that since the telecast, 68 percent of those polled
approved of the way Clinton was doing his job, up from 59 percent
since the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the job approval numbers, however, the public was still
divided over Clinton's trustworthiness, and a majority of those
polled still believe that he lied under oath about his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress also saw the volatility of public opinion in
their own phone calls from constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, said that on Thursday and Friday,
phone calls to his office were ``as heavy as I'd ever seen it'' and
running 8 to 1 against the president. But on Tuesday, he said the
calls became ``much more favorable'' to the president. ``It was
significantly changed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said he thought little had
changed. ``People who thought the president was a liar felt
vindicated,'' he said. ``People who felt he was being picked on
felt vindicated. And people who hadn't made up their minds were
bored out of their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, one Republican took to the Senate floor on Tuesday to
warn his party against even the appearance of partisanship or a
rush to judgment. ``I think it's very important that there be a
real effort on the part of Republicans _ because we Republicans are
in control _ to not press for every bit of advantage,'' warned Sen.
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans fended off any talk of an early deal with the
president, they moved forward with a timetable that would set a
House vote on whether to open an impeachment inquiry for early
October. Impeachment hearings would then be put off until after the
election.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists said the delay would allow their party to
move cautiously before the election _ neither turning off their own
conservative base by being too easy on the president nor appearing
to be too harsh. Because of Clinton's troubles, Republicans are now
expecting to increase their majorities in both the House and the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican House member who is closely monitoring the
elections said that the volatility of the public mood argued for
caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is in unchartered waters waiting for the fog to lift
and figure out where they are,'' he said, speaking on condition
that he not be identified. ``No one is willing to make a deal until
they know where they stand. The polls are meaningless. The
president's support is a fraction of an inch deep. Every number
besides his favorable rating is ominous for Democrats. And
Republicans know that misplaying their hand is dangerous too.
Everyone's in a state of suspended animation.''

 &HT;    Neagle content for now to sit, rest ailing shoulder
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ If the parade seems to be passing Denny Neagle by, he'll
just catch up later. His left shoulder is still causing some
discomfort, and given how the rotation has managed, with him making
only two September starts, the left-hander welcomes the extended
rest.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle will work in relief during one of the weekend games with
the New York Mets, at his discretion, in his last tune-up before
the playoffs. He is not 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing is, where I got the (cortisone) injection
(Sept. 8), that feels fine,'' he said. ``But now I'm hurting in the
back (of the shoulder) again. It just keeps spreading back and
forth. That's the thing about bursitis, though. The bursa sac
covers that whole area, so it moves around a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Neagle has pitched just 12 innings this month _ a Sept .1
victory over Houston and Thursday's victory over Arizona that gave
the club five 15-game winners. Although he was originally scheduled
to make a final start against the Marlins tonight, manager Bobby
Cox scrambled the rotation for the final week, bringing Kevin
Millwood back from the bullpen to work Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   That has allowed Neagle's shoulder to dictate when he works
next. With him relegated to the bullpen for the first round of the
playoffs, the Braves should not have to push to get him to the
mound until the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I'd be grinding hard (in the last start), trying to get
that 15th win, and that probably put a little more stress on it,''
Neagle said. ``It's not something I'm real concerned about, and
with the way it's all set up now, it feels like a weight's been
taken off my shoulders, so to speak. Now I can pick when I'm going
to throw here in the last few games.''
</P>
<P>
   Up the middle
</P>
<P>
   With seven starts between them in the first 20 games of
September, second baseman Keith Lockhart (strained right hamstring)
and shortstop Walt Weiss (strained left quadriceps) are taking
their own routes to the playoffs. Both will be tested this weekend
to determine if they should be included on the postseason roster.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart has stepped up his physical regimen to see just what
his hamstring will allow him to do. Beyond light jogging and taking
infield practice, he has done little in the last 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to take it easy,'' he said. ``If I go and do it
again, it's not like, well, you're 60 percent; it's like, your
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, because he has aggravated his quad injury as many as 10
times this year, does not need to experiment with his mobility. He
is just reserving himself for October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect it to be perfect,'' said Weiss, who first
developed the problem in late May. ``In the postseason, you just go
as hard as you can for as long as you can, and you hope it holds
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.

   With six games to play, the Marlins have drawn 733,090 fewer
fans at Pro Player Stadium this season, a drop-off of 30 percent. .
. . There have been 11 20-win seasons recorded in the National
League the past eight years. Seven of those belong to Atlanta
Braves, and four of those seven belong to Tom Glavine. . . .
Braves' first baseman Greg Colbrunn entered the Florida series with
seven hits, including two doubles, in his last 14 at-bats and four
RBIs.

 &HT;    Braves on deck: Florida Marlins

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ When: 7:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   _ TV: Fox Sports South.
</P>
<P>
   _ Probable starting pitchers: RHP John Smoltz (16-3, 2.99; 7-2,
3.32 lifetime vs. Marlins) vs. LHP Kirt Ojala (2-6, 3.93; 1-1, 4.50
lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   _ Notes: Smoltz will start, but he won't last much beyond the
third or fourth inning. With the playoffs only six or seven days
off _ depending on site and opponent _ Smoltz is interested only in
a tune-up. Then, he'll let his right elbow rest until the
postseason. He's got hardly anything left to prove, anyway, after
posting an 11-1 record in the second half with a 2.41 ERA. He might
have added another victory if not for his dubious ejection in
Cincinnati on July 29 in a game the Braves eventually won 11-5. He
has faced the Marlins twice this year and beaten them both times,
allowing four runs in 13 innings with 16 strikeouts. Ojala presents
an old challenge for the Braves _ a rookie left-hander. But they
treated him rudely in his first and only start against Atlanta on
Sept. 11 at Turner Field. Ojala gave up five earned runs in four
innings. Gerald Williams' third-inning grand slam was the big blow
in an 8-2 Atlanta victory. Ojala is 1-6 as a starter but deserves
better. He has allowed two or fewer runs in six of his 11 starts,
but the Marlins have scored three or fewer in six of his starts.

PHOTOGRAPHERS MOVE FORWARD INTO THE PAST  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 27) 
</HEADLINE>

magazine.

 By LYLE REXER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The photographer Jerry Spagnoli remembers the first
daguerreotype he bought, in a flea market. The image of two girls
seemed to hover over the tarnished silver plate, and the play of
surfaces seemed to capture the vitality of the living subject.
</P>
<P>
   An antiquated process revealed expressive possibilities he
hadn't imagined. He has spent two decades since then exploring
them.
</P>
<P>
   When Jayne Hinds Bidaut saw her first tintype, she was so struck
by its rich creamy tone that she could scarcely believe this
photographic process had been abandoned. She set out to revive it.
For the photographer Dan Estabrook, old albumen prints and tintypes
inspired a fantasy. He imagines planting the ones he makes in flea
markets and antique shops, to be discovered as ``originals'' from a
bygone time that never existed.
</P>
<P>
   On the verge of a filmless, digital revolution, photography is
moving forward into its past. Photographers are polishing
daguerreotype plates, coating paper with egg whites, transforming
entire trailers into pinhole cameras and mixing emulsions from
19th-century recipes in order to coax new expressive effects from
old photographic techniques.
</P>
<P>
   So diverse are the artists returning to photography's roots that
the movement is more like a groundswell.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Fuss has rediscovered the pinhole camera and the photogram,
the cameraless photograph made famous by Man Ray. John Dugdale has
given up standard photography to make only blue-toned prints called
cyanotypes, from the simplest developing process. Stephen Sack has
scoured the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris for stereopticon
images, an early version of 3-D, which he joins together and
rephotographs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best known antiquarian explorers is Joel Peter
Witkin, whose spotty silver prints of staged tableaux, often
involving fantastically masked figures, link photography and the
discovery of the unconscious in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the Smithsonian Institution, the Oakland Museum and
most recently the J. Paul Getty Museum have all mounted major
exhibitions of daguerreotypes, images captured directly on a
silver-surfaced plate. The Getty exhibition ``The Silver Canvas''
demonstrated the range of this early art and hinted at why it is
making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back at these pioneers, today's artists see a way to
restore expression and emotion to an art beguiled by technology,''
says Weston Naef, curator of photography at the Getty. Sarah
Morthland, whose gallery exhibition ``Inventors and Alchemists'' in
May brought together the work of several contemporary artists
exploring old processes, adds: ``They share an attachment to the
photograph as a made thing, rather than as pure image or social
document. They want to hold fast to the art of photography.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the artists have highly personal reasons for choosing
particular processes. When Dugdale, a successful fashion
photographer, lost most of his sight as a result of AIDS, a
large-format camera was the only kind he could manipulate.
</P>
<P>
   To print, he chose the most direct process available: paper
coated with a solution of iron that could be exposed in sunlight
and washed with tap water. The result is a blue-tinted image called
a cyanotype. Fortuitous though it might be, the overall hue lends a
profoundly elegiac quality to his still lifes and portraits of
friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bidaut, whose exhibition opens on Oct. 17th at the
Ricco-Maresca Gallery in Manhattan and may be the first devoted to
contemporary tintypes, had been searching for a way to photograph
insects from her entomological collection. The tintype, an image
captured on a thin, coated plate of iron (there is no tin in it),
provided the detail and dimensionality she wanted. The
image-containing emulsion can often create a raised surface on the
plate. Paper prints simply seemed too flat to her. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The past provides an abundance of possibilities for artists in
search of inspiration, if they are willing to get their hands
dirty. Most of the obsolete processes were invented in the early
decades of photography, a hectically experimental period.
</P>
<P>
   The first photogram was probably made around 1802. Louis Jacques
Mande Daguerre made the first daguerreotype around 1835. Cyanotypes
appeared in 1842, the tintype in 1854. Early photographic paper was
made simply by soaking a sheet of paper in salt water and brushing
it with silver nitrate.
</P>
<P>
   When it was discovered that a mix of egg white would make the
paper more sensitive, albumen prints became state of the art. They
held that position for 40 years, until 1895, when gelatin provided
a more stable effect. Methods of taking and printing photographs
multiplied so rapidly that the United States Patent Office threw up
its hands in despair at the applications.
</P>
<P>
   France Scully Osterman and Mark Osterman, present day disciples
of the old methods, have even succeeded in printing photos on
transparent sheets of mica. The Ostermans are to old photography
what Clem Labine and the Old House Journal were to historic
preservation: repositories of arcane knowledge and keepers of the
flame. Through lectures, workshops and their Collodion Journal
(collodion is the material originally used to coat glass-plate
negatives), they have helped hundreds of amateurs and artists
decipher the chemical recipes of old manuals and appreciate the
inventiveness of photographic pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   The Ostermans, like Kenneth Nelson of Eastman Kodak, may have
succeeded too well. It is now common to see noncombatants lugging
glass-plate cameras across the fields of Civil War reenactments.
Some are selling their images as originals to rival Mathew Brady's.
</P>
<P>
   It seems a short step to the world of artists like David
McDermott and Peter McGough, who have not only adopted 19th-century
photographic methods, but dress and life style as well. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The old techniques are heavily hands-on and idiosyncratic. That
is the source of their appeal. It is also the prime reason for
their eclipse. Most became obsolete in a few decades, replaced by
others that were simpler, cheaper and faster and produced more
consistent results. Only the tintype lasted as a curiosity into the
20th century. It was cheaper and easier to view than a
daguerreotype and provided the instant gratification of a Polaroid.

 &HT;    1954: The year Joe Bauman upstaged the aliens (he hit 72)
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSWELL, N.M. _ As he watches Mark McGwire or Sammy Sosa hit
another home run on television, a smile usually appears on Joe
Bauman's wrinkled face, and his mind drifts back 44 years to when
he was briefly the talk of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only the minor leagues,'' says Bauman, organized
baseball's single-season home-run king. ``But it's still something
no one else has done.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Sosa caught and passed Babe Ruth, then Roger Maris.
But the record Bauman set on the windblown fields of the Class C
Longhorn League in 1954 appears unreachable.
</P>
<P>
   Bauman smashed 72 home runs for the Roswell Rockets in just 138
games. He also batted .400, drove in 224 runs, scored 188 and
walked 150 times.
</P>
<P>
   Life magazine and Sports Illustrated photographers recorded the
historic moment when he hit three homers in a season-ending
doubleheader, breaking the minor-league record of 69. But the most
prolific season in minor-league history didn't earn Bauman a trip
to the majors. The 6-foot-5, 245-pound first baseman was 32 and
already had given up hope of making the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, he was back at work at the Texaco service
station he had bought with his baseball savings. The San Francisco
Seals of the Pacific Coast League called, but he couldn't afford to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Soon his record was forgotten, even in Roswell _ the southeast
New Mexico town of 50,000 that has been the Oklahoma native's home
since. An alleged UFO sighting in 1947 was what everyone kept
talking about, not home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``About everyone who saw me play has either moved out of town or
is dead,'' says Bauman, 76. ``A lot of people probably thought I
died, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came McGwire's and Sosa's home-run assault. Now everyone
seems to want to talk to the man who hit 72. The total is as hard
to believe as little men from outer space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm getting more attention now than in 1954,'' Bauman
says. ``Everytime someone hits a home run, another reporter
calls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He tries to act like he doesn't want to keep talking about the
old times,'' says Bauman's wife of 56 years, Dorothy. ``But I think
he is kinda enjoying it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, there were 36 minor leagues, and the Longhorn League,
which had teams in Texas and New Mexico, was just one rung up from
the bottom among the classifications. Only one of the eight teams
was affiliated with a major-league club and aging minor-leaguers
like Bauman played side by side with raw rookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitching wasn't all that great, I'll admit that,'' Bauman
recalls. ``And the ball traveled pretty good in the high altitude.
It was definitely a hitter's league, but the wind usually blew to
left field, not right, which would have helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauman's season, however, was no fluke. He hit 50 homers for
nearby Artesia in 1952 and 53 the next year. Then he moved to
Roswell for the 1954 season, lured by a $1,000 bonus that he used
to help buy the service station and a promise of $600 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Bauman started hot and never cooled off. The left-handed hitter
put drive after drive over Fair Park Stadium's 10-foot-high wooden
fence, 329 feet from home plate down the right-field line.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the fence was a holding pen for rodeo bulls, and beyond
that the Eastern New Mexico State Fair rodeo arena. One night,
Bauman hit a shot that cleared the fence, the holding pen and
finally landed in the rodeo arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some spectators told me that,'' Bauman says. ``I couldn't see
it after it went over the fence where they kept the bulls.''
</P>
<P>
   After every trip around the bases at Fair Park, Bauman also got
to make the trip along the grandstand fence. As was the custom in
west Texas and New Mexico, fans celebrated homers by slipping
dollar bils through the holes in the chicken wire for the happy
hitter to collect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to look like Bermuda grass sticking throught the
fence,'' says Bauman, who hit 44 homers at home in 1954 and also
got a free ham for each. ``I don't think I ever got less than $40,
and sometimes a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauman would hit a league-record four homers against Sweetwater
on Aug. 31 to give him 68, then he tied the minor-league record on
Sept. 2 with a homer against Midland.
</P>
<P>
   Big Spring had the smallest park in the league, but Bauman went
without a homer there the next two games. Photographers had to
shoot from as close as possible to the batter's box in those days,
and flash bulbs went off every time Bauman swung, often blinding
the hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Only one day was left and the Rockets had a twilight
doubleheader Sept. 5 at Artesia, 43 miles south of Roswell. Many
fans missed the record-breaker, because they were either stuck in
traffic or in line to buy tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Moved to leadoff to get more at-bats, Bauman fouled off three
1-2 pitches from Cuban righthander Jose Gallardo. Then he swung his
35-inch, 34-ounce Louisville Slugger and hit a fastball over the
rightfield fence, 360 feet from home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a relief more than anything else,'' Bauman says. ``I
know it wasn't anything like Maris or McGwire must have felt, but
the pressure started to get to me. I wanted it over with.''
</P>
<P>
   After No. 70, Bauman didn't have enough hands or time to grab
all the money stuck through the screen by the crowd of 2,600.
Roswell and Artesia fans all wanted to reward the slugger.
</P>
<P>
   ``My teammates started to help me collect, then the Artesia
players joined in,'' says Bauman, a big grin engulfing his face at
the recollection. ``We still had a doubleheader to play, and the
umpires wanted to get the game moving. It must have taken us at
least 10 or 15 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauman says he can't remember exactly how much cash was
collected, but he thinks it was about $900. With the loot safely
stored in a large paper sack, Bauman hit two more homers in the
doubleheader nightcap, giving him 10 homers in the season's last
nine games and 72 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Congratulatory telegrams arrived from all over the country,
including one from Ernie Johnson, then a pitcher with the Milwaukee
Braves. Johson had been a teammate at Hartford in 1948, Bauman's
only year in the Braves' farm system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe was a gentle giant, a great guy who could hit a ball a
long way,'' Johnson says. ``But there were a lot of minor-leaguers
in those days and not many spots in the majors. A lot of good
players never really got a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Braves had purchased Bauman's contract from Little
Rock of the Southern Association for $10,000 before the 1948
season. But when he failed to make the AAA team in Milwaukee and
hit only 10 homers in part-time duty at Class A Hartford, the
Braves tried to cut his salary from $600 a month to $400 in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I could make that much selling 24-inch black shoe
strings on a street corner back home in Oklahoma City,'' says
Bauman, who refused to sign.
</P>
<P>
   After the season started, the Braves came back with an offer to
play for the Class AA Atlanta Crackers. But by then Bauman had
signed to play semi-pro ball with a team in Elk City, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd given Elk City my word that I'd play there all season and
wasn't about to go back on my word,'' Bauman says. ``I knew it
would cost me any chance to make the majors, but it was a matter of
principle. Baseball players weren't treated any better than mules
in those days.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauman, who had earlier lost four minor-league seasons while he
served in the Navy during World War II, didn't return to the minors
until 1952. He retired because of a bad ankle midway in the 1956
season at age 34 with 337 minor-league homers and a .337 career
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd really wanted to retire after 1954,'' Bauman says. ``What
was I going to do for an encore? Hit 73 homers?''
</P>
<P>
   Bauman sold his Texaco station in 1967, then worked for a beer
distributor until retiring. The exterior of the neat, gray bungalow
on West Deming Street he and his wife have lived in for more than
20 years was used when ``Unsolved Mysteries'' filmed an episode
about the Roswell UFO incident.
</P>
<P>
   Roswell hasn't had minor-league baseball since 1959, and the
grandstand at Fair Park Stadium was torn down years ago. Bauman _
who saw his only major-league game in person 50 years ago _ spends
most evenings in his favorite chair in the living room watching
baseball on cable TV. Thanks to McGwire and Sosa, he occasionally
hears his name mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball is really jazzed up,'' Bauman says. ``But McGwire and
Sosa would hit them out anyway. They've been great for baseball.
After the (1994) strike, the game was about dead. Now, everyone is
excited about baseball again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of them might finish with 68 homers. I thought 72
was out of reach. But if one of them does it sometime, I'm all for
it. I've never thought what I did should be lumped in with the
major-leaguers anyway. I've always just considered it a
minor-league record. And I don't think it will ever be broken.
That's enough for me.''

 &HT;    White making big catches
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even among 100 or so teammates and a dozen coaches,
Georgia Tech's leading receiver Dez White was a lonely young man
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   From the first day of freshman practice, college football was a
struggle, as you'd expect for a receiver who was having a hard time
catching the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking (that) if every practice is like this, I'm
not going to make it,'' White said about his first practice in a
Tech uniform.
</P>
<P>
   What most people didn't know outside the program was that White
never really played receiver in high school at the Bolles School in
Jacksonville. He was a running back whom the coaches sent deep from
time to time because he has such great speed. White was more
comfortable with a ball at his feet than in his hands. His favorite
sport growing up was soccer.
</P>
<P>
   What some of the people inside the Tech program didn't know was
that several days before he got to campus, he had injured his thumb
playing catch with his uncle Adrian Smith, a former New York Giant.
Every time he caught a pass, it hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to where I wasn't using my thumb and started dropping
everything,'' White said. ``From then on, my confidence shot down.
The frustrating thing was knowing I could catch the ball and not
being able to.''
</P>
<P>
   On top of his own frustration was that of offensive coordinator
Ralph Friedgen, not known for holding back the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I struggled with it a lot, from a respect standpoint,'' White
said. ``I felt sometimes coach Friedgen was unfair. But now I
realize all the things I did last year have helped me get to this
point. It was adjusting from a high-school coach to a college
coach.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, White was putting his hands up earlier in his
route and concentrating harder on the ball, but nothing seemed to
work.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken sophomore kept his troubles mostly to himself.
But hedid find a source of strength in Marcus Hinton of Athletes
in Action, a campus Christian organization. Several times a week,
Hinton, who played at McEachern High and Clemson, and White would
sit and chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a matter of just keeping on, not giving up,'' White
said. ``I said to myself, `Relax and it'll come.' And it has.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first couple of practices this year , White felt
different, and he played that way. Just a couple practices in, he
made a tough catch up high over two defenders and got some
re-assurance from Friedgen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Great catch,' '' White said and laughed. ``He said,
`If you can make that catch, you should make all of them.' It
wasn't much of a compliment, but you can't expect (much more of
one) from him.''
</P>
<P>
   With the departure of Harvey Middleton and Derrick Steagall,
White was projected as a starter this season, but with injuries to
Mike Sheridan and Jon Muyres in the preseason he has had to be much
more. He has responded by leading Tech with nine catches for 171
yards.
</P>
<P>
   White caught his first touchdown pass, a 24-yarder against New
Mexico State. He made one of his finest catches in that game for a
47-yard gain to move the Tech offense from deep in its territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two catches he made,'' Friedgen said, ``were big time
catches, as good as you'll see in any league.''

 &HT;    Public wary of Falcons
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It isn't entirely true that the Falcons have been
ignored in the 16 years since Leeman Bennett was fired. There were
two outbreaks of Falcon Fever, one in 1986, another in 1990. Both
went into immediate remission, and the resulting skepticism remains
the team's single biggest hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   You can offer only so many false clues before the public doubts
every move you make. In 1986, the Falcons tantalized their audience
with a 4-0 start, the linchpin of which was a rousing victory in
Dallas. (How rousing? People actually wrote songs about it.) By
Week 5, the Falcons were selling out Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium,
something they had failed to do in Dan Henning's three previous
seasons. Trouble was, the team still wasn't very good.
</P>
<P>
   The 1986 Falcons won only three more games. Quarterback David
Archer got hurt. Henning's one-back offense was revealed as a
one-trick pony. The Cowboys, foils in what seemed a watershed game,
wound up under .500 for the first time in two decades. In Week 14,
the Falcons played before only 30,397 and managed to lose to 0-13
Indianapolis on a blocked punt. For a franchise that has had few
highs, that was the abject low.
</P>
<P>
   Henning got fired, deservedly. The Falcons could find no one to
take the job _ Dick Vermeil and Terry Donahue said no _ and wound
up promoting Marion Campbell, the defensive coordinator who already
had failed once as a head coach here. When inevitably he failed
again, the Falcons had the chance to start anew. Instead they
dipped again into their past and hired Jerry Glanville.
</P>
<P>
   Glanville did one good thing: He whipped up interest. The
Falcons staged an infamous brawl against Buddy Ryan's Eagles in a
preseason scrimmage, and all of a sudden the Falcons were a hot
ticket again. But familiarity bred contempt. Even though Glanville
took his team to the playoffs in 1991, his methods had begun to
grate. He was gone two years later, replaced by his offensive
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Married to the run-and-shoot, June Jones had no chance. He
lasted three years. In 1997, the Falcons turned themselves over to
Dan Reeves, an outsider who knows his business. What should have
produced a wave of goodwill was met with raging indifference. Too
many bad moves had left the Falcons overdrawn at the bank of public
forgiveness. Almost on cue, Reeves has built a solid team that
remains distrusted in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   You hear it said that the Falcons can't be taken seriously
unless they win Sunday in San Francisco. That is wrong. They should
be taken seriously now. This is a serious team staffed by serious
players and overseen by serious coaches. Is it a Super Bowl
champion? No. Is it of playoff caliber? Maybe not yet. But it's
getting there.
</P>
<P>
   To lose in San Fran would invalidate nothing. This is not 1986
all over, a quick start built on a mirage. This is not 1990, when
unsoundness was apparent amid the tumult. This is a team that
deserves the benefit of the doubt. Alas, doubt seems overpowering.
The populace clings to its determination not to be fooled again,
even when presented with a team that is, at long last, not fooling
around.

Journal-Constitution, Atlanta, Ga.

 &HT;    Falcons' top run defense faces a test
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Atlanta Falcons defensive tackle Travis Hall flew
past Carolina right guard Corbin Lacina in the second quarter of
the season opener and dropped Panthers running back Fred Lane for a
6-yard loss, Falcons defensive coach Bill Kollar got excited.
</P>
<P>
   Kollar's had a lot to get excited about lately.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has the NFL's No. 1-ranked run defense, allowing just
58.5 yards per game, and the unit is allowing an NFL-low 2.6 yards
per carry. The longest gain has been 9 yards.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday at San Francisco, Atlanta (2-0) will place its defense
against a running game different from what it has seen. San
Francisco's Garrison Hearst is more likely to bounce outside and
has more speed than the Panthers' Lane or the Philadelphia Eagles'
Duce Staley. The 49ers (2-0) lead the NFL with 208.5 rushing yards
per game behind Hearst, who is averaging 167.5 yards.
</P>
<P>
   So when No. 1 faces No. 1, something has to give.
</P>
<P>
   There are two reasons for the Falcons' success. The Panthers are
No. 24 and Philadelphia is No. 19 in the NFL in rushing. But that
shouldn't take away from the fact that Falcons ends Chuck Smith and
Lester Archambeau, tackles Hall and Shane Dronett, and linebackers
Cornelius Bennett, Jessie Tuggle, Henri Crockett and Craig Sauer
have been very stingy against the run.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons use a scheme called ``gap control.'' The concept
calls for players to drop anchor or rush hard in a specific area
and not give that area up until the play clearly is going away from
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to end up jinxing yourself, but everybody has been
playing better gap control,'' Kollar said. ``Everybody has a better
feel for where they're supposed to be. We want to stop the run and
force the pass.''
</P>
<P>
   They have been good at that lately. The Falcons gave up 118.1
rushing yards per game the first 10 games last season. They've
given up 76 yards rushing per game in eight games since, holding
opposing running backs below 100 yards 10 times in a row. The
Falcons have won eight of those games.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times in gap defense, you'll see a guy free-lance and
jump into another gap,'' Smith said. ``But we've got respect for
where one another is going to be, and we stay put.''
</P>
<P>
   Attitude means a lot to the Falcons' undersized line. Hall is
the biggest of the Falcons defenders at 6 feet 5, 300 pounds. Smith
(6-2, 265) and Archambeau (6-4, 275) are not as big as some of
their peers, and Dronett (6-6, 295) is not huge. But Archambeau
already has 15 tackles and is tied with middle linebacker Tuggle
for second on the team behind Bennett's 18.
</P>
<P>
   And Smith is plain surly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a mentality; you have to want to play the
run,'' he said. ``A lot of guys just don't want to play the run.
Nobody wants to do the dirty work. You got to attack, run to the
ball. If you can't stop the run, your chances aren't very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Note: On Tuesday, the Falcons reached an injury settlement with
former University of Georgia rookie linebacker Brandon Tolbert, a
member of the practice squad, and waived him. Tolbert, bothered by
a hamstring injury, was a seventh-round draft choice by
Jacksonville. The Falcons probably will sign another linebacker to
the practice squad today.

 UNDATED: a Polaroid.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's artists quickly discover that to exploit the past is to
court the very uncertainty early innovators sought to banish.
</P>
<P>
   When Spagnoli clicks the shutter of a daguerreotype portrait
(demand for them is growing), he can never predict the end result.
The sitter has to hold still for a long exposure, and he uses a
special brace for the purpose. If the plate and emulsion are not
prepared exactly or the mercury-vapor fixing process is badly
timed, a pale-faced subject can appear to have fallen asleep under
a sunlamp. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such unpredictability attracted Estabrook to old processes. His
work embraces accident and employs decay in order to dramatize the
distance between spectator and image. In his view, time leaches
meaning from every photograph, renders it a lost object, enabling
us to project onto it our own sentiments and associations.
</P>
<P>
   The stains and imperfections of prints made from gum bichromate
or albumen coatings would have been cropped out by a 19th-century
photographer. Estabrook uses them to emphasize the inevitability of
decay and to heighten the sense of nostalgia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most frequent criticism of old-process photographic art is
that its techniques can be applied to any subject with equally
startling results. Yet the best of these artists choose their
subjects with extreme care. Sack, who appropriates rather than
duplicates an old process, has examined thousands of pairs of
stereopticon images to find a handful that capture for him the way
we imagine and remember places.
</P>
<P>
   Estabrook's 1997 ``Floating Cloth'' appears at first glance to
be an antique image of a pinned drapery, but a closer look reveals
the wires that suspend the cloth, evoking a magician's act and
suggesting photography's origins in a dubious illusionism. Image
and process inform each other. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the early photographers, unpredictability wasn't creative,
it was unprofitable. Given the chemicals involved, it could also be
dangerous. Spagnoli at first hesitated to make daguerreotypes
because one of the main developing agents is deadly mercury vapor.
He began only after he learned that the image could be safely
``fixed'' in a sealed container.
</P>
<P>
   A form of cyanide is another common element in old processes,
and before the danger it posed was fully recognized, many
practitioners would chew on crystals of the stuff in the course of
their work.
</P>
<P>
   The Collodion Journal regularly runs articles on photographic
poisons and their antidotes, complete with excerpts from
19th-century accounts of suicides and horrendous accidental deaths.
Silver burns were so common that collodion photography was called
``the black art.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even such chemical volatility offers the artist a subject.
Spagnoli's 1995 ``Machine for Destroying Daguerreotypes'' is a box
with a peephole containing a cherry blossom and a daguerreotype. As
the flower decays, it gives off gasses that react with the metal
plate to efface the image. It suggests that in art as in life,
beauty and permanence are incompatible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The preoccupation with contingency offers a clue to the deeper
motivations of many of the antiquarian avant-gardists. The widely
variable outcome of old techniques virtually guarantees that each
production is one of a kind and bears, on some level, the indelible
mark of the artist's encounter with a particular set of
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Like Dugdale's recording his world even after he can no longer
see it, these artists seek to present evidence for the individual
in a universe of digital simulacra.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, old methods offer the promise of recovering an
intimacy to photographic communication that mass media have all but
overwhelmed. Individual photographs still mean a lot to people.
Even when these artists play on the desire for meaning, they can't
help honoring it.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Ms. Biduat's tintypes portray classically posed and
draped nudes. She mounts them in antique cases, as they would have
been a century ago. The cases transform them from impersonal works
of art into intimate keepsakes. A few years ago, hunting for these
cases, she discovered one that had been opened so often that it was
marked by fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked myself what picture could have drawn the owner back to
it again and again,'' she says. ``That's the kind of image I want
to make.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ With no fanfare and surprisingly little mourning,
a museum that critics had extolled as Mexico's finest forum for
modern art was closed on Sunday, a victim of cost slashing at the
leading television network, Televisa.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, the Cultural Center for Contemporary Art, shut its
doors at the spartan but spacious rust-colored building where it
had offered 172 exhibitions over 12 years, including authoritative
retrospectives of Mexican artists like painter Maria Izquierdo and
photographers Manuel Alvarez Bravo and his first wife, Lola.
</P>
<P>
   The museum was created from scratch out of a collaboration
between Emilio Azcarraga Milmo, the billionaire owner of Televisa,
who died last year; his friend Robert Littman, a New Yorker who
directed the museum from its founding, and Paula Cussi, a Mexican
actress whose love affair and eventual marriage to Azcarraga lasted
2{ decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Cultural Center became a respectable stop on the
international circuit, after shows like an affectionate 1987 homage
to Leo Castelli, the New York art impresario, and a 1990 display of
Salvador Dali works from the Reina Sofia National Art Museum in
Madrid. Thriving on ample budgets from Televisa, the museum
accumulated a distinctive collection of works by young artists from
Mexico, the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Although Televisa officials said the center would continue to
operate as a museum-without-walls by lending its collection for
shows in other spaces, considerable confusion seems to surround its
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are completely unclarified to me,'' Littman said. He
said he would pack up the center's collection to store it in a
warehouse at a Televisa complex in a suburb above the capital city.
</P>
<P>
   Televisa officials have indicated that the building that housed
the museum, originally a press center for the 1984 World Cup soccer
championships, would be sold or rented for commercial purposes yet
to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   For now, only 15 works from the permanent collection, by
American artists including Edward Ruscha and Brice Marden, will be
hung in the residence of U.S. Ambassador Jeffrey Davidow. The home
is not regularly open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were few protests from Mexican artists, leaders
of Mexico's art world were appalled by Televisa's decision to close
the Cultural Center and dismiss its 120-member staff to save the
$12 million devoted to its annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a divorce where only one party makes the
decision,'' said Raquel Tibol, the longtime art critic for the
weekly magazine Proceso. ``It is an action by a private company
that fails to respect the tacit cultural agreement between a museum
and its public.''
</P>
<P>
   But Televisa officials said they could no longer afford the
Cultural Center under the austerity regimen the company adopted
after the death of Azcarraga, a strong-willed magnate known as the
Tiger, who built his family's business into one of the largest
media empires in the world. A son, Emilio Azcarraga Jean, who is
30, took over the conglomerate after his father's death.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cussi had caught the elder Azcarraga's eye in the early days
of her career at Televisa when she was reading horoscopes on the
air. Although she had no expertise in modern art or experience as a
museum curator, he made her chairwoman of the center and appointed
Littman to direct it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paula is a very smart lady and a very quick study,'' Littman
said. ``To stay with Emilio for 25 years, you have to know about
politics, art, entertainment, economics. She was very conversant,
and she spent a lot of time researching.''
</P>
<P>
   As the museum's reputation grew, Azcarraga's support became more
enthusiastic. For most of his lifetime Televisa had a monopoly
hammerlock on television in Mexico, and he was frequently
criticized for producing crass programming to appeal to the lowest
common denominator among Mexican viewers. The Cultural Center
allowed him to show that he could make a sophisticated contribution
to Mexican culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really enjoyed coming to the openings,'' Littman recalled.
``It was an important part of his life. Emilio had many
opportunities to kiss us goodbye, but he never did.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum's popularity in Mexico was established in 1988 with a
show that brought together images of the Virgin of Guadalupe,
Mexico's patroness saint. In 1990 Littman organized an exhibition
by Robert Motherwell and other artists from around the world to
illustrate essays of art criticism by Octavio Paz, the Mexican
poet.
</P>
<P>
   But relations between Ms. Cussi and the Azcarraga family cooled
after the death of the elder Azcarraga, from whom she was separated
in 1994. In August 1997 she severed her all her ties to Televisa
when she sold the company shares that he had left her in his will,
for a figure estimated in Mexican press reports at $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Initially the younger Azcarraga made a public pledge in front of
all of Televisa's employees to keep the museum open. But financial
pragmatism, in the wake of a punishing recession in 1995,
prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Gaston Melo, a Televisa vice president, said the company was not
planning to sell off the permanent collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Selling has never been the point,'' Melo said. He said
Televisa was negotiating with public universities and government
museums for shows of the collection.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's demise provoked little outcry among Mexican
artists, most of whom remain suspicious of Televisa. But its
closing leaves the cultivation of modern art in Mexico almost
entirely with government museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provided an independent focus on the visual arts,'' Littman
said. ``We didn't have to do a show because the president of Mexico
signed a peace treaty with Lower Slobovia.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tibol, the art critic, said: ``There is absolutely no one
left who can fill the void. No one even aspires to doing it. There
is a spiritual reluctance to barge into the abandoned house that
someone else built.''

ABUNDANT NATIVE MESQUITE IS A BLESSING, OR A CURSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few things have stirred rural Texans as much as the
centuries-old battle over the pesky mesquite.
</P>
<P>
   Thorny mesquite has been aggressively poisoned and uprooted by
the state's ranchers, who see it as a pasture-ruining water hog.
</P>
<P>
   But the native tree is a blessing to barbecue chefs, furniture
makers and others who appreciate the flavor that its smoke imparts
or who behold strength and beauty in its dark, rich hues.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rob Junell of San Angelo in West Texas, who says the
scrubby trees are about as endearing as ``fire ants with leaves,''
wants to spend millions to destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a group of Texas researchers, artisans and
entrepreneurs called Los Amigos del Mesquite are holding a contest
to find the state's tallest, straightest mesquite so they can use
its seed pods to grow many more.
</P>
<P>
   Junell is seeking $17 million _ $12 million from the state and
$5 million from landowners _ to remove 130 million mesquites and
100 million juniper ash trees in the 950,000-acre North Concho
watershed near his home city.
</P>
<P>
   The trees ``serve as straws sucking water'' from the watershed,
according to an executive summary of a study by the Texas A&AMP;M
Research and Extension Center, the Texas State Soil and Water
Conservation Board and the Upper Colorado River Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Clearing the trees would increase the North Concho River's
watershed stream flow fivefold, recharge underground aquifers and
make water available to West Texans at a fraction of the current
cost, the $86,000 study asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to pull up, poison and chop down the much-maligned
member of the pea family, whose genealogy dates back 50 million
years, are nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Antilley has been battling mesquite on his ranch near the
West Texas town of Winters for more than 50 years. Despite a stroke
and two bouts of surgery, he still goes out on weekends to kill
them, his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   But the anti-mesquite forces enjoy a mixed record at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas, we've had a USDA-sponsored mesquite eradication
program since the 1950s, when we had 40 million acres of
mesquite,'' said David Miller of Bastrop, whose family has ranched
in the area since the 1850s. ``After 45 years of eradicating
mesquite, we only have 55 million acres left.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of fighting mesquite, Miller decided to promote it.
</P>
<P>
   His firm, Texas Woods, is one of a dozen in the state that mills
mesquite logs into flooring tiles for homes, hotels and office
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Four times more stable than oak and twice as hard, mesquite
tiles can be laid in such non-traditional, high-moisture areas as
bathrooms, saunas and boat decks, said Miller, a Baptist minister
and former contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers once urged chainsaw crews to clear mesquite for free,
saving them the expense of doing it themselves. But Miller suggests
that ranchers collect $10 to $15 per cord.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, he said, pay cutters $150 to $300 a cord for the thicker
logs; chip makers pay a fraction of that for the rest. Processed
mesquite floor tile retails for about $7 per square foot.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas mesquite industry grosses an estimated $25 million a
year, with the bulk in the smoking chip market. But the market for
flooring and furniture is growing, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mesquite is worth $40 per ton as barbecue wood and $2,000 per
ton as a finished floor product,'' said Peter Felker, 51, a plant
physiologist for 24 years at Texas A&AMP;M University-Kingsville.
</P>
<P>
   So what's holding back mesquite?
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everything about it is expensive,'' Miller said. ``It's
hard to harvest, there's a lot of faults (imperfections) in it,
getting a clear board is difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Los Amigos researchers are trying to find taller,
straighter specimens among trees that generally are ground hugging
and gnarled, Felker said. Seed pods from the contest's winners, to
be announced Thursday in Corpus Christi, will be used to develop a
tree bred for lumber and furniture use.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said his own father-in-law laughs at the idea of paying
good money for mesquite.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, insisted Claude Watterson, 80, a fourth-generation South
Texas rancher who has struggled against mesquite encroachment for
seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's beautiful wood,'' Watterson said. ``I'd have some
mesquite flooring myself in my house if I could afford it.''

TEXAS A&AMP;M MIGHT HAVE TO FORFEIT VICTORY, OFFICIALS SAY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Texas A&AMP;M officials said yesterday that
they are conducting an investigation into the eligibility status of
fullback D'Andre Hardeman that could result in the Aggies
forfeiting a Sept. 12 victory against Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the issue, said a source with knowledge of the
inquiry, is whether Hardeman should have been declared academically
eligible under NCAA satisfactory-progress rules based on courses he
completed during summer school to regain his eligibility for this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hardeman played in the team's first two games,
questions about his eligibility arose Thursday, athletic director
Wally Groff said. A&AMP;M held Hardeman out of last week's game against
Southern Mississippi. He continues to practice with the team, but
team officials have suspended him until the matter is settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we get all the facts, I really can't elaborate on
anything,'' Groff said. ``It could be a day. It could be a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the possibility that No. 17 A&AMP;M might forfeit a 28-7
victory against Louisiana Tech in which Hardeman scored three
touchdowns, Groff said: ``I guess that's always a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M (2-1) plays host to North Texas (0-3) on Saturday, and
Hardeman will not participate in that game, A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum
said. With Hardeman sidelined, the Aggies' depth chart at fullback
shows freshman Ja'Mar Toombs as the starter backed by walk-on Will
Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum and Groff acknowledged the possibility that Hardeman, a
senior from Houston, might have played his last game for A&AMP;M but
neither considers that a foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Hardeman, who rushed for 105 yards and four touchdowns in the
team's first two games, declined to comment yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of a forfeit, players said, would not distract them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already accepted it, whether it does or doesn't
happen,'' quarterback Branndon Stewart said. ``We can still win the
South Division. We can still win the Big 12. It wouldn't be the
forfeiture of a (conference) game.''
</P>
<P>
   But dropping from 2-1 to 1-2 could affect the Aggies in national
rankings and bowl bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought has occurred to me,'' Groff said. ``But I have not
asked about any of that.''

MARKET PLACE: STARWOOD HAS LOST SOME WALL STREET LUSTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This story is now on the business front page. It replaces
FORD-EQUITY-MARKETPLACE, which has been eliminated.) 
(lb) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the past few years, Barry Sternlicht, chairman and chief
executive of Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc., has
dazzled analysts with his financial acumen, transforming what had
been a sleepy real-estate investment trust into the world's largest
hotel company.
</P>
<P>
   Sternlicht's popularity has waned a good bit on Wall Street
recently, because over the last year Starwood's shares, along with
those of other leisure-time companies, have fallen precipitously.
Yet Sternlicht, who paid $10.2 billion to buy ITT Corp. earlier
this year, has the knack of making into a good deal what
superficially looks bad for Starwood shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   To buy ITT and Westin Hotels LP _ two companies far bigger than
his own _ Sternlicht had to turn to a number of sources, some
exotic, for capital. The collateral he used in exchange for access
to that capital was Starwood stock, and his belief that its price
would continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
   The reality that its stock has lost more than 50 percent of its
value in the last year was brought home Tuesday, when Starwood
announced it was unwinding a contract known on Wall Street as a
``forward equity swap arrangement'' with UBS AG, the Swiss bank.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the contract, which Starwood negotiated with
the bank last October and was due to expire on Oct. 10, the company
said it would buy back 2.18 million shares of stock it promised to
the bank for about $130 million, or about $59.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Starwood agreed to buy the shares back by the expiration date at
the price the bank paid, plus interest, if the bank could not sell
them at a profit on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   The news did not help Starwood's stock much. The shares closed
at $32 each, down 12.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   When he borrowed the $130 million, Sternlicht was effectively
gambling that he would never have to issue so many shares to the
bank, because he thought that over the course of the next 12 months
the price of Starwood shares would continue to rise. Given his
reputation, that view was held by a number of analysts on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a number of real-estate investment trust stocks were so
hot last year that some REITs, including Patriot American and
Crescent Financial, struck similar deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were big for a while,'' said Jason Ader, an analyst at
Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. ``They offered REITs a way to access capital to
grow their business without much effort. They were almost making a
bet that the price of the stock would go up.''
</P>
<P>
   The UBS transaction was not the only equity swap deal Sternlicht
negotiated for Starwood. In February 1998, to help finance the ITT
acquisition, the company negotiated a similar deal with Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co., Lehman Brothers and NMS Services Inc. In return for
about $250 million, Starwood agreed to issue the investment banks
4.5 million shares. At the time of that deal, the stock was trading
at about $52 a share.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday, Sternlicht said that Starwood was
``evaluating the benefits of an early termination'' of that
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Since no stock was ever issued, and he is repaying the lenders
in cash, Sternlicht can legitimately be seen as borrowing money
from several investment banks, and paying interest on the money.
But analysts said that once fees were included, the borrowing was
probably not very cost-effective, and that ratings agencies might
look twice at what was once promised equity, and is now debt.
</P>
<P>
   Sternlicht was clearly hoping that a rise in Starwood's stock
price would result in the real issuance of less stock than
originally promised.
</P>
<P>
   In part, fears about an impending economic downturn have helped
to hammer Starwood's stock.
</P>
<P>
   But the company remains very optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Starwood said it had received commitments to finance
the repurchase of up to $1 billion of its shares. (The $130 million
of UBS stock it bought back Tuesday is part of that program. An
early unwinding of the Merrill Lynch agreement will presumably be
part of the program too.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe Starwood stock represents an extraordinary value,''
Sternlicht said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With assets like Sheraton Hotels, Caesars World and Westin,
people with deep pockets may well agree. A number of analysts said
Tuesday there were rumors that Starwood's sagging stock price might
make the company susceptible to an unsolicited takeover or
leveraged buyout.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Gallagher, a Starwood spokesman, declined to comment on the
rumors. But he noted that even at these depressed prices a takeover
would probably cost between $15 billion and $20 billion.

SPORTS COLUMN: HOMER RACE `LUCKY' FOR BASEBALL  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ When the baseball commissioner's office was in New
York, the former commissioners from Ford Frick to Fay Vincent had
lunch in their favorite fancy restaurants. But Tuesday Allan (Bud)
Selig, the new commissioner, drove over to where he has had lunch
for more than three decades: Gilles drive-in with a neon ``Frozen
Custard'' sign on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner usually has a hot dog, but Tuesday he ordered a
grilled cheese sandwich with his usual Diet Coke. Along with a
cheeseburger and a lemonade for his visitor, the bill was $5.63.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his black Lexus sedan, the commissioner was munching
on his sandwich when several teen-age boys, students at nearby Pope
Pius XI High School, walked by. Several said hello and one had a
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Sosa going to hit a home run tonight?'' the boy asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brewers' pitching hasn't been too good lately,'' the
commissioner said, knowing that Sosa had already hit 10 homers
against the Brewers, then he laughed. ``I can say that now.''
</P>
<P>
   He can say that now because, after nearly three decades, he is
the commissioner instead of the Brewers' owner and president.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Selig is the commissioner just when all those
home runs by Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa have done for baseball
after the 1994 World Series cancellation what all those home runs
by Babe Ruth did for baseball after the 1919 Black Sox scandal.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday night the commissioner was in County Stadium as Sosa
and the Chicago Cubs opened a two-game series here.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father always told me that to be successful, you have to be
lucky, too,'' Selig said. ``And with McGwire and Sosa we've been
lucky. Not just because of the home runs, but because of how
they've handled all this with such class and dignity and
graciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball would have been unlucky if, say, Albert Belle and Barry
Bonds, both surly and snarling, were hitting all these homers.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa hasn't even sounded resentful that Selig wasn't at Wrigley
Field a week ago Sunday, when Sosa hit two homers to tie and
surpass Roger Maris' 61 in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Sammy after that game and told him how bad I felt
that I hadn't been there,'' recalled Selig, who had been in St.
Louis when McGwire hit No. 62.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Selig was at Wrigley Field for Sammy Sosa day to
present him with a historic achievement award.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the bench before the ceremonies,'' Selig said, ``I told
Sammy, `I hope you didn't misinterpret what happened a week ago.'
And he told me: `Mr. Commissioner, don't worry. I'm not that kind
of person. I'm grateful for everything you and everybody else has
done for me.'''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Sosa, the magnets for a projected average attendance
of 2.4 million for each major league team this season, created what
Selig called a ``focus on the field'' rather than on labor strife.
It was that divisiveness that led to Selig's becoming the acting
commissioner before the owners voted him the title July 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation lived through eight work stoppages in
baseball, but the next generation can't have any stoppages,'' he
said. ``As heartbreaking as the cancellation of the 1994 World
Series was, if we can avert that again in 2001, and I think we can,
we will have learned a valuable lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   But can another labor dispute be averted?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it can; I have a lot of ideas I don't want to talk
about yet,'' he said. ``But there's no question that payroll is the
determinant of success. For fans, baseball is hope and faith that
your team has a chance to contend. If you remove that hope and
faith from 20 or 22 teams that can't compete in payroll, there's a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   As the owner of the small-market Brewers, Selig solved one of
the Milwaukee franchise's problems by putting together the
financing for Miller Park, which will open in 2000 with a
retractable roof and natural grass. As the acting commissioner, he
had a reputation for quietly being able to persuade owners to solve
bitter problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Fetzer, the Tigers' former owner, once told me, `The best
owners and commissioners are the ones you read about the least,'''
Selig said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps with that in mind, Bud Selig intends to remain in
Milwaukee, where he has lived all his life, where he grew up
rooting for the minor league Brewers before adopting the Braves
when they moved here from Boston in 1953. He's still at his big
desk in the Brewers' tiny offices, but he'll soon move into a new
commissioner's office on Wisconsin Avenue downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be in New York half the time, too,'' he said, alluding to
Major League Baseball's headquarters on Park Avenue. ``And I want
to visit all the franchises at least once a year.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the new commissioner goes to those midtown Manhattan
restaurants where all the other commissioners had lunch, he won't
be able to get by on $5.63 for two.

LOUIS P. MARTINI, 79, LEADING FIGURE IN CALIFORNIA WINE BUSINESS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Louis P. Martini, a leading figure in the California wine
business and chairman of the Louis M. Martini Winery in Napa
Valley, died Monday at his home in St. Helena, Calif. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   The Martini family has been involved in the California wine
industry for more than 70 years. Martini's father, Louis M.
Martini, founded the family winery as the L.M. Martini Grape
Products Co. in 1922 in Kingsburg, near Fresno. The elder Martini,
who never thought of Prohibition as anything more than a temporary
aberration, began planning the expansion of his business while
other wine companies were closing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, he moved to the Napa Valley and changed the company's
name to the Louis M. Martini Winery.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Peter Martini was born in Livermore and grew up in
Kingsburg, working in the winery and in the vineyards as a boy. He
graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 1941 and
spent four years in the Army Air Forces during World War II. He
joined the winery as vice president in 1946 and became the
winemaker in 1954; wines he made in the 1950s and '60s are still
prized by collectors.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 4 inches, Martini was a gentle giant, who worked in
the shadow of his flamboyant father until the elder Martini's death
in 1974. To an extent, the son's self-effacing nature is reflected
in the winery's reputation. While he was a major producer of fine
wine and an important behind-the-scenes industry leader, Martini
avoided the well-publicized social side of Napa Valley life, and
his winery rarely appeared in trendy articles about the wine
business.
</P>
<P>
   But his achievements were numerous. In the '50s and '60s, he
helped improve grape quality by identifying and propagating
superior grape clones. He developed vineyards in the Carneros
district of the valley when it was considered useful only for
grazing sheep, and he is credited with making the first Carneros
varietal pinot noir in 1952. Today, many of the best California
pinot noirs come from Carneros. Martini also made the first
varietal merlot wine in the United States with his merlot blend of
1968 to 1970. And he was a pioneer in the use of mechanical grape
harvesting.
</P>
<P>
   From 1968 to 1985, he was president and general manager of the
winery, which remains in family hands. His daughter Carolyn is
president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Martini was a founder and former chairman of the Wine Institute
and a charter member of the American Society of Enologists.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving, besides his daughter, are his wife, Elizabeth
Martinelli Martini; two sons, Michael, of St. Helena, the current
Martini winemaker, and Peter, of Seattle; another daughter,
Patricia, of San Francisco; and four grandchildren.

UAL NAMES NEW PRESIDENT IN WAKE OF UNIONS' ACTIONS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill.)  (jw) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   United Airlines' parent company, the UAL Corp., named James
Goodwin, a longtime senior executive, as its new president and
chief operating officer on Tuesday, only a few days after his
predecessor was forced out by the carrier's powerful unions.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment immediately vaulted Goodwin, 54, into the race
to succeed Gerald Greenwald, United's chairman and chief executive,
whose five-year employment contract expires next summer.
</P>
<P>
   But Goodwin's accession is hardly guaranteed. United's board of
directors, scheduled to meet Wednesday in Buenos Aires, has formed
a committee to search outside the company for a new chief executive
and it is not even clear that Greenwald himself would stay on if
asked.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden change in executives presages a period of increasing
uncertainty at United, the country's largest airline as well as the
largest company in which employees hold majority ownership.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 employee stock ownership plan, under which workers
received 55 percent of United's stock in exchange for wage
concessions, expires in 2000 and the company must decide whether to
renew it. The same year, United must also negotiate new contracts
with the International Association of Machinists and the Air Line
Pilots Association, its most influential unions.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the carrier's 19,000 reservation agents voted to
affiliate with the machinists in the most successful union
organizing drive in two decades. They, too, will need a contract.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin, who was not available for comment, was most recently
senior vice president in charge of North America, one of several
jobs he has held since joining as an accountant in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim has worked in virtually every aspect of our business and
we are indeed fortunate to have him as our president,'' Greenwald
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his long tenure at United, Goodwin is not well known in
the industry. An executive at the carrier who requested anonymity
described him as a strong operational manager who commands wide
respect within the airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he speaks, everyone listens,'' the executive said. ``He
has sort of been the inside guy running the airline for many, many
years.''
</P>
<P>
   And Goodwin appears to have the respect of the unions. ``Our
relations with him in the past have been very positive,'' Kathy
White, a spokeswoman for the pilots' association, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   He succeeds John Edwardson, an industry outsider who joined
United in 1994 from the Ameritech Corp. The company had been
grooming him to succeed Greenwald. But Edwardson grew increasingly
unpopular with the pilots' and the machinists' unions, which each
have one seat on United's 12-person board.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned on Friday after it became clear that the two unions
would not support his elevation to chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought he was a breath of fresh air and he turned out to
be a real disappointment,'' said Karen Asuncion, a United ramp
worker and president of machinists local lodge 1487 near Chicago's
O'Hare Airport.
</P>
<P>
   While Greenwald has a reputation for fairness and is widely
liked by workers, she said, Edwardson was viewed as biased.
``Edwardson always backed management even if the facts leaned
heavily toward the employees,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers praised Goodwin's appointment precisely
because he is an insider.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear was that they would go out and hire some marquee name
who would make Wall Street feel all warm and fuzzy,'' said Mike
Boyd, an airline consultant based in Evergreen, Colo. ``Instead
they picked someone who knows the difference between the smell of
Chanel No. 5 and jet fuel. That is very good because there are a
whole slew of issues facing the airline and they need someone who
doesn't have to have a learning curve.''
</P>
<P>
   Julius Maldutis, a Wall Street airline industry analyst at CIBC
Oppenheimer in New York, agreed. ``He knows all the people and can
calm the ruffled feathers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Goodwin can impress the board that he has enough
breadth and charisma to succeed Greenwald is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Riding four years of record earnings since 1994, airline stocks
have been some of the best performers in recent years. But the
share price of United, which has the largest global network of any
domestic carrier, has lagged behind those of its major competitors.
Some analysts believe investors are wary of the stock because the
Chicago-based company is employee-owned.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, United stock was not hurt by Edwardson's ouster. Rather it
has rallied in recent days, closing Tuesday at $70.25 a share, up
$2 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   United also said that Christopher Bowers, who has been running
its international operations, would succeed Goodwin as senior vice
president for North America.

AUTOPSY ON GRIFFITH-JOYNER CONTINUES INTO SECOND DAY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Authorities continued performing an autopsy Tuesday to try to
determine the cause of death of the 1988 Olympic sprint champion,
Florence Griffith Joyner, who did not wake from her sleep on Monday
morning at her home in Mission Viejo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Rivera, a spokesman for the Orange County coroner's
office, said that it was not uncommon for an autopsy to extend into
a second day and that toxicology tests are routinely performed in a
case of sudden or unknown death. The results of the autopsy may not
be known for several days or several weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Kersee, who coached Griffith Joyner and was related to her
by marriage, said at a news conference in Los Angeles Tuesday that
an initial autopsy did not determine the cause of death and that a
more extensive autopsy was being performed.
</P>
<P>
   Kersee also backed away from a statement issued by a family
spokesman on Monday that Griffith Joyner was believed to have died
from a heart seizure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no idea why Florence left us,'' said Kersee, who is
married to the track star Jackie Joyner-Kersee, whose brother, Al
Joyner, was married to Griffith Joyner.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner had suffered a seizure two years ago while on a
flight from California to St. Louis, Kersee said, and was taken to
Barnes Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, where she underwent several
tests. The doctors could not find anything wrong, and Griffith
Joyner was released the next day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Cooper, a hospital spokesman, confirmed that Griffith
Joyner had been treated, but added that ``her stay here was not
related to any cardiac event or problem.'' He said he had no
further information about Griffith Joyner's symptoms or treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Kersee said that Griffith Joyner had suffered from
exercise-induced asthma and migraine headaches, but not from heart
problems. She reported being a ``little tired'' on Sunday night, he
said, but added that ``there were no signs whatsoever that Florence
was ill.'' He called her death a shock.
</P>
<P>
   Because the autopsy report has not yet been issued, and because
there is only scant public knowledge of the medical history of
Griffith Joyner and her family, doctors not involved in the case
cautioned that it was premature to draw any conclusions about the
cause of her death. They stressed that she could have had heart
disease that had no connection to her past as an athlete, or that
she could have died from some other cause, such as an aneurysm.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also said that rhythmic abnormalities in her heart could
have caused electrical problems that would not be evident upon
autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-eight years old is a premature death, but the fact that
one is an athlete doesn't make an individual immune from all the
other ailments that befall mankind,'' said Dr. Gary Wadler, an
internist and sports medicine expert who is an associate professor
at the New York University School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Sudden death affects 200,000 to 400,000 Americans each year,
according to a 1994 study published in the Journal of the American
College of Cardiology.
</P>
<P>
   Studies of athletes who die of cardiovascular reasons during
exercise have generally shown that younger athletes tend to die
from structural problems of the heart, cardiologists said Tuesday.
The most common cause is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a thickening
or enlargement of the heart muscle. Older athletes who die during
exercise are more likely to have coronary artery disease, such as a
narrowing of the arteries, cardiologists said.
</P>
<P>
   At 38, Griffith Joyner was in the middle range between young and
old. And she died during her sleep, not during exercise. However,
the causes of sudden death for athletes who are not exercising are
``not dissimilar'' to the causes for athletes who die during
exercise, said Dr. Steven Van Camp, a San Diego cardiologist who
conducted a 10-year study of exercise-related deaths among high
school and college athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would anticipate a structural abnormality would be found in
the autopsy,'' Van Camp said of Griffith Joyner, basing his opinion
on early reports that heart problems were suspected in her death.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Thompson, a cardiologist who is president of the
American College of Sports Medicine and director of preventive
cardiology at Hartford (Conn.) Hospital, said he thought that
scarring would be found in Griffith Joyner's heart muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, where did she get it?'' he said. ``Was it
from an old heart attack? A burned-out viral infection? Sometimes
you never settle the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Because her record-setting performances at 100 and 200 meters
were so stunning, Griffith Joyner faced rumors and accusations from
competitors that she had used such performance-enhancing drugs as
steroids and human growth hormone. But she did not fail any drug
tests, she denied using drugs, and there is no evidence that she
did.
</P>
<P>
   Kersee dismissed such talk Tuesday as jealousy on the part of
other athletes. ``In the sports world, unfortunately, athletes and
organizations play the role of tarnishing people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors cautioned that there is only theoretical evidence, not
proof, that steroid use can increase the risk of heart disease by
reducing the so-called good cholesterol, and by making an athlete
more susceptible to plaque buildup and clotting in the arteries. In
the absence of long-term studies, the evidence remains anecdotal
and the scientific link remains tenuous, doctors stressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not convinced that anabolic steroids increase the risk of
cardiac disease,'' Thompson said. The harmful effects of steroid
use may be accentuated more in women than men, he said, but he
added: ``I think a connection to steroid use is impossible to
prove. There are some theoretical connections, but the smoking gun
is not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Camp said that while it was important to recognize the
significant health risks posed by steroids, Griffith Joyner
``doesn't fit the profile of someone having heart problems related
to drug use, which would most likely be seen during acute use or
long-term use by a man because of increased susceptibility to
coronary heart disease.''

   NEW YORK _ There's a Victorian house on a cul-de-sac in Staten
Island that looks a little different from its neighbors. Flanking
the walkway to the front porch are two eyeballs the size of
cantaloupes, and where a picket fence used to be, there is a
sculptural gateway of rusted iron, a dangling wooden sphere and a
shiny aluminum circle. ``Welcome to the Abstract Ranch,'' said
Vernon Reid, the guitarist and composer who lives and works there.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, 40, is one of New York's best-connected musicians. He is
doubtless the only player versatile and personable enough to have
made music with Keith Richards, Public Enemy, Santana, Hootie and
the Blowfish, Bill Frisell and John Zorn. ``He's always doing a
million and three things,'' said the singer D.K. Dyson, who is
writing songs with him. In a typical week, Reid juggles
songwriting, recording sessions and rehearsals; Wednesday, Friday
and Saturday he is to perform a dance score, ``Jazz Train,''
commissioned by Donald Byrd and presented by 651: An Arts Center,
at the Majestic Theater in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   In the parlor of the Abstract Ranch, presided over by a towering
painting of Jimi Hendrix, a recording session was in progress on
Thursday afternoon. Stacks of equipment formed a bunker within the
room; in its center, Reid took his place at the monitor of a
computer that was capturing the music on its hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   It was just another day of blurring musical borders. A brooding
trip-hop drone wafted from the speakers, shimmering with chords
from the electrified zither that a musician named Laraaji had set
up in one corner. Hearing the meditative tones, Ms. Dyson started
to make the Indian devotional hand gestures called mudras. Then she
sang about a woman who says she'll try anything ``just because it
feels good/just because it's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   D.J. Logic's turntable was atop some instrument cases; soon he
would add burbles and video-game noises. Leon Gruenbaum hunched
over a paint-spattered, rewired computer keyboard, a homemade
instrument he called the Samchillian Tip Tip Tip Cheeepeeeee,
improvising a bass line. Between takes, Ms. Dyson spoke up. ``I
have a question,'' she said. ``This girl is drinking whisky and
driving over a cliff. Is she going to survive?''
</P>
<P>
   Reid replied: ``Totally she will survive. Totally! Just because
she says she'll do something doesn't mean she'll do it. It's just
that she's capable of doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid has capabilities of his own. He is both virtuosic and
flexible, a guitarist who can deliver bone-crunching power chords
and delicate folky traceries, divebombing lead-guitar solos and
clenched funk chords, dissonant excursions and steadfast reggae. He
defies pigeonholes; when he picked up a visitor at the Staten
Island ferry terminal, the radio in his van was playing Hank
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never know what's going to happen next, and that's great,''
Reid said. ``I really like it when I'm able to keep all the
different things going that I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   When the 1990s began, Reid was a rock star, the founder and
leader of Living Colour. The band applied the lessons of Hendrix,
Led Zeppelin and Sly Stone to songs with titles like ``Cult of
Personality'' and ``Open Letter to a Landlord,'' and it played
arenas around the country. Living Colour won Grammy Awards for best
hard-rock performance in 1989 and 1990; now the Grammy medals hang
in Reid's living room, around the necks of a stuffed two-headed
calf.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995 Living Colour had broken up, and since then, Reid has
had a multifarious solo career. He released a mostly instrumental
album, ``Mistaken Identity'' (550 Music/Epic), in 1996. He toured
the United States and abroad with one of his bands, My Science
Project. He also went to Bamako, the capital of Mali, to produce an
album merging funk and African rhythms for the Malian singer Salif
Keita.
</P>
<P>
   Reid is on airplanes so often that he has begun to collect the
cards with safety instructions on them. ``They're so anti-esthetic
they have an esthetic all their own,'' he said. ``I think it's an
industrial art, this Dada art expression that's slipping in
completely under our noses. Duchamp would say, `That is it! The
safety card is the art of the 20th century.' All of our anxieties,
all of our fears are encoded in the safety card. I want a complete
set.''
</P>
<P>
   At a rehearsal for ``Jazz Train'' on Monday afternoon, Byrd said
that he asked Reid to write music for part of the piece because
``Vernon was going to be my radical.'' The work is in three
sections; the other two have music by the drummer Max Roach and the
pianist Geri Allen. ``Vernon has an eclectic taste and
influences,'' Byrd said, ``and I thought I was going to get
something edgy.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his other activities, Reid is organizing and booking a
month of concerts in December at Tonic on the Lower East Side. The
series may include a show by My Science Project or his other
current band, Guitar Oblique, a trio with the guitarists Elliott
Sharp and David Torn that recently finished an album.
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition of Reid's photographs _ small, driftwood-framed
vignettes of everyday Surrealism titled ``Fetishes, Moments,
Mementos'' _ is at the Fourth Street Photo Gallery in Manhattan
through Sept. 30. And Reid is writing a play, ``Waiting for Sly,''
that takes place in a recording studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studio is a crucible of complete drama,'' Reid said. ``It
can be a wonderful place to be and it can be the worst place to be.
There's the pressure of time, there's the pressure of everyone's
temperament, there are a million things that can go wrong. And it's
a place of real triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody's gotten their part right after really
struggling with it, it's a victory for everyone in the room. And
when somebody comes in and does something on the first take, it's
awesome. Or when somebody does something that's magical, and the
assistant doesn't have the machine on record ...'' He laughed.

No fancy clothes or party manners necessary: taking a break from

 NEW YORK: He laughed. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reid has seen all those things happen in a career that has never
followed a standard path. He was born in London to parents from
Montserrat; the family moved to Brooklyn when he was 2. He studied
jazz guitar with Ted Dunbar and Rodney Jones, and in the early
1980s he made his reputation as the daredevil guitarist in Ronald
Shannon Jackson's Decoding Society, playing complex and vociferous
jazz-rock.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, Reid helped start the Black Rock Coalition.
With concerts and manifestoes, the coalition set out to break down
the stereotypes facing blacks in the music business, and to remind
an increasingly segregated audience about rock's African-American
roots. Living Colour, the coalition's flagship band, blasted its
way from the club CBGB to the Lollapalooza tour. With his
blond-tipped dreadlocks shaking on MTV, Reid was a celebrity. ``I
dug the privilege of it,'' he said. ``But I always felt like, `This
is just another weird thing happening to me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Living Colour faltered when grunge took over in the mid-1990s.
And while the band dissolved, Reid's marriage was falling apart. He
now lives with Gabri Christa, a dancer and choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the breakup of Living Colour and the breakdown of my
marriage, I tried to write songs and they were these screeds, they
were just trash,'' Reid said. ``I'm really happy now, but the new
songs are all over the map. They're dealing with things that are
not sexy and cool and groovy. Gabri said, `You can't write about it
when you're in it. You can only write about it when you're out of
it, because that's when you can look at it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one song called `Afflicted,' and the first line is
`Stare at the ceiling, wasting my time about who I'm not being,'''
Reid continued. ``Sometimes it's a struggle to be not who you want
to be, not who you used to be, not who you're going to be, but just
being right where you are, who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   For Reid, that doesn't mean ruling out any options. He's
enthusiastic about a show he's planning at Tonic with the guitarist
Ernie Jackson playing the little-known music of Justin Holland, a
black 19th-century classical guitarist, along with a transcribed
hip-hop tune. At the same time, Reid wouldn't mind if one of the
songs he's recording with Ms. Dyson became a hit single. ``I like
hit singles, I like pop music,'' he said. ``And Sony Records has
shown belief in me because they haven't kicked me to the curb
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the windfall from Living Colour was lost as the result
of Reid's divorce, although royalty checks still arrive.
``Everybody stresses about money, but I manage not to allow it to
screw up what I feel about art or music,'' he added. ``If something
makes no fiscal sense _ right, I'll go there. The thing that helps
is that I really love all different kinds of music. I'm working all
the time, and I'm making it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid chooses his projects based on ``whatever seems like it's
going to be fun,'' he said. ``When you make contact with music and
make contact with the people pushing the notes forward, there's no
judgment. You connect to it. Other than that it's like an
intellectual exercise. You're trying to prove something to
somebody, you're trying to figure it out, whatever. What is it
supposed to mean, what do you symbolize, what does this moment
symbolize? But when you circumvent all that, you make real contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life is like all these little jump-cuts,'' Reid said.
``Being on stage with Carlos Santana _ I wouldn't be playing guitar
if it wasn't for hearing him. Rehearsing with Ornette Coleman,
doing `Cobra' with John Zorn, jump-cutting from that to having
Maceo Parker come out on stage with Living Colour, or just playing
a line with Buster Williams on the Geri Allen sessions. I mean, how
cool is that? Or running into Joey Ramone or Lou Reed or Laurie
Anderson and them saying, `Hey man, you want to play on my record?'
</P>
<P>
   ``All this stuff sounds like name-dropping, but really, it's
just what happened. And part of me has been very bemused by it and
weirded out by it. Because I was just a kid in Brooklyn, sitting on
his bed with a guitar in my lap, and listening to Santana records
or James Brown records or Mahavishnu records or Led Zeppelin
records, and thinking, `Wow!' And then, you know, I'm meeting Jimmy
Page. It is not lost on me, the fantastic irony of it. Now, I
basically want to be able to just keep going.''

Tuesday that he once had high hopes that his former deputy, Anwar
Ibrahim, would be his successor. But he said that ``I cannot accept
a man who is a sodomist as leader of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first public statement about the arrest on Sunday of
Anwar, the prime minister said he had interviewed men and women who
said they had had illicit sex with Anwar.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar, 51, was the designated successor to Mahathir, 72, until
he was dismissed three weeks ago. He is now being held under
special government powers intended to prevent subversion.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters, Mahathir acknowledged for the first time
that he felt that Anwar had begun to challenge his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to retire,'' he said at a news conference. ``I have
named him successor. What was the need for him to challenge me?''
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between the two men grew over the last year as
Malaysia's economy spun into crisis. Mahathir lashed out at world
financial powers, but Anwar took a more orthodox approach in line
with the prescriptions of the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   With Anwar's public stature growing, his supporters mounted a
tentative challenge to Mahathir at a congress in June of the
governing party, the United Malays National Organization.
</P>
<P>
   After his removal from office on Sept. 2, Anwar unleashed what
appeared to have been suppressed fury at his mentor, calling him
insane and senile and declaring he was not fit to lead the nation.
</P>
<P>
   One response by the government was to arrest a number of Anwar's
allies, including two men who the police said confessed while in
custody to allowing Anwar to sodomize them.
</P>
<P>
   On the day before his arrest, Anwar denied the accusation and
said his friends must have been tortured into making their
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's arrest touched off riots in Kuala Lumpur on Monday,
which were quelled by riot policemen using tear gas and water
cannon. The police said Tuesday that 132 people had been detained.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir defended the police action, saying, ``When you are
dealing with an unruly mob, a certain amount of violence has to be
used.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister asserted that rumors about Anwar's sex life
had been around for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even for me, it took me years to believe the allegations,'' he
said. ``I dismissed it as a false accusation. Subsequently I was
told again about this last year and I said it is just out of sheer
jealousy for my man who is going to be the leader of the party.''
</P>
<P>
   So, he said, he checked for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually interviewed the people he sodomized, the women that
he had sex with, the driver who brought the women to the place
where he met them,'' he said.

<P>
   MADISON, Wis. _ With spending on most American political
campaigns seemingly headed toward Pluto, the contest for U.S.
senator in Wisconsin is remarkable for its restraint, including the
almost quaint notion that most of the financial donors in a
Wisconsin election should actually live in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   For Sen. Russell Feingold, a Democrat who sponsored the
unsuccessful recent measure to curb campaign spending, it was a
matter of practicing what he preaches, or risk being called a
hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   For his Republican opponent, Rep. Mark W. Neumann, it was a
chance to underscore his conservative view that Americans can do
the right thing without mandates from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a kind of do-it-yourself reform,'' said Larry
Mackinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive
Politics, a nonpartisan research group that tracks campaign
spending. ``It's admirable. Can you imagine this happening in New
York?''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates have promised to limit donations from political
action groups to 10 percent of the total money raised; vowed that
less than 25 percent of the money raised by individual contributors
will come from out of state; imposed a spending limit of $2,000 of
the candidate's own money, and limited overall spending to $1 per
registered voter.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold, who is making the bigger sacrifice _ an incumbent
senator can be a fund-raising machine _ has promised to spend no
more than $3.8 million, less than half of what Paul Wellstone spent
on his successful 1996 Senate race in neighboring Minnesota, a
state with fewer people.
</P>
<P>
   Neumann said he would cap his spending at $4.7 million,
justifying the larger sum because Feingold was also using money
raised in his early years in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say the Wisconsin contest is the nation's
only statewide race that is sticking to such rules. A Senate
contest in Massachusetts in 1996 between Gov. William Weld, a
Republican, and John Kerry, the incumbent Democrat, produced an
agreement to limit spending. But the final weeks of that campaign,
which Kerry won, dissolved into bitter recriminations, as both
candidates exceeded the spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   Independent polls published in Wisconsin newspapers have shown
Senator Feingold with a double-digit lead. The Republican Party
says its polls show the race in a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   The rules imposed by Feingold and Neumann are more stringent
than the terms of the failed campaign finance reform bill, which
Feingold sponsored with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. That bill would
have limited lobbyist contributions to 20 percent of the total sum
a candidate raises, compared with the 10 percent limit in
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold, who describes himself as the nation's poorest senator,
with a net worth of $30,000 to $40,000, said he knew that his
advocacy of campaign finance overhaul would mean greater scrutiny
of his own money-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the self-imposed limit, he said, was the
disgust he felt at begging for money like some political
panhandler. ``It made me sick,'' he said. ``You're calling someone
you don't even know and asking them for money.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his Senate staff vehemently opposed the idea of an
incumbent forsaking the chance to raise enough money to blitz radio
and television stations with advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold, who tends to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party,
has promised not to use his franking privileges to pay for
mailings. He has also vowed not to cooperate with lobbyists raising
money for advertisements in his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   He asserts that Neumann, on the other hand, has shown little
compunction about benefiting from a windfall of advertisements paid
for with money raised by conservative groups. Feingold noted that
Neumann was running television and radio advertisements on Aug. 11,
a month before his own first commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Neumann, a favorite of such groups as the Christian Coalition
and the National Taxpayers Union, meanwhile, asserts that Feingold
has also benefited from advertisements paid for by interest groups,
pointing to spots run recently by the Sierra Club that sharply
criticized the Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these nits, the Wisconsin contest remains a model of
spending restraint, compared with campaigns in most other states.
The state was also the home of the reform-minded Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
   The state has a generally liberal political tradition, but it
has always taken a dim view of excess. Former Sen. William
Proxmire, a Democrat who left office a decade ago, was known for
his Golden Fleece Awards, which highlighted wasteful spending in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Taylor, executive director of the Alliance for Better
Campaigns in Washington, said that vowing to limit campaign
spending was well-intentioned but ``fraught with peril.''
</P>
<P>
   Limiting the money spent by candidates, Taylor said, could
``tilt the playing field to outside interests,'' like business and
union groups, whose advertisements would become even more dominant.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the efforts in Wisconsin were worthy and might show
the nation of new way of electing its leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an attractive experiment,'' Taylor said. ``The instinct
is to be applauded. But everybody ought to have their eyes open
here.'' &QL;

<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ Battered overnight by what
meteorologists describe as the strongest storm to hit this
Caribbean island in 70 years, Puerto Rico struggled Tuesday to
begin repairing at least a billion dollars in damage inflicted by
Hurricane Georges, which continued its slow march westward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a major onslaught,'' Gov. Pedro Rossello said
Tuesday morning, as the last traces of the storm were still
pounding the western coast. ``We have severe damage, impassable
roads, no power and a high probability of flooding. We are going to
have to start from zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as residents were cleaning up their homes and businesses,
Georges swept across the neighboring island of Hispaniola,
battering both the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Santo Domingo, the
Dominican capital, was largely unprepared. Forecasters had expected
the storm to hit the northern coast, but Georges changed course and
headed straight for the city of 3 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists said the storm could hit the Florida Keys by late
Thursday or early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Georges has been blamed for at least 11 deaths across the
Caribbean, including five in Puerto Rico, and the toll was expected
to rise as reports came in from isolated areas.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello described the hurricane, the eighth to strike Puerto
Rico in the past 100 years, as the worst in decades. Local
forecasters said the storm was the most powerful to strike the
island since the San Felipe hurricane of Sept. 13, 1928.
</P>
<P>
   Winds of 115 mph left the island virtually without electricity.
Nearly 80 percent of its 3.8 million residents were without water,
and many also had no telephone service, especially on the southern
coast. In the U.S. Virgin Islands just east of here, similar
problems were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Radio and television stations said that five people died _ three
in a landslide and two from heart attacks _ as the hurricane moved
across Puerto Rico Monday night and early Tuesday at 14 mph. Police
and other officials said they could not confirm the reports.
</P>
<P>
   After an inspection tour Tuesday, Rossello estimated that the
damage was at least a billion dollars. Government officials said
total damages are likely to exceed the cost of Hurricane Hugo,
which struck northeastern Puerto Rico in 1989. President Clinton
has declared both Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to be disaster
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hurricane Service in Miami said mountain ranges in
those countries were dissipating some of the storm's strength, but
warned that Georges could regain force once it gets out over the
warm open waters of the Caribbean again.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's future path remains uncertain. Meteorologists said
Georges, a dangerous category 3 storm with winds now at 120 mph,
could strike anywhere from central Cuba to the Bahamas, which along
with Turks and Caicos are already under a hurricane warning.
</P>
<P>
   According to Steve Feuer, a meteorologist with the Hurricane
Research Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, Georges is expected to leave Hispaniola by early
Wednesday morning. He said it was ``very uncertain'' if and when it
would hit Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a less than 20 percent chance at this point,'' Feuer
said. ``We have no great certainty''
</P>
<P>
   As a precautionary measure, authorities in Monroe County, Fla.,
which includes Key West and most of the Everglades, declared a
state of emergency and ordered a mandatory evacuation as of
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're an island community,'' said Mary Reich, a county
commissioner. ``We're used to these things.'' There are no
hurricane shelters in the Florida Keys, she said, and only one
highway that connects with the rest of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Georges caused extensive damage to housing and public buildings
on the eastern Caribbean islands on Sunday, with 70 percent of the
homes in St. Kitts and Nevis, the smallest country in the Western
Hemisphere, said to be affected. The storm was reported to have
killed three people there and two more in nearby Antigua and
Barbuda, as well as one in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The flow of emergency assistance was slowed because Luis Munoz
Marin International Airport here was still being cleared during the
day. American Airlines said, however, that it expects commercial
flights to resume on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, Rossello and a representative of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency made a swing through the San Juan
metropolitan area, home to about one-third of Puerto Rico's
population. Nearly everywhere they turned, they encountered scenes
of destruction and flooding.
</P>
<P>
   In San Juan, thousands of trees had toppled, taking street
lights and power and other utility lines with them, while near the
eastern suburb of Loiza, a river had overflowed its banks. Streets
were littered with debris, much of it metal signs, shutters and
awnings ripped from windows and walls by the force of the storm.
But residents were already out with brooms, carts and pickup trucks
to haul the rubble away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had had 300 people in shelters during the hurricane, but
that's going to change dramatically,'' said Victor Soto, mayor of
the San Juan suburb of Toa Baja. ``A lot of people here have lost
the roofs on their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardest-hit region was said to be the mountainous interior
of the island. There as much as 20 inches of rain fell during
Georges' slow passage across houses of wood and zinc.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was much worse than Hurricane Hugo,'' said Juan Marrero,
a resident of the San Juan suburb of Catano, which experienced
extensive flooding. ``Just in the area around where I lived, we've
got more than 30 houses that have no roof anymore. I'm all right,
thank God, except for some damage to the store I own, but those
people have lost everything.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Georges cut off cell phone and phone communication to
the south coast ``This is the worst storm that Salinas has seen in
its history,'' said the mayor of Salinas, Basilio Baerga, on
Tuesday morning, as he was trying to assess the damage to his town.
Baerga said there was at least one death in his town attributed to
Georges _ a blind man who apparently suffered a heart attack as
Georges began hitting this south coast town. He could not provide
further details.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane also damaged the town's popular harbor district
and the town's marina. ``The only thing left is the piling,'' said
67-year-old Bill Williams, who lives on a sailboat docked here.
</P>
<P>
   Many barrio residents took refuge in one of the town's municipal
shelters. ``I lost everything,'' said 46-year-old Onelia Malave of
Barrio Carmen, who rode out the storm at a shelter in the Luis
Munos Rivera school with her three children. ``We have no roof and
everything is wet.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not an easy night at the shelter, however, as heavy rains
flooded rooms, and heavy winds uprooted a huge banyan tree beside
the school. ``That tree has been there since 1925, the year the
school was built,'' said school director Lillian Torres. ``It was a
frightening night.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cayey, in the mountainous part of the island, the lush
vegetation had been turned into greenish-brown confetti by Tuesday
morning. All along highway 1, its main road, houses and businesses
were torn down or turned into twisted hulks of metal and wood.
</P>
<P>
   By 2 p.m., residents seeking to file damage claims had already
formed a long line that wrapped around the municipal stadium, which
was also damaged significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the eye passed over, it was silent. And then you could
hear it coming again. It sounded like a tractor-trailer running
down the highway, said 46-year-old Frank Vega of the storm's
approach. The storm toppled Vega's truck, filled with hay and eggs,
and sent his car sliding into a cement building. ``We got hit
bad,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A warehouse for the town's medical center was also destroyed in
the storm, along with the medicine inside it. Civil Defense
officials were evacuating residents of an old-age home which was
also damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is wet, everything is ruined,'' said Brunilda
Milian, 43, who passed the storm in her wooden home with her
husband and 10 children. The yard behind her house was filled with
the carcasses of dead poultry, which were raised commercially by
her husband. With a machete in hand, he was still trying to
calculate the extent of his loss.

A TENOR WHO KNOWS NO BOUNDS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As weeks go in the life of the ubiquitous Placido Domingo, the
next two, though cram-packed by the standards of mere mortal
performers, are not that punishing.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night the 57-year-old tenor will celebrate the 30th
anniversary, to the day, of his Metropolitan Opera debut by singing
Samson to the Dalila of the mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina in the
production of Saint-Saens' opera introduced last season. It will be
televised almost live (with a one-hour taped delay), starting at 8
p.m. on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   The next night Domingo will conduct Verdi's ``Aida.'' But at
least he is not singing and conducting on the same day, as he has
done three times at the Met, most notably on April 22, 1995, when
he sang the title role of Wagner's five-hour ``Parsifal'' for a
matinee broadcast, then went backstage, showered, had a bite to
eat, donned a tux and conducted Puccini's ``Madama Butterfly'' that
night.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two weeks, however, he is staying put, which is
rare for him, simply singing three more Samsons and conducting two
more ``Aidas.'' Only by the week of Oct. 12 does a more typically
Domingoesque schedule kick in: between two additional Samsons he
has to rush to Washington to start rehearsing the role of Loris in
Giordano's ``Fedora,'' which will open the Washington Opera's
season on Oct. 24. While there he will also attend board meetings
of the company, which, incidentally, he also serves as artistic
director.
</P>
<P>
   To date, he has sung 39 roles with the Met and conducted 6
operas, for a total, coming into this week, of 551 performances,
out of more than 2,800 in his entire career.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's not just the extent, but the quality and
consistency of his work that makes Placido Domingo one of the most
ambitious, intelligent and self-challenging artists of our time. He
was an opera superstar even before the Three Tenors made him a pop
culture icon. But in a way his immense fame masks the scope of his
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   No singer of this century has matched the range of Domingo, who
has sung more than 100 roles. What other tenor has been acclaimed
in roles as different as Aeneas in Berlioz's ``Troyens,'' which
calls for heroic French sound as well as incomparable subtlety, and
Alfredo in Verdi's ``Traviata,'' which demands classic Italianate
lyricism? Who else could have made signature statements in roles as
opposite as Offenbach's Hoffmann, which Domingo sang like a man
possessed without sacrificing French elan, and Verdi's daunting
Otello, perhaps Domingo's most renowned portrayal, to which he
brings an affecting blend of dusky vocal coloration, tempestuous
energy and plaintive expressivity?
</P>
<P>
   After all this, to have reconstituted himself in the last 15
years as an important Wagner tenor is astounding. Two seasons ago,
listening to his Siegmund in ``Die Walkure,'' it was impossible not
to think: he shouldn't be able to do this. Yet it was equally
impossible to think of another tenor right now who could do it much
better. And yet he can still sing a verismo potboiler like
``Fedora.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, there has been a down side to his pursuing such
wide-ranging repertory with such unstoppable energy. Some critics
and connoisseurs, while freely acknowledging Domingo's dedication
and vocal endowment, have found his work a bit bland. Not because
he is undramatic, but because the act of adapting his voice to so
many stylistically different roles has left him without a
distinctive vocal identity.
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, Luciano Pavarotti is Domingo's opposite.
Pavarotti has essentially confined himself to the lirico-spinto
Italian repertory, with some occasional forays into French roles of
a similar lyrical cast, most famously Tonio in Donizetti's ``Fille
du Regiment,'' after which he was dubbed the ``King of the High
Cs,'' at once a marketing ploy and God's honest truth. Sadly, in
the last 15 years, Pavarotti has been increasingly slothful and
sometimes embarrassingly unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to hear Luciano Pavarotti in his prime in a role like
Edgardo in Donizetti's ``Lucia di Lammermoor,'' Riccardo in Verdi's
``Ballo in Maschera'' or Mario in Puccini's ``Tosca'' was to hear a
voice triumphant in terms of heritage, style, lyricism and,
especially, idiomatic language.
</P>
<P>
   His was never the most insightful singing, but there was a sheer
vocal charisma that came from a sense of hearing a role as it was
ideally intended to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   With Domingo, you seldom feel that you are hearing a vocal ideal
in a role. But only purists can fail to be affected by the
intellectual curiosity that charges his portrayals, by his
expressively nuanced, rhythmically vibrant musicianship, and by the
husky, vibrant colorings of his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly,'' Domingo said recently, ``I am surprised
that, at 57, I am still singing. Many singers sing longer, I know.
But because of the amount of singing I have done, I thought my
career would be over by now. A voice is unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   He may be surprised, but he is not slowing down. This year
alone, with the Vienna State Opera, he performed his first Jean in
Meyerbeer's ``Le Prophete,'' a work famous in its day but now a
novelty, and ``sang like a prince,'' wrote the critic George W.
Loomis in The International Herald Tribune. And in March at the Met
Domingo will perform his first Russian role, Herman in
Tchaikovsky's ``Pique Dame.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's his first Russian role, he explains, if you don't
count the Simpleton in ``Boris Godunov'' and Lensky in ``Eugene
Onegin,'' both of which he sang in Hebrew in the early 1960s as a
tenor with the Israeli National Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Even his Met debut, four days ahead of schedule, was frantic.
Domingo, just 27, was to take over the role of Maurizio in Cilea's
``Adriana Lecouvreur'' from Franco Corelli. One hour before curtain
time, Corelli withdrew, complaining of hoarseness.
</P>
<P>
   A call went out to Domingo in New Jersey, who was no doubt
hoping for an evening off. All that day he had been rehearsing
``Turandot'' at the Met (covering the role of Calaf), and the night
before he had sung ``Pagliacci'' with the New York City Opera. He
showed up with four minutes to spare and ``sounded fresh and
clear,'' wrote Allen Hughes, a critic for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   How does Domingo account for his vocal and mental stamina, and
the debate about the character of his voice?
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he reflected on these matters during lunch at the
Spanish restaurant he owns on East 49th Street in Manhattan called
(and why not?) Domingo. You would think he had enough to worry
about without entering the risky restaurant business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am losing money right now,'' he said, as he urged tapas on
his interviewer. ``But I can afford to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed he can. Domingo maintains residences in New York, Los
Angeles, Washington, Acapulco, Monte Carlo, Madrid and Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Part of his longevity is due to exceptional musical
intelligence. He is a quite decent pianist, who can teach himself
roles at the keyboard. But he does a lot of learning on planes,
studying scores in silence.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the main reason he gives for his endurance is his
hard-won technique. He began his vocal career as a baritone and
still calls himself, not so jokingly, a ``baritenor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never an easy tenor,'' he said. ``I never had what you
would call a top voice without any problem. I had to create my
tessitura, really sweating and working, building it up, half-step
by half-step.'' But what was a disadvantage at first has become an
advantage of late. ``I have been able to survive crises and
difficult times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His Wagner singing represents a triumph of vocal accommodation,
which is why some devotees of German opera find Domingo's Wagner,
for all its intelligence and ardency, not authentic. ``That may be
true,'' Domingo said. ``But I will tell you I have had my greatest
successes with Wagner roles in Bayreuth.'' &QL;

   Every leading tenor character in Wagner, from Tannhauser on, is
in some way an outsider, a stranger who wanders in, or a searcher
from afar, like the questing knight Lohengrin, and the abandoned,
rootless Siegmund, and Parsifal, the confused youth befriended by
the Knights of the Grail. This seems to be the way Wagner thought
of the tenor voice. So, for some critics, including this one, the
slight Latinate tinge in Domingo's sound when he sings Wagner
actually enriches his characterizations.
</P>
<P>
   His voice is resilient, but he knows it can't last that much
longer. So he has been preparing himself for a post-singing career.
From his schedule, it would seem that he is preparing himself for
several post-singing careers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the work as artistic director of the Washington Opera,
and artistic adviser to the Los Angeles Opera, Domingo runs an
international vocal competition, whose winners have included
successful artists like Elizabeth Futral, Ainhoa Arteta and Jose
Cura.
</P>
<P>
   And of course there is his conducting. The perception persists
that major opera companies around the world, including the Met,
having benefited from Domingo's loyalty as a tenor, have, out of
gratitude and a savvy sense of box office, indulged him in his
desire to conduct.
</P>
<P>
   His work has come in for rough treatment from some critics. Even
sympathetic observers tend to agree that, though Domingo knows the
scores he conducts thoroughly, his technique is insufficiently
incisive.
</P>
<P>
   In defense, he cites his early musical training, which included
working with his parents' zarzuela company (sort of Spanish
operettas). There, even as an adolescent, he was directing the
chorus, coaching singers and conducting. Later, while a student at
the Mexican National Conservatory, he studied first piano, then
conducting (under Igor Markevitch) and only later, singing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had concentrated on conducting instead of singing, with
the same focus, I could have been an important conductor,'' he
said; ``I'm absolutely sure.'' He may be right. But this is not
what he did, and it will be hard to make up for that much lost
time.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo's training at the conservatory was cut short by his
impulsive first marriage. At 16, he ran off and married a student
two years older. Soon his first son, Pepe, was born. His parents
were ``furious, but, even more sad,'' he said. The marriage ended,
and in 1962 he met and married his present wife, Marta, a singer
who gave up her career to support his and to raise their two sons,
Placido Jr. and Alvaro.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a torrid book called ``The Private Lives of the Three
Tenors'' by Marcia Lewis (yes, that's Monica Lewinsky's mom)
alleges that Domingo's interests in women are as far-reaching as
his operatic repertory. But he has refused to discuss the book.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Right now, however, much of Domingo's nonsinging time is
directed toward the Washington Opera. When he accepted the artistic
director's post in 1966, speculation abounded that he would be a
figurehead. In fact, he has immersed himself in the work. But his
tenure began with an inherited crisis.
</P>
<P>
   A plan was in place to move the Washington Opera from its
residency at the Kennedy Center to a landmark 1902 building, the
Woodward &AMP; Lothrop department store, which was bought by the
company at a bankruptcy sale for $18 million, provided by a
longtime patron, Betty Brown Casey.
</P>
<P>
   The building would have required complete gutting and massive
reconstruction. But the advantages were a downtown Washington
location and a potentially splendid space that the company would
own. Currently, the company must share its space with other Kennedy
Center constituents, not to mention all the touring mega-musicals.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there was one sizable negative: a $200 million price tag,
minimum, for the renovation. ``It would have been cheaper to build
a completely new house,'' Domingo said.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Domingo was tactfully vague with the press when asked
about the plan. Behind the scenes, however, he persuaded his
recalcitrant company that staying put was the only viable option.
The Kennedy Center has promised to renovate the Opera House
thoroughly and give the Washington Opera more access and space.
Meanwhile, the abandoned department store gives the company a
choice parcel of downtown property to sell when it wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Domingo watched his parents try to run a company, he
has wanted to try himself. He has gotten his wish, with the
attendant headaches. But his vision is clear (for example, he
insists on doing a recent American opera each year), and he is
winning good notices.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the Three Tenors? How does Domingo rate this
unabashedly commercial endeavor beside his other work? ``What do
people want? Of course the Three Tenors is not an opera,'' he said.
``But I still dedicate most of my work each year to very serious
opera. So why do they mind if we do something wonderful that the
public enjoys, and we make money for it? What's the harm?''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of the money is a sore point. For the Three Tenors
international tour in 1996-97 (10 cities, one performance per
stop), each tenor received $10 million, not including recording and
video royalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at all the sports kids who are 16 and 17, and making a
fortune. And we with 30 years of career are not entitled to make
money? That's very cruel. I don't believe that opera companies can
pay us more than they do now, and they shouldn't. Nevertheless, we
are underpaid. Every time I sing at the Met, I fill the house. But
I am paid the same as another singer of less popularity, which is
right. That is why we do other things like concerts, and the Three
Tenors. I understand the complaints of purists. But I don't want
the purists to go to the Three Tenors.''
</P>
<P>
   He is still seeking operatic challenges. But he has finally
given up his dream of singing Wagner's Tristan onstage. Even
Domingo's accommodating voice has its limits. But he wants to
record it, and a project involving Jane Eaglen as Isolde and Zubin
Mehta as conductor is taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   He would dearly love to record both Siegmund and Siegfried in a
complete ``Ring'' cycle, even though Siegfried is another role he
will never sing onstage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He just might pull it off. But if not, Placido Domingo is
satisfied. ``I would do it all again, everything,'' he said. ``Even
the mistakes.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two agencies made acquisitions in health care and in public
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The Lowe Healthcare division of the Lowe Group unit of the
Interpublic Group of Companies acquired Grob Health and Science
Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., and renamed the agency Lowe Grob Health
and Science. Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Grob Health, with 24 employees, has billings estimated at $16
million from clients like the Boston Scientific Corp. and Medeva
PLC. Lawrence Grob, 48, president, and his wife, Ellen Touart-Grob,
44, chief operating officer, will continue to oversee the agency in
those roles.
</P>
<P>
   And Incepta Group PLC in London _ which owns agencies including
the financial and corporate communications shop Citigate
Communications and the advertising agency Citigate Albert Frank _
acquired another financial and corporate communications agency,
Dewe Rogerson Group Ltd. in London, for an estimated $40 million in
cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Incepta will combine the two public
relations and investor relations agencies to form Citigate Dewe
Rogerson. The combined shop will have 400 employees in 9 offices
around the world and fee income estimated at $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   David Wright, 54, chairman of Incepta, was named to the
additional responsibilities of overseeing Citigate Dewe Rogerson,
as chairman, while Anthony Carlisle, a director of Dewe Rogerson
and executive chairman of the London office of Dewe Rogerson, will
become an executive director of Incepta. &QL;

SUHARTO WEALTH UNDER INQUIRY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The Indonesian government has questioned
former President Suharto about his personal wealth and accusations
that he had billions of dollars in overseas bank accounts,
officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two officials leading the investigation told reporters on
Tuesday that Suharto would soon provide the attorney general's
office with a report of his wealth to help ``clarify'' news reports
that place his worth at up to $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, who resigned under pressure in May after 32 years in
office, has denied having any holdings overseas and has challenged
critics to substantiate their accusations that he amassed a fortune
through corruption and the granting of business privileges to his
family members and associates.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-hour meeting with the former president on Monday
evening at his home in central Jakarta, Attorney General Mohammad
Ghalib said the government had no plans to bring charges against
Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until there is proof, Suharto is not a suspect,'' he said.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: PHILIPPINE AIRLINES TO SHUT DOWN; HIGHER AIR FARES
EXPECTED; WORLD'S LARGEST PASSENGER SHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (Also moved in ``t'' category.) 
(lb) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barring a last-minute rescue, Philippine Airlines, Asia's oldest
scheduled carrier, will shut down at midnight Wednesday. This means
passengers who until now have flown the airline's daily nonstop
flight between Los Angeles and Manila, or the thrice-weekly nonstop
flights between San Francisco and Manila, will have to make other
arrangements. But no other arrangements from the United States will
be nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines, for example, has daily flights to Manila
from nine U.S. cities, including New York, Los Angeles and San
Francisco. But all of them connect through Tokyo, which after a
layover of about two hours requires a change of plane and an
additional four and a half hours of flying. Northwest's daily
flight from Memphis, Tenn., to Manila via Tokyo also requires a
stop and a change of plane in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   UAL's United Airlines flew nonstop between San Francisco and
Manila until Feb. 20, when it finally pulled the plug on that
unprofitable route. Now United's Manila-bound passengers have to
fly to Tokyo and connect with another airline _ as do those of
AMR's American Airlines and Delta Air Lines. Continental Airlines'
passengers can fly nonstop to Honolulu from Newark, N.J., Houston
and Los Angeles, and then connect on Continental Micronesia to
Manila after a stop in Guam.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine Airlines has been hurt by a series of strikes, by the
Asian financial crisis and by overly ambitious expansion plans that
have saddled the carrier with $2 billion in debt. ``Demand in Asia
has just dried up, and several airlines there are verging on
bankruptcy,'' said Michael Boult, director of supplier relations
for Rosenbluth International, the large business travel management
company.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbluth and other travel management companies almost never
book clients on struggling airlines, lest they fail and leave
passengers stranded. But they have no problem booking with
Singapore Airlines, Qantas Airways, Air New Zealand, ANA, Cathay
Pacific or Japan Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Boult said that the fire-sale fares offered by many
Asian carriers, in an effort to keep afloat, had led to
``aggressive corporate discounting'' of as much as 25 percent _
even by U.S. and European carriers _ for fares to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 1999 will still be rough going for the weaker Asian
carriers,'' Boult said. ``But there's no doubt in my mind that the
Asian market will rebound in the year 2000,'' although not
necessarily with all the current airlines intact.
</P>
<P>
   Prices on the Rise
</P>
<P>
   Business travelers should prepare themselves for another year of
heavy passenger loads on airlines and high occupancies in business
hotels. And, of course, higher prices for both. A preliminary study
by American Express, released Tuesday, projects an overall increase
of 5 percent to 6 percent for the cost of business travel next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The price increases will again be led by air fares, which will
rise an expected 4 percent to 5 percent, and for hotel rooms, which
will go up 7 percent to 10 percent in New York, Chicago, Los
Angeles and the 22 other top business destinations,
</P>
<P>
   The forecast numbers, based on data from American Express and
other industry sources, could change if current economic turmoil
overseas and stock market instability in the United States
translate into lower demand for business travel. As of now, though,
the company said, it is advising companies ``to brace for another
tough year with few travel bargains.''
</P>
<P>
   A Really Tall Ship
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ That behemoth looming over the New York skyline from
Pier 88 beginning Thursday will be neither an apparition nor
something out of a Japanese science fiction film. Instead, it will
be the 109,000-ton, 18-deck, $450 million Grand Princess, the
world's most expensive and biggest passenger ship _ taller than
either Niagara Falls or the Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Launched last May, the ship _ owned by Peninsular and Oriental
Steam Navigation Co. _ cruised the Mediterranean until Sept. 11,
before heading to Manhattan. The actress Olivia de Havilland will
formally christen the ship next Tuesday at 10:30 a.m.; the first
marriage in the ship's wedding chapel will be performed Friday at
10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Oct. 4, the ship _ 53 feet too wide to get through the
Panama Canal _ will begin almost eight months of seven-day
Caribbean cruises from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
COLLEGE STATION _ Texas A&AMP;M might have to forfeit its Sept. 12 win
over Louisiana Tech, pending the findings of a university
investigation into the eligibility of fullback D'Andre ``Tiki''
Hardeman.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A senior from Galena Park, Hardeman was placed on indefinite
suspension last week for unspecified reasons and will remain
sidelined Saturday when the Aggies host North Texas at Kyle Field.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before A&AMP;M beat Southern Mississippi 24-6 in
Starkville, Miss., last weekend to improve to 2-1, coach R.C.
Slocum informed Hardeman he was being suspended. University
officials have yet to explain why that action was taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have much to say,'' A&AMP;M athletic director Wally Groff
said Tuesday, ``other than that we have a situation we're looking
into, and it affects one of our student-athletes. Until we get in
all of the information, we really don't have a comment to make.''
</P>
<P>
   An anonymous source close to the situation has said Hardeman is
mired in an academic problem that has arisen from his summer-school
course work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about satisfactory progress this summer,'' the source
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Cannon, A&AMP;M's sports information director, said that if a
player is suspended for violating team rules, Slocum usually ``will
say it's for breaking team rules.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I can remember a player just being
suspended indefinitely,'' Cannon said.
</P>
<P>
   Groff said he first learned about the issue Thursday while
attending a Big 12 athletic directors meeting in Dallas. He gave no
time frame for completion of the university investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could take a day, or it could take a week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hardeman has played in two games this season _ a season-opening
23-14 loss to Florida State in the Kickoff Classic at East
Rutherford, N.J., on Aug. 31, and the 28-7 victory over Louisiana
Tech at Kyle Field. In the second game, Hardeman ran for three
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Before being suspended, Hardeman was the Aggies' second-leading
ground-gainer (105 yards) and No. 1 scorer (24 points). Entering
the 1998 season, Hardeman had carried 262 times for 1,490 yards
(5.7 average) and scored 26 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   If it is determined he was academically ineligible at the start
of the season, the Aggies could be forced to forfeit the win over
Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess there's always that possibility, just like anything
else,'' Groff said.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum admitted Hardeman's absence ``cuts down our options
greatly'' on offense. But other than to confirm the fullback won't
be used Saturday, the coach had little more to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get into anything hypothetical, what might
have happened and who is at fault,'' he said. ``I do feel some
frustration. But there are some situations where you can't talk
about some things.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight game, freshman Ja'Mar Toombs of Kilgore
will start Saturday in place of Hardeman.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies feel that while Hardeman will be missed for whatever
length of time he remains on suspension, there is enough talent to
keep the ship afloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not where we want to be, and without Tiki, it will be
tough,'' tight end Dan Campbell said. ``He's what an A&AMP;M running
back is all about. He's tough, and he will run through tacklers.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M has nine games remaining. Should they have to forfeit the
Louisiana Tech win, the Aggies would have to win at least five more
games to qualify for a bowl. According to NCAA guidelines, a team
must have a minimum of six victories against Division I opponents
to qualify for a bowl.

`NEW' GERMANS FIND ESCAPE FROM TAINTED PAST
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich., S.C.)  (jw)

<P>
   HANOVER, Germany _ They have grappled with their nation's
history and understand its shame. They see their future with a
self-confidence their parents lacked.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's baby boomers have come of age, a new elite that has
moved into the country's boardrooms and its barracks, worldly,
drawn largely from the former West Germany, and above all striving
for a sense of normality in a land whose elders felt anything but
easy with themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls give no clear indication of this generation's
likely voting patterns in national elections on Sept. 27, in which
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 68, is in the biggest fight of his
political career, against Gerhard Schroeder, 54.
</P>
<P>
   But it is clear that no politician can afford to ignore this
generation, a broad swath of the 60 million voters. For it will
define the agenda in business, style, the arts and, increasingly,
in politics as a dominant Germany faces a new era.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an entire generation stretching from 35 to 50 that is
running the country,'' Lt. Col. Carsten Jacobson, 43, a general
staff officer and former tank commander, said at his home near a
lake south of Hanover. ``It is the managers, the political leading
class, the top civil servants.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a generation forged by two key dates: 1968, when a student
revolt in Europe produced a broader sense of its power, and 1989,
when the fall of the Berlin Wall led to German reunification. It is
also a generation that has molded American thinking about how
Germany will brace for a new century _ aware of its own interests
and ready to pursue them, and to assume greater responsibility
within the European and Atlantic alliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether they have overcome their fear of being
German, and the answer is: Yes,'' said J.D. Bindenagel, a senior
U.S. State Department official with long experience in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   German companies are major players in the economies of the
victorious wartime Allies. German soldiers, once barred from
service outside their country, now patrol the Balkans. When
Europeans seek a lead in dealing with the Russian crisis, they turn
reflexively to Bonn. And much of Europe's ability to make its
single currency work will demand German leadership.
</P>
<P>
   As with much of Germany's modern visage, it is a generation with
two profiles: west and east.
</P>
<P>
   Many westerners were born of parents who experienced Nazi
Germany first hand, yet frequently lived in denial of complicity as
they rebuilt their country into Europe's richest. Yet all were
nurtured by the peace, prosperity and self-confidence of the German
economic miracle.
</P>
<P>
   In the former East Germany, the dynamic was different: a
Communist leadership denied not just responsibility for the Nazi
era, but also the individual initiative encouraged in the west _
creating divisions that linger today. But what differentiates
Germany's baby boomers from their American counterparts is the
legacy of the past.
</P>
<P>
   German success, like American success, is measured in snappy
suits and slick cars, exclusive vacations and rich homes. But where
the American collective memory unfolded from victory in World War
II, many Germans of an earlier generation emerged with the
crushing, guilt-laden burden of the Holocaust and defeat.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the new Germans are bolstered by a consensus that
while Germans of their age must prevent history from repeating
itself, time has distanced them from their forebears' guilt. They
are far more ready to assert their interests, sometimes as Germans,
sometimes more as Europeans, in a contradictory world where
globalization has heightened national competition, just as the
conflicts of the post-Cold War era in places like Bosnia and
Albania demand cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War, the soldiers of the former West Germany
were forbidden _ by the Constitution and often by inclination _
from venturing outside the huge land mass patrolled by NATO. When
the Cold War ended, many Germans, including those in the military,
still resisted American insistence that reunification brought new
responsibilities in policing an unruly world.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Jacobson was not one of them. ``We are a country at the
crossroads of European history,'' he said. ``We border nine
countries. We are 80 million people. We are a wealthy country and a
magnet to neighbors who are not as wealthy. It's generally felt
that we have a moral burden. But I don't think we have any
alternative but to take an active role.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, though, the emergence of that role took Germany back
to its past and, specifically, to its history in the Balkans, where
Hitler's armies sustained a fascist regime in Croatia. From 1945 to
the mid-1990's, when a German medical unit cautiously deployed to
Croatia, followed by the dispatch of combat troops to Bosnia, the
Balkans represented a taboo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be stupid as a German soldier to go to the Balkans
without knowing what happened there,'' Col. Jacobson said. ``And
since everything in the Balkans is history, there is no nice
gesture to get around that.''
</P>
<P>
   So in late 1997, Col. Jacobson set off for Sarajevo for what
became a seven-month stint as military assistant to a German
two-star general serving under American command of the
international peace force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   It went ``remarkably well,'' he said. Despite historical
mistrust, there were no personal affronts. Indeed, he said, he
discovered that working 24 hours a day with other soldiers in the
multinational force, some from countries that had been invaded by
Nazi Germany, ``Germans were not looked at differently.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found our way back to the choir of nations as
soldiers,'' Col. Jacobson said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Along that route, of course, the United States was a mentor. But
here too, for a newer generation, attitudes toward America have
become more textured as Germans have moved away from being
perceived as Teutonic stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel very German in Britain or the United States,''
said Gabriele Eick, 46, the head of communications at Dresdner
Bank. ``I feel very much at home. I would be embarrassed if people
thought: the typical German.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Eick's resume could almost be that of an American high
flier, reflecting a career that for many years unfolded within
German subsidiaries of big American corporations like IBM, A.C.
Nielsen and Burson-Marsteller.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Ms. Eick's career has brought her into a different
and potentially more combative relationship with an important part
of American society: part of her job is to mold the corporate
response to a class-action suit by Holocaust survivors who say
Dresdner and other banks profited from their suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Eick was born in the former East Germany in 1952 and her
family fled to the west just a few months before the Berlin Wall
was built in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``My generation grew up on American folk songs,'' she said. ``I
know more American folk songs than German ones. And this is how I
learned a large part of my English. I grew up with a very strong,
positive American orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sentiments like these are much different from those of people
like Kohl, whose teen-age years unfolded under the occupation of
French and American forces.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as Hermann Grohe, a 37-year-old member of Parliament in
Bonn put it: ``I meet American legislators with the feeling that
these are representatives of the people in the most important
democracy in the world. But I don't see them as `the victor.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere has that been more evident than in the world of
business. German publishing houses have taken huge stakes in
American publishing. Volkswagen owns auto plants from the Czech
Republic to Spain. Daimler-Benz bought Chrysler. SAP, a German
software company, is the fourth largest in the American-dominated
hi-tech world. BMW owns the Rover car company in Britain and has
agreed with Volkswagen to parcel out ownership of Rolls Royce and
Bentley.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisitive drive was forced on German business by a
changing world. The European single market and the prospect of a
European single currency obliged companies to think in terms of far
wider networks, while the broader dynamics of the auto industry led
the drive for economies of scale as a means of survival in the
global competition. And that, in turn, revolutionized German big
business, creating the readiness not just to advance into global
markets, but also to challenge Germany's stultified labor
practices.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key players in this transformation was Helmut Panke,
52, BMW's industrial relations director, who set up the company's
operation in Spartanburg, S.C., between 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreigners change because they see a different Germany,'' he
said. ``But Germany and the Germans changed because they have
experienced more of the global network.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that view came from the west, and Matthias Platzeck,
44, the environment minister of Brandenburg, in the east, sees
things differently.
</P>
<P>
   Platzeck was 7 when the Berlin Wall was built, sealing him into
a cocoon of social protection, outright repression and Soviet
domination.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you learned a second language, it was Russian or Polish,''
Platzeck said. And even now, the sophistication of western Germans
does not extend so easily to the easterners. ``The ability to jump
across the pond is a western thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a world, he said, that treated the Holocaust as ``a side
issue'' and tried to teach its children to glorify the Soviet
Union. And it has left a different legacy.
</P>
<P>
   In eastern Germany, unemployment is twice as high as in the
west, at 20 percent, and it afflicts mainly the 50-plus generation,
the group that in the west gained most from the economic miracle.
The causes for the easterners' joblessness are well known:
reunification brought a wave of Deutschmark capitalism, utterly
destroying industries that had offered artificial full employment.
</P>
<P>
   But, Platzeck said, that same shock wave may have galvanized a
younger generation, forcing members into service industries, the
media and other sectors. ``Unlike in the west, 80 percent of
professional people in eastern Germany who do have jobs have
changed their jobs in the past seven years,'' he said. ``Big
changes are on the way with the European single currency. And
easterners are better armed for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The generational shifts evoke the real subtext driving Germany's
election: How will this new generation propel Europe's economic
powerhouse toward the challenges of the European unity?
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's Social Democratic opponent, Schroeder, is 14 years
younger than the Christian Democratic chancellor and likes to call
himself a Spatgeborene, a word that means ``born late'' and denotes
those whose birth came late enough to avoid all taint of the Third
Reich.
</P>
<P>
   While Schroeder is narrowly ahead in opinion surveys, though,
his personal popularity is equaled by a Christian Democrat of his
generation, Wolfgang Schauble, Kohl's heir apparent. And many
believe that if he won, Kohl would soon hand over to Schauble. In
other words, whatever the outcome on Sept. 27, this is likely to be
Kohl's last election before he bows out.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's choice as economics minister is Jost Stollmann, 43,
an iconoclastic computer millionaire who has angered the Social
Democratic party traditionalists by rejecting their left-wing
economic platform. ``Germany's future,'' Stollmann declared
recently, ``is neither left nor right, not ideological but
pragmatic. It will be a different way, our own German way.''

EXECUTIVE FALLOUT FROM A MERGER ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One morning last November, as leaders of Worldcom Inc. and MCI
Communications Corp. held a news conference in New York to announce
their companies' $37 billion merger deal, an executive close to
Worldcom who sat in the audience subtly gestured at the stage and
an extremely subdued Gerald Taylor, MCI's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Jerry,'' the executive said, using Taylor's nickname.
``You can tell he's not going to stick around.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right. Worldcom completed its acquisition of MCI last
Tuesday, and Taylor, who was to run the new MCI Worldcom Inc.'s
international operations, tendered his resignation before the end
of the week, mere days after the company where he worked for almost
30 years formally disappeared, people close to MCI said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom announced Taylor's resignation Tuesday and said it
would take effect at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday night, Taylor said that he had first
considered leaving MCI after the company agreed to be acquired by
British Telecommunications in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I joined MCI really as a summer job,'' he said. ``It's time
for new blood there and it's probably time for me to pursue other
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said that one of the possibilities he was considering was
joining a small start-up company.
</P>
<P>
   Like the executive at the news conference, most people in the
telecommunications industry did not expect Taylor to remain at the
combined company for long. But the speed of Taylor's departure may
be interpreted as a sign that Bernard Ebbers, who built Worldcom
through acquisitions, does not plan to alter his style of corporate
integration _ which features cost-cutting and major executive
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Ebbers, who had been Worldcom's chairman and will be chief
executive of the new company, is known for relying on a tight group
of managers. Executives at Worldcom's targets who find themselves
potentially competing with members of Ebbers' circle generally move
on.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Taylor was not the only senior MCI executive to
announce his resignation Tuesday. Lance Boxer, MCI's chief
information officer, announced that he had agreed to join Lucent
Technologies Inc., North America's biggest maker of
telecommunications gear, as president for communications software.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, 44, said that John Sidgmore, head of Worldcom's Internet
unit, had asked him to stay with MCI Worldcom, but he added that
with the takeover his opportunities for advancement seemed less
than stellar.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew I wanted to expand and run a new business unit,''
Boxer said Tuesday. ``It wasn't going to be possible in the MCI
Worldcom structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Timothy Price, MCI's president, who is to run MCI
Worldcom's domestic operation, Boxer added, ``The business units
will be run by Tim Price, John Sidgmore and whoever runs the Jerry
Taylor operation.''
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, after MCI and Worldcom announced that Scott
Sullivan, Worldcom's high-powered chief financial officer, would
take over that post in the combined company, Douglas Maine, MCI's
finance chief, left in April to join IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, 56, will stay on the MCI Worldcom board, where he will
remain linked to a longtime colleague, Bert Roberts Jr., chairman
of the former MCI and chairman of MCI Worldcom. Executives close to
Roberts say he does not intend to step down anytime soon, but not
many people say they expect Roberts to stay with the company for
the long haul, especially since a majority of the board he is to
lead was appointed by Ebbers.

`RUSH HOUR'S' CHAN FINDS DO-IT-YOURSELF STARDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB GRAHAM  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO &LR;   &LR; _ Jackie Chan has a cold.
</P>
<P>
   He caught it after washing his canvas shoes in a hotel room
shower and drying them off naked under the air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny, huh?'' he says. ``I always wash my own shoes. I wash my
own underwear, too. Why? Because if you give it to the hotel, they
charge you $3 for one underwear.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the guy whose new movie, ``Rush Hour,'' just brought in
$33 million over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   He's been using the same bar of soap that he picked up in a
Taiwan hotel several stops before reaching San Francisco. He wraps
it up after each use and takes it with him to the next hotel on his
tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to see people waste things,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Chan's been like that for more than three decades, ever since he
went from boy to teenager under the tutelage of a tough master at a
Peking Opera academy in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 44 years old but still look very good,'' he says. ``Why?
Because I have very good basic training. My foundation is very
good.''
</P>
<P>
   If Chan comes across as completely sure of himself, he also is
playful. His cold doesn't prevent him from suddenly breaking into
song, in a sweet karaoke voice:
</P>
<P>
   (set ital)Wise men say only fools rush in, but I can't help
falling in love with you.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   He's so pleased with himself that he croons another one.
</P>
<P>
   (set ital)Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high, there's a
land that I heard of once in a lullaby.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a good singer,'' he says. ``For the last 10 years I
listen to a lot of American songs. Why? Because I want to learn
English.''
</P>
<P>
   The best way to learn English, he goes on, ``is to have an
American girlfriend. If I don't have an American girlfriend, the
best way is to watch TV, CNN, or listen to CDs, country music.''
</P>
<P>
   There he goes again: (set ital)You are always on my mind, you
are always on my mind.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   He also sings the soul anthem ``War'' with co-star Chris Tucker
in ``Rush Hour,'' but what he really likes to sing are ballads. ``I
like more slow songs. Then I can follow. Then I can listen and
really use the words. Rock, I cannot understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Learning English, like washing his shoes, is something he does
``for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He's got all the fame he could possibly handle and probably all
the money, too. ``It's not about the money. Money in the bank is
only zero, zero, zero,'' he says, reaching into the pocket of his
black-and-white jumpsuit and pulling out a money clip. ``Now money
in your pocket, that's real money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to do something today for myself, for my family,
for the Chinese community.''
</P>
<P>
   What he really wants to do right now is ``get back into the
American market.''
</P>
<P>
   He tried it in the early '80s with two ``Cannonball Run''
movies, which starred Burt Reynolds, but the films didn't do too
much for Chan. ``Rumble in the Bronx'' was a U.S. hit in 1994, but
despite the title, the film was a Hong Kong production, with Chan
dubbing his own voice, and so was ``Supercop'' after that.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of the first weekend's box office, it looks as if
``Rush Hour,'' a Hollywood production, has turned the corner for
him.
</P>
<P>
   He's ready to do a sequel, if anybody asks him. ``At the end of
the movie, you see Chris Tucker and me on the plane. Where are we
going? Nobody knows. Maybe plane land in China,'' he says with a
grin.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There is a Jackie Chan quick change of direction. ``But if it's
no good and nobody call us, that's OK, too. I have my own
projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Chan has his own team of seven stuntmen, and they work out for
three hours every day, wherever his moviemaking takes him _ Los
Angeles, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong. He does not do much weight
training. ``I cannot have huge muscles,'' he says. ``Mostly we
jump, punch, kick.''
</P>
<P>
   He has just published an ``as told to'' book, ``I Am Jackie
Chan: My Life in Action,'' which describes his apprenticeship in
the Peking Opera academy _ Chinese opera includes tumbling and
martial arts, as well as singing. The book also has a filmography
that lists his work as a stuntman on the Bruce Lee films ``Fist of
Fury'' and ``Enter the Dragon.''
</P>
<P>
   In those days, the early '70s, he established the style of doing
his own stunts that became his trademark. Now, audiences expect it
from him, even as other action films rely on high-tech computer
graphics for their effects. ``If I make `Jurassic Park,' with
dinosaurs, it's not Jackie Chan anymore. I have to stay in this
kind of style.''
</P>
<P>
   He nearly died as the result of a head injury from falling out
of a tree while making ``Armour of God'' in 1986. Even today, he
does not take stunt-related injuries seriously unless he ends up in
the hospital. For ``Rush Hour,'' there were times he was ``just
hurting a little bit, cutting a little bit,'' but ``mostly blood
comes out a little bit, and I don't worry about it.''

ADVERTISERS ARE GRADED ON HOW THEY DEPICT WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn., Mich., N.Y., Ohio, Calif., Ill.)   (af)  
 By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An organization of women in advertising is again
grading efforts by Madison Avenue to portray their sex in sales
pitches for products.
</P>
<P>
   At a luncheon Wednesday at the New York Hilton, the
organization, Advertising Women of New York, will present honors
and dishonors at its second annual event known as the Good, the Bad
and the Ugly Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisements labeled good include work for the AT&AMP;T Corp., the
Kellogg Co. and Mastercard International Inc. The campaigns
considered bad are for products as diverse as automobiles, beer and
shampoo. And the most ugly of the ugly ads that present women in
demeaning ways, according to the organization, is a commercial for
a fast-food chain that celebrates a busty blonde running on a
beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we really bent over backwards not to point our
finger at marketers who were still using the outdated, stereotyped
imagery,'' said Toni Lee, co-chairwoman of the Advertising Women of
New York creative committee and an awards judge, ``but this year we
felt we had given them fair warning.''
</P>
<P>
   To supplement the opinions of the judges, the organization asked
women who do not work in advertising to comment on the ads, which
could be viewed on the iVillage Web site (www.iVilliage.com).
</P>
<P>
   N.W. Ayer &AMP; Partners in New York, a unit of MacManus Group and
the sponsor of the luncheon, also showed the ads under
consideration to women in focus groups; videotapes of those
sessions will be shown at the luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted marketers to hear what women in the marketplace had
to say,'' said Ms. Lee, who is president at TL Communications in
Wilton, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The ads that are being praised portray women as much more
multidimensional than how they were depicted in ads decades ago,
when simplification to the point of condescension was standard. In
many of those early ads, American women were depicted as mindless
housewives whose agenda in life was to scrub kitchen floors, make a
good cup of coffee and have the whitest laundry _ all while wearing
pearls.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the ``good'' ads are suffused with humor, like one
commercial _ a multiple winner at the luncheon _ by the Leo Burnett
Co. in Chicago for the Special K cereal sold by Kellogg. The spot,
which carries the theme ``Reshape your attitude,'' shows men in a
bar, uttering such phrases as ``I will stop asking `Do I look fat
in this?''' and ``I have my mother's thighs. I have to accept
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The awards _ including a ``Grand Good'' for the commercial and a
``They Get It'' honor for Kellogg _ are especially noteworthy
because as recently as two years ago, the company and Burnett were
criticized by some women for a Special K campaign centered on a
woman admiring herself in a mirror as she modeled a black dress,
apparently a size 2 at most.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg's ``complete advertising about-face is ample evidence
that this leading advertiser not only gets it,'' Ms. Lee said,
``but also gets the fact that they didn't get it before.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Kafer, a spokeswoman for Kellogg in Battle Creek, Mich.,
said the company was pleased with the recognition adding, ``We have
changed our advertising approach based on feedback from women.''
</P>
<P>
   Another winner of a ``good'' award is a commercial for the
Ameritech Corp. cellular telephones, created by the Cliff Freeman &AMP;
Partners unit of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC in New York. The spot mocks
the propensity of men to buy women gifts like a waffle iron and a
``nice new fluffy bath towel.''
</P>
<P>
   Another praised commercial, for Mastercard, was created by
McCann-Erickson New York, part of the McCann-Erickson Worldwide
Advertising division of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the
Interpublic Group of Companies. The spot describes as ``priceless''
a woman's ability to have the last word with an old boyfriend at a
class reunion.
</P>
<P>
   A second Grand Good Award will be presented to AT&AMP;T and its
agency, Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising in New York, for two
commercials centered on the relationship between mothers and
daughters. One, using the Cyndi Lauper song ``Girls Just Wanna Have
Fun,'' shows a female executive playing hooky from work to take her
three daughters to the beach. The other, using the Frank Sinatra
version of ``Our Love is Here to Stay,'' shows a mother taking her
daughter to college for freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   The other ``They Get It'' Award is being given to Purple Moon, a
new media company in Mountain View, Calif., that creates CD-ROMs
and interactive programs for girls. The citation praises the
company for helping girls become comfortable with technology and
recognizing differences between the way girls and boys play.
</P>
<P>
   Luncheongoers who are eager to watch the women of Madison Avenue
bite the hand that feeds them will probably be disappointed,
because the awards, as they did last year, devote less attention to
the bad and the ugly than to the good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out to embarrass anybody,'' said Nora P. McAniff,
president of Advertising Women of New York, who is also the
publisher of People magazine, which is owned by Time Warner Inc.
``But hopefully it's a learning experience for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   One judge, Caroline Jones, president and creative director at
Caroline Jones Inc. in New York, said that it was important to
criticize as well as to praise because even ``going toward the year
2000, we still see women depicted as sex objects for products
mostly aimed at men.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization wants marketers ``to know that this is not
acceptable in this day and age,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Among the campaigns judged offensive to women are television
commercials for Herbal Essences hair care and shower products sold
by the Clairol unit of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. The ads,
created by Kaplan Thaler Group in New York, feature women
simulating sexual arousal to make a pun on the brand's ``organic''
formulas.
</P>
<P>
   Another thumbs down went to the Kay Jewelers retail chain
division of Sterling Jewelers Inc. in Akron, Ohio, and its agency,
Stern Advertising in Pepper Pike, Ohio, for a commercial in which a
woman is ignored by her boyfriend when they encounter the model
Cindy Crawford shopping at a Kay store.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Grand Ugly'' Award will be given to Del Taco Inc. in
Laguna Hills, Calif., for a commercial by Italia/Gal Advertising in
Los Angeles, which promoted a menu item called the Macho Combo
Burrito. As a tanned woman, barely wearing her bikini, runs in slow
motion, an announcer intones, ``If this is your idea of quality
entertainment ... have we got something for you.'' Musclebound men
in crew cuts are then seen head-banging each other interspersed
with beauty shots of the burrito.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of the 21 judges of the awards, Sara Smith, best
summarized why that spot was considered the worst of the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``What,'' asked the 11-year-old sixth-grade student from
Davenport, Iowa, ``does a woman in a bikini have to do with
tacos?''

SPENCER SLUGS HIS WAY INTO YANKS' PLANS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, N.Y.)  (jw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shane Spencer can't run as well as Chad Curtis, can't
spray line drives like Tim Raines, doesn't hit the ball as far as
Darryl Strawberry. But what Spencer does have is impeccable timing.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer, a veteran of 46 major league at-bats before Tuesday
night, is on a power binge that could propel him into a meaningful
role with the Yankees in the playoffs, which start next week. He
banged two homers and nearly hit two others in the first game of
Tuesday's day-night doubleheader with Cleveland at Yankee Stadium,
seizing the attention of Manager Joe Torre.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's opened our eyes,'' Torre said after the Yankees won the
first game, 10-4, to improve their record to 108-48. With six games
remaining, including Tuesday night's, the Yankees needed two
victories to tie the single-season club record of 110, set by the
1927 Yankees (who finished 110-44), and three victories to tie the
American League record of 111, set by the 1954 Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer's emergence has come just as Strawberry and Raines are
hobbling with minor leg injuries. Strawberry bruised a calf when he
was hit by a pitch on Monday, and Raines has a sore knee. Neither
injury is considered serious, but both players are older and have
histories of leg trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, who played well in the first half of the season and was
rewarded with a three-year contract, has had a miserable second
half, batting just .212 in 189 at-bats with one home run and 13
runs batted in, including a .186 average with runners in scoring
position. Pitches on the outer half of the plate have been a
mystery to him, and his defensive play has suffered of late.
</P>
<P>
   Going into September, the Yankees' post-season lineup figured to
include Raines or Strawberry against right-handed pitchers and
Raines or Curtis against left-handers. But Spencer is crushing the
ball and Curtis is floundering and Torre is watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he's swinging the bat now,'' Torre said, referring to
Spencer, ``nobody is swinging the bat better.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing the Indians' Dave Burba, Spencer slammed a gigantic
410-foot solo home run in the second inning, the second of three
home runs the Yankees hit in the inning. (Tino Martinez hammered a
two-run homer and Scott Brosius homered immediately after Spencer.)
Two innings later, Spencer drove his second home run, to
straightaway center field.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer came within five feet of another home run in the sixth
inning; left fielder David Justice caught the ball at the wall in
left-center field. Then, in the seventh, Spencer unloaded a
towering shot down the left-field line. The ball bent foul by 10 or
15 feet and crashed into the upper deck, prompting some oooohs from
the 14,480 attending the first game.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer also made a running, leaping catch in the second inning
and nearly threw out a runner at second base in the sixth inning,
further confirmation of Torre's belief that Spencer can be at least
adequate in playing the outfield. A week ago, there was some doubt
as to whether Spencer would be part of the 25-man roster. Now the
question is, how may Torre employ a right-handed-hitting outfielder
with a .370 average and an .870 slugging percentage?
</P>
<P>
   Comparing Spencer to Mark McGwire directly would be absurd, but
to put Spencer's binge in perspective: McGwire leads major league
regulars with one home run for every 7.5 at-bats; Spencer had a
homer for every 7.7 at-bats before Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Torre believes in the value of experience, he said, before
adding, ``You try to ride a hot hand when you get in the
post-season.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer, a 28th-round draft pick in 1990, pounded 30 home runs
for Class AAA Columbus in 1997 and put himself into position for
his promotion this year, and most likely onto the post-season
roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no control over that,'' Spencer said. ``If I get a
chance to play, I'm just having fun.'' &QL;

TV NOTES: PRIME-TIME SPINNING; WATERGATE RERUNS; COURT TV KNOWS ITS
NICHE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new prime-time season has just begun, with Nielsen ratings
in for new broadcast network offerings on Sunday and Monday nights.
But the spinning has begun in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   NBC may have had reason to spin. It finished in fourth place
Monday night in the 40 metered markets measured by Nielsen in
overnight ratings. But that still doesn't explain the news release
NBC issued, with this headline: ```Will and Grace' Debut Tops
Premiere of `Ally McBeal' by 30 Percent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will and Grace,'' a new comedy in the 9:30 p.m. time slot
between ``Caroline in the City'' and ``Dateline'' on NBC, had a 9.2
overnight rating (each rating point represents 598,000 homes). But
``Ally McBeal,'' the hourlong Fox hit, had an 11.3 rating overall,
and an 11.5 in the half hour it competed against ``Will and
Grace.'' ``Ally'' was second only to ABC's ``Monday Night
Football.''
</P>
<P>
   The text of the NBC statement said that ``Will and Grace''
outdid the series debut of ``Ally McBeal'' ``in the same time
period last fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the fact that the headline implies a victory in this
year's comparable time periods, the statement is inaccurate even
for last year. In its premiere last fall, on Sept. 8, ``Ally
McBeal'' earned a 9.3 rating. In the episode that ran on the
comparable date last year (Sept. 22), it had a 7.4, which is 24
percent, not 30 percent, lower than the 9.2 ``Will and Grace'' got
in metered markets on Monday night. Even then, it's an odd
comparison: the third episode of ``Ally'' versus the debut of
``Will and Grace''?
</P>
<P>
   The NBC publicist who wrote the release, Mike Nelson, was out of
the office Tuesday and could not be reached for an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   NBC may have had reason to gloss over some Nielsen numbers,
since all four of its half-hour sitcoms that had their season
premieres on Monday were down from the ratings the network received
for the same time periods last year, and ``Caroline in the City''
was down by 38 percent, to an 8.3 rating from a 13.4 rating.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, by contrast, had reason to be encouraged. The returning
comedy ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' was up, with a 10.2 rating, even
though it was competing against ``Ally McBeal'' and ``Monday Night
Football.'' A new sitcom, ``The King of Queens,'' got a 9.7
overnight rating. And the new series ``L.A. Doctors'' earned a 10.7
against a 9.0 for ``Dateline,'' which had coverage of President
Clinton's grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The Nixon Hearings
</P>
<P>
   The national fascination with President Clinton's unexpurgated
grand jury testimony on Monday reminded some Americans of an
earlier, equally compelling presidential television event _ the
1974 Watergate hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The History Channel, fittingly, is already on that wavelength.
Tuesday, the cable network announced that it would show the House
Judiciary Committee hearings from 1974, starting next Monday: 25
hours of them in five-hour chunks from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. each day,
and again from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Along with committee members who are still involved in
Washington politics, like Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the Republican
leader, and Defense Secretary William Cohen, the 1974 clips show a
young lawyer who served as counsel to the committee's Democrats
during those hearings _ Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us had covered anything like this before, and we were
scared,'' Roger Mudd, a History Channel regular who was then the
congressional correspondent for CBS News, said Tuesday. He and Bob
Schieffer, CBS News' current congressional correspondent, will be
the co-anchors for the reruns of the hearings, which will use CBS'
archival footage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew what would happen, whether democracy itself would
slip off the edge of the world if you impeached a president,'' Mudd
said Tuesday. ``It was really unknown stuff we were covering.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a journalist living through those years, 1972, 1973 and
1974, no other three years could ever be comparable to those. Every
morning when you woke up, there was something that caused your jaw
to drop. You didn't know from one day to the next how exciting it
would get. You almost couldn't stand it, it was so exciting, but it
was grim and scary at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mudd is also kicking off a new monthly series this Friday called
``Great Minds of American History,'' in which he interviews top
historians _ Stephen Ambrose, on World War II and the 1950s; David
McCullough on the early 20th century; James McPherson on the Civil
War; Richard White on the settlement of the American West, and
Gordon Wood on the American Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to running on the History Channel, these one-hour
episodes will appear on PBS next spring.
</P>
<P>
   As someone who originally wanted to be a professional historian
when he grew up, Mudd has found his niche at the History Channel.
In earning his master's degree in history from the University of
North Carolina, Mudd wrote his thesis on the relationship between
the press and Franklin Roosevelt's top advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I then wanted to work for a newspaper before going on with my
next level of studies,'' he said. He got a job with The Richmond
(Va.) News-Leader, which led to a radio job, which led to
television, and the rest, as they say, is history.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Plugging Away
</P>
<P>
   In a measure of how far Court TV Telecommunications has fallen
off the public radar screen, most newspapers' accounts about which
television networks would be carrying President Clinton's grand
jury testimony on Monday, and later assessments of that coverage,
did not even mention Court TV.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in its heyday, when the nation was obsessed with O.J.
Simpson's murder trial, Court TV was a dominant television force,
both in carrying the trial itself live every day, and in analyzing
and commenting on it between court sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a two-hour show last night replaying segments of the
Clinton testimony and analyzing the specific legal issues,'' Henry
Schleiff, the newly named president of Court TV, said rather
plaintively Tuesday. ``We really put Clinton's testimony under a
microscope, in a way that only Court TV can.''
</P>
<P>
   The cable network also carried Clinton's Aug. 17 videotaped
testimony live as it was being released, just as the all-news cable
networks and the three major broadcast networks did.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's panelists included a number of conservatives _
Mark Braden, former chief counsel of the Republican National
Committee; Jamie Wareham, former director of Lawyers for Dole;
Gilbert Davis, a former lawyer for Paula Jones, and Larry Klayman,
chairman of the conservative foundation Judicial Watch _ as well as
Time magazine's deputy chief of the Washington bureau, Jef
McAllister.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had five of our own journalists, too, whose job was to
balance the arguments,'' said Sheilagh D'Arcy McGee, the network's
vice president for programming. ``For those tired of all the
partisan arguing and screaming, we are trying to illuminate the
process and the actual legal issues. That's our niche and we will
stick to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schleiff, who technically doesn't start his new job until Oct.
5, will take over a network that has been floundering since Steve
Brill, its founder, sold his interest and departed in February
1997. Court TV was left in the hands of three co-owners who
bickered over its direction and a new president. Finally, Time
Warner and Liberty Media bought out NBC's interest, and last week
hired Schleiff, a lawyer and television executive.

WILLIAM ALBRIGHT, 53, COMPOSER OF RAGTIME MUSIC FOR THE ORGAN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Albright, a composer, organist and pianist, died on
Sept. 17 at his home in Ann Arbor, Mich. He was 53.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver failure, said his agent, Karen McFarlane.
</P>
<P>
   Albright won special respect for his work in ragtime and organ
music. These might seem quite distinct fields, but,
characteristically, he brought them together. He wrote rags for the
organ, which had probably never had rags written for it before, and
his creative output was nourished by a love of the American
vernacular that he found in ragtime and church music.
</P>
<P>
   He was born on Oct. 20, 1944, in Gary, Ind., and attended the
Juilliard School's preparatory department before going to the
University of Michigan in 1962. There he studied composition with
Ross Lee Finney and George Rochberg and the organ with Marilyn
Mason. He spent the 1968-69 academic year in Paris, attending
Olivier Messiaen's classes at the Conservatory, and then returned
to the University of Michigan, where he completed his graduate
studies and then joined the faculty in 1970. He remained at the
university, eventually becoming chairman of the composition
department.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's discovery of prejazz musical styles _ ragtime and
stride piano _was a revelation. He performed and recorded much of
this music, which provided a crucial model for such early works as
his ``Grand Sonata in Rag'' for piano (1968). As he wrote of this
piece: ``Ragtime, a beautiful, classical, syncopated music from the
turn of the century, has turned out to have a new fascination for
composers nurtured in our century's subsequent modernism.
Imagination, as well as tonality and rhythmic vitality, could run
rampant: why not have fun and sentimentality? It's very
avant-garde!''
</P>
<P>
   He continued to have fun and sentimentality, and to help other
composers along the way. While contributing extensively to the
organ repertory, he also commissioned pieces from diverse
contemporaries that he played on his concert tours of North America
and Europe. His own organ pieces include the Symphony of 1986.
Among other works are mixed-media pieces for the theater,
compositions for instrumental ensembles (usually unconventional
ones) and a 1983 oratorio, ``A Song to David.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Elizabeth Mae Albright, of New
York; a son, John Kirk Albright, of Ypsilanti, Mich.; and two
brothers, John B., of Germantown, Md., and Richard, of Morristown,
N.J.

POLI-DIXON GETS THE CALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From his position on the UCLA sideline, Brian
Poli-Dixon did not hear Freddie Mitchell's femur break in two.
Other players did, but Poli-Dixon was 20 yards away, which seems
like 20 miles when trying to detect slight sounds in a collision
sport.
</P>
<P>
   A few seconds later Poli-Dixon heard UCLA trainer Geoff Schaadt
yell, ``Mitchell's down,'' and he figured that meant Mitchell was
out for the game, perhaps a week or two. It wasn't until halftime
that Poli-Dixon learned the unsettling truth: Mitchell had
fractured his left femur, would undergo emergency surgery to insert
a stabilizing rod and two interlocking screws, and would miss the
rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   A few tears later, Poli-Dixon began to see the cruel irony: The
football fates had given as they had taken away. Mitchell's injury
had become his opportunity. A fallen friend had created the chance
of a lifetime for a quiet, skinny sophomore from northeast Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his chance,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of its best playmaker, UCLA needs someone to take
center stage for its potent offense to run at maximum efficiency.
All fingers point to Poli-Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm looking forward to it,'' he said. ``It could be something
somebody put out there for me. Maybe it was meant to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Poli-Dixon does not have Mitchell's charisma, he does not have
Mitchell's quickness and he might not have Mitchell's hands. But in
some respects he's a better prospect _ good enough, in fact, to
draw comparisons to former Bruin J.J. Stokes. Both are 6-5, with
long, graceful strides and possessing what coaches call game speed;
they're as fast as they need to be. Stokes emerged during his
sophomore season and the Bruins hope Poli-Dixon, who has three
touchdowns in two games, will do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian has definitely proven he can be a big-play guy,''
offensive coordinator Al Borges said. ``If there is a plus side to
losing Freddie, it's that it gives us a chance to exploit
Poli-Dixon's talents.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by a mix of hope and belief, UCLA made Poli-Dixon the
starter at split end this week and moved Brad Melsby to backup
flanker behind Danny Farmer. Melsby is strong and surehanded, but
he lacks Poli-Dixon's size and speed and is best suited for the
slot (inside) position when the Bruins use their three-receiver
formation. The big plays _ the post patterns, the out-and-ups, the
quick slants _ will be left to Farmer and Poli-Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmer and I talked about this,'' Poli-Dixon said. ``It's on
us. We've got to do it. We talked about it in Houston, we talked
about it on (Spaulding Field) and in the training room.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no plans for radical schematic changes, Borges said
Tuesday. Any adjustments in the post-Mitchell passing game will be
too subtle for the fans to notice. (They might be too subtle for
the opponents as well.) Quarterback Cade McNown will disperse the
ball as usual, throwing screens to the running backs, curls to the
tight ends, fades and posts to the receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time you have to make changes is if there's a blatant
weakness filling in,'' Borges said. ``Anytime you lose a guy of
Mitchell's caliber, there are going to be depth problems. I think
we'll be OK as long as we don't lose anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Without doubt, it's been a difficult week for Poli-Dixon. His
good friend was lost for the year with a broken leg. He hasn't
practiced because of a concussion suffered at Houston (he expects
to play against Miami) and the weight of UCLA's passing game
suddenly has shifted to his lean, sloping shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Is he ready? He'd better be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been myself this week,'' Poli-Dixon said. ``Part of
it may be the concussion, part may be sorrow for Freddie and his
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I talked to him Sunday, and he said, `You've got to do it
for me.' In the back of my mind, I've got Freddie on my shoulders.
Even though he's not there, I've got his spirit on my shoulders.
I'm playing for him.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Note: Hurricane Georges is expected to hit South Florida
later this week. Scheduled to arrive in Miami on Thursday evening,
UCLA is considering alternate travel plans. More information is
expected today.

COWBOYS' NEXT TEST IS CONSISTENCY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Three games into the 1998 season, the Cowboys
are back.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Not back to the dominance that resulted in three Super Bowl
titles from 1992-95, but back atop the NFC East after Monday's 31-7
shellacking of the defending division champion New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The victory put the Cowboys (2-1), who have won five of the past
six division titles, in first place for the first time since the
sixth week of the 1997 season. And considering that the next five
opponents _ starting Sunday against the Oakland Raiders (1-2),
followed by the Washington Redskins (0-3), Carolina Panthers (0-2),
Chicago Bears (0-3) and Philadelphia Eagles (0-3) _ have a combined
record of 1-13, they could stay there for a while.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cowboys coach Chan Gailey, who still remembers the
42-23 debacle against the Denver Broncos two weeks ago, refuses to
engage in talk of a Cowboys cakewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we've got to realize is that we have not arrived
by any stretch of the imagination,'' Gailey said. ``We are still
working to earn something back and get back something that we had
here. But we are not taking anything. In this league, as close are
teams are, you got to prove yourself every week.''
</P>
<P>
   And as far as Gailey is concerned, the Cowboys have only proved
to be inconsistent _ good the first week against the Cardinals, bad
the second week against the Broncos and good the third week against
the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   And while he liked what he saw against the Giants _ especially
defensively, where the Cowboys improved from the 517 yards allowed
against the Broncos to 252, including 56 on the ground _ Gailey
said, ``we got to prove it again and again. We got to be
consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys defensive coordinator Dave Campo was of a similar
mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't look good one week and not look good the next week,''
Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   What Campo liked the most against the Giants was that all phases
of the team contributed. Cornerback/receiver/punt returner Deion
Sanders might have stolen the show with a 71-yard interception
return for a touchdown, a 59-yard punt return for a touchdown and a
55-yard pass reception, but he had plenty of company.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys got interceptions from free safety Kenny Wheaton and
cornerback Kevin Mathis and sacks from defensive tackle Leon Lett,
linebacker Randall Godfrey, defensive tackle Chad Hennings and free
safety Omar Stoutmire.
</P>
<P>
   Campo said he doesn't know which performance is more indicative
of his 16th-ranked defense _ the one against the Broncos, or the
one against the Giants _ but he said he likes the way his team
responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where we are,'' Campo said. ``I know I like our
group of guys. I know I like the way they go about their business.
I like our speed. And I like the pride we have. But when you put it
all together, I don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the key for the Cowboys is improving the running
game and being more consistent in the passing game. The running
game, hampered without starter Emmitt Smith (groin injury) for most
of the game, gained 80 yards on 29 carries. And the passing game
was undone by four dropped passes.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, however, said the team overcome the problems because
backup quarterback Jason Garrett did a nice job of running the
offense and the Cowboys stayed away from turnovers and sacks.
Garrett completed 12 of 28 passes for 222 yards with a touchdown
and no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   But with Garrett starting for at least another three weeks for
starter Troy Aikman (fractured collarbone), Gailey said the Cowboys
are going to have to continue to be smart.
</P>
<P>
   ``How we played was good enough to win (Monday night), but it
might not be every week,'' Gailey said. ``But if we can continue to
eliminate sacks and turnovers, we are going to give ourselves a
chance to win a lot of games.''

   PRISTINA, Serbia _ The Clinton administration's special envoy
for Kosovo drove into a valley filled with about 20,000 ethnic
Albanian refugees Tuesday, many of whom sleep in the fields, to
refute the Yugoslav president's assertions that there was no human
crisis in the province.
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting in Belgrade on Monday with the envoy,
Ambassador Christopher R. Hill, President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia insisted that Western descriptions of a crisis had been
invented as an excuse to use force against the Serbian troops and
policemen in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is the southern province of Serbia, the republic that is
the larger part of Yugoslavia. More than 90 percent of Kosovo's
people are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   After the session with Hill, Milosevic said on television that
``the term `humanitarian catastrophe,' which we have been hearing
in past weeks, is not based on reality.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday after touring the Pagarusa region _ about 25 miles
south of Pristina, the provincial capital _ Hill said he had heard
the stories of many Albanian refugees who had been living in the
open for more than a month and were too scared to return home
because hostile Serbian forces were posted in their villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw no sign of people returning and met people who, contrary
to Serb insistence of their being under shelter, were sleeping in
the fields,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Some slept in tractor trailers, others in makeshift tents, he
said, and many had been without shelter for up to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Some of their houses were damaged by the Serbs. Some were
intact, but even in those cases, the Albanians said they were too
fearful to go back because of the Serbian police, Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 250,000 Albanians have fled their homes since the
conflict between Albanian separatist guerrillas, known as the
Kosovo Liberation Army, and Serbian forces started in the spring.
The exodus of Albanians from villages all over the province
intensified in July when the Serbian security police, backed by the
Yugoslav Army, mounted a tank and artillery offensive against the
lightly armed guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   With the Serbian offensive about to enter its third month,
senior Clinton administration officials and NATO diplomats have
renewed their threats of air strikes against Milosevic's forces.
They say they hope to deter Milosevic from continued attacks that
result in ever more refugees as winter closes in.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's defense ministers are scheduled to meet in Portugal on
Thursday to discuss what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday, residents of Pristina woke to the sound of
shelling about 12 miles northeast of the capital. The new attacks,
which centered on the Cicevica ridge where the Kosovo Liberation
Army was known to have some remaining strength, were expected to
result in many more refugees, relief officials said Tuesday night.
The officials said they had seen two military attack helicopters
fly over the area.
</P>
<P>
   In his meeting with Milosevic, Hill said he had pressed the
Yugoslav president _ the de facto leader of Serbia _ to withdraw
the additional security forces that were sent to Kosovo to deal
with the Albanian guerrillas. ``Until they are removed, people will
not return to their homes,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic did not give any specific commitment about a
withdrawal of forces, Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same meeting, Hill presented Milosevic with a draft
proposal drawn up by the State Department for the future of the
province. The proposal, Western diplomats said, does not touch the
basic issue of the status of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the issue of whether Kosovo should remain part
of Serbia, become a separate republic within Yugoslavia or be
granted independence, as the Albanians demand, is too hot for
rational discussion, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the proposal presents ideas for an ``interim solution''
of three years during which a presidency, and the leadership of a
legislature and government would be rotated among the major and
minor ethnic groups in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic promised to return point-by-point comments to the
State Department within a week, Western diplomats said. Ethnic
Albanian leaders released their reaction to the proposal last
weekend.

LONG AN ADMIRER, JOHNSON BECOMES MCGWIRE'S FOE FOR A DAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mo., Calif., N.Y., Ill., N.D., Wash., Texas)  (jw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Randy Johnson was the awkward one of the two, a tall
campus curiosity as skinny as Jack Sprat with a slingshot of an arm
but the aim of a water gun. Fastballs spraying everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson was the thin man on campus, his teammate at the
University of Southern California back in the early '80s, Mark
McGwire, was the big man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark was made for success, and you could see that early on,''
Johnson said just before his Houston Astros played McGwire's
Cardinals Tuesday night. ``I was like 6-foot-10 and 180 pounds. I
threw hard, but I'd usually hit the backstop about every other
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark was more polished. I was raw. If someone would have said
Randy will do this or that, no one would have seen it. With Mark,
you saw it. I'm not surprised he is where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Johnson has long since grown into a frame that
uncoils from the mound and comes at batters like a nightmare. And
on Wednesday, the two superstars will face off in a power duel.
Johnson versus McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we both have an admiration for what each other has
done,'' Johnson said. ``I have respect for Mark and what he has
done for baseball. It's amazing what he and Sammy Sosa have brought
about. There are these incredible stories about them, and how they
got to where they are. It's great for baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   As unbelievable as McGwire's power has been while he chased and
passed Roger Maris' single-season home run record of 61, reaching
65 before Tuesday night's game against Houston and starter Mike
Hampton, Johnson has displayed surreal numbers as well since coming
to the National League from Seattle in an attention-getting trade
six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   He will look to win his seventh consecutive start on Wednesday
in his last action of the regular season. And he will try to grab
it by challenging McGwire. Last year, that strategy failed him as
McGwire, then with the Oakland A's, crushed a Johnson pitch more
than 500 feet in Seattle's Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   In their only meeting of this season, two weeks ago, McGwire
could not catch up to Johnson's fastball. Few batters have since
Johnson arrived from Seattle. In his last six starts, he is 6-0
with a 1.14 earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   Some have wondered out loud, why now? Why wasn't Johnson this
hot in Seattle (9-10, 4.33 ERA)? There are theories that the
negative air surrounding his contract status in Seattle was
weighing on him, while others believe he was not giving it his best
because of the rift. Whatever the answer, the fresh start has
served him well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that, a new start, but there are other things,'' Johnson
said. ``There are bigger parks in the National League. I've had
shutouts that might not have been shutouts in Seattle because the
Astrodome is bigger. That helps. And I'm also having fun. I'm
feeding off the encouragement of the fans, and I'm focused.''
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety and edginess that crept into Johnson's personality
in Seattle have disappeared as his phenomenal restart to the season
has become a spectacle in its own right. The hype around Johnson's
performance does not come close to matching the swirl of craziness
that has revolved around McGwire, but Johnson has held his own
against his old college teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both have gotten to where we are because we worked hard,''
Johnson said. ``I wouldn't be surprised if Mark wins the home run
race, and then comes back and breaks his own record. If there is
one person who will be able to do it, it's him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I face him, I don't isolate on one person. I've never
concentrated on just him.''

HURRICANE ALARMS NEW YORKERS WITH TIES TO CARIBBEAN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Hurricane Georges continued on its destructive
path through the northeastern Caribbean on Tuesday, the storm also
roared to life for millions of people in New York City who have
relatives living in its path.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Martinez spent much of the day Tuesday darting from the
orange street-corner kiosk in the Washington Heights section of
Manhattan where he sells Spanish and English magazines, into a
nearby telephone center to try to reach his family in Santo
Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. After six tries,
Martinez had his first stroke of luck around noon, when he reached
one of his brothers. But the news was not good.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all locked inside,'' said Martinez, 38, referring to
his parents, three children and 10 brothers who all live only a
quarter-mile from the sea. Martinez was also told that the walls of
some houses in his parents' neighborhood were being knocked down by
the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is fear of flooding and the wind,'' he said. ``It is
dangerous for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Martinez, people across New York were searching for news
and beginning to make plans to start relief efforts for relatives
in the islands.
</P>
<P>
   In Puerto Rico, the hurricane leveled buildings and left people
with little water and no electricity. The storm has left at least
10 people dead in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The Dominican Republic was struck by winds of 120 miles per hour
barreling toward Santo Domingo, cutting power and forcing residents
into emergency shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Before Maria Diaz opened the doors to Mony Travel, a travel
agency in Washington Heights that advertises ``llamadas
internacionales'' (``international calls''), a line of anxious men
and women were waiting outside.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane reports brought such a brisk business to the narrow
storefront that Ms. Diaz, 33, had no to time to stop and call her
own family. She said her mother was on vacation in Santo Domingo,
where an older sister of Ms. Diaz lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nervous time,'' she said as she sat behind a counter,
distributing customers' keys to one of the eight telephone booths.
``Everyone wants to hear for themselves what is happening, but not
many calls are getting through.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Diaz tried to dismiss her fears for her family, but they
only intensified as customer after customer returned to the counter
with disappointment in their eyes and fear in their voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid for my family and the country,'' she said. ``It's a
poor place. The houses are not so strong. They cannot survive
something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane unleashed similar fears among other New Yorkers
with ties to the Caribbean, as reports of the toll on Puerto Rico
and smaller islands like St. Kitts, Antigua and Nevis continued to
stream in.
</P>
<P>
   For two days, Sabu Rafael, 19, of Harlem has watched news
footage from Puerto Rico, hoping to catch a glimpse of his
73-year-old grandmother or to at least hear that her neighborhood
survived. ``I've tried to get through but I couldn't through,''
said Rafael, a pet-store manager.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael said he was as nervous about his grandmother as he was
about the damage to Puerto Rico. ``It really hurts to see what
happened. ''
</P>
<P>
   As officials began to calculate the damage, several relief
efforts were already under way in New York. Fernando Ferrer, the
Bronx borough president, and more than a dozen other elected
officials announced a combined relief effort for Puerto Rico and
other Caribbean islands.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to relieve the incredible suffering,'' Ferrer
said. ``Estimates of the damage are mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer asked for donations of water and electrical generators
but discouraged contributions of blankets and clothing. Fire
stations around the city will be used as informal drop-off points
for donations. And in the Bronx, seven hospitals have volunteered
to oversee the collections.
</P>
<P>
   The Caribbean American Chamber of Commerce and Industry, a group
of 1,500 business owners based in Brooklyn Heights, was soliciting
medical supplies, dried food items and money to finance relief
efforts in St. Kitts, where 130 mph winds ripped away the roof of a
major hospital and 70 percent of the homes, and to Antigua, where
at least two people were killed. The donations will be airlifted to
Antigua, which will serve as the distribution point.
</P>
<P>
   ``These islands are so vulnerable,'' said Roy Hastick, the
group's president. ``They depend on the tourism, and to have such a
deadly storm happen now at the beginning of the season is
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   After Hurricane Hugo in 1989, the group sent more than $50,000
to help with relief efforts in the Caribbean. But Hastick said this
hurricane would be more difficult to recover from.
</P>
<P>
   ``This storm has turned the Caribbean into one big disaster
site,'' he said. ``There is damage everywhere.''

 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two prominent Internet pioneers have founded a
company to create a way of navigating the Internet with maps that
portray the relationships between computers and information as
three-dimensional space.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Invisible Worlds Inc., based in Silicon Valley at
Redwood City, is the brainchild of Carl Malamud and Marshall Rose,
both Internet software developers who are credited with helping to
create some of the most widely used technology components of the
global computer network.
</P>
<P>
   The idea underlying the new company is that the current
generation of Internet navigation tools _ portals, search engines
and directories _ make it difficult for users to visualize
dimensions of cyberspace, the virtual universe that has resulted
from the emergence of the Internet and online services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think you should be able to take your mouse or joystick and
drive around the Internet,'' Malamud said. ``One of the reasons the
Web seems so chaotic is there is no way to see it visually.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there are already a number of so-called virtual worlds
and 3-D Internet standards such as Virtual Reality Modeling
Language, or VRML, Malamud said this was the first commercial
effort to build the tools to map the entire Internet.
</P>
<P>
   When it is made available sometime next year, the company's set
of visual rules, known as the Blocks protocol, will make it
possible for computer users to examine locations of and
relationships between Internet computers and network connections
much as they would peruse a map or an atlas.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, users will view the interactive maps using a standard
Web browser. But Malamud said he hoped someday to see the
development of map-viewing software with more powerful
visualization features.
</P>
<P>
   One benefit of a standard mapping protocol for the Internet will
be the possibility of creating many different maps based geography,
subject or almost any other concept.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the new company is planning to create two
demonstration maps, one focusing on financial information and the
other on music and media. However, in addition to selling
advertising or possibly even renting metaphorical space in the
areas it maps, Invisible Worlds is hoping that its new protocol
will create a market for tools, service software and map-viewing
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Malamud nor Rose is a novice at creating Internet
standards. Rose is the author of the Post Office Protocol, or POP,
the standard that is used by millions of Internet computer users
for sending and receiving e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Malamud has developed a number of nonprofit projects including
Internet Talk Radio, the first online station, in 1993. He is
probably best known for his campaign to persuade the U.S.
government to publish public records on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   By posting both the entire text of all Security and Exchange
Commission documents and much of the Patent Office database, he
created public demand that in turn forced those agencies to make
documents publicly available on line at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as an economist, Malamud, 39, said that the idea of
mapping the Internet came to him in 1991 while he was working with
the Internet and using computers and routers dispersed around the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   Because the concept of geographic distance is irrelevant in
cyberspace, which is formed of instantaneous connections, Malamud
began searching for a way to provide the kind of rich, spatially
oriented view of the Internet that maps afford of the physical
world.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although science-fiction writers such as Vernor Vinge, Neal
Stephenson and William Gibson, who coined the term cyberspace in
his 1984 novel ``Neuromancer,'' have all envisioned electronic
worlds emerging from computer networks, Malamud said they did not
inspire the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't read a great deal of science fiction,'' Malamud said.
But he did trace his inspiration to the work of writers such as
Thomas Pynchon, whose most recent novel, ``Mason &AMP; Dixon,''
celebrated the role the cartographer can play in defining uncharted
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Vinton Cerf, who invented Internet protocol, the set of
communications rules that made the Internet possible, said mapping
the Internet was an extremely difficult undertaking that had no
certain outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Carl and Marshall are among the most creative network
citizens that we have,'' said Cerf, now an executive at MCI
Worldcom. He said he had abandoned his own experiments with mapping
multiple dimensions of information into a three-dimensional
representation, finding the problem too daunting.
</P>
<P>
   What Malamud found daunting was searching for support. His
three-year odyssey took him from the United States to Japan and
Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and he said he settled on a for-profit
venture only after his bids to form a nonprofit enterprise to
create an Internet atlas failed to win supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Malamud said he decided to come ``home'' to Silicon Valley,
where he has settled into a small office space near several other
start-up companies.

   CLINTON-REACT (Washington) _ The White House and prominent
Democrats say they have opened an aggressive behind-the-scenes
campaign to save President Clinton from impeachment hearings by
seeking to build support among politicians of both parties for the
president to be harshly rebuked by Congress and perhaps pay a large
fine. By Richard L. Berke.

<P>
   CLINTON-ASSESS (Washington) _ Throughout his hours of testimony
broadcast on Monday, Clinton dodged and weaved and bobbed. It was a
spectacle that would have destroyed most politicians, beamed across
television screens with labels warning of its explicit sexual
content and rife with literally incredible details and denials. It
was recorded in the most secret forum in Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence,
then released to the world by the president's political enemies in
the hope that it would damage him severely. Yet on Tuesday morning,
as he has so often before, Clinton once again bobbed up, buoyed by
a bipartisan consensus among politicians that after months of
bleeding, the president may have finally had a good day. By Todd S.
Purdum.

   PEANUT-BAN (New York) _ Peanut butter is under attack at the
schoolhouse door. Cheap, nutritious, popular and traditional, it
has nonetheless taken its place on the list of substances _ like
asbestos and lead _ that send shivers down the spines of school
administrators. Prodded by activist parents warning of lethal
allergies, by the claims of some researchers that peanut allergies
are on the rise and, not least, by a fear of litigation, growing
numbers of public and private schools across the country, including
many of New York City's independent schools, have banned peanut
butter from their cafeterias.

there are glaring problems with the city's 18-year-old effort to
require inspections and repairs of tall buildings. City officials
acknowledge that laws governing facade maintenance have long
allowed for ineffective, sometimes useless, inspections of many
buildings. And while the officials have made recent efforts to
strengthen the laws, inspection records and interviews with city
officials, engineers, architects and landlords indicate that
numerous problems exist.

   STARWOOD-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ Over the past few years, Barry
Sternlicht, chairman and chief executive of Starwood Hotels and
Resorts Worldwide Inc., has dazzled analysts with his financial
acumen, transforming what had been a sleepy real-estate investment
trust into the world's largest hotel company. Sternlicht's
popularity has waned a good bit on Wall Street recently, because
over the last year Starwood's shares, along with those of other
leisure-time companies, have fallen precipitously. Yet Sternlicht,
who paid $10.2 billion to buy ITT Corp. earlier this year, has the
knack of making into a good deal what superficially looks bad for
Starwood shareholders. By Kenneth N. Gilpin.

sandwiched between the dry cleaners and the shoe repair shops, are
wine stores, and on Saturday afternoons, many of them are opening
bottles of Spanish riojas, or California chardonnays, or Australian
syrahs and pouring them, free of charge, for anyone who takes the
trouble to stop in. In San Francisco, the hedonistic Saturday has
become a ritual, as cars stream across the Golden Gate bridge and
speed toward the vineyards of Napa and Sonoma. New York does not
have the vineyards, but it does have the wine stores, dozens and
dozens of them, and shrewd customers, after making a few phone
calls and drawing up a little list, can map out a personal wine
trail, as I did on a recent Saturday afternoon. By William Grimes.

example. Yes, pizza. Although it is most often known as a

FROM ARCHITECTURAL SHOWMAN TO YALE DEAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not so many years ago, Robert A.M. Stern, the
architect, was peacefully reading behind the privet hedge of his
modest East Hampton ranch house _ his architect friends refer to it
as the ranchburger _ which Stern bought after his divorce, when he
overheard a few people passing by his sign out front. ``My God, he
doesn't really live here, does he?'' Stern heard someone say.
</P>
<P>
   Horrified, the man who has designed for Rockefellers,
Rothschilds and Fords waited five minutes for the offenders to
leave, scurried to pull his ``Robert A.M. Stern'' sign from the
grass, then began renovation plans. Today the house is, to no one's
surprise, a classic Stern shingle-style with a big screened porch
and an evocation of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shoemaker never has time to make shoes for the children,
let alone for himself,'' said Stern, explaining why he lived in
architectural purgatory for so long.
</P>
<P>
   These days people wonder how Stern, one of the biggest
architectural voices in New York City, has time to make any shoes
at all.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 9, Stern began his first day as dean of the Yale School
of Architecture, with a mission to haul the floundering institution
back to glory. His 150-member New York firm, Robert A.M. Stern
Associates, has 10 big houses under way, from an East Hampton
shingle to a California Mediterranean for Ivan Reitman, the
director. (They take two years to build and start at $2 million.)
</P>
<P>
   Stern is also at work on a performing arts center in Houston, a
400-unit apartment building in Battery Park City, a residence hall
at Columbia University and public libraries in Nashville, Miami and
Yonkers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he is finishing up ``New York 1880,'' the fourth in a
five-volume architectural history of New York City. He is on the
board of Disney, played an important role in luring the company to
Times Square, and is trying to have the 1964 Huntington Hartford
building at 2 Columbus Circle, considered by some architects to
look like a giant shower stall, designated a landmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``People associate modernism with commercial crud,'' said Stern,
59. And then, dryly: ``It's very easy to get all the
preservationists to rally if it has molding on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern, a traditionalist, has himself had a lifelong love affair
with molding, and there are complaints at Yale that installing the
Ralph Lauren of architecture _ the view of his critics _ sends the
wrong message about the direction of the school.
</P>
<P>
   But Stern says that ``unlike Louis XIV, Yale is not me'' and
that he will bring in many modernist points of view. His fans
consider him an excellent choice, a tough and decisive
scholar-showman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob has never been short in the chutzpah department,'' said
his longtime friend, Stanley Tigerman, the architect. Friends also
say the appointment will push Stern closer toward the role to which
he aspires, that of architectural statesman, now held by Stern's
onetime Yale professor, Philip Johnson, 92.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was destined for greatness,'' said Johnson, who
added that although Stern's work is ``not my dish of tea,
architecture, like the house of the Lord, has many mansions.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Stern sat still long enough for an interview in his
grand offices at 34th Street and 10th Avenue, with sweeping views
of the Hudson. He was witty and argumentative, thoughtful and glib.
If Stern's calling was politics, he would be a Sunday morning
program's talking head. He often talks in exclamation points.
</P>
<P>
   On the redevelopment of Times Square (his firm did an early
master plan): ``People have this romance of Times Square, as if
somehow Bergdorf Goodman used to be there next to the Metropolitan
Museum of Art. Let's get real. This is New York!''
</P>
<P>
   On building houses for rich people: ``We are a capitalist
society. You need a client.''
</P>
<P>
   On the personality of architects: ``To build anything, you have
to think differently. It is fundamentally an arrogant act. That
little drawing becomes 45 stories high. Hundreds of people work in
that building, thousands pass through it. This is not for shrinking
violets. This is not about having a bad season when you pick the
wrong hemline. This is serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern got serious when he was 13 and told his parents he would
be an architect. His inspiration was the sight of Manhattan from
Brooklyn's subways. ``It was like a mountain range of pinnacled
peaks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is uncharacteristically close-mouthed about his Brooklyn
childhood, and about his father, who sold insurance. ``He was not
one of the world's most successful businessmen,'' Stern said.
``Let's not go into it.''
</P>
<P>
   (Tigerman tried to explain Stern's reticence: ``My parents were
very poor, so at some level I was embarrassed because I hung out
with rich people. Does that say a lot of good things about me? No.
But you don't talk about it. So he has some frailties. So what?'')
</P>
<P>
   Stern went to Columbia and then the Yale School of Architecture,
where he was Johnson's protege. His first house was a 1967 shingle
in Montauk inspired by Robert Venturi, the post-modernist
architect. He is divorced from Lynn Solinger, a Gimbel, and has one
son. Architecture seems to be his true love.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the swaggering developers, they know about money,'' he
said. ``But you give them a shape. It's a tremendous power.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern had one request: ``Make me funny and charming, but don't
break my fabulous visage.''

CONVICTED KILLER ARRESTED AGAIN IN FRANCE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Mass.)  (jw) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ira Einhorn, an anti-establishment leader who has
spent the last 17 years in Europe as a fugitive from justice in the
murder of his girlfriend in Philadelphia in 1977, has been arrested
again in France and faces possible extradition to the United
States, a government official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said of
the government's efforts to persuade France to extradite Einhorn:
``We are very grateful for the help of the French government. We
have never given up.''
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn's lawyers said they would fight the extradition.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Einhorn, a lecturer who once held a Kennedy Fellowship
at Harvard University, was convicted in absentia of first-degree
murder in the death of Holly Maddux, whose mummified body was found
in a trunk in Einhorn's closet in his home in Philadelphia. He was
sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   After fleeing in 1981, Einhorn lived in Britain, Switzerland,
Spain, Denmark and Sweden, before settling in the French village of
Champagne-Mouton, northeast of Bordeaux. He has denied killing Ms.
Maddux, maintaining that he had been framed.
</P>
<P>
   The case has drawn the attention of the highest levels of the
U.S. government. On a trip to France, Attorney General Janet Reno
discussed it with her French counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Norris Gelman, a lawyer for Einhorn, said in Philadelphia that
several issues would be raised in opposing extradition, including a
challenge to the validity of a new Pennsylvania law that would have
the effect of granting Einhorn a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legislature cannot grant a new trial,'' Gelman said.
``Only a court can grant a new trial. It violates the separation of
powers. New trials are for the courts, not the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Simon, another lawyer for Einhorn, said in
Philadelphia, ``Under the U.S.-French extradition treaty, the law
that is applied is the law of the country in which the person is
being held.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Simon said, French law requires that a person
tried in absentia, convicted and then arrested ``will be given a
new trial upon the mere asking.''
</P>
<P>
   When Einhorn was first arrested last year and then freed when a
French court refused to allow his extradition, the Pennsylvania law
did not have the provision for a new trial upon the defendant's
request. So the Pennsylvania Legislature passed a law bringing the
state's provision of a retrial on request in line with French law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislative branch has the power to pass laws,'' Simon
said, ``but it is not empowered to grant new trials. That is in the
power of the judiciary.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Simon said, Einhorn, if extradited to Pennsylvania, could
find the courts unwilling to grant him a new trial under
legislative edict. He asked, framing the question that would be
raised at the extradition hearing: ``Can the French be confident
that he absolutely will be given a new trial in the same manner
that a Frenchman would be given a new trial?''
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn, now in his late 50s, is a different person to different
people. To Gelman, one of his lawyers, he is a crusading
environmentalist and a brilliant political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   To his followers in Philadelphia, he was a pacifist who
enchanted his audiences with lectures about psychic weapons,
psychedelic drugs and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   But to Ms. Maddux's relatives, who have pressed the Philadelphia
authorities to bring her killer to justice, he is a person whose
jailing would bring them the peace and closure they crave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing you can never shake in your life is your
conscience,'' Meg Wakeman, Ms. Maddux's sister, told The
Philadelphia Inquirer this year. ``You can shake the authorities,
you can shake your friends, you can fly from country to country _
on someone else's dime, I might add _ but you just can't get rid of
that conscience. And one of these days, his conscience just might
catch up with him.''
</P>
<P>
   To Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham he is simply a
murderer who needs to pay the price for his crime. In an interview
on the A&AMP;E cable television network this year, Ms. Abraham said,
``I will hunt him down to the ends of the earth.''

   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ Battered overnight by what
meteorologists describe as the strongest storm to hit this
Caribbean island in 70 years, Puerto Rico struggled Tuesday to
begin repairing at least a billion dollars in damage inflicted by
Hurricane Georges, which continued its slow march westward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a major onslaught,'' Gov. Pedro Rossello said
Tuesday morning, as the last traces of the storm were still
pounding the western coast. ``We have severe damage, impassable
roads, no power and a high probability of flooding. We are going to
have to start from zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as residents were cleaning up their homes and businesses,
Georges swept across the neighboring island of Hispaniola,
battering both the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Santo Domingo, the
Dominican capital, was largely unprepared. Forecasters had expected
the storm to hit the northern coast, but Georges changed course and
headed straight for the city of 3 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Dominican officials reported 11 deaths, uprooted trees and
severe flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists said the storm could hit the Florida Keys by late
Thursday or early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Georges has been blamed for at least 20 deaths across the
Caribbean, including five in Puerto Rico, and the toll is expected
to rise as reports came in from isolated areas.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello described the hurricane, the eighth to strike Puerto
Rico in the past 100 years, as the worst in decades. Local
forecasters said the storm was the most powerful to strike the
island since the San Felipe hurricane of Sept. 13, 1928.
</P>
<P>
   Winds of 115 mph left the island virtually without electricity.
Nearly 80 percent of its 3.8 million residents were without water,
and many also had no telephone service, especially on the southern
coast. In the U.S. Virgin Islands just east of here, similar
problems were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Radio and television stations said that five people died _ three
in a landslide and two from heart attacks _ as the hurricane moved
across Puerto Rico Monday night and early Tuesday at 14 mph. Police
and other officials said they could not confirm the reports.
</P>
<P>
   After an inspection tour Tuesday, Rossello estimated that the
damage was at least a billion dollars. Government officials said
total damages are likely to exceed the cost of Hurricane Hugo,
which struck northeastern Puerto Rico in 1989. President Clinton
has declared both Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to be disaster
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hurricane Service in Miami said mountain ranges in
those countries were dissipating some of the storm's strength, but
warned that Georges could regain force once it gets out over the
warm open waters of the Caribbean again.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's future path remains uncertain. Meteorologists said
Georges, a dangerous category 3 storm with winds now at 120 mph,
could strike anywhere from central Cuba to the Bahamas, which along
with Turks and Caicos are already under a hurricane warning.
</P>
<P>
   According to Steve Feuer, a meteorologist with the Hurricane
Research Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, Georges is expected to leave Hispaniola by early
Wednesday morning. He said it was ``very uncertain'' if and when it
would hit Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a less than 20 percent chance at this point,'' Feuer
said. ``We have no great certainty''
</P>
<P>
   As a precautionary measure, authorities in Monroe County, Fla.,
which includes Key West and most of the Everglades, declared a
state of emergency and ordered a mandatory evacuation as of
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're an island community,'' said Mary Reich, a county
commissioner. ``We're used to these things.'' There are no
hurricane shelters in the Florida Keys, she said, and only one
highway that connects with the rest of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Georges caused extensive damage to housing and public buildings
on the eastern Caribbean islands on Sunday, with 70 percent of the
homes in St. Kitts and Nevis, the smallest country in the Western
Hemisphere, said to be affected. The storm was reported to have
killed three people there and two more in nearby Antigua and
Barbuda, as well as one in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The flow of emergency assistance was slowed because Luis Munoz
Marin International Airport here was still being cleared during the
day. American Airlines said, however, that it expects commercial
flights to resume on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, Rossello and a representative of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency made a swing through the San Juan
metropolitan area, home to about one-third of Puerto Rico's
population. Nearly everywhere they turned, they encountered scenes
of destruction and flooding.
</P>
<P>
   In San Juan, thousands of trees had toppled, taking street
lights and power and other utility lines with them, while near the
eastern suburb of Loiza, a river had overflowed its banks. Streets
were littered with debris, much of it metal signs, shutters and
awnings ripped from windows and walls by the force of the storm.
But residents were already out with brooms, carts and pickup trucks
to haul the rubble away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had had 300 people in shelters during the hurricane, but
that's going to change dramatically,'' said Victor Soto, mayor of
the San Juan suburb of Toa Baja. ``A lot of people here have lost
the roofs on their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardest-hit region was said to be the mountainous interior
of the island. There as much as 20 inches of rain fell during
Georges' slow passage across houses of wood and zinc.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was much worse than Hurricane Hugo,'' said Juan Marrero,
a resident of the San Juan suburb of Catano, which experienced
extensive flooding. ``Just in the area around where I lived, we've
got more than 30 houses that have no roof anymore. I'm all right,
thank God, except for some damage to the store I own, but those
people have lost everything.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Georges cut off cell phone and phone communication to
the south coast ``This is the worst storm that Salinas has seen in
its history,'' said the mayor of Salinas, Basilio Baerga, on
Tuesday morning, as he was trying to assess the damage to his town.
Baerga said there was at least one death in his town attributed to
Georges _ a blind man who apparently suffered a heart attack as
Georges began hitting this south coast town. He could not provide
further details.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane also damaged the town's popular harbor district
and the town's marina. ``The only thing left is the piling,'' said
67-year-old Bill Williams, who lives on a sailboat docked here.
</P>
<P>
   Many barrio residents took refuge in one of the town's municipal
shelters. ``I lost everything,'' said 46-year-old Onelia Malave of
Barrio Carmen, who rode out the storm at a shelter in the Luis
Munos Rivera school with her three children. ``We have no roof and
everything is wet.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not an easy night at the shelter, however, as heavy rains
flooded rooms, and heavy winds uprooted a huge banyan tree beside
the school. ``That tree has been there since 1925, the year the
school was built,'' said school director Lillian Torres. ``It was a
frightening night.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cayey, in the mountainous part of the island, the lush
vegetation had been turned into greenish-brown confetti by Tuesday
morning. All along highway 1, its main road, houses and businesses
were torn down or turned into twisted hulks of metal and wood.
</P>
<P>
   By 2 p.m., residents seeking to file damage claims had already
formed a long line that wrapped around the municipal stadium, which
was also damaged significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the eye passed over, it was silent. And then you could
hear it coming again. It sounded like a tractor-trailer running
down the highway, said 46-year-old Frank Vega of the storm's
approach. The storm toppled Vega's truck, filled with hay and eggs,
and sent his car sliding into a cement building. ``We got hit
bad,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A warehouse for the town's medical center was also destroyed in
the storm, along with the medicine inside it. Civil Defense
officials were evacuating residents of an old-age home which was
also damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is wet, everything is ruined,'' said Brunilda
Milian, 43, who passed the storm in her wooden home with her
husband and 10 children. The yard behind her house was filled with
the carcasses of dead poultry, which were raised commercially by
her husband. With a machete in hand, he was still trying to
calculate the extent of his loss.

MANDELA, AT WHITE HOUSE, SAYS WORLD BACKS CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nelson Mandela, the president of South Africa and
among the planet's foremost moral authorities, gave President
Clinton the kind of emotional endorsement Wednesday night that he
has trouble getting these days from members of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   At a White House reception, Mandela said that the domestic
debates of the United States were not his business but that his
personal code did not allow him to desert a friend. He said South
Africa, Africa and the entire world supported Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do wish to say that President Clinton is a friend of South
Africa and Africa,'' he said, ``and, I believe, the friend of the
great mass of black people, and the minorities and the disabled of
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that ``we are thinking of you in this difficult and
discouraging time in your life,'' Mandela recalled receiving a
telephone call two days ago from Frederick Chiluba, the president
of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Mandela, I want you to support President Clinton,'
'' Mandela said. ``He was not speaking for himself, and he said so.
He said, `I am speaking for the continent of Africa.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, clearly moved, smiled during Mandela's remarks, and
appeared at one point to wipe away a tear.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela was repeatedly interrupted with applause from an
audience of black religious leaders, presidents of historically
black colleges and members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Black
Americans have been among the president's most loyal supporters
since he acknowledged an inappropriate relationship with Monica S.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Mandela again said he would not ``interfere in the
domestic affairs of this country,'' his audience was laughing,
convinced that he was doing just that. Mandela described the
standing ovation that Clinton received on Monday from the United
Nations General Assembly. ``If you judge from the reaction'' of the
delegates, he said, ``the United States is completely isolated on
this question.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mandela seemed to entertain the possibility that Clinton's
presidency might not survive this scandal. ``If our expectations,
if our fondest prayers and dreams, are not realized,'' he said,
``then we should all bear in mind that the greatest glory of living
lies not in never falling but in rising every time you fall.''
</P>
<P>
   In introducing Mandela, Clinton thanked him ``for being the
person we'd all like to be _ on our best day.''

 &HT;    A visit to Bill might be just what Georges needs
 &HT;    By Frank Cerabino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I knew I shouldn't be going to see Bill.
</P>
<P>
   I should be going to Home Depot. I should be trying to beat the
storm surge of panic hurricane shoppers. I should be buying anchor
bolts so I'd be ready just in case I have to put those aluminum
panels over the windows in the back of my house.
</P>
<P>
   I shouldn't be driving on Broadway in West Palm Beach, looking
for the storefront shop specializing in occult religious items.
</P>
<P>
   I shouldn't be seeking the counsel of store owner Bill Kennedy.
The last time I spoke to Bill, he sold me something called Luck In
A Hurry Oil and an Alleged Money Drawing Candle.
</P>
<P>
   No, I didn't win the Lotto that week. But maybe I didn't follow
his detailed instructions as carefully as I should have.
</P>
<P>
   So I'm back. Call me an optimist.
</P>
<P>
   ``What have you got for a hurricane?'' I ask, after walking into
St. Benedict Religious Store.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hurricane?'' Bill says, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, to keep one away,'' I say, sparing him the details about
what a chore it is to put up those aluminum panels.
</P>
<P>
   Bill's got stuff for just about everything. There are voodoo
dolls, powders and potions for enemies, and something called Bend
Over Oil for folks you'd like to know better.
</P>
<P>
   I figured he must have some hurricane repellant in the store.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, I'm not prone to humoring the occult. But I'm ready to
make an exception.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of immersing myself in the Weather Channel and
its constant scientific nattering, I've had my fill of upper-level
shearing, cones of probability and well-defined eye walls.
</P>
<P>
   I want answers. And I want them now.
</P>
<P>
   Bill gets my hopes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no spirits in the air yet,'' he tells me, looking
out his window.
</P>
<P>
   Bill says hurricanes are basically controlled by one main spirit
who stays in the eye while a crew of other dead spirits swirl
around the outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like an army,'' he says. ``Normally, you'll see the
workers floating in the clouds about 24 to 36 hours before it
hits,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do they look like?'' I ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``People,'' he says. ``Only bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   But I won't be able to see them, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only certain people can see them,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   (I had an aunt like that. They let her out on weekends.)
</P>
<P>
   ``But wait a minute, Bill,'' I say. ``That's no help at all. The
scientists will know where the hurricane is going to hit when it's
24 hours away. I need to know now. And if it's coming here, I need
to know if there's something you sell that will make the hurricane
go someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill says he can't help me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody fools with Mother Nature,'' he says. ``The only thing
any human being can do is pray to the god they've been serving.''
</P>
<P>
   Too mainstream occult for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about using some of those blue pellets you have over
there?'' I ask.
</P>
<P>
   The ``bluing'' pellets ($3.50) allegedly ward off evil by
turning your bath water blue before you hop in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Won't work,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Neither would the Seven Holy Spirit Sand, the Black Salt or the
Deliverance Oil _ even in the $12.95 size.
</P>
<P>
   They only work for people problems, not Hurricane Georges
problems, Bill explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you've got nothing!'' I say. ``You can't just start
sprinkling all this stuff in the street and make all these
hurricane spirits go away?''
</P>
<P>
   Bill shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of evil in South Florida,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does that mean?'' I ask. ``You mean, if we get a
hurricane, it's because we deserve it? You're starting to sound
like Pat Robertson.''
</P>
<P>
   I think I've hurt Bill's feelings with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do me a favor, Bill,'' I say, patching things up before
leaving. ``If the spirits start showing up in the clouds, give me a
call.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I'm going to Home Depot.

 &HT;    NCR to make changes in employee coverages, benefits
 &HT;    By Angela Townsend
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Dayton-based NCR Corp., long considered a
business anomaly with its rich employee benefits program, is
catching up with the times.
</P>
<P>
   Influenced in large part by rising health-care costs, NCR this
week is telling employees and retirees they will be responsible for
part of their health-care costs, starting next year. Among the
changes:
</P>
<P>
   Employees have not had to pay any portion of their health-care
coverage. Starting Jan. 1, individual employees will pay 10 percent
through payroll deduction; employees with dependents will pay for
30 percent of their coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-pocket expenses for generic and brand-name prescription
drugs will go to $10 and $20, up from $5 and $10, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   NCR will cut the number of HMOs to 53, from 70, eliminating HMO
contracts with low enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   The dental deductible for basic and major care (but not
preventive care, which is covered with no deductible) will be
increased to $50 from $20 per individual in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Employees hired on or after Jan. 1 will not longer be offered
retiree medical coverage. Current employees will not have retiree
medical coverage before age 65 unless they meet specific age and
service requirements.
</P>
<P>
   No changes to retiree medical coverage for current retirees age
65 and older were announced.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, NCR spent more than $70 million on medical, dental and
prescription drug benefits for employees and their dependents.
Employers nationally spent more than $262 billion on group health
insurance in 1996, according to the Washington, D.C.-based Employee
Benefits Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, NCR decided to study what similar companies were
doing. ``We found that we're the only company in the technology
industry that was not asking for employee contributions,'' said
spokesman Michael Tarpey. ``Lexis-Nexis, Reynolds &AMP; Reynolds and
Standard Register all ask their employees to contribute to the cost
of medical benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   NCR is making the changes to remain competitive while continuing
to address its employees' needs, Tarpey said, adding that the
company expects to save about $30 million annually with the health
care benefits changes.
</P>
<P>
   Single employees under the NCR Core Plan will contribute on
average $13.25 per month; employees with one dependent, $66 per
month; employees with two or more dependents, $104 per month.
</P>
<P>
   NCR's change in policy follows the trend of companies nationwide
bracing for what they fear will be skyrocketing health-care costs,
said Ken McConnell, a research analyst with EBRI.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Ludwig, secretary/treasurer of the NCR Retiree Assurance
Association, said the changes were not unexpected, especially since
NCR had consulted with employees and retirees.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're doing is fair. Nobody is excited about having to
make contributions to their benefits, but on the other hand, it's
very common,'' said Ludwig, 65, an NCR employee for 42 years before
retiring in 1994. ``NCR for so long had done so much above the
competition and many other companies. Our number one concern is
that the company remain successful.

 &HT;    PAX TV: Poor Nielsen ratings based on bad data
 &HT;    By Marguerite M. Plunkett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The first national Nielsen television
ratings for PAX TV came in Tuesday at less than half the network's
estimates, with all its new and rerun prime-time shows rating at
the bottom of the 122-program national list.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson Communications, however, says the numbers don't include
all the households it reaches.
</P>
<P>
   PAX drew an average 0.5 rating for its prime-time programming
for the week of Sept. 14-20, according to Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   The number means that half of 1 percent of U.S. homes with TV
sets _ or 529,000 households _ tuned in to the new network.
</P>
<P>
   But West Palm Beach-based Paxson (AMEX: PAX, $9.75), which has
been estimating a 1 to 1.2 average national rating for prime time,
said Nielsen's numbers were incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   The national survey did not count all the areas PAX is serving,
according to Rob Hebenstreit, Paxson vice president of research.
Nielsen's numbers were preliminary and released before Paxson had
verified them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hebenstreit said he had a Nielsen letter in hand that
acknowledged the ratings did not reflect PAX's full coverage. He
would not release the letter, however.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, he said, cited one example of 40 cable systems that
had not been counted in the Nielsen ratings.
</P>
<P>
   However, Nielsen spokeswoman Anne Elliot said she was not aware
of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen did not release national numbers for Paxson before this
week because it had difficulty determining where PAX TV was airing,
and when.
</P>
<P>
   Hebenstreit said Paxson wanted the figures released for its
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping that Nielsen's systems were in place,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen measures all networks nightly and weekly, drawing
information from two different groups of metered television sets
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen has been providing overnight ratings of PAX since the
family-oriented network debuted Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   PAX drew a 2.4 overnight rating in the West Palm Beach market
for its first day in existence.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Paxson estimated its ratings at about 1.4
nationally. The latter was an average of the 31 markets Nielsen
measured PAX in, after each market was weighted according to
population.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson has said it needs an average 1 rating 1 percent of
households with televisions over the year to be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   All nine of PAX's prime-time shows, including weekend movies,
finished at the bottom of the individual show ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Reruns of Touched by an Angel, Diagnosis Murder and Dr. Quinn,
Medicine Woman finished tied for 114th, with a 0.6 rating. PAX's
original programming was led by Neon Rider, tied for 118th at a 0.4
rating and Flipper: The New Adventures, at 121 with a 0.3 rating.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 rated show for the week was the CBS Sunday night
movie, The Marriage Fool, which drew a 14 rating.
</P>
<P>
   The weekly Nielsen ratings showed that an average 0.3 percent of
people over 2 years old in households with televisions or 738,000
people tuned in to PAX during the week. The percentage of adults 18
to 49 was 0.2, representing 273,000 viewers.
</P>
<P>
   PAX's average prime-time rating of 0.5 percent compared with ABC
at a rating of 8.1; CBS, 7.9; NBC, 7.5; Fox, 6.2; WB, 2.5; and UPN,
1.9.
</P>
<P>
   PAX airs on WPXP-Channel 67 in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson owns, operates or is affiliated with 95 stations in the
nation in markets with more than 76 million TV households.

   WASHINGTON _ The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in
Cincinnati will make its public debut this weekend, kicking off a
civil rights lecture series and presenting the first International
Freedom Conductor Award to civil rights crusader Rosa Parks.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ohio celebrates its bicentennial in 2003, the
Freedom Center's planned interactive museum will tell the story of
the Underground Railroad, the clandestine network of abolitionists
who harbored fleeing slaves in pre-Civil War America.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the Cincinnati-based center came from the National
Conference for the Community and Justice, formerly the National
Conference of Christians and Jews. The group adopted the
Underground Railroad's timeless civil rights story as a way to
commemorate its 50th anniversary, and is planning the museum as a
way to spread the railroad's message. Construction on the museum is
to begin in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   John Fleming, director of the National Afro-American Museum in
Wilberforce and recently appointed director of the Freedom Center,
said the center will help people understand the contributions of
the Underground Railroad, explain how the secret network ferried
slaves out of the south, and serve as a central clearinghouse of
Underground Railroad information for scholars and preservationists.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than showcasing artifacts, the center will take visitors
through the harrowing experience of an escape. Virtual reality
combined with historical accounts of fugitives and those who helped
them will tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not primarily a collecting institution,'' said current
director Ed Ringaud. ``What we're trying to do is become one of the
key partners to the National Park Service on the network.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, Congress passed a bill placing Underground Railroad
sites under the protection of the National Park Service. The next
step is to establish the network the bill created and link
Underground Railroad sites to each other and to the Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   While the Freedom Center has no official government ties, it
could help in the effort. The bill's authors, U.S. Reps. Louis
Stokes, D-Cleveland, and Rob Portman, R-Cincinnati, said the
center, working with the National Park Service, would be able to
provide the technological and scholarly resources needed for the
network's base of operations.
</P>
<P>
   Ringaud said the museum will have a database of sites and
encourage partons to visit the sites to bring the story to life.
</P>
<P>
   The lecture series and civil rights award help spread the
humanitarian ideals that drove the Underground Railroad and honor
those who still fight for freedom, Ringaud said.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Appeals Judge A. Leon Higginbotham will give the
inaugural lecture on Friday, followed by the presentation of the
International Freedom Conductor Award to Parks on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Higginbotham served as an international mediator for the
1994 elections in South Africa, and was appointed commissioner of
President Clinton's U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, Parks touched off the contemporary push for civil
rights when she refused to surrender her seat on a Montgomery, Ala.
bus to a white passenger. Her open defiance of the city's Jim Crow
segregation laws sparked a 381-day bus boycott by the city's black
community.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom Center will cost an estimated $80 million dollars,
and many local sources have already pledged support, Ringaud said.
Cincinnati will give $6 million and Hamilton County will pay for
the garage-foundation on which the museum will be built.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom Center, along with other organizations wanting to
tell the story of the Underground Railroad, could soon be eligible
to share in $24 million from a grant program proposed by U.S. Sen.
Mike DeWine, R-Ohio. The money, added to a federal education bill,
will be distributed over five years to groups dedicated to
educating people about the Underground Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations would have to raise 80 percent of their project's
total cost to qualify for the grant. Other government sources could
contribute up to 20 percent of the matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   Some preservationists, including Cathy Nelson, state coordinator
the Ohio Underground Railroad Association, said an 80 percent match
is too high for local organizations trying to restore the houses,
roads and other buildings used by the railroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a countless number of authentic sites,'' Nelson said.
``I'm not for creating something new. I want to preserve what we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Boesel, a spokesman for DeWine, said the educational
money is just the first step in getting organizations the money
they need to preserve the history of the railroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the beginning,'' Boesel said. ``Now that you have
something on the books, it's much easier to go back and get more.''

 &HT;    Recreating history the hard way
 &HT;    By Shannon Joyce
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the thousands of slaves who reached Ohio on their way to
freedom in Canada, Anthony Cohen will have traveled almost 800
miles, through forests and rivers, by the time he reaches Dayton,
Ohio on Nov. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, an Underground Railroad historian, is retracing the steps
of slaves who fled to north to freedom in pre-Civil War America.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, 34, left Mobile, Ala., on Sept. 1 and is making his way
to Windsor, Ont. He's due to pass through Oxford, Ohio Nov. 1 and
Dayton Nov. 4, although at this time he has no specific activities
planned to mark his time here.
</P>
<P>
   It's Cohen's second trek along the railroad. In 1996, he
retraced a path from Maryland to Canada. Along the way, he talked
to locals and historians, gathering railroad facts and folklore, as
well as a sense of what it was like to travel such a long distance.
</P>
<P>
   He recorded the last journey in a book due out in February. He
hopes to turn this one into a film documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Zuri Walker, director of Cohen's North Star Foundation, said
Cohen is a marathon runner and is well-prepared for the trip, but
he doesn't have to do it all on foot. He can use any means of
transportation available to fleeing slaves, including boats,
trains, horses and buggies.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who has a B.A. in American Studies from the American
University in Washington, D.C., has advised the National Park
Service on Underground Railroad history. North Star, a non-profit
organization Cohen founded, is devoted to restoring the safe houses
used in the Underground Railroad. North Star is paying for Cohen's
trip through private donations.

 &HT;    Perez's HR, steal spark Braves
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A $60 million baseball machine was commandeered by a
reserve catcher with a hero's grin and the gait of a burro. Tuesday
night belonged to Eddie Perez.
</P>
<P>
   With the Braves mystified by Florida rookie Rafael Medina, who
struck out a career-high eight in seven innings, Perez hit the home
run that determined the game and broke the single-season franchise
record. It was also Perez who stole the first base of his career in
the seventh and then beat one of the best arms in the league to
score a big insurance run.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that he had to be refreshed on what the steal sign
was by first-base coach Pat Corrales. Never mind that his homer
cleared the left field wall by the length of his bat. The Braves
beat the Marlins 4-1 on Eddie's night.
</P>
<P>
   Shaking his head, he said, ``I should take off these shoes, put
them in a box and send them right to the Hall of Fame. I should
take the bag with me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' said manager Bobby Cox, ``Eddie was movin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozzie Guillen picked up a pair of two-out RBIs, Michael Tucker
added another and starter Kevin Millwood had enough to win his 17th
game, though he worked just five innings to get it. Millwood
(17-8), destined for the bullpen in the postseason, finished strong
with a third straight victory, allowing only five runs in his last
24 innings (1.88 ERA) while tying Greg Maddux in the victory
column.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that leaves me about 180 wins less than he has in his
career,'' Millwood said. ``I'm even with him right now, but that's
not saying a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventeen. Amazing,'' said Cox. ``Just amazing. I mean, he's
got the stuff to do it, but it's just amazing your fifth starter
can win that many games in the number of starts he gets (29), which
ain't that many.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez's homer in the fifth was the Braves' 208th, breaking the
32-year-old club record. His stolen base in the seventh enabled him
to score the Braves' third run, beating the arm of right fielder
Mark Kotsay, who is tied with Andruw Jones for the major-league
lead with 19 outfield assists. Cox had only allowed Perez to
attempt a steal once in his first 207 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat had to tell me the signal,'' he said. ``Maybe it was the
last chance in my life to get the green light. So I took off, man.
I'm not going to stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves bullpen continued its late-season surge with four
scoreless innings and has allowed one earned run in its last 19
innings. Kerry Ligtenberg recorded his 30th save, becoming the
first rookie to reach 30 since Todd Worrell saved 36 for St. Louis
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't expecting to get the numbers I got too,'' said
Ligtenberg, who is unscored on in his last nine appearances. ``When
I got my 15th (on Aug. 1), I was kind of hoping to get to 20 by the
end of the season.''

<P>
   MASERU, Lesotho _ South African troops rolled into this tiny
mountainous kingdom early Tuesday morning to put a quick end to
political turmoil that had brought the government to a standstill.
Instead, the invading force met surprisingly heavy resistance from
Lesotho soldiers who oppose the government. They took to the hills
and brought relentless fire on the South Africans.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day perhaps 30 people were dead, including as
many as 10 South Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting could be heard near the army barracks northeast of this
city, where the Lesotho soldiers had set fire to the tall grass and
then escaped into the craggy hills nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the South Africans tried to lift their wounded into
helicopters near the base, they came under heavy fire and had to
stop the evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the South African soldiers also set off a day of
looting and burning. By early afternoon, every other building
seemed to be on fire and thick plumes of acrid smoke darkened the
streets and rose high above the city. The pavement was littered
with goods the looters had dropped, a brand-new sneaker here, a
pink sofa pillow there. It was clear that no matter what the
outcome of South Africa's action, much of Maseru had been
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's action in this country _ a land the size of
Maryland, with a population of 2 million, completely surrounded by
South Africa _ marked the first time that President Nelson
Mandela's government has taken part in military intervention beyond
its borders. Even before the deaths, South Africa's opposition
parties were raising questions about the justification of the
venture in Lesotho (pronounced leh-SOO-too).
</P>
<P>
   Under apartheid, South Africa frequently meddled in its
neighbors' business. But since its first all-race elections in
1994, South Africa had stuck to a policy of looking for negotiated
solutions to Africa's conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   South African officials said they had sent more than 600
soldiers into Lesotho because they were asked to by Prime Minister
Pakalitha Mosisili, who believed a coup was imminent. For weeks the
country had been crippled by protesters who assert that the
country's May elections, won overwhelmingly by the ruling party,
were rigged.
</P>
<P>
   But the presence of South African soldiers here seemed to elicit
nothing but rage among Lesotho citizens. South African-owned
business were singled out for attack and cars with South African
license plates were stoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not the way to solve our problems,'' said Mohamed
Yunes, who was standing in front of a building he owns on Kingsway
Street here watching looters breaking windows and setting fires.
``We've never had anything like this before. What are they doing
here? What is their plan? We will all be ruined when they are
through.''
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's minister for safety and security, Sydney
Mufamadi, said at a news conference in Pretoria that the
intervention, under the auspices of the 14-nation Southern African
Development Community, had been on the drawing board for weeks and
would continue until ``all the parties involved had agreed that
stability had returned.'' Botswana is also supposed to have
supplied troops for the action.
</P>
<P>
   Mufamadi said that six Lesotho soldiers had been killed in the
fighting so far. But later reports counted as many as 17. Army
officials said there had been heavy fighting near the barracks and
the Lesotho dam, which supplies electricity to the country.
</P>
<P>
   At least five civilians have also been reported dead. By
midafternoon, a steady stream of refugees _ mostly foreigners _
could be seen trying to get across the border into South Africa,
their cars crammed with belongings.
</P>
<P>
   A freelance photographer, Greg Marinovich, a Pulitzer Prize
winner, was shot in the leg during the melee, and a South African
Broadcasting Corporation cameraman was also wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Lesotho, an impoverished country that was once a British
protectorate, is greatly dependent on South Africa. The nation had
been in political turmoil since results of elections were contested
by the losing party almost immediately after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Lesotho Congress Party won 79 of 80 Parliament seats.
But a report by a commission of representatives from South Africa,
Botswana and Zimbabwe last week cited ``serious concerns'' about
the voting. It did not however call for new elections. South Africa
has been trying to mediate between the two parties, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the chaos in the country has been intensifying.
Anti-government protesters had been hijacking government vehicles
to use them to block traffic in downtown. And one army general has
been forced to resign at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the opposition party, Vincent Malebo, condemned
South Africa's action as a ``heartless'' attempt by South Africa to
beat Lesotho into submission. He said the military action was
poorly thought out, and had failed to cope with the burning and
looting.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly hours went by when there was looting but little sign
of a South African presence in downtown Maseru. Fires roared
unattended and the heat caused glass windows to explode onto the
sidewalk. Lesotho police officers walked by looters without
uttering a word.
</P>
<P>
   South African soldiers appeared stunned by the resistance they
encountered. On the road leading to the barracks, a dozen South
African armored vehicles seemed to be patrolling without much
purpose, taking heavy fire from many directions. Amidst the fire,
an armored medical unit was treating a half dozen wounded soldiers.
Three others were dead.
</P>
<P>
   One of the wounded soldiers said the Lesotho soldiers had so far
outmaneuvered them. ``They lit all these fires and then they
scattered to the hills,'' the soldier said. ``They are at home in
those hills, we are not. ''

UNIVERSITIES FINDING A SHARP RISE IN COMPUTER-AIDED CHEATING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Va., S.C., Mass., Calif., Ill., Iowa)  (jw) 
 By IAN ZACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKSBURG, Va. _ In a troubling reminder of technology's darker
side, Virginia Tech, the state's largest university, has
acknowledged that computer-aided cheating by students is growing
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot more cases,'' said Leon Geyer, who oversees
the student-run honor system at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
State University, which has 25,000 students. ``In the olden days,
you had to copy from the book. Now, you just copy and paste.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the university say that the number of cheating
complaints has grown to 280 last year from 80 in 1995-96. Those
complaints include reports of plagiarizing information from the
Internet, sharing answers or other information by e-mail or
diskette and stealing information from a fellow student's computer
screen or electronic mail system.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech is not the only university experiencing growth in
such incidents or worrying about how to detect and prevent them.
The personal computer, while enhancing teaching, has made cheating
as simple as pointing and clicking a mouse or exchanging a floppy
disk with the answers to a take-home test.
</P>
<P>
   Stealing or copying someone's work has become so effortless,
some say, that students may be inured to the ethical or legal
consequences, much like drivers exceeding the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say everyone in the class has a networked computer,''
said Chris Duckenfield, vice provost for computing and information
technology at Clemson University in South Carolina. ``They can
exchange information electronically. They can pull down information
electronically. Who's going to watch over every student's shoulder
to see what they're doing?''
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Boston University was so concerned about computer
cheating that it filed a federal lawsuit to stop eight companies
from selling term papers over the Internet in Massachusetts. The
university's action came a quarter century after the institution
successfully sued term-paper mills hawking typewritten papers out
of Volkswagen buses in Cambridge. The state now bans the sale of
printed term papers.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of California at Berkeley, a computer science
professor, Alex Aiken, created software to identify plagiarism in
his programming courses. He placed the software, called Moss, for
Measure of Software Similarity, on the Internet (at
www.cs.berkeley.edu/aiken/moss.html) and it is now used by more
than 500 professors at universities worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Aiken attributes the rise to the anonymity of electronic
communication, the vast resources of the Internet and the
ever-multiplying speed of computers. ``The fact that you can do it
more quickly makes it easier to yield to an impulse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is apparently what happened to the president of the student
union at Oxford University in England, who was expelled after the
university determined she had cheated on a final examination by
downloading an essay she had written earlier.
</P>
<P>
   At Virginia Tech last spring, dozens of students in a
computer-programming course _ roughly 10 percent of a class of 600
_ were accused of electronically sharing information on a year-end
assignment. And recently, two graduating seniors downloaded another
students' work to turn in as their own computer programming
assignment. A piece of software similar to Aiken's found them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem to be an increasing problem because it is so much
easier,'' said Amanda Rich, a 21-year-old Virginia Tech senior from
Clinton, Ill., who is chief justice of the university's honor
system court, where accused cheaters are tried.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rich said some incidents were obvious cases of wrongdoing,
while others appear to be ignorance by students who do not
understand the rules of scholarly research.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, professors and administrators at Virginia
Tech do not quite know how to respond. ``I don't know if this is
the beginning of an ugly, awful trend or just a blip,'' said John
Carroll, a computer science professor. ``It's a new world out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But professors are not waiting around for a new set of computer
commandments to take hold. Some routinely search the Internet when
information in a term paper appears suspicious. A University of
Iowa professor has written an electronic paper called
``Downloadable Term Papers: What's a Prof. to Do?'' The professor,
Tom Rocklin, says that some teachers unwittingly encourage students
to cheat by giving broad general-knowledge assignments or
scheduling too many large projects at the end of a semester.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tie assignments really tightly to what you're doing in
class, it becomes more difficult to cheat,'' Rocklin said. He also
suggested that teachers require outlines and rough drafts for term
papers, so they can see a student's work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Geyer, the faculty adviser for Virginia Tech's honor system,
said that while computer cheating was easy to do, once suspected it
was also ``easy to detect _ and students haven't figured out the
latter.''
</P>
<P>
   At Virginia Tech, students found guilty of computer-aided
cheating have received punishments ranging from zeros and
double-weighted zeros on tests _ which can mean a failing grade in
a course _ to community service. Under the university's honor
system, students rarely are expelled for a first offense.
</P>
<P>
   But, Geyer said, ``I know some graduating seniors who had to go
to summer school.''

EDITORIAL: DUBIOUS DECISIONS ON THE SUDAN
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept. 23:
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after American missiles destroyed the Shifa
pharmaceutical plant in the Sudan last month, serious questions
arose about whether the Clinton administration had targeted the
right factory. The administration insisted that the factory was
producing nerve gas for terrorists. But a report in Monday's Times
by Tim Weiner and James Risen reveals that the decision to attack
the plant was based in part on incomplete information and
inference.
</P>
<P>
   The administration argues that it nevertheless had enough to go
on to justify the attack. But the launching of deadly American
missiles requires more solid and convincing evidence than
Washington appears to have had in this case.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial decisions leading up to the attack were made by a
narrow group of top national security officials meeting alone.
Knowledgeable staff members were excluded to assure secrecy. With
America's embassy in Khartoum closed, up-to-date information was
scarce. Hard proof linking the Shifa factory to terrorism and nerve
gas production was elusive, and the indirect evidence that was
available was incomplete and open to conflicting interpretations.
In addition, the CIA had recently concluded that reports that had
appeared to document a clear link between the Sudanese government
and terrorist activities were fabricated and unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the Aug. 20 missile attack, the administration was
compelled to retreat from its claims that the Shifa factory had
been directly financed by Osama bin Laden, the alleged terrorist
linked to the deadly attacks on two American embassies in Africa.
Washington still insists that soil samples in American possession
conclusively prove that an early stage of nerve gas production was
taking place at the plant. But Western scientists who recently
worked at the plant insist they knew of no nerve gas work.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they say, Shifa was the Sudan's main source of locally
needed agricultural chemicals and veterinary medicines. Whether or
not it turns out that the United States destroyed the Shifa plant
in error, Washington should offer to replace any lost production of
agricultural and veterinary products from the plant. It does not
help the war against terrorism to hurt innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's nerve gas allegations may well be correct. But the
record badly needs to be clarified. Wrongly, the administration has
resisted calls for independent verification of soil samples from
the plant. It should agree to such review.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is entitled to use military force to protect
itself against terrorism. But the case for every such action must
be rigorously established. In the case of the Sudan, Washington has
conspicuously failed to prove its case.

ZEILE GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN BY KIDS

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Since shedding his Los Angeles Dodgers uniform
in May, Todd Zeile has donned two others. Nothing new there. The
Texas Rangers ensemble he pulled on Tuesday afternoon in Anaheim
before a stretch-drive game with the Angels was the seventh
different set of colors this baseball Bedouin has worn in the last
four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In light of this, it's probably comforting to know that Zeile's
influence on a community is not altered as readily. It does not
diminish when he departs.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle LaMarre, director of development for the Make-A-Wish
Foundation in Los Angeles, has no doubt of this. She was making
small talk recently with Kenneth, 11, of Compton, one of the kids
assisted by her organization. Kenneth is infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him what he did all summer,'' LaMarre said. ``He said
(excitedly), `I went to a Dodger game!' And I asked him what else
he had done over the summer. He just kind of looked at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she realized. The ONLY out-of-the-ordinary activity this
boy had engaged in all summer was to go to a single Dodgers game.
Zeile, two uniforms and thousands of miles removed, had provided
the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he joined the Dodgers in December '96, Zeile, whose
athletic career had been spawned at Hart High and UCLA, approached
the team's front office and said he wanted to support 10 different
children's charities in Southern California, writing each a $10,000
check each year. Additionally, he bought 10 season tickets _ good
seats _ that would be rotated among the charities throughout each
season.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers officials have since remarked that no player in club
memory comes even close to matching Zeile's philanthropic fervor.
</P>
<P>
   When Zeile was shipped off to the Florida Marlins on May 16 as
part of the Mike Piazza trade, he sent each charity a letter
!ital!apologizing!off! that he wouldn't personally be able to host
each group on home Saturdays, as planned, but that they were
encouraged to continue using the tickets.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Kenneth was able to enjoy a rare bright moment in a
life that will end soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd was just delightful, in a very low-key, comfortable
way,'' said Susan Franklin, executive director of Camp Ronald
McDonald for Good Times, another of Zeile's charities, which hosts
kids stricken with cancer. ``He would meet the kids on the field
and pose for pictures, and it wasn't about, `Are you going to put
it in the newsletter?' It was almost done in an anonymous way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so disappointed that he's gone. But not only that, to be
replaced by WHAT?''
</P>
<P>
   Something, indeed, is wrong with this picture. At a time when
professional athletes are widely viewed as greedy mercenaries, here
was a player who wanted nothing more than to put down deep roots in
a community and be extensively involved with it.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile says his wife, former Olympic gold-medalist gymnast
Julianne McNamara, developed a similar passion for charity
involvement during her years as a world-class athlete. Together,
they looked forward to indulging it in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Early this season, the Zeiles moved from Santa Clarita to what
Todd calls ``an interim house'' while their dream home was being
constructed in Westlake Village. Son Garrett, 4, was preparing to
enter kindergarten. Daughter Hannah had been born just four months
before.
</P>
<P>
   And then, baseball reality arrived like chin music.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins required Zeile in the Piazza trade because they
wanted a veteran third baseman who would be marketable to a pennant
contender looking for help. Accordingly, he was sent on to Texas in
the middle of the summer, where his steady production over this
season _ .268 average, 18 home runs, 91 RBI entering Tuesday
night's game _ has enhanced the Rangers' chances of putting the
Angels in their wake over this final week of the AL West race.
</P>
<P>
   But he puzzles over the way his hoped-for stability in L.A. was
so swiftly dashed. Wouldn't this be the type of player a club would
want to hold onto?
</P>
<P>
   Zeile smiled and said: ``That was one of the sentiments Fred
Claire (the Dodgers' since-fired executive vice president) and some
of the people I knew internally expressed: This might be an early
chapter in the Fox baseball scenario, but one of the potential
disappointments was seeing things from a corporate vantage point as
opposed to the family emphasis, the way the O'Malleys had run the
club for so many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have been victimized by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, anyone who has been traded four times and switched
teams as a free agent twice over a four-year period cannot be
surprised by the vagaries of baseball's business.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Zeile, who is signed through next year, is hopeful of
remaining with Texas at least for a while. ``I certainly would like
to try and find some sense of a home for a few years,'' he said
quietly, ``and not have to go through that worry at the (July 31
trade) deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, some of those needy kids back home have to make
due with the explanations they receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made for interesting conversations,'' Franklin, of Camp
Ronald McDonald, said of the 10-or-so dates her young cancer
victims had at Dodger Stadium this year. ``They'd ask, `Will he
come back?' `Who's at third base now?' `Will he be in Texas for a
long time?' ''
</P>
<P>
   For that latter query, Franklin provided the best response she
could: ``Well, we don't know.''

EDITORIAL: RISING COSTS IN HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept. 23:
</P>
<P>
   A report by economists at the Department of Health and Human
Services predicts that growth in health-care spending will increase
substantially over the next 10 years. Total health expenditures are
expected to rise from $1 trillion in 1996 to $2.1 trillion by 2007,
jumping from 13.6 percent of gross domestic product to 16.6
percent. That is likely to translate into much higher health
insurance premium increases than has been the case in recent years.
These numbers are discouraging, particularly since the projections
do not even reach the years when baby boomers will begin utilizing
health care intensively in their late 60s and 70s.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively low growth in spending of the past four years is
actually an aberration from long-term trends, made possible by a
rapid shift of American workers into managed-care plans from costly
fee-for-service plans where there were few constraints on what
doctors and hospitals could charge or patients could request. Many
economists have said for some time, however, that this tamping down
of costs is a one-time effect achieved mostly by getting price
discounts out of hospital systems and squeezing down doctors' fees.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term ability of managed care to control escalating
costs is likely to be more modest. Although it can help by
subjecting doctors' decisions to review and emphasizing preventive
care, managed care has not been able to resist consumer demands for
expensive technological procedures, a big driver of health
spending. Changing practice standards and new and more expensive
drugs will continue to push up spending even after managed care
squeezes the easy-to-attack inefficiencies out of the health
delivery system. The growth of point-of-service plans where
enrollees have greater choice of doctors may further weaken managed
care's ability to control costs.
</P>
<P>
   This country already spends more on health care as a share of
gross domestic product than any other nation, yet 41 million
Americans have no health coverage at all. The shift toward managed
care has produced a few good years of relatively stable costs. But
it has not reduced the problem of the uninsured. With costs
starting to accelerate again, the hope that managed care could
extract enough savings out of the system to cover millions of
uninsured Americans seems less and less likely.

<P>
   FUENGIROLA, Spain _ Like many of the British expatriates
scattered around southern Spain, Cecilia Riber and her husband
moved to this coastal town when they retired, drawn to its warm
climate and relaxed way of life. But Riber died six years ago, and
now, after 15 years away from home, Mrs. Riber is ready to go back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, my family is starting to worry that I'm on my own
here, and I'm not getting any younger,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But as eager as she is to return to England, Mrs. Riber, 68, is
one of a number of displaced Britons here and around Western Europe
who are caught in a strange sort of limbo, one that has forced them
to weigh love of country against love of animals.
</P>
<P>
   Under Britain's 77-year-old rabies law, if Mrs. Riber took her
mixed-breed hound, Scruffy, back to England with her, he would be
required to spend six months in quarantine, serving his time in
solitary confinement in one of the 80 or so kennels licensed by the
British government. He wouldn't be allowed to play with other dogs.
He wouldn't be allowed to go for walks. And, Mrs. Riber says, she
just won't do it to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can't go back to England because he wouldn't be able
to survive in a kennel for six months,'' Mrs. Riber said of
Scruffy, who is no youngster himself, nearing 13 and suffering from
an enlarged heart that has left him short of breath and slow on his
feet. ``He's very important to me, particularly as I'm on my own
now. And that's why I'm staying here. I won't leave him. I can't
leave him.''
</P>
<P>
   There are people like Mrs. Riber all over southern Spain, in
France, in the Netherlands, in Switzerland. The painter David
Hockney and the actor Rupert Everett, who are both British and live
abroad, have refused to move back to England because of the rabies
law. Probably the most famous anti-quarantine campaigner is
Christopher Patten, Britain's last governor in Hong Kong, who moved
back to London last year but left his beloved Norfolk terriers,
Whisky and Soda, with dog-loving friends in France.
</P>
<P>
   The quarantine law, which applies to all domestic mammals, dates
from a time when rabies was a serious problem. But now, with the
disease eradicated in some parts of the world or kept at bay by
vaccinations in others, anti-quarantine campaigners say it is time
for Britain to scrap its law. They are bitterly opposed by the
country's $14.5 million-a-year quarantine kennel industry, which
argues that it would be foolish to change a law that has been so
apparently successful (and so lucrative).
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that years of anti-quarantine agitation, from
people both within and outside Britain, are finally, slowly paying
off. On Sept. 23, a government-appointed committee of scientists is
to issue a report that is expected to recommend a number of
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility would be to institute a ``pet passport'' system,
in which pets coming from the European Union and other rabies-free
places would carry documentation proving they were healthy and had
been inoculated against rabies. The system would entail placing
electronic chips under the animals' skin for easy identification.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the government accepts the need for change, it will
probably be at least a year before anything actually happens, said
a spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,
which administers the law. Until then, people like Mrs. Riber are
simply waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life is on hold,'' said Mrs. Riber, who sold her house and
rented a temporary apartment recently. ``I'm leaving the minute the
regulation is changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Up in the hill town of Alhaurin el Grande, Elizabeth Collins put
it a different way. ``I'll wait until he dies,'' she said, speaking
of her dog, Sam, ``or, I guess, until the law changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam, a mixed-breed dog with a strong suggestion of German
shepherd, is ill and probably does not have much more than a year
to live anyway, said Mrs. Collins, whose husband died recently and
who wants to go home to England. ``My daughter thinks I'm being
sentimental, that a dog's a dog and I should just have him put
down,'' she said. ``But I say: `Sam's my friend. I wouldn't do that
to him.'''
</P>
<P>
   In desperation, more and more people are turning to smuggling to
skirt the quarantine law. Some conceal their pets in bags or boxes
and sneak them through the Channel Tunnel. Others pay professional
smugglers upward of several thousand dollars to bring the animals
in by boat or truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's surprisingly easy,'' said Peter Harrison, a British
writer and kennel operator here in Spain, who by way of testing the
system recently flew to London carrying a box stamped ``Live
Animals,'' which he occasionally opened and put in food (no one
stopped him).
</P>
<P>
   Although as many as 10,000 dogs and cats are smuggled into
Britain each year, according to one estimate, many people are
reluctant to use this method.
</P>
<P>
   John Nicholson said he would be afraid for the safety of Bella,
his Staffordshire bull terrier. He loves Bella so much that when he
and his wife had a baby ``the opinion was that if Bella didn't get
on with the baby, then the baby was going.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know what kind of trauma she could go through,''
said Nicholson, who runs a laundromat in a tourist enclave in El
Faro. ``They can take them and just drop them in a hole
somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Dixon, a Briton who runs a poolside bar with her husband,
Bill, in the coastal town of Benalmadena, said of Major, her
14-year-old retriever: ``Let's put it this way _ I'd be in a mental
institution if anything happened to him.'' The Dixons have vowed
never to put Major back in quarantine after a traumatic stay a
decade ago when he came out emaciated and depressed, his spirit
subdued by the experience.
</P>
<P>
   And so they remain in Spain, their dog having won out over their
home country. ``Look at it from his point of view,'' Dixon said.
``Six months of a dog's life is a long time. You're putting him in
prison for three and a half years, in his terms, and he's done
nothing.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans vowed on Tuesday to press
ahead with their consideration of an impeachment inquiry even
though the broadcast of President Clinton's grand jury testimony
about Monica Lewinsky did nothing to shake his national standing,
and may even have strengthened it.
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing that Clinton's job approval ratings had gone
up after the release of his videotaped testimony, White House aides
sent strong signals that the president would accept some kind of
censure, and possibly a fine, to end the threat of impeachment. But
Republicans in both the House and the Senate flatly rejected the
idea of a deal as premature, preferring to see the outcome of the
November elections and whether the Whitewater independent counsel,
Kenneth Starr, will follow up with indictments.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the video's release, members of both parties
now consider it inevitable that the House Judiciary Committee will
quickly recommend a full impeachment inquiry. Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., who is chairman of the committee, said on Tuesday that if
the House voted for an inquiry he would like to open hearings
shortly after the midterm election.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists suggested that timetable would allow
Republicans to neither turn off their own conservative base by
being too easy on the president nor appear to be too harsh before
the midterm elections. It would also force Democrats to take a vote
on Clinton's fate just weeks before the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde waved off discussion of some lesser punishment for the
president as ``very premature to talk about,'' and indicated that
such negotiations could come only if the House decided to impeach
the president and try him before the Senate. ``That's a decision,
if it ever gets there, for the Senate to make,'' he said. ``But
we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Republicans also widely dismissed any effort to
short-circuit an impeachment inquiry. ''We have a constitutional
process to follow,'' said Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the
majority whip. ``I don't think you should say, `Well, here is what
we decided should be the outcome _ it should be impeachment, it
should be censure, it should be reprimand, it should be nothing.' I
don't think we should guess what the solution should be and then
work to build it.''
</P>
<P>
   With manuevering intensifying in Congress, the White House
opened a new counterattack against Starr. Having seen the 3,200
pages of documentation made public by the House Judiciary
Committee, the president's lawyers accused the independent counsel
of distorting the evidence against Clinton in his report citing 11
possibly impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the House Judiciary Committee, David Kendall,
Clinton's private lawyer, and Charles F.C. Ruff, the White House
counsel, said Starr ``ignored all reasonable standards of
fairness'' and left out evidence that supports the President.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry, the White House press secretary, cited the
exclusion of Ms. Lewinsky's statement to a grand jury that ``no one
ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job for my
silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the charges, Hyde said, ``My staff tells me that's
just not so,'' but added that ``we welcome any correspondence''
from White House lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Republican dismissal of any deal, the White House and
prominent Democrats also worked feverishly behind the scenes to
craft a punishment for Clinton short of impeachment that could have
appeal within their own party and to respected Republicans outside
Capitol Hill. Over the weekend, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., suggested
that Clinton should testify before the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said on Tuesday that he would welcome an appearance by
Clinton before his committee, but said the ``orderly procedure''
would be for the president to appear after a formal impeachment
inquiry had begun. Sen. Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader,
said he was not certain he would recommend that the president take
such a course. ''I have questions about the kind of fair hearing he
would get,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia and Rep. Dick Gephardt of
Missouri, the House minority leaer, were to meet on Wednesday with
the leaders of the House Judiciary Committee to discuss the next
steps in the Clinton investigation. The deliberations have become
increasingly partisan since the House voted 363-63 to make public
Starr's report, with Democrats accusing the Republicans of seeking
to embarrass the president.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the broadcast of Clinton's testimony before the grand jury,
showing a president ranging from contrite to argumentative, furious
to crestfallen, seemed in fact to strengthen the president.
</P>
<P>
   Polling conducted by Gallup for CNN and US Today showed a
six-point jump in Clinton's job approval rating, to 66 percent,
after the broadcast, compared with 60 percent on Sunday. And CBS
News found that since the telecast, 68 percent of those polled
approved of the way Clinton was doing his job, up from 59 percent
since the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the job approval numbers, however, the public was still
divided over Clinton's trustworthiness, and a majority of those
polled still believe that he lied under oath about his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress also saw the volatility of public opinion in
their own phone calls from constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, said that on Thursday and Friday,
phone calls to his office were ``as heavy as I'd ever seen it'' and
running 8 to 1 against the president. But on Tuesday, he said the
calls became ``much more favorable'' to the president. ``It was
significantly changed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said he thought little had
changed. ``People who thought the president was a liar felt
vindicated,'' he said. ``People who felt he was being picked on
felt vindicated. And people who hadn't made up their minds were
bored out of their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, one Republican took to the Senate floor on Tuesday to
warn his party against even the appearance of partisanship or a
rush to judgment. ``I think it's very important that there be a
real effort on the part of Republicans _ because we Republicans are
in control _ to not press for every bit of advantage,'' warned Sen.
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans fended off any talk of an early deal with the
president, they moved forward with a timetable that would set a
House vote on whether to open an impeachment inquiry for early
October. Impeachment hearings would then be put off until after the
election.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists said the delay would allow their party to
move cautiously before the election. Because of Clinton's troubles,
Republcans expect to increase their majorities in both the House
and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican House member who is closely monitoring the
elections said that the volatility of the public mood argued for
caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is in unchartered waters waiting for the fog to lift
and figure out where they are,'' he said, speaking on condition
that he not be identified. ``No one is willing to make a deal until
they know where they stand. The polls are meaningless. The
president's support is a fraction of an inch deep. Every number
besides his favorable rating is ominous for Democrats. And
Republicans know that misplaying their hand is dangerous too.
Everyone's in a state of suspended animation.''

RED SOX POUR IT ON DEVIL RAYS 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-DEVIL RAYS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Very quickly, the opponent changed. The Red Sox went from
worrying about the Devil Rays to worrying about the devilish rain.
One potentially was far more dangerous than the other.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of everything, the Red Sox persevered Tuesday night and
moved a step closer to the playoffs by ripping Tampa Bay, 11-2,
before an underneath-the-overhang assemblage of 20,399 at
rain-swept Fenway Park. The victory dropped Boston's magic number
to 2 for clinching the American league wild-card berth as Toronto
kept pace with a 7-3 victory over the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was a formality after three innings, when Boston
took a 7-0 lead thanks to some truly terrible Tampa Bay pitching in
some truly terrible Boston weather.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, with rain sweeping across the field like a scene
from ``Wuthering Heights,'' the big fear was that the game wouldn't
last the 4 1/2 innings required to make it official. But the
grounds crew kept pounding sand into the pitcher's mound and
infield, the real hard rain never did fall, and the umpiring crew
saw no need to halt play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather was pretty harsh,'' said Nomar Garciaparra, who
snapped out of a 2-of-17 skid by going 2 for 3, including his
eighth triple of the season. ``But we've overcome adversity all
year long, and that's what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The undeniable feel-good story of the night was pitcher Pete
Schourek. In six previous starts, he had pitched well enough to go
0-2 with four no-decisions. Staked to a seven-run lead on a dark
and stormy night against a team going nowhere ... well, he's been
in tougher situations.
</P>
<P>
   He went eight innings, throwing just 91 pitches, an
energy-efficient performance. He yielded a meaningless two-run
homer to Mike Kelly in the fifth and easily could have finished the
game. As it was, his eight innings constituted his longest outing
in almost three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no big deal,'' Schourek said. ``It's a matter of pitch
count for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Added manager Jimy Williams, ``There was no reason for it. We
have a pitch count and he has been through operations before, so
you want to be careful. Why risk it?''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Boston offense, it came, like voting in Chicago,
early and often. The Red Sox picked up three runs in the second off
starter and loser Julio Santana, who added to his impressive
September numbers (0-4, 9.00 ERA) by getting behind virtually every
hitter after a seamless first.
</P>
<P>
   Santana was cuffed for six runs in 2 1/3 innings. In the second,
Darren Bragg snapped an 0-for-9 streak with a two-run double and
eventually scored on a Scott Hatteberg sacrifice fly. Mo Vaughn
knocked in two runs in the third when his single (which easily
could have been scored an error) bounced off first baseman Fred
McGriff and scored Darren Lewis, who had singled, and John
Valentin, who had collected his 44th double of the season. Vaughn's
single extended his hitting streak to 11 games, a season high.
</P>
<P>
   That was it for Santana, but his replacement, nano-Red Sox
pitcher Brad Pennington (1996), was even worse. Pennington had just
been called up from Durham Monday; he should have stayed where he
was.
</P>
<P>
   Pennington walked three straight batters, then surrendered an
RBI single to Hatteberg. Mercifully, he was replaced by rookie Mike
Duvall, who can tell his grandchildren that he got Mike Benjamin to
hit into a double play in his very first major league appearance.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, it became a race against the elements. The start
of the game was delayed 29 minutes and the weather worsened in the
middle innings. The umpiring crew said afterward that they almost
stopped play on a couple of occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't worry about it,'' Williams said. ``That's why you
have tarps.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the rain, there was a 17 mile-per-hour wind
blowing all over the place and a temperature of 65 degrees that was
forecast to drop as the night wore on. In other words, there aren't
many more unpleasant conditions under which to play baseball. Or
rugby.
</P>
<P>
   The ridiculousness of the situation was driven home, so to
speak, in the fifth. Tampa Bay second baseman Miguel Cairo lost a
popup in the rain and wind, and two runs scored on what should have
been an easy, inning-ending out. Those two runs made it 10-2 after
five innings, which already seemed like more than long enough, both
in production and endurance. Things quieted down after that, both
in the sky and on the field.
