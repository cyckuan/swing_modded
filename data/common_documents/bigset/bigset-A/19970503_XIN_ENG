<HEADLINE> Shahak Calls for Larger Defense Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army's chief of staff
Amnon Lipkin-Shahak said today that the country's defense budget
must be enlarged so as to make Israel well prepared for any
eventualities, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gathering of senior Israeli officers in Tel
Aviv, Shahak said that the current budget "is inadequate, and
leaves gap."
</P>
<P>
Shahak admitted that he has no specific information about
steps taken by neighboring countries, but for Israel to be well
prepared would "require more tangible preparations," which needs
a larger budget.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said that
threat of ground-to-ground missile attacks from Iran, and
chemical and biological warfares "are more realistic than ever."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Israeli press reported that Syria, with
the aid of Russian experts, has succeeded in manufacturing a
particularly deadly form of nerve gas known as VX.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the Syrians are now in the initial
stages of putting VX into warheads for ground-to-ground Scud
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai then warned against any provocation, saying Israel
has "all the capabilities."
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that Israel wanted to resolve problems
around the negotiating table with the Syrians, and had no
intention of confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Syria denied the Israeli allegations that it had put deadly
nerve gas in surface-to-surface missiles capable of hitting
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The official Syrian newspaper Al-Baath accused Israel of
launching a "misleading campaign" to draw attention from its
hardline stance toward the Arabs, which has stalled the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Israel was planning to "use it as a
pretext in any American-Israeli talks" to counter American
concern over the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> Santer Congratulates Blair, Urges Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- European Commission (EC) President
Jacques Santer today congratulated British Labor Party leader Tony
Blair on his election as the new prime minister in Thursday's
general election.
</P>
<P>
Santer expressed hope of working closely with Blair on European
integration, and described the election as "an outstanding
victory" for the Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped the Labor government would play its "rightful
leading role within the (European) Union and in the wider Europe."
</P>
<P>
Vote counting up to now has secured Labor more than 400 seats
in the House of Commons, giving it the biggest majority in Britain
in a century and a half.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to working very closely with the
government," Santer said in a telegram, adding that he hoped to
see Blair soon.
</P>
<P>
The Labor victory came "at a crucial stage" in the EU's
development, Santer said. The new British government would play a
"vital role" in successfully handling the thorny issues in
accelerating European integration when it took over the EU
presidency at the beginning of the next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc was confronted with many challenges,
including revision of the EU treaty, its enlargement into Eastern
and Central Europe, and the final stage of creating an economic
and monetary union.
</P>
<P>
"Never more than now has the European Union needed strong
British commitment with its unique combination of pragmatism and
efficiency," Santer said.
</P>
<P>
It was expected that Blair would breathe new life into the
deadlock in its negotiations with the EU on investing the bloc
with greater powers.
</P>
<P>
Eurosceptics in Britain are firmly opposed to closer
integration with the EU, and Major's government has been widely
split over issues of greater majority voting, new powers for the
European Parliament and border lifting policies.
</P>
<P>
A special EU summit is scheduled on May 23 in Noordwijk, in the
Netherlands, providing Blair with an opportunity to meet leaders
of other EU countries.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok also telegraphed Blair today to
congratulate him on his landslide victory.
</P>
<P>
Kok, whose country holds the current EU presidency, said he
hoped the new British government would "play a constructive role"
in the continuing EU inter-governmental conference, to help bring
about "active achievements."

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Ends Visit to Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Ibrahim Mainassara
left the city of Sirt today after a three-day state visit to
Libya, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Libya, Mainassara held talks with leader of
the Libyan revolutionary command council Colonel Moammar Gaddafi
on the bilateral relations between Niger and Libya and ways of
developing them.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed other African current issues of
common concern, the Libyan News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
No details about the meeting were available.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerien leader arrived in Libya on Monday evening
accompanied by his foreign minister, minister of energy and mines,
minister of industry, and deputy speaker of the parliament as well
as former Secretary General of the Organization of Islamic
Conference Hamed Al-Ghabid.

<HEADLINE> US Unemployment Rate Down to 4.9 percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate
declined to 4.9 percent in April, the lowest in 24 years, U.S.
Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
It was a stunning drop from a seasonally adjusted jobless rate
of 5.2 percent a month earlier despite a second month of modest
growth in employer's payrolls. More than 142,000 jobs were added
in April after a downwardly revised gain of 139,000 in March.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate was the lowest since December 1973 when
Richard Nixon was president.
</P>
<P>
The report said that growth in service industries totaled
199,000 jobs, reflecting strong gains in engineering, health,
social services and data processing.
</P>
<P>
But some of the factors dampened the growth of employer
payrolls, including heavy Spring snows in the Northeast and Upper
Midwest and flooding in some states. As a result, construction
payrolls lost 44,000 jobs in April but could be expected to
rebound later in the Spring.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report showed average hourly earnings for
non-supervisory workers fell a penny to 12.14 dollars. But that
was up 3.6 percent from 11.72 dollars a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy surged as 1997 began with a growth rate of 5.6
percent in the first quarter, the fastest pace in a decade. And
the growth has been accomplished without a noticeable acceleration
in inflation in consumer goods prices.
</P>
<P>
Strong growth early in the year prompted the U.S. Federal
Reserve (Fed) to tighten monetary policy in March to pre-emptively
curb inflation pressures before they emerge.
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. analysts expect that the U.S. Fed will make another
increase of short-term interest rate when its policy-makers meet
next on May 20.

PARIS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming visit to China by
French President Jacques Chirac will be a big event for

<HEADLINE> Portuguese President Leaves for Northwest of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese president Gorge Sampaio
flew to Mozambique's Tete province to inspect the hydro-power
station in Cabora Bassa upon completing his visit to a school in
the city of Quelimane in the Zambezia province in the north of
Mozambique this morning.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth day of his visit to Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The Cabora Bassa power station is the biggest investment
project of Portugal in Mozambique as well as overseas. The power
station was completed in the 1970s, but failed to display its
benefit due to the damage of the high-voltage power transmission
tower during the war. It is expected that the power transmission
tower will be restored within the year and begin power supply to
South Africa this October.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is the biggest user of the power station.
However, no result has been produced in the talks among South
Africa, Portugal and Mozambique regarding the new power
prices due to opposition from the side of South Africa. Both
Portugal and Mozambique think that the price of the electricity
set for the power station was too low.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese president will return to the capital Maputo
today. He began his visit to Mozambique on April 28 and will
wind up his visit tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> UNDP to Make Donation to Help Mozambique in Mine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) will provide 9.7 million US dollar in helping
Mozambique in the work to clear mines.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by an unidentified person of the UNDP here
in Maputo today, according to the Mozambican News Agency report.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used for clearing mines in the Maputo, Gaza
and Inhambane provinces in the south of Mozambique, he said.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of doing so is to completely remove mines and
other explosive devices in Mozambique, for an average five people
are killed or disabled by these explosive devices very month, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations estimates that there are still about two
million mines throughout Mozambique that have not been removed.
The mines were deployed during the war period in the past 30
years.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement reached between Mozambique and South
Africa in the capital Lome, Togo, last month, South Africa will
provide 12 million Rands to help Maputo province in mine
clearing. Maputo province borders with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Finland will also provide one million US dollars to help
Mozambique in mine clearance.
</P>
<P>
The war in Mozambique was over in 1992 and the work to clear
mines began in 1993. So far, only no more than 100,000 mines have
been removed.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Needs Minimal 71 Mln Dollars for Revival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Liberia, the West African country
that has been ravaged by the seven-year civil war, is seeking a
minimum of 71 million U.S. dollars for the rehabilitation of its
infrastructure facilities destroyed in the cross-fire.
</P>
<P>
The facilities, marked as essential for resumption of economic
and social activities, include the country's international
airport in the capital of Monrovia and its telecommunications and
postal facilities, according to a Liberian official.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear as yet the level of damage suffered by the
country's production, particularly manufacturing facilities
during the crisis.
</P>
<P>
But according to Alfred Kollie, Liberia's Minister of Post and
Telecommunications, the seven-year war has devastated all the
necessary infrastructure essential to keep life going.
</P>
<P>
Kollie, who was in Nigeria last week to attend an Internet
workshop for West Africa, said that presently there are just
5,000 telephone lines and one sub-post office to serve the nearly
1.5 million people left in the country.
</P>
<P>
Liberia used to have 10,000 telephone lines spread through
three telephone exchanges located in Monrovia and two in the
provinces to beam telephone signals through microwave.
</P>
<P>
But all that has been devastated, while letters could not go
beyond Monrovia until other sub-post offices are rehabilitated,
Kollie said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kollie, the telecommunications infrastructure
needs a minimum of 15 million dollars to be put in place, and the
postal services, a minimum of three million dollars to be
restructured.
</P>
<P>
For the Robert International Airport in Monrovia, the runway
remains intact but all other facilities, including the tower,
telecommunication facilities, the lounge, are completely
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
It would require about 54 million dollars to rehabilitate, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, a complete assessment of the infrastructure,
including roads, hospitals, terminal buildings of the airports
and others, is underway. The country is to seek financial aid
from international donors, especially the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Urges British Labor to Keep Promises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus expects the newly elected
Labor government in Britain to live up to its pre-election
promises regarding a settlement of the protracted Cyprus question.
</P>
<P>
In a congratulatory telegram today to Labor party leader Tony
Blair on his victory, Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
expressed his confidence that the party's declared positions on
Cyprus will be effectively promoted and that Blair's government
"will pursue further the efforts for a just and viable solution
to the long-standing Cyprus problem and the accession of Cyprus
to the European Union (EU)."
</P>
<P>
Also commenting on the Labor Party victory, Foreign Minister
Yiannakis Cassoulides told reporters today that Cyprus is looking
forward to cooperation with the new British government and
expressed the hope that pre-election promises on Cyprus will be
materialized.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Government Spokesman Manolis Christofides told his
daily press briefing today: "we have been satisfied by the
position of the British government but we expect the new Labor
government to implement its pre-election promises."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to statements made by the Labor Party calling
for the accession of Cyprus to the EU, irrespective of a solution
to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Christofides said that the government of Cyprus has always
worked closely with Britain and pointed out that special ties
exist between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Greece and Turkey were three guarantors who signed
the Treaty of Guarantee in 1960, whereby they were given the
right for joint or unilateral action to safeguard the
independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of
Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Denies Links with Zairean Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Burundi's agriculture and livestock
minister Damase Ntiranyibagira today refuted allegations his
country is aiding Zairean rebels led by Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The minister told journalists after paying a courtesy call on
Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe in Harare that Burundi had its
own problems and could not afford to assist other countries in
any way.
</P>
<P>
"These are unfounded allegations. Burundi has its own enormous
problems and has no intention to interfere with affairs involving
her neighbours," he said.
</P>
<P>
Burundi has, together with Rwanda and Uganda been accused of
assisting Kabila's alliance of democratic forces for the
liberation of Congo-Zaire as it seeks to oust Mobutu Sese Seko
from his 32-year reign as Zairean president.
</P>
<P>
Kabila and Mobutu are, however, expected to hold a meeting to
try and find ways of resolving the six-month crisis.
</P>
<P>
The minister added he had brought a "brotherly" message from
Burundi leader Pierre Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
"This is a message in which our leader expressed his gesture
to the Zimbabwe government for what it did for the Burundi people
and hope that the two countries will accompany each other in
their peace paths," said the minister.

<HEADLINE> Johannesburg Airport Beefs Up Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Security at Johannesburg
International Airport has been upgraded after media reports early
this week that crime was on the increase, the airport authorities
said today.
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the airport said it had budgeted 1.2 million
Rands (272,727 U.S. dollars) to install closed circuit security
cameras to monitor public areas, and had arranged for a more
visible police presence on the airport's premises.
</P>
<P>
The airport said it had built facilities in the domestic
terminal where the public could report crime and another was
planned for the international terminal.
</P>
<P>
It had also established a task team comprising airport
representatives, South African Airways security staff, policemen,
and private security guards to fight crimes.
</P>
<P>
Jessie Duarte, an official responsible for safety and security
in Gauteng Province said on Wednesday that there had been 10,295
crimes at the airport since 1994, with the daily number of crimes
rising from 8.5 percent in 1994 to the current 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition to burglaries, the crimes at the airport also
include a variety of smugglings involving drugs, ivories,
abalones, diamonds and arms.

<HEADLINE> Liberia's Parties Urged to Campaign in Hinterland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The West African peacekeeping force
(ECOMOG) has appealed to all political parties in Liberia and
their activists to extend campaign to all parts of the country,
particularly the hinterland.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the security situation in the country is
conducive for political activities, ECOMOG will provide
additional security for any political party going into the
hinterland for political campaign on request, ECOMOG said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"All ECOMOG requires is a 24-hour notice and we will not only
further enhance security in the town or village of campaign, but
also provide escorts for the politicians," ECOMOG Commander
Maj.-Gen. Victor Malu said in a statement, quoted by the News
Agency of Nigeria today.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the determination of the force to intensify the
haunt for arms all around the country to ensure that the security
situation gets even better with each passing day.
</P>
<P>
This, he added, would ensure a free and fair conduct of the
election scheduled for May 30.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Liberia's former warlord and
presidential candidate Charles Taylor launched his political
campaign on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But the campaign is reportedly in clear defiance of the
Independent Electoral Commission of the country as the commission
last week delayed the official start of party conventions and
campaigns as well as the submission of party lists "until further
notice", according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Taylor announced the beginning of the campaign immediately at
the end of a one-day strategy seminar for his National Patriotic
Party, which is said to be better prepared than most others.
</P>
<P>
The electoral commission is yet to react to Taylor's defiant
move, reports said.

LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Gerry Adams, leader of the Irish
Republican Army's (IRA) Sinn Fein political wing, won a Northern

Adams was elected for West Belfast, giving Sinn Fein its first

<P>
Sinn Fein shares the IRA's goal of ending British rule over
Northern Ireland. It is reported that Adams will not take up his
seat in the British parliament because he says that would give
recognitions to Britain's right to rule Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The IRA declared a truce in a 28-year war on British forces in

<P>
NICOSIA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 communist and leftist
parties from all over the world will gather in this Eastern
Mediterranean island this weekend to discuss what they called
neo-liberal trends in today's world.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' left-wing AKEL party General Secretary Demetris
Christofias told a press conference here today that the gathering
would focus on nationalism, chauvinism, racism and religious
fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
The two-day international meeting, sponsored by the AKEL,
is to take place in the southeastern coastal town of Larnaca
Saturday and Sunday under the theme "The Leftist Movement's
Contemporary Stance and the Need to Combat Neo-Liberalism in the
New World Order."
</P>
<P>
Christofias said that the meeting is dedicated to the 70th
founding anniversary of the Cyprus Communist Party (CCP), which
was outlawed in 1941 following a British colonial order.
</P>
<P>
The AKEL emerged from the CCP after the latter was banned.
</P>
<P>
Christofias expressed the conviction that the meeting will
contribute toward greater coordination of action by left-wing
parties and have beneficial repercussion for Cyprus and every
other nation struggling for peace.
</P>
<P>
The AKEL leader said a special session will be held on the
protracted Cyprus question with the aim of finding an early
solution to it.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be attended by 39 leftist parties from 27
countries, including Russia, Cuba, France, Portugal, Greece,
Sudan and Vietnam. Seven of them are ruling parties.

<HEADLINE> EU Warns to Take US to WTO over Poultry Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said on
Friday it may take the U.S. to the World Trade Organization(WTO)
because of Washington's plans to block imports of poultry from the
European Union in a row over food safety rules.
</P>
<P>
The EU and the United States have reached an agreement in
Washington on Wednesday on mutually acceptable inspection rules
covering three billion US dollars of trade annually in red meat,
dairy, fish, egg and pet food products.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides failed to agree on equivalent standards for
veterinary inspection of poultry products.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the chief U.S. negotiator Paul Drazek said up to
one million US dollars of imports of European poultry products
would be blocked.
</P>
<P>
The measure would come as retaliation after the EU on April 1
imposed curbs on imports of 50 million US dollars of U.S. poultry,
saying that the U.S. method of decontaminating chicken carcasses
in chlorinated water posed a threat to consumer health.
</P>
<P>
"We have to wait and see exactly what the plans are,"
Commission chief spokesman Nicholas Van der Pas told a news
briefing. "We do not rule out the possibility to go to the WTO
because we think that such measures on the basis of the
announcements would indeed be unjustified."
</P>
<P>
In a statement, EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler said
the agreement reached on Wednesday marked an important step in
facilitating EU-US trade in red meat, dairy, fish products and egg
products, as well as pet food.
</P>
<P>
Mr Fischler however regretted that differences on poultry could
not be resolved as the U.S. has rejected the EU's offer for a
temporary solution over poultry.
</P>
<P>
Instead the U.S. was planning to retaliate against EU import
curbs by taking "unjustified and unfair action" against the EU
poultry industry even though it was committed to respecting U.S.
sanitary measures, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. action would be clearly in breach of its WTO's
Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures(SPS) obligations, and the EC
would have to consider the appropriate action to be taken,"
Fischler added.
</P>
<P>
Although further talks are planned, Commission officials said
no date had been fixed and did not foresee any early settlement.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Advocates Strategic Alliance With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu said here today that a strategic cooperation with
Turkey is growing, reported the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the statement when he was meeting with
Turkish Defense Minister Turhan Tayan at the end of the
latter's three-day visit to the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Tayan expressed hope, however, that the good relations between
Turkey and Israel would help advance the peace process in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Tayan was received by a full military honor guard at the
Defense Ministry shortly after his arrival in Israel
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, he toured the northern Israeli border areas with
Lebanon and Syria and the Golan Heights and received a briefing
from head of the Israeli Northern Command Maj.-Gen. Amiram
Levine.
</P>
<P>
Then he visited Israel Aircraft Industries, where 54
Turkish F-4 fighters are being upgraded. The deal is worth 600
million U.S. dollars and both sides are discussing the
possibility of another deal to upgrade Turkey's F-5s in a deal
worth over 300 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Israel is also competing with three other countries for a
deal to upgrade Turkey's M-60 tanks.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Cevik Bir, Turkish deputy chief of general staff, is
scheduled to arrive in Israel Sunday as part of the on-going
high-level military talks between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which will also be attended by U.S. military
representatives, will deal with immediate and medium-term
issues. The immediate concerns are wrapping up the details of a
U.S.-Israeli-Turkish sea exercise in the Mediterranean, due to
be held over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The longer term goal of the talks is to discuss strategy for
dealing with what the countries regard as the emerging threats
in the Middle East, particularly Iran and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israel is wooing Turkey, an Islamic country and a NATO
member, to a strategic alliance against the backdrop of mounting
tensions between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
During the talks at the Defense Ministry following the
welcoming ceremony Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai briefed his guest on the alleged threats facing Israel,
particularly the proliferation of surface-to-surface missiles and
non-conventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai argued that both Israel and Turkey are suffering
from the threat of terror and that Israel is willing to extend
aid to Turkey in combating terror.
</P>
<P>
"The security cooperation between Israeli and Turkey is not
directed against any third party," Mordechai
declared. "Cooperation is vital for both countries and for
strengthening the stability of the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
In his response, Tayan said that the cooperation "is not
pointing arrows at any third party. Turkey sees relations as
very important and I believe they will bring stability to the
region and advance the peace process."

LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- An unprecedented number of British
women have been elected members of parliament (MPs) in Thursday's
general election, according to the latest results of the voting on
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
At least 118 women MPs have been voted in, and it seems very

</P>
<P>
Of all the newly-elected female MPs, the Labor Party claimed
101 while the out-going Conservative Party, only contributed 12,
and all the rest come from the liberal Democrats and the Scottish
National Party.

However, despite the new influx of female MPs, the number of
women in British politics is still low compared with the U.S. and
countries in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
In the previous House of Commons, women accounted for only 9.2
percent of all the seats. The new ruling Labor Party, a long-time
champion of women's rights, has set a target of getting the number
of female MPs even-handed with male MPs in 10 years time.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Youngest Prime Minister of the Century  (By Jiang Yaping) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Tony Blair, leader of the Labor Party
in opposition for 18 years, has become Britain's youngest prime
minister of this century after his party won a landslide victory
on Thursday's general election.
</P>
<P>
Blair was born into a middle-class family on May 6, 1953 in
Edingburgh in northern Scotland with an elder brother and a
younger sister. His father Leon was an aspiring Conservative
politician and dreamed of becoming a Conservative prime minister
some day.
</P>
<P>
When he was 11, Blair's farther suffered a stroke and lied in bed
for several years before recovery, changing Blair's well-being
childhood life into a hard one.
</P>
<P>
However, his parents managed to send him to Durham Choristers
School and then to Fettes College, an exclusive Scottish private
school in Edinburgh, from where he received good education and
succeeded in going to Law School at St John's College, Oxford
University.
</P>
<P>
At Oxford, Blair joined a rock 'n' roll band called "the Ugly
Rumors", grew long hair and dressed up in garish fashions.
</P>
<P>
After graduation in 1975, Blair was called to the Bar at
Lincoln's Inn the next year. Although he joined the Labor Party in
1975, he did not participate in politics until 1983, when he was
elected the Member of Parliament for Sedgefield, his old hometown.
</P>
<P>
But once he stepped into the political arena, he had a speedy
promotion and was deemed as a rising star. He was elected to the
Shadow Cabinet in October 1988 and became Shadow Secretary of
State for Energy and Shadow Secretary of State for Employment in
the following years before he was promoted to Shadow Home
Secretary in 1992 after Labor was defeated in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
After the then Labor Party leader John Smith died of a sudden
heart attack in May, 1994, Blair was elected the leader two months
later, after his close friend and the Shadow Chancellor Gordon
Brown quit the competition.
</P>
<P>
His first major move in reforming the old-styled party since
then was to revise Clause Four of the party constitution
concerning the establishment of a socialist economy, which was
agreed by a special Conference in April 1995.
</P>
<P>
He also shifted the party policies from the left to center and
loosened ties with the trade unions to attract the middle-class
voters who traditionally supported the Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
In recent opinion polls, Blair's Labor Party had been enjoying
a comfortable lead over the Conservatives from 16 to 28 points,
indicating most voters want a change after 18-year rule of the
Conservative Party, which finally pushed him into Downing Street
today. The sleaze and sex scandals involved in Conservative
officials and the open splits of the ruling party over Europe have
also helped the Labor to win power again.
</P>
<P>
During his election campaign, Blair has promised to reform
education, punish young offenders, cut National Health Service
waiting lists and get 250,000 young people back to work.
</P>
<P>
Now it's time for him to keep his promises and start doing
instead of talking.
</P>
<P>
Blair was married to Cherie Booth, who is also a barrister, in
1980 with two sons and a daughter.

<HEADLINE> UK Business Circles' Demands on Labor Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- British business circles put forward
their demands on the Labor Government, while congratulating
Labor's landslide election victory today.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the Confederation of British Industry's (CBI)
call for clarification of Labor's policies on the minimum wage,
the windfall tax and the European Single Market, the British
Chambers of Commerce (BCC) voiced the European "Social chapter" as
an important concern.
</P>
<P>
David Richardson, president of the BCC said: "The priority now
must be to remove the uncertainty surrounding the new government's
policies on the single currency, social chapter, minimum wage and
the economy."
</P>
<P>
Labor has said it will end Britain's opt-out, negotiated by the
Tories, from this European framework for minimum working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
In what it called its six-point challenge to Labor, the BCC
called on it to "maintain our opt-out from the Social Chapter in
order to protect labor market flexibility".
</P>
<P>
It should use fiscal policy, if necessary adjusting income tax,
in order to stave off inflation but avoiding the harm interest
rate rises would do to business competitiveness, the BCC added.
</P>
<P>
The Chambers also called on Labor not to establish a minimum
wage "at a level which will harm competitiveness and jobs" and to
begin a debate on how to tackle Britain's skills deficit.
</P>
<P>
The British Retail Consortium, which represents 90 percent of
the retail industry by sales, said retailers had an important role
to play in the job creation strategies planned by Labor.
</P>
<P>
Its director general Ann Robinson said: "Success will depend on
the new government's commitment to a broad economic environment
that continues to encourage investment, competition and choice in
the High Street."

LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new Foreign Secretary Robin

foreign relations, vowing to make Britain a leading player in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Cook, whose Labor Party has won a landslide victory in

He stressed that the new government has three priorities in its
foreign policy, saying the first one is " to make Britain a

that we can better shape the direction of Europe if Britain takes
its rightful place in the driving seat of Europe."
</P>
<P>
The second priority is " to make maximum use of Britain's
embassies and high commissions to promote trade abroad and boost
jobs at home," he said.
</P>

countries for our commitment to building a strong international
community, and pride for ourselves in our contribution to keeping
the peace of the world and preserving the environment of our

<HEADLINE> Angolan FM Denies Involvement in Zairean War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio De
Moura today once again denied Angola's involvement in the Zairean
conflict.
</P>
<P>
He said this to reporters before the tripartite talks
of Angolan President Eduardo Dos Santos, Zairean rebel leader
Laurent Kabila and Rwandan Vice-President Paul Kagame.
</P>
<P>
Angola has no intention to create turmoil in Zaire, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, Angola hopes that the present Zairean
authorities be changed through peaceful means, since it has in
the past 32 years been engaged in systematically creating
instability in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government will continue to cooperate with the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in assisting refugees in
Zaire, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he expressed concern about the flow of large
numbers of armed Zairean refugees into Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean government in a letter to the U.N. Security
Council on Monday charged Angola with massing 1,500 soldiers in
the Yema region on the Angolan-Zairean border in a bid to support
Zairean rebels. Moura later denied the claims. enditem

<HEADLINE> Kenya Vows to Combat Customs Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government today said in
a statement that two senior Customs officers had been dismissed
due to being involved in illegal practices.
</P>
<P>
The statement disclosed that extensive investigations were
going on to unearth those involved in the illegal practice.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the government is determined to root out
corruptions in the Customs department, where enough evidence is
reportedly gathered on those involved.
</P>
<P>
The due process of the law will be applied "regardless of
one's position in government or society," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, some businessmen collude with
public officers to deny the government revenue by evading to pay
tax on imported goods.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that some imports which entered the country as
transit goods were meant for neighboring land-locked countries
and stored in Customs bonded warehouses.
</P>
<P>
However, these imported goods never reach their intended
destinations and instead are illegally diverted and later sold to
the local markets, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
This destroys local industries and denies people employment
opportunities, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said at a mass rally in
commemoration of the Labour Day on Thursday that some
unscrupulous businessmen import sugar on the pretext of transit
goods and then sell it on the local market.
</P>
<P>
Moi announced that businessmen importing sugar should be taxed
heavily to protect the local sugar industry from collapse.

<P>
CAIRO, May 2 (Xinhua) -- A surprise, massive sandstorm whose
speed reached 100 kilometers per hour swept Egypt this afternoon,
reducing the visibility into zero in many places.
</P>
<P>
The sandstorm, moving from the Libyan desert at midafternoon,
shrouded all streets of Cairo, the capital of Egypt, in darkness,
sending whiffs of sand and dust into all building and almost
suffocating the dwellers here.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports said the storm destroyed several houses and
uprooted trees in many places nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo International Airport closed down for about two
hours and incoming flights were diverted to the Red Sea coastal
town of Hurghada and to Aswan in the south.
</P>
<P>
The only death was reported in Giza province where a tree fell
on man and killed him on the spot.
</P>

witnessed a serious accident where a palm tree fell in Al-burge
village on high-voltage power cables resulting in a huge fire
which completely burnt 10 houses. Citizens and cattle were
evacuated immediately and no casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
In Assiut province, 320 kilometers south of Cairo, governor
Mohammed Ragaie Al-Tahawi declared a state of alert in the public
utilities including electricity, sanitary drainage and health
services.

high-voltage network across the country are functioning properly
without sustaining any damage in the sandstorm.
</P>

<P>
PARIS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Zairian rebel leader Laurent-Desire
Kabila is playing a game of cat and mouse with President Mobutu
Sese Seko by keeping the latter waiting to meet him on a South
African warship this evening.
</P>
<P>
The South African government is scheduled to host a
face-to-face meeting this evening between Kabila and Mobutu on
board the warship SAS Outeniqua in the international water off the
coast of Angola and Zaire.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela welcomed aboard Mobutu
this afternoon, who came on an armored vehicle and under the
company of his son, daughter, and about 15 bodyguards, all of them
transported by a support boat anchored at the Congolese port city
of Pointe-Noire.
</P>
<P>
But the presidential office of Angola, where Kabila is now
staying, said this evening that Kabila would not "in principle"
leave Angola this evening and the meeting could be postponed until
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South African Vice-President Thabo Mbeki, who is
supposed to accompany Kabila to land on SAS Outeniqua in a
helicopter, said that the meeting would be held tonight.
</P>

<HEADLINE> US Urges Mobutu, Kabila to Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States is urging
Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila
to hold talks to pull the central African country out of war
harassment, the State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
"These talks are very important for President Mobutu, very
important for alliance leader Kabila. But most importantly, very
important for the people of Zaire. We believe it is essential that
these talks take place. And we urge the leaders to make that
happen," State Department spokesman John Dinger said at a regular
briefing.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu was reported to have boarded a South African navy ship
in Congo for talks with Kabila, while the latter was to be waiting
in Angola's capital Luanda.
</P>
<P>
Dinger believed that Angola "has been providing support to the
(rebel) alliance," but he refused to confirm a Washington Post
report that Angolan troops equipped with armored vehicles and
heavy artillery have joined Zairian rebels in their push toward
the capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
He also refused to discuss reports that France had mounted a
covert operation to try to keep Mobutu in power.

<P>
KAMPALA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Y. Museveni met
here today with Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs Amre Moussa
over bilateral relations and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
They talked at length about economic relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that as the Egyptian economy has grown rapidly,
Egypt is putting emphasis on the development of the
social infrastructure and the rural area.
</P>
<P>
Moussa commended Museveni on the economic reforms which he has
introduced in Uganda to facilitate economic development.
</P>
<P>
Later, they met with a group of Egyptian businessmen who are
undertaking business ventures in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said, foreign investors had in the past been
discouraged from investing in Uganda because the governments
failed to make a full analysis of business flows to see how they
could benefit the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that concentration was instead put on externalizing
the dividends without calculating what would remain in the
country in form of payments to workers, taxes, money spent on raw
materials and other aspects. enditem

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Researches into Snail Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is researching into snail
farming with financial support from the World Bank, the News
Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
Adeniyi Amusan, the chief of Agricultural Superintendant of
the Ibadan-based Institute for Agricultural Research and
Training, was quoted as saying that the project started in
September 1995 with a foundation stock of 30 giant African
snails.
</P>
<P>
Within a month, 28 new snails emerged from the soil, he said,
adding that so far they have produced 1,300 such snails known as
archelins.
</P>
<P>
However, Amusan said, only 1,000 snails now survive, the other
300 were lost in an attack of soldier ants and rats.
</P>
<P>
He noted that if the snails are well-managed, they could yield
high economic returns because of the demand for them both in the
local and international market.
</P>
<P>
Snail meat is very nutritious, rich of protein and iron
content. It can also help control hypertension and improve
fertility in human body, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official added that his institute is ready to advise
farmers on snail farming.

<P>
The dialogue will open on Saturday in Kasane where the borders

</P>
<P>
"Smart Partnership", a concept conceived by Malaysia, is the
philosophy of creating "win-win" relationships and promoting
"cooperative competitiveness", said the report.
</P>
<P>
Masire said the aim of the meeting was to provide an
opportunity for business and governments to exchange views on how
they can work together in promoting the smart partnership as a
foundation for transforming southern Africa into a world growth
center.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Urges Women to Pursue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa today urged parents to encourage their daughters to pursue
technical education, saying it was one of the means to liberate
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Laying a foundation stone for the Mtwara Vocational Training
Center, southeastern Tanzania, the president said the number of
students in vacational centers has risen from 1,783 in 1984 to
4,000 now, but only 25 percent of the total intake was female.
</P>
<P>
"The notion that technical education was for males only should
be discarded. We should not enter with it in the next century,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The official Daily News quoted Mkapa as saying that parents
should encourage girls to pursue technical studies so as to
increase their employment share and enhance their ability to
self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
This, he pointed out, was one of the lasting solutions to
women's problems in the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
He said technical education was the launching pad for
Tanzania's economic take-off and called on the improvement of
their curriculum so that graduates from such colleges are able to
serve the economy.
</P>
<P>
The president said technical education would also enable the
youth to be employed in the informal sector as the formal sector
can only absorb 20,000 out of 300,000 job seekers annually.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said Tanzania still needs an expanded technical
education capacity to be able to enrol more school leavers.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the authorities to review the primary education
syllabus so that it contains a practical technical education
aspect. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye today underscored the need of using human waste
in biogas plants as a measure for enhancing environmental
sanitation.
</P>
<P>
After inspecting a new biogas plant which will use human waste
at Haidom Secondary School in Mbulut District, northern Tanzania,
Sumaye said, that "after all, the by-products after the gas has
been produced is as good as other fertilizers."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who himself is an expert in biogas plants
construction, said that even developed countries used human waste
to produce gas for household purposes.
</P>
<P>
He said the gas produced from biogas plants using human waste
do not have environmental effects.
</P>
<P>
The biogas plant, which is part of the 100 million Tanzania
Shillings (about 166,000 U.S. Dollars) Haidom Secondary School
project, will produce 250 cubic meters of gas a day. enditem

WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton and Republican congressional leaders
Friday announced agreement on a plan to balance the budget by 2002
and cut taxes, resolving a rancorous debate over federal spending
that has dominated the nation's politics for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton Friday dedicated a memorial to the
president who had coaxed the country through its worst depression
and led it through a brutal war. The Franklin Delano Roosevelt
Memorial honors the 32nd president as one of the great leaders of
this country -- in the company of Washington, Jefferson and
Lincoln -- and pays tribute to the jaunty inspiration that marked
the unique 12-year span of Roosevelt's presidency.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico rejected a proposal that
would allow United States drug agents to carry arms in Mexico, and
another that would let American officials administer lie-detector
tests to Mexicans applying for sensitive posts in Mexico's own
anti-drug agencies.
</P>
<P>
-- Four days after a member of the Republic of Texas
secessionist group was returned from jail to the group's mountain
compound in return for two hostages, he walked out of the cramped
trailer there and surrendered to state-law-enforcement officers.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Approves Draft 1998 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today approved a 540 billion peso (20.5 billion US dollar) budget
for 1998, 10 percent higher than that of 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released today by the Department of Budget and
Management, Budget and Management Secretary Salvador Enriquez said
the 1998 budget seeks to sustain the health of the fiscal sector
by maintaining a surplus in the government.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that for 1998, some 85 percent of the budget will
be programmed for productive expenditures, about the same level as
that of 1997 and an improvement over the 1996 budget which
allocated only 80 percent for productive expenses.
</P>
<P>
He said the unproductive components, namely the allocation for
interest payments and net lending including subsidy to the Oil
Price Stabilization Fund, which is a new expenditure in the 1998
budget, will comprise only 15 percent of the budget.
</P>
<P>
The department data also showed that proposed expenditures for
capital outlays will increase by 12 percent from 88.2 billion
pesos (3.35 billion US dollars) in 1997 to 98.8 billion pesos
(3.76 billion US dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Maintenance and other operating expenses will decline by 2.8
percent from 64.2 billion pesos (2.44 billion US dollars) to 62.4
billion pesos (2.37 billion US dollars), it showed.
</P>
<P>
Enriquez said that to promote infrastructure development, the
department is proposing an increase in the allocation for capital
outlays which would mean more roads, bridges, school buildings,
flood control and water supply system and other public facilities.
</P>
<P>
The department is currently analyzing the 1998 budget proposals
of national agencies, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said final decisions will be made on these proposals for
integration into the national budget that President Ramos will
submit to Congress in July.

<HEADLINE> China Reiterates Tax Demand on Expressway Tolls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- China's State Administration of
Taxation (SAT) has issued a circular reiterating the collection of
taxes on tolls from vehicles running on the country's expressways.
</P>
<P>
All areas must strictly observe the power to grant tax cuts and
exemptions as stipulated in the provisional and additional rules
on business taxes, and strictly follow the policy of levying taxes
on fees levied on vehicles on the expressways, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
China reimposed a business tax on tolls on expressways and
bridges in 1994, according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the consistency of tax laws, the Ministry of Finance
and the SAT issued a joint notice in 1995 saying that all areas
must strictly follow the relevant rules on business taxes on fees
collected by administrative departments and government agencies,
and may not grant tax breaks and exemptions without authorization.
</P>
<P>
However, recent surveys by auditing agencies show that in some
places business taxes are reduced or exempted recklessly, the SAT
circular said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Northeast China's Jilin
Province are changing their concepts about consumption, with
expenditure on durable goods, education and health care growing by
large margins in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Observers here hold that farmers are no longer simply
concentrating on improving basic living conditions, but are keen
to upgrade their overall quality of life.
</P>
<P>
Jilin is a leading agricultural base in China, and is
particularly famous for its maize production. Over the past few
years the province's grain production and that of township
enterprises have seen rapid development.
</P>
<P>
"With money in my pocket, I'm bound to improve my standard of
living," said a local farmer.
</P>
<P>
Color TV sets, motorcycles and cameras were favorite
consumption items among farmers in the first quarter of this year,
according to official figures, which reveal that the sales of
color TV grew by 32 percent to more than 11,000 sets in the
province's rural areas, compared the same period one year ago.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey of 1,600 agricultural families showed that
farmers' spending on living, household equipment and services
increased by 13.5 percent in the first quarter of the year, that
on medical care by 32.9 percent, and that on education and
entertainment by 12 percent; that on food and clothing only
inched up, compared with the same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Targets to Be Dustbin-Free City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The capital city of south China's
Guangdong Province announced that its dustbins will disappear
within three years, according to the "China Environmental News".
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve this target, a new method of rubbish
collecting and transportation is being experimented in some pilot
districts in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that eight rubbish compression stations have been
put into operation, and each of them can treat rubbish for six to
ten street blocks.
</P>
<P>
In the pilot districts, sanitation workers will collect rubbish
from door to door, and move the rubbish to the treatment center
after compressing them in the station.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the city produces approximately 5,000 tons
of garbage daily, and it has over 30,000 dustbins for rubbish
collection.
</P>
<P>
"These dustbins make the city look dirty while sometimes
creating trouble for traffics," said an official in charge of the
dustbin-free project.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that 80 rubbish compression stations are
enough to replace all the 30,000-plus dustbins.
</P>
<P>
The city has resolved to build 53 compression stations this
year, and to spread the service of collecting rubbish to the
doorstep to 60 percent of the families.

<HEADLINE> National Flag, Emblem Bill Tabled to PLC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The National Flag and National
Emblem Bill was tabled to the Provisional Legislative Council
(PLC) at its full sitting here today for the first and second
readings.
</P>
<P>
Introduced by Fanny Law, director of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) Chief Executive's Office, the bill
provides for the use and protection of the national flag and the
national emblem in the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Law said that Annex 3 of the Basic Law stipulates that six
national laws must be applied in the HKSAR with effect from July 1
through promulgation or legislation by the HKSAR, including a
resolution and an order relevant to China's national flag and
national emblem.
</P>
<P>
After the promulgation of the Basic Law on April 4, 1990, the
Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress
endorsed the Law on the National Flag and the Law on the National
Emblem in 1990 and in 1991 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Law said that these two laws are not in Annex 3 of the Basic
Law, but certain provisions are relevant to the HKSAR and should
apply in the HKSAR with local legislation.
</P>
<P>
The national flag and the national emblem symbolize China's
resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and the bill provides
that main government buildings in the HKSAR must display the
national flag, the national emblem, or both, Law said.
</P>
<P>
The national flag and the national emblem should be respected
and cherished, Law said, adding that the bill prohibits the use of
"damaged, defiled, faded or substandard" national flag or national
emblem.
</P>
<P>
In order to safeguard the dignity of the national flag and the
national emblem, the bill prohibits them from being used in
trademarks, advertisements or private funeral functions. In
addition, the national emblem must not be used as furnishings or
ornaments in everyday life.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive may also stipulate places or occasions on
which the national flag and the national emblem may not be used or
displayed.
</P>
<P>
The bill sets out the maximum penalty for intentionally
desecrating the national flag and the national emblem -- a fine of
50,000 HK dollars (6,410 US dollars) and three years'
imprisonment.

<HEADLINE> China Issues Notice to Counter Dry Spells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council has issued a
notice calling on government at all levels and departments
concerned to take drought-relief measures in order to ensure
successful spring sowing and a good summer harvest this year.
</P>
<P>
China has so far got off to a good start in farm production, as
spring plowing has proceeded smoothly, the acreage of summer crops
has expanded and the crops are doing fine, the notice said.
</P>
<P>
However, dry spells have hit large parts of north China,
northeast China, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, northwest China
and Sichuan Province since mid-April.
</P>
<P>
The drought, which is worsening, will do harms to the late
growth of summer crops and spring plowing right now, the notice
said.
</P>
<P>
"Governments at all levels and departments concerned should
take prompt actions to combat drought in order to ensure
successful spring sowing and a bumper summer harvest," the State
Council said in the notice.
</P>
<P>
The great significance of a good summer and year-round harvest
must be fully realized, the notice urged, adding that this year is
very important in the course of China's development.
</P>
<P>
A good harvest will be in the interests of developing the good
situation in agriculture and rural economy, maintaining the
overall situation of reform, development and stability, and
realizing the smooth return of Hong Kong to the motherland and the
convocation of the 15th the Communist Party of China (CPC)
National Congress, the State Council noted.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, governments at all levels and the departments
concerned must be fully aware of the significance of a good
agricultural harvest," it said.
</P>
<P>
To tackle drought, new water sources should be created and the
irrigated areas be enlarged, the notice said.
</P>
<P>
It also said that efforts should also be made to spread
water-saving farming techniques and techniques of farming under
arid conditions.

<HEADLINE> Japanese-Funded Golf Club Fined for Tax Evasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The tax authorities in this boom
city in south China's Guangdong Province have imposed a 26.48
million-yuan fine on a Japanese-funded golf club which ignored
repeated orders to pay taxes worth 70.62 million which it had
evaded during the period 1988-1996.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen tax bureau found out that the Honichi Golf Leisure
Club had enrolled 3,342 overseas members and received about 977
million yuan in membership fees over the past nine years. But the
club had paid no taxes.
</P>
<P>
The bureau froze the club's 13 million yuan bank account April
9 and sealed up and withheld 10 automobiles belonging to the club
April 10.
</P>
<P>
The club had ignored a payment deadline of April 25 this
year. Furthermore, it held two news conferences at which it spread
false information. The tax evasion case has developed into a
serious tax refusal one, said Wu Shengwen, director of the tax
bureau.

<HEADLINE> HK Seeks to End Asylum Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government is
working on an agreement with Hanoi to end Hong Kong's status as a
port of first asylum, a policy that has been in place for more
than 20 years, according to today's Hong Kong Standard.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to stem the flow of Vietnamese illegal
immigrants, which rose more than eight-fold in the first four
months of this year, according to Assistant Director of
Immigration Choy Ping-tai.
</P>
<P>
Choy said the government is working on a bilateral agreement
with Hanoi that would allow Hong Kong to immediately repatriate
all Vietnamese illegal immigrants upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
The report said the total number of Vietnamese illegal
immigrants who came to Hong Kong from January to April this year
reached 796 compared with 97 during the same period of last year
while for the whole of last year the number was 1,096.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the agreement would be in place shortly before or
after the handover.
</P>
<P>
Refugee Concern spokeswoman Pam Baker called the bilateral
agreement "a sensible idea." "These new arrivals come here to seek
jobs and not seek asylum," she said.

<HEADLINE> Regional Flag, Emblem Bill Introduced to PLC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Regional Flag and Regional
Emblem Bill was introduced to the Provisional Legislative Council
(PLC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) here
today for the first and second readings.
</P>
<P>
Fanny Law, director of the HKSAR Chief Executive's Office,
presented the draft bill, which provides for the use and
protection of the HKSAR regional flag and emblem, to the PLC at
its fifth full sitting.
</P>
<P>
Currently the Colony Armorial Bearing (Protection) Ordinance is
the only piece of legislation in Hong Kong regarding the
protection of government emblem, and it also indirectly governs
the use of Hong Kong flag, Law said.
</P>
<P>
But the ordinance cannot be adopted as a HKSAR law after
midnight June 30 because of its colonial color, in accordance with
a resolution passed earlier this year by the Standing Committee of
the Chinese National People's Congress, the director noted.
</P>
<P>
So there is a need to make a new legislation for the protection
of the regional flag and emblem of the HKSAR and on their use and
manufacture, she said.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill consists of four parts, she continued.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, to make provisions to safeguard the dignity of the
regional flag and the regional emblem.
</P>
<P>
Their main purpose is to prohibit the display and use of a
regional flag or regional emblem that is damaged, defiled, faded
or substandard, the intentional desecration of the regional flag
and the regional emblem, and the use of the regional flag and the
regional emblem in trademarks and for advertising purposes.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, to make provisions to ensure that the regional flag
and the regional emblem will be manufactured in accordance with
the specifications which have been set out by the Preparatory
Committee for the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the bill suggests that the national flag or the
national emblem occupy a more prominent position, when the
national flag is displayed together with the regional flag, or the
national emblem is displayed together with the regional emblem.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the bill empowers the chief executive to stipulate
which organizations and places in the HKSAR must display the
regional flag and the regional emblem.

<HEADLINE> Strategic Alliance Proposed for Insurers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A leader of Hong Kong's insurance
industry said a strategic alliance is needed in the Chinese
mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong to provide growth opportunities for
local insurers away from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers Lau Hon-keung
said the Hong Kong insurance market is nearly saturated and
competition is fierce. The mainland and Taiwan markets could
provide development opportunities for Hong Kong insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
"If Hong Kong, the mainland and Taiwan can create an alliance,
Hong Kong can expand its insurance business in both places," Lau
was quoted as saying in today's South China Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
He said that after the handover of Hong Kong, the business
relationship between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong will get
closer and there is a need for more cooperation between insurers
in the two places.
</P>
<P>
He said many insurers from the mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong
support the idea of establishing a strategic alliance, under which
the three places would have a formal exchange program for staff
and training insurance agents.
</P>
<P>
Lau indicated his federation would commission a report on the
strategic alliance issue.

<HEADLINE> Chief Executive's Office Moves Motion on HK Budget to PLC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A representative of the Chief
Executive's Office of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) today moved a motion requesting the HKSAR Provisional
Legislative Council (PLC) to support Hong Kong's budget for
1997-98.
</P>
<P>
At the 5th plenary session of the PLC, Fanny Law, director of
the office, said that the Chief Executive and the Executive
Council of the HKSAR support this budget which is based on the
consensus reached between the Chinese and British sides.
</P>
<P>
Since the financial year of 1997-98 straddles the transfer of
the Hong Kong government, the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group set
up in 1995 an expert group to handle the compilation of the
1997-98 budget and related matters.
</P>
<P>
She said that with a co-operative and pragmatic attitude, the
two sides reached a consensus on both the expenditure and revenue
aspects of the budget after more than 10 rounds of discussions.
</P>
<P>
She said that the transitional budget fully accords with the
established principles of financial prudence and the relevant
provisions in the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
It is a budget which is financially sound and prudent and takes
into account the interests of all quarters and it has a positive
effect on the future economic and social progress of Hong Kong,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Law noted that the budget also seeks to ensure that on its
establishment, the HKSAR government has healthy fiscal reserves to
meet the needs for medium- and long-term development.
</P>
<P>
The expenditure estimates are in accordance with the provisions
in Article 107 of the Basic Law -- keeping expenditures within
the limits of revenue.
</P>
<P>
The total expenditure is 203 billion HK dollars, of which 154
billion HK dollars is for recurrent expenses and 47.8 billion is
for capital projects.
</P>
<P>
The total estimated revenue is 234.7 billion HK dollars. The
significant increase is mainly due to the additional revenue from
the collection of rents in accordance with Article 121 of the
Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The estimated surplus is 31.7 billion HK dollars. The fiscal
reserves available to the HKSAR Government at April 1 1998 will
total 359 billion HK dollars (including the balance of the Land
Fund).
</P>
<P>
Such reserves are of paramount importance to the stability of
Hong Kong's monetary system during the transition, Law said,
adding that they also lay a sound financial basis for Hong Kong
people ruling Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
She said that how to use the reserves to further create wealth
and enhance the well-being of the community will be a great
challenge for the HKSAR government.
</P>
<P>
After Ms. Law's interpretation on the budget, the PLC meeting
decided to adjourn debate on the motion and the Finance Committee
of the PLC will discuss the budget in the forthcoming weeks.

</P>
<P>
The strong gale and poor visibility has led to the closure of
Aswan and Abu Simble airports.
</P>
<P>
Ten domestic flights, due to take off from Cairo Airport this
morning were delayed due to bad weather conditions over airports
of Luxor, Aswan, Sharm el-Sheikh and Hurghada.
</P>
<P>
An official at the Civil Aviation Authority said that poor
visibility made these airports unsafe for landing and taking-off
operations.
</P>
<P>
A state of emergency was announced at Cairo Airport to cope
with the problems created by the flood of the delayed passengers,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a dusty smell still lingered on the Cairo streets
which have returned to its daily hustle and bustle in brilliant
sunshine from the havoc of Friday afternoon's devastating
sandstorm.
</P>
<P>
The sandstorm, the worst in more than 30 years, has killed
eight people and injured three others in the country, according to
the Egyptian MENA news agency.
</P>
<P>
Most of the casualties were due to the fall of trees, posts and
walls.
</P>
<P>
A chaotic traffic was another major reason for the casualties
as the storm reduced drivers' visibility to zero in many parts of
sandstorm-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Ten other people were rushed to hospitals for breathing
problems in Cairo when the storm, moving from the Libyan desert at
midafternoon at a speed of 100 kilometers per hour, enveloped the
city in darkness and suffocated many people.
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted Minister of Electricity and Energy Maher Abaza as
saying that all medium and high-voltage network across the country
are functioning properly without sustaining any damage in the
sandstorm.
</P>
<P>
He said that Egypt's unified power grid is designed to
withstand earthquakes and storms.

<HEADLINE> Iron-Steel Giant Grows Rapidly In North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The biggest industrial company in
north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has joined the
country's top five steel giants, according to government
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that the Baotou Iron and Steel Company's overall
industrial output value reached 4.48 billion yuan in 1996, up
12.43 percent over the previous year. It produced 4.05 million
tons of steel and 3.86 million tons of iron in that year, net
increases of 750,000 tons and 810,000 tons, respectively, over
1995.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s the company ranked tenth among China's iron
and steel enterprises.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995) the company spent
over eight billion yuan on technical improvements, making itself
capable of producing four million tons of steel annually.
</P>
<P>
Last year it completed 122 major technical research projects,
thereby earning more than 170 million yuan in profits.
</P>
<P>
The company has a dozen branch factories, and its total
employees number over 140,000.
</P>
<P>
"Our major task is to upgrade our management," said Zeng
Guo'an, the company's general manager.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that improvements in management have lowered
production costs by 867 million yuan over the past three
years. The company generated over 1.6 billion yuan in profits and
taxes annually over the past four consecutive years, and its
export volume exceeded 90 million dollars-worth in both 1995 and
1996, at a time when most of the country's steel enterprises
suffered deficits.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Poor Roads Cause Huge Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's poorly-maintained roads are
causing the nation a loss of 80 billion Naira (about one billion
U.S. dollars) every year, the official New Nigerian reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the Minister of Works and Housing,
Major-General Abdulkarim Adisa as saying in Kaduna State on
Friday that about 53 billion Naira (about 66 million dollars) is
spent annually to repair vehicles due to the poor state of road
networks.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Nigeria's economic growth suffer a loss of 5.5
percent of the Gross Domestic Product, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has one of the most developed road networks in Africa,
thanks to the huge investment in the oil boom period in the
1970s. However, economic hardship in the years since has left
most of the roads uncared in declining.
</P>
<P>
The minister complained that the scarcity of bitumen is
hampering the timely execution of various rehabilitation
projects.
</P>
<P>
From October 1993 to March this year, the ministry got a
supply of 21,275 tons of bitumen, whereas the request is 400,000
tons, he said.

PARIS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The triumph of the British Labor Party of Tony Blair has
inspired all the French political parties -- except the
extreme-right National Front. While the ruling majority interprets
the victory as one of liberals, the leftwing parties are trying to
learn from their British counterparts in their own attempt to win
the legislative elections in France.
</P>
<P>
-- European countries have unanimously hailed the victory of
the British Labor Party of Tony Blair, calling for the turning of
a page of the British policy on Europe weeks from the holding of
the Intergovernmental Conference of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- While many Frenchmen mistakenly think that the victory of
British Labor Party of Tony Blair will have a domino effect in
France, ideologically speaking, Blair is closer to Prime Minister
Alain Juppe than Socialist Party leader Lionel Jospin. Moreover,
the economic balance sheet of the Conservative Party is excellent,
so Blair is unlikely to completely break with Thatcherism.
</P>
<P>
-- In the Elysee presidential palace, in the Matignon Hotel of
prime minister's office, and in every headquarters of political
parties joining the election campaign in France, people are
analyzing the victory of the British Labors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Jacques Chirac will speak to the French
people on May 7, the second anniversary of his election as
president.

HANOI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will begin the first round of
negotiations with the World Trade Organization (WTO) over entry in
Geneva this July, an official source here said today.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam applied to join the WTO when the Geneva-based
organization was established on January 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Vietnam has sent a summary of its trade policies
to it, said Tran Duc Minh, Director General of the Multilateral

</P>
<P>
Vietnam will be required to answer about 2,500 questions in the
July meeting to clarify its eligibility and ability to implement
the rights and obligations of a WTO member, Tran Duc Minh said.
</P>
<P>
He said Vietnam's application to join the WTO is aimed at
obtaining preferential treatment in trade relations, maintaining
its international balance of payments and protecting its fledgling
industries.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that it would take Vietnam more than three years
to become a full member of the WTO.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns US D'Amato Bill, Berlin Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran today indignantly condemned the
U.S. D'Amato Bill and the Berlin court verdict on the Mykonos case
at a international forum attended by jurists, lawyers and justice
ministers from 39 countries.
</P>
<P>
The four-day 36th session of the Asian-African Legal
Consultative Committee (AALCC) opened here today. About 40
countries, including China, Egypt, India, Iran, Iraq, Indonesia,
Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Russia and Singapore, are
represented at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Iranian First Vice-President
Hassan Habibi urged the AALCC annual session to include Iran's
request -- the subject of extraterritorial application of national
legislation -- in the agenda.
</P>
<P>
On August 5, 1996, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the
D'Amato Bill to punish non-American companies which invest 40
million dollars or more a year in Iranian oil and gas sectors.
</P>
<P>
Habibi strongly condemned the bill, saying that Iran intends to
bring attention of the participating delegations to the
"international repercussions of such a disastrous action."
</P>
<P>
Iran's proposal was accepted at the meeting and will be
reviewed and under discussion on the last day of the AALCC
session. AALCC President Teofisto Guingona, who is also Filipino
Justice Minister, told Xinhua that AALCC will take up the
subject.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian vice-president called on legal experts and lawyers
to strongly condemn the U.S. domestic law, describing it as
"breach of the fundamental rights of nations to development."
</P>
<P>
Habibi pointed out that no state has the right to enforce law
outside its territory -- except in rare cases within the rules of
international law.
</P>
<P>
The extraterritorial legislation should not extend to the point
that can threaten sovereignty and harm dignity, security and
development of other states, Habibi noted.
</P>
<P>
Iran's proposal also referred to the Berlin court verdict on
the Mykonos case on April 10 which implicated Iranian top
leadership behind the assassination of four exiled Kurdish
opposition leaders in a Berlin restaurant five years ago.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the meeting, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati told the meeting that there is a "dangerous trend"
for a country to "extend unilaterally the jurisdiction of domestic
courts which contravenes basic principles of international law."
</P>
<P>
The minister attacked the presiding judge of the Berlin court
for "violating the well-established principle of international law
-- namely, the Jurisdictional Immunities of States."
</P>
<P>
The Berlin court verdict sparked a crisis in relations between
Iran and Germany and European countries.
</P>
<P>
Germany and Iran have recalled their ambassadors and expelled
four diplomats from each side. Ambassadors from EU member
nations, except Greece, have also been recalled from
Tehran.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Booming in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The private sector in this north
China port city is maintaining an upward momentum, with its
registered capital exceeding 9.4 billion yuan by the end of last
year, or a year-on-year increase of 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
The sector, initiated by the municipal government in the 1980s
to offer employment for jobless young people, has now grown into
one of the city's five economic driving forces, along with the
state-owned economy, collective economy, township enterprises and
foreign-funded economy. It handed in more than one billion yuan in
taxes to the state last year.
</P>
<P>
More than 237,000 individual household-operated firms and
16,000 private firms are involved in the sector, a total of
512,000 people or 5.4 percent of the city's total population,
according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin has incorporated the private economy into its overall
development strategy, and adopted some preferential policies to
encourage individual households to develop into privately-run
enterprises, which will be directed further to large-scale
performance, high-tech and export-oriented development.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year there were 878 privately-run
enterprises, each with one to five million yuan of registered
capital, a year-on-year rise of 162.8 percent. The per-household
capital rose to 420,000 yuan, a 48.5 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government plans to set up a private economic
development park, let development zones admit privately-run
enterprises and encourage the private sector to participate in the
transformation of small state-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> OAU Crisis Response Force Soon, Says Salim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Africa has agreed to form a
multinational crisis response force that could be called upon to
intervene in crisis situations, according to Salim Ahmed Salim,
secretary-general of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
But the arrangement would not be a standing peace force, Salim
said, adding that what the content would go for was a formula by
which member countries would create peace contingents with their
national armies for intervening conflicts in the continent, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
On his second day of his visit to Nigeria on Friday, Salim
said a standing force could consume the meagre resources
available in the continent.
</P>
<P>
He said the OAU was committed to the formation of a crisis
response force based on a formula peculiar to the continent's
situation and available resources.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the idea of a regional peace force now being
vigorously canvassed by the United States and Western nations was
not new to African leaders since it was first prescribed by the
Ghanaian leader, Kwame Nkrumah, when he called for the formation
of an African High Command.
</P>
<P>
What must be done concerning a peace force to intervene in the
conflicts on the continent must be done in conjunction with
international organizations such as the United Nations and other
bodies with the continent's peculiarities in view, he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim is leading a high-powered OAU delegation to the African
First Ladies Summit on Peace which is to open in Abuja, capital
of Nigeria, on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Car Dealers Racket Exposed in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambians who have bought cars from
South Africa have complained of a highly sophisticated syndicate
of bogus dealers who sell vehicles and later claim them as
stolen.
</P>
<P>
The dealers are reportedly selling vehicles to unsuspecting
Zambians and later making insurance claims for indemnity,
reporting the vehicles have been stolen.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted communications and transport
deputy minister Gilbert Mululu as saying that he has received a
number of reports of vehicles bought from car dealers in South
Africa being impounded by international police (INTERPOL) in
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
According to the local newspaper, he said that "it is
because of such complaints that we have changed the system and
introduced new blue books with unique security features. We will
soon be getting in touch with the automobile association of South
Africa and insurance firms."
</P>
<P>
INTERPOL seized more than 40 vehicles in Lusaka and Copperbelt
this week suspected of being stolen from South Africa and other
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
In Kitwe, northern Zambia, INTERPOL officers coming from
Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe seized over 30 cars in the
past week.
</P>
<P>
Mululu said he is aware of an INTERPOL initiative to curb
cross-border car thefts currently operating in Zambia but there
is need to address the problem at the source.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister: Middle East Peace Process Not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy has denied an allegation that the peace process in the
Middle East is dead, saying it is just "somewhat deadlocked."
</P>
<P>
The state-run Israel Radio today quoted Levy as saying
consultations are taking place in the foreign ministry on how to
move the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
David Afek, head of the foreign ministry's political research
center, told a meeting of the ministry's management that the peace
process is dead after the U.N. condemnation of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Afek was quoted in the local press Wednesday as saying the
U.S. is not with Israel, neither is Europe, nor is the Arab
world. Israel's positions are not accepted in the world, and it
needs a political initiative "to tell us where we're
heading. Without that, the situation will only get worse," he said.
</P>
<P>
Afek's statement aroused a controversy in the foreign
ministry. Foreign ministry Director-General Eitan Bentsur issued a
statement Thursday denying reports that the peace process is
dead.
</P>
<P>
Bentsur, the number two figure in the ministry, said "The
ministry's position is that the peace process is alive and
well. Efforts are being made to return the negotiations to their
track and I'm sure this will happen soon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bentsur also denied a report in the Hebrew daily, Yediot
Aharonot, that the foreign ministry has opened a "war file."
"This report is groundless. Nobody in the ministry has been asked
or permitted to open such a mysterious file. The ministry is
devoting all its efforts to advancing the peace process," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry has been embarrassed by the country's
international isolation as a result of the hardline policy
adopted by the rightwing Likud-led government. The peace image
developed since the signing of the historic Oslo Accords in 1993
has largedly been tarnished especially by the plan new Jewish
settlement at Har Homa in Arab East Jerusalem adopted a month
ago.

<HEADLINE> Southwest China Province Uses Education to Assist Those in Need </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- One out of every ten who live below
the poverty line in China come from southwestern Guizhou province,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The the backward in Guizhou is attributed mainly to its
geographical disadvantage and low level of education.
</P>
<P>
In its 48 counties that are locked into poverty, the number of
young illiterates accounts for 38.1 percent of the population. The
remaining youngsters have received no more than five years of
education.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, the provincial government have been trying to
educate the poor people, provide them with vocational training and
boost industries that use the local human and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Women and children, who account for 60 percent of the total
destitute population, were the first target.
</P>
<P>
According to the Guizhou Economic Commission, since 1989, a
total of 1.9 million rural Guizhou women have been required to
participate in a national technical training program for poverty
alleviation. Eighty percent of them eventually grasped one or two
techniques.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the local committees of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), non-Communist parties, and the
federations of industry and commerce initiated in the early 1990s
a technical poverty alleviation campaign, which involved 36,000
employees and covered more than 200 townships and villages.
</P>
<P>
So far, 8,560 projects have been completed with 1.5 million
farmers trained and 40 vocational-technical schools set up.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, after 1995, the local governments at all levels have
increased by a large margin the funding earmarked to boost
education for the destitute population. The anti-poverty effort
has enabled 10 percent more youngsters in the mountainous area to
go back to school and also helped 300,000 young people become
literate by 1996. At the same time, 80 percent of the towns in the
poor region have set up culture and technology training centers.
</P>
<P>
The local government has made it clear in its Ninth Five-Year
Plan (1996-2000) that 85 percent of bank poverty-relief loans
should be injected into planting and husbandry along with
agricultural by-products processing.
</P>
<P>
The fund includes a training program for professional personnel
and another to boost infrastructure construction.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Reaping Benefits of More Phone Connections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of "telephone villages"
where more than 60 percent of rural families have phones reached
9,572 at the end of March, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
There were 13.43 million rural phone subscribers during the
period, accounting for about 21 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Most "telephone villages" are in southern and eastern coastal
regions where rural township industries are booming and many
farmers run individual businesses.
</P>
<P>
Rapid telecommunications development in rural areas is part of
the country's overall fast expansion of telephone networks in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, the post and
telecommunications sector achieved 37.55 billion yuan (4.52
billion US dollars) in trade volume, a rise of 33.6 percent over
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
And the sector also notched up 36.39 billion yuan (4.3 billion
US dollars) in revenue, an increase of 35.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
This means that China's post and telecom industry is keeping to
its fast development trends.
</P>
<P>
The MPT report said that in the January-March period, China
provided 55,775 new phone subscribers every day, an increase of
13.359 over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
China's phone coverage -- access to telephones for every 100
people -- reached 6.68 percent by the end of March this year.

<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- China's rebust economy has enticed a
leading French conglomerate to intensify its investments in the
country, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Rhone-Poulenc, the world's seventh largest pharmaceutical and
chemicals group, has 15 additional projects under negotiation with
Chinese parters.
</P>
<P>
The new projects are expected to be signed within the next two

and also general delegate for the Chinese mainland, Taiwan and
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the French company had already

1996.
</P>
<P>
Rhone-Poulenc has also set up Rhone-Poulenc (China) Co, the

<HEADLINE> Ujamaa (Socialism) There to Stay, Tanzanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 3 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa said
on Friday the ruling Revolutionary Party (CCM) has not abandoned
Ujamaa (Socialism) but rather changed the strategy by placing the
economy in private hands so as to achieve progress, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a CCM Regional Executive Committee seminar in
Mtwara, South-Estern Tanzania, President Mkapa said public
ownership of all major means of production had failed to deliver
the goods, but in a short span of time, it has proved that it is
possible for the government to earn dividends and get taxes from
privatised firms.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who is also CCM National Chairman, cited the Tanzania
Breweries Limited (TBL) which paid 20 billion Tanzania Shillings
(about 33 million US Dollars) to the Treasury in tax and
dividends in a span of two years. He said the amount was equal to
the budget of one large ministry or three smaller ministries.
</P>
<P>
"If we could get 10 such companies, it is obvious that the
ability of the government to carry on its core functions and
deliver social services, would be improved," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said private investors should not be seen as exploiters
as the government also benefits from them in terms of taxes and
employment for the people.
</P>
<P>
He said he personally does not pride in privatising public
firms, but was courageous enough to admit that there was need to
change tactics in order to achieve faster development.
</P>
<P>
The CCM Chairam told the seminar that he was aware that there
were people within CCM who think that the party has lost
direction and was no longer propagating its Ujamaa ideology, but
said ideology cannot be sustained by a weak economy.
</P>
<P>
"We are not changing the objectives of our policy. We are
changing the methods so that we build an economy that can sustain
Ujamaa goals," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said some CCM and government leaders have failed to move
with the fast changes being undertaken in the country and did not
understand their necessity, meaning and objectives.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that the presence of such people in
CM and the government was dangerous as it would create a rift
between the leadership or impede the implementation of CCM'
election manifesto.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Farmers Urged to Diversify Crop Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Minister of Agriculture,
Food and Fisheries Edith Nawakwi has urged farmers in the country
to diversify crop growing to enable them earn money on a large
scale.
</P>
<P>
While inspecting a farm growing paprika on Friday, Nawakwi
said to local farmers that paprika is a cash-earning product
which she would love to see a lot of farmers venture into.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out the importance of crop diversification, saying
that it is the surest way of enhancing agriculture both
commercially and locally and appealed to the farmers to grow
crops not only to feed their families but equally enough to sell
to earn money.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, the owner of the farm Ronald Mwansa said
that a ton of paprika fetches 1,600 US dollars on the European
market and at present New York is the readily available market
for it.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Takes Disciplinary Actions for Rough Plays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Gabon was fined 10,000 Swiss francs
(6,800 US dollars) on Friday by the soccer's governing body FIFA
for its inadequate security measures in a World Cup qualifier.
</P>
<P>
On April 6, Morocco led 4-0 against Gabon before fans threw in
objects onto the field in Libreville and Ugandan referee Charles
Masembe had to abandon the match after 55 minutes.
</P>
<P>
But FIFA delayed a decision on the match itself pending a
meeting of the World Cup Organizing Committee which will decide
its outcome on May 30.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, FIFA also suspended eight players for their rude
conducts in recent World Cup games, including three-match bans for
Ecuadoran Luis Capurro and Ireland's Jason McAteer.
</P>
<P>
The heaviest fine levied Friday was against Croatia with 15,000
Swiss francs (10,200 dollars) after smokebombs were set off in
Split during a 1-1 draw with Denmark on March 29.
</P>
<P>
Capurro was punished for striking an opponent from behind in
Ecuador's 1-1 draw with Peru on April 2 while McAteer was sent off
on April 2 for kicking a Macedonian player in the head.
</P>
<P>
Mitko Sojovski, who scored twice on penalties for Macedonia to
forge a 2-2 draw, was banned fr two matches.
</P>
<P>
Other sanctions included a two-match ban for Hong Kong's Chan
Chi Keung and Thailand's Lonesawang Sanor for their actions in a
3-2 victory by Hong Kong on March 30, and a two-match suspension
for Luxembourg's Joel Groff.

<HEADLINE> 8 Killed, 3 Injured in Egypt's Sandstorm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Eight people were killed and three
others injured in Friday's worst sandstorm ever sweeping across
Egypt in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian MENA news agency today quoted an interior ministry
source as saying that most of the casualties were due to the fall
of trees, posts and walls.
</P>
<P>
A chaotic traffic was another major reason for the casualties
as the storm, moving from the Libyan desert at midafternoon,
reduced drivers' visibility to zero in many parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Ten people were rushed to hospitals for breathing problems in
Cairo when the storm, packed with winds of 100 kilometers per
hour, enveloped the city in darkness, suffocated many people.
</P>
<P>
A total of 29 trees, seven posts, three walls of houses and
parts of nine houses collapsed in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Two gas pipes were broken in the capital but there were no
casualties or heavy damages, said the source.
</P>
<P>
According to Wahid Saudi of the Egyptian Meteorological
Service, it was the worst sandstorm in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Beni-Suef province, some 100 kilometers south of Cairo,
witnessed a serious accident where a palm tree fell in Al-burge
village on high-voltage power cables resulting in a huge fire
which completely burnt 10 houses.
</P>
<P>
In Assiut province, 320 kilometers south of Cairo, a state of
alert was declared in the public utilities including electricity,
sanitary drainage and health services.
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted Minister of Electricity and Energy Maher Abaza as
saying that all medium and high-voltage network across the country
are functioning properly without sustaining any damage in the
sandstorm.
</P>
<P>
He said that Egypt's unified power grid is designed to
withstand earthquakes and storms.

</P>
<P>

trip.
</P>
<P>

NEW DELHI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- India's Congress Party has
rescheduled its organizational elections for the third time,
triggering off a controversy both inside and outside the party,
the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
All India Congress Committee spokesman V. N. Gadgil announced
Friday that the poll process will now begin on May 22 and finish
by July 15 -- about one and a half month behind the May 31
deadline set by the Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
He said the delay was caused by the three-week political
turmoil that followed the Congress Party's decision to withdraw
support to the H. D. Deve Gowda government on March 30.
</P>
<P>
Party General Secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad approached the
Election Commission last week for permission to postpone the polls
on the same ground, but the commission turned down the plea.
</P>
<P>
Gadgil could not give a clear answer as to why the party defied
the commission and refused to discuss the latter's powers in the
matter.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, the commission will give clearance for the
postponement of the polls.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how the commission will react to the latest
development.
</P>
<P>
The commission had earlier set January as the deadline for the
Congress Party to conduct organizational polls.
</P>
<P>
At the party's request, the commission had subsequently allowed
the party to postpone the elections twice, with March 31 and May
31 reset as the deadline.

HANOI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's foreign trade deficit
dropped by 30.3 percent in the first quarter to 960 million
U.S. dollars from 1,378 million dollars a year before, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-invested businesses accounted for 34 percent of the
total deficit, official statistics said.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit has been narrowed thanks to more effective

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Praises Sino-Africa Relations (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng said he hoped that
his visit to the seven African nations will further Sino-African
exchanges, increase mutual understanding, develop traditional
friendship and expanding reciprocal cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark in his reply to questions concerning the
purpose and significance of this visit put forward by Xinhua
correspondents upon his departure for Africa.
</P>
<P>
Li said that President Jiang Zemin, during his visit to six
African countries in May last year, voiced his views on the
building of long-term stable and all-round cooperative
Sino-African ties for the 21st century, which drew wide-ranging
praises and welcome from all the African countries.
</P>
<P>
Li said the current world situation is generally moving toward
relaxation with an accelerating multi-polarization trend and a
further strengthening of the international status of developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the world is still strewn with conflicts, the unjust
and irrational international political and economic order remains
unchanged and the disparity between the rich and the poor is
enlarging, Li said, noting that peace and stability are still the
two major topics facing the governments and peoples of all
countries.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China always attaches importance to
strengthening its unity and cooperation with the developing
countries including African nations, which constitutes an
important component part of the independent foreign policy of
peace China has been pursuing.
</P>
<P>
The growth of friendly relations between China and developing
countries is conducive to advancing world peace and development.

<P>
On the future growth and prospects of Sino-African ties, Li
Peng noted that Sino-African relations have scored great progress
lately, which have been epitomized by growing bilateral exchanges,
particularly an exchange of visits at the high-level.
</P>
<P>
"Such an exchange of visits have deepened mutual understanding,
trust and friendship between the Chinese and African leaders," the
Chinese premier said.
</P>
<P>
"Sino-African economic and trade cooperation have also achieved
significant results, with a growing number of Chinese enterprises
going to Africa to develop businesses," he said, "and such
cooperation is becoming increasingly active and the patterns of
cooperation tends to be diversified."
</P>
<P>
"China and Africa have further increased their consultations in
international affairs," he said, "and at the recent Geneva meeting
of UN commission of human rights, African countries along with
other developing countries, upholding fairness and justice, and
firmly supporting China, once again foiled the anti-China proposal
by a few Western countries."
</P>
<P>
"There are no conflicts of interest or historic grievances
between China and Africa," the premier said, "they are now facing
heavy tasks of developing economy."
</P>
<P>
"Both sides have vast common interests in international affairs
and good basis for cooperation and huge potentials for economic
cooperation and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
He further acknowledged that "it is in conformity with the
aspirations of the Chinese and African people to further enhance
mutual exchanges, promote friendly cooperation in varying fields
and deepen the traditional friendship between the peoples."
</P>
<P>
"Sino-African relations have wide prospects for development,"
he added.

<P>
With regard to Sino-African economic and trade cooperation, Li
said the Chinese government has always supported and helped with
the economic development of African nations ever since 1960s.
</P>
<P>
"China has grant aids to Africa within its capability," he
said. "Though the amount of economic aid was limited, it does not
attach any political conditions to these aids."
</P>
<P>
"China's fully respect to the wishes of the recipient countries
have won high praises from the vast majority of African countries
and people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We always maintain that such aid should be mutual and reflect
the brotherhood of mutual help among developing countries. African
countries, too, have for long given huge support and help to China
and the Chinese people have felt deeply grateful to it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, based on the changed conditions of Africa and
China, the Chinese government has reformed and restructured its
form of foreign aid," Li said. "The goal of our economic aid is to
proceed from the specific conditions and effectively help African
nations to develop their economy by enlarging the scale of
Sino-African economic cooperation and increasing the benefits of
substantial and more-varied economic cooperation with African
nations.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government encourages Chinese enterpriese to
cooperate directly with African enterprises, supports Chinese
companies and enterprises to invest in Africa and to go in for
contracted technical and labor services and expand the sphere of
cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China's basic policy of aiding Africa remains unchanged," he
said.
</P>
<P>
During this visit, he added, China will sign a number of
economic and trade cooperation agreements with African governments
and enterprises, and explore into new channels of further
developing economic and trade cooperations.
</P>
<P>
China and Africa, which is rich in resources and has a huge
market, are mutually complementary to some extent in economy, he
said, expressing his belief that through their joint efforts China
and Africa will score a new growth in economic and trade ties.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The names of three leading
supermarket chains in Bangkok have been exposed for selling
contaminated food.
</P>
<P>
Formaldehyde, fungus and bacteria were found in packaged food
sampled from the three supermarkets during a surprise inspection
on Friday by a team led by Bangkok Governor Bhichit Rattakul.
</P>
<P>
The group carried out random checks on three types of packaged
food -- fresh, ready-to-eat and ready-to-cook.
</P>
<P>
Formaldehyde was detected in bean sprouts and bacteria in fresh
food at Foodland Supermarket.
</P>
<P>
Bacteria and fungus were also found in ready-to-eat and
ready-to-cook food at Central and the mall's Home Fresh Mart.
</P>
<P>
At Central, "use by" dates on meat balls, spring rolls and
coconut milk were found to have expired.
</P>
<P>
Some labels on packages were found to be either fabricated or
incomplete, without showing dates of manufacture and expiry, the
food's origin, ingredients, preservatives, storage instructions
and approval from the Food and Drug Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok governor gave the supermarkets one week to improve.

KATHMANDU, May 3 (Xinhua) -- India's former Prime Minister H.
D. Deve Gowda is expected to arrive here today for a three-day
private visit to Nepal, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of Gowda's visit is to make his pilgrimage
to the Pashupati Temple, a holy place of the Hindu religion in a
Kathmandu suburb, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Nepali Foreign Ministry confirmed Gowda's
visit but declined to comment on his agenda, saying the visit is
largely a private one.
</P>
<P>
Gowda, who stepped down last month when the Congress Party
withdrew support to his United Front government, had earlier twice
missed an official visit to Nepal when he was the Indian prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
His visit to Nepal was canceled twice in November 1996 and last
March respectively due to his mother's death and the change of
government in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Nepal, Gowda is scheduled to meet Nepali
Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Election Official Plays Down Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's General Elections
Institute's chief Moch. Yogie S.M. played down the United
Development Party's (PPP) decision Friday not to campaign in
Jakarta and Yogyakarta.
</P>
<P>
The PPP, along with the ruling party Golkar and the Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI), started its campaign on April 27 for the
May 29 general election and the campaign will run till May 23.
</P>
<P>
"The party is expected to continue its campaign," Yogie, who is
also the minister of home affairs, said last night when asked to
comment on the PPP's decision to call off its campaign activities
in Jakarta and Yogyakarta.
</P>
<P>
The PPP has stopped campaigning in Yogyakarta, Central Java, to
protest the attacks by supporters of the ruling party Golkar on
two of its offices there Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yogie said the attacks should not be "exaggerated" because they
were minor incidents involving Golkar supporters who could not
control their emotions.
</P>
<P>
The PPP also canceled its campaign here Friday because the
authorities have refused to let it hold outdoor rallies.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of PPP supporters Friday afternoon cruised the main
streets of Jakarta in motorcade parades though the party leaders
had decided to cancel campaigning activities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of the Election Supervision Committee
Singgih said the committee will be impartial in dealing with
violations of election rules.
</P>
<P>
"Any group would be punished if they violated election
regulations," Singgih stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said each party has already violated some regulations since
the parties entered their respective second rounds of campaigning
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the local press today, dozens of people were
injured Friday in two clashes between PPP supporters and hundreds
of unidentified people in Pekalongan, Central Java.
</P>
<P>
In this year's campaign, the country is divided into three
groups of campaign areas where the three parties could conduct
their campaign activities in turns.
</P>
<P>
The government also banned motor parades and marches during the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The three contestants are vying for 425 of the 500 seats of the
House of Representatives. The 75 remaining seats are reserved for
the Armed Forces whose members do not vote.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 124 million eligible voters will take part in the
forthcoming general election.

BANGKOK, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 10,000 poor villagers have
ended their three-month-long protest in front of the government
house, after Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh promised to help
solve their problems.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit, who on Friday met the protesting villagers and
leaders of the Assembly of the Poor, agreed to help find solutions
and take up some of the problems at next weekly cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan also agreed that the
priority of a 2-billion-baht (80 million U.S. dollars) central
fund will be to help poor farmers affected by two dams built in
the 1970s and 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The government on Friday arranged nearly 100 buses to take home
the villagers, most of whom are from the north and northeast.
</P>
<P>
The villagers, under the Assembly of the Poor, arrived in
Bangkok in late January, less than two months after the Chavalit
government took office and presented 121 problems to the
government.
</P>
<P>
Most of the problems have risen from land conflicts, evictions
and government infrastructure construction such as hydropower dams
and government centers and have accumulated over the past two
decades under several governments.

<HEADLINE> Businessman With Heroin Arrested in Colombo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Police Narcotics Bureau
(PNB) Friday arrested a wealthy businessman with 650 grams of
heroin in Colombo, according to police sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the man, alleged to be the main heroin dealer
in some areas south of Colombo, was carrying the drug on the sly
to avoid suspicion when the PNB arrested him.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old man collects drugs from India and packs them
and sells them to local dealers. At the time of his arrest, he had
six packets of heroin on him, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the man is a Tamil businessman and
therefore they are also probing into the possibility of the
suspect having rebel connections.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels who have been fighting for a separate state,
have allegedly launched fund-raising campaigns by engaging in
international drug trafficking recently, according to local
reports.

<HEADLINE> Memorial Service Held for Helen Snow in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 2 (Xinhua) -- A memorial service was held today
in a church in Connecticut, the United States, to honor Helen Snow
for her life-time commitment to building a bridge of understanding
between the Chinese and American people.
</P>
<P>
Helen Snow, who died at 90 on January 11, 1997, was the former
wife of Edgar Snow. A well-known American woman reporter and
writer, she lived in China in the 1930s and wrote over 40 books
about China all her life.
</P>
<P>
Helen Snow's book Inside Red China, along with Edgar Snow's Red
Star Over China, became the classic documentation of the Chinese
revolution.
</P>
<P>
Those present at the memorial service included Huang Hua,
former Chinese vice-premier and foreign minister, and Li Daoyu,
China's ambassador to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Huang Hua said, "My wife and I have come 8,000 miles from the
other side of the globe to pay our last respects."
</P>
<P>
"Helen will live forever in the memory of the Chinese people
because they see in her a tried and true friend who understood
their plight and sufferings and shared their hopes and aspirations
as one human being to another," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now, as our countries prepare to enter a new millennium of
hope for the progress of mankind, let us remember and cherish
Helen's legacy of building a bridge of friendship, understanding
and cooperation between our two great peoples," Huang concluded.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his deepest sorrow over Helen's death, Li Daoyu,
recalled the indelible contributions Helen has made to China-U.S.
relations. He described her death as a great loss to the people of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that in its efforts to develop into a strong and
prosperous nation, China has enjoyed tremendous help and support
from its foreign friends like Helen and owed a great deal to them
for what they have done for it.
</P>
<P>
Some of Helen's American friends recalled their relationship
with Helen, and her influence on the events in China and on the
U.S.-China relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Local entry Martin Sinner became the
last German victim as he failed to secure a semifinal berth in the
Munich Open tennis tournament on Friday.
</P>
<P>
After a two-hour bare-knuckled battle, Sinner who ranked 129th,
was knocked off by 13th-ranked Alex Corretja of Spain 5-7, 6-2,
6-1, making the Germans to miss the semis for the first time since
1991.
</P>
<P>
In the cheers of 4,500 home fans, the German qualifier had a
strong start by winning the first set 7-5, but was out of the
rhythem in the succeeding sets when Corretja regained his
confidence and forms with precise strokes and heavy hits.
</P>
<P>
Swiss Marc Rosset, fighting a flu, ousted second-seeded Carlos
Moya in straight sets by winning the key points in a match plagued
by errors from both players. After receiving treatment twice at
the court, Rosset eventually secured his semifinal berth 7-5, 7-6
(7-5).
</P>
<P>
Rosset, a former Olympics singles champion, will face Corretja
in Saturday's semifinals.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Homicide claimed 410 lives in the
metropolitan Caracas during the first quarter of this year,
accounting for 67 percent of the total deaths caused by violence
and social unrest in the capital of Venezuela, a study shows.
</P>
<P>
The study was made by the Forensic Medicine Division of the
Judicial Technical police and the National Council of Scientific
and Technological Research.
</P>
<P>
It says that homicides were the primary cause of the total
deaths of 604 in the first three months in 1997, followed by
accidents and suicides.
</P>
<P>
Jack Castro, head of the police department, said that 300
homicide victims were male and only 110 were female.
</P>
<P>
He said that 380 people were killed by firearms and 25 by
knives.
</P>
<P>
The study indicates that homicides perpetrated by firearms or
knives occurred primarily in the eastern and western suburbs of
Caracas.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Real Estate Market to Warm up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's real estate market is
expected to bottom out after two-years of slack performance, China
Daily reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The good news comes as a new package of long called for rules
on housing mortgage loans were put into effect last Monday.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China announced on Monday it was offering
housing mortgage loans with lower interest rates for home buyers
in China's 223 cities.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) in mortgage loans will
be made available this year through several State-owned commercial
banks and the mortgage terms will be as long as 20 years and cover
up to 70 per cent of the housing price.
</P>
<P>
"The new measures on housing mortgage loans will certainly lend
a hand to Beijing's real estate market which has just begun on
another round of development," Pan Shiyi, vice-chairman of board
of directors of China (Beijing) Real Estate Index (CREI) was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The CREI Beijing index reported the first bounce back in March
after a six-month decline, which marked the second turning point
for revival since the system was founded in late 1994.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the realty markets of most southern cities which rely on
bank loans to develop real estate, Beijing's real estate market
is linked more to enterprises or payment installments by
house-buyers, which explains why Beijing's housing prices are not
much subject to the country's credit policies.

<P>
TIRANA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Albania has not asked to extend the
mandate of the Italian-led eight-nation security force as some
foreign media have reported, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said
today.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign media recently reported that the Albanian
government has called for the mandate of the multi-national
protection force to be extended. But the spokesman said the
reports were not true.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the government attached great importance to
the role the multi-national force has played in Albania and
promised that the government and its institutions will provide any
possible cooperation with the force.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 people have been killed since violence broke out
in Albania early this year after the collapse of shaky investment
schemes. Many army depots have been reportedly looted in the
violence.
</P>
<P>
Some 6,000 troops of the multi-national protection force have
arrived in Albania in the past two weeks to secure the delivery of
humanitarian aid and to guard the ports, airports and key
transportation routes.

<HEADLINE> African Bees Cause Alarm in Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, May 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 130 persons had to
receive medical treatment at hospitals and about 1,000 domestic
animals died in Panama due to attacks by African bees during
the first quarter of this year, said today the Panamanian
Civil Protection National System (Sinaproc).
</P>
<P>
Central American security organizations directors said recently
that there are 13 billion Africanized bees in Panama which are a
serious danger for the region, and promised to draft joint
contingency projects to combat them.
</P>
<P>
These insects arrived in Panama in February of 1982 and since
then they have killed five persons, and caused the hospitalization
of several thousands, plus killing a considerable number of
animals, such as dogs, cows, horses and even chicken.
</P>
<P>
Central American security organizations expressed hope that the
narrowness of the Panamanian territory and its condition of being
the only land passage between South and North America are the
ideal conditions to stop the spreading of new swarms.
</P>
<P>
The Sinaproc is already drafting a contingency plan to combat
the bees, which could start the extermination of big communities
of these insects. enditem

<HEADLINE> 1,190 New Vehicles Registered Daily in Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 3 (Xinhua) -- An average of 1,190 vehicles,
including 737 cars, are added to Bangkok's congestion every day,
according to the figures issued by the Land Transport Department
of the Thai government.
</P>
<P>
Registered were 70,353 new vehicles in Bangkok during the first
two months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the number of vehicles in Bangkok has
soared by 49.5 percent. In 1992 there were 2,373,288 vehicles on
the road in the Thai capital, but last year the number reached
3,549,082.
</P>
<P>
Yongyut Sarasombat, secretary-general of the office of the
Commission for the Management of Road Traffic, said his office is
worried about the increase because the road area in Bangkok has
risen only by 1.5 percent annually.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Wants Continued Dialogue Over Malvinas Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Argentine government today
hoped to keep constructive dialogue with Britain's Labor
government over the disputed Malvinas Islands.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Relations Ministry said in a communique today that
Argentina expects the progress made in recent years to be
consolidated and the dispute to be resolved in keeping with
international law.
</P>
<P>
Argentina and Britain have long disputed over the sovereignty
of Malvinas Islands and fought a war in April 1982. The islands,
also known as the Falkland Islands among Britons, is located 550
kilometers off the east coast of Argentina in the south Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the United Nations, the two countries
decided to put aside the sovereignty dispute and cooperate in
exploring and extracting oil and natural gas in the waters around
the islands.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that Argentina hopes to form a closer
relationship with Britain under the Labor government headed by
Anthony Blair.
</P>
<P>
President Carlos Menem also sent a message to Blair,
congratulating him on his landslide victory in Thursday's
election.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Not to Tremble at U.S. Sanctions: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Neither the Myanmar State Law and
Order Restoration Council (SLORC) nor the Tatmadaw (Armed Forces)
government need tremble at a western power's sanctions or pay any
attention to them, Myanmar leader General Maung Aye has said.
</P>
<P>
The government is resolving to overcome any difficulty and
barriers with internal strength and unity, SLORC Vice-Chairman
Maung Aye was quoted by today's official paper The New Light of
Myanmar as saying at a graduation parade of the army officers at
Bahtoo Tatmyo Friday.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made in response to a recent U.S. decision to
impose economic sanctions on Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Maung Aye, who is also deputy commander-in-chief of the Myanmar
Defense Services and commander-in-chief of the Army, added that
his country is prepared to respond to any insult and attack and
defend the nation against attempts of the western bloc to dominate
it.
</P>
<P>
He stressed non-interference in others' internal affairs and
said Myanmar would also reject others' meddling in its own
affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said Myanmar has stood on its own self-reliance basis since
before the sanctions were imposed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government announced its decision on April 22 to ban
new U.S. investment in Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela to Evaluate Oil Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela will send a mission to
Central America to evaluate the use of the benefits it gives to
the region under an oil agreement, a Foreign Ministry communique
said today.
</P>
<P>
The mission, made up of the representatives of the state
enterprise Petroleos de Venezuela, the Venezuelan Investments Fund
and relevant ministries, will visit the region on May 5-9 and May
19-23.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed by Venezuela and Mexico, the two
countries supply crude oil to Central American and Caribbean
countries in favorable terms, and part of the invoice is granted
as financing to the beneficiary nations.
</P>
<P>
The mission will examine the use of the benefits, specially
those resulting from the import of crude and refined byproducts by
private companies.
</P>
<P>
It will also consider the renewal of the agreement for the
1997-1998 period.
</P>
<P>
The committee officials will hold a seminar to explain the
paces, procedures and financial modalities for development
projects and programs.

</P>
<P>
Venezuela tops Latin America in both oil reserves and oil
export. Oil is the source of the country's 95 percent foreign
exchange reserves and 70 percent of government revenue.

<HEADLINE> National Project to Help Reduce Death From Stroke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Fewer Chinese residents may die from
a stroke if a 10-year national pilot project on community-based
chronic disease control is well-functioning as planned, China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health plans to reduce by 20 percent the
average number of deaths from stroke by the year 2007 and reach a
7-8 percent drop in the average rate of smoking, said a ministry
official.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics from the Ministry of Health indicate that
each year in China, some one million people die from stroke and
1.5 million new stroke cases are registered annually.
</P>
<P>
Of the current six million patients suffering from stroke, 75
percent have lost their working ability.
</P>
<P>
Various medical expenditures and other economic loses resulting
from such cases can be as high as ten billion yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
Also, the nation has more than 300 million stroke -- including
about 34 percent of people older than age 15 who are smoking.
</P>
<P>
If immediate action is not taken, domestic and foreign experts
say, about two million Chinese people will die of smoking-related
illnesses annually by the year 2025.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health has designated 17 provinces to carry out
pilot work focusing on non-infectious illnesses including heart
and brain vascular diseases, malignant tumors, diabetes and dental
problems.
</P>
<P>
A total of two million yuan will be utilized to organize health
monitoring and various health-promotion activities in the pilot
communities.
</P>
<P>
Chronic-disease control organizations will be set up in each
pilot community. Each resident older than 15 years of age will
receive regular blood pressure checks and lectures will be offered
to help foster healthy living habits.
</P>
<P>
The program will be gradually introduced to other areas in the
country, said Li Shufen, in charge of chronic-disease control from
the Ministry of Health.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leaders on Sino-African Relationship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Top Chinese leaders have on many
occasions defined China's policy and principles on developing
friendship and cooperation with African countries during their
African tours in recent years.
</P>
<P>
On May 13, 1996, Chinese President Jiang Zemin put forward a
five-point proposal on the development of Sino-African friendship
when addressing the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in Addis
Ababa, capital of Ethiopia, during his two-week visit to Africa.
</P>
<P>
The main points of the proposal are: foster a sincere
friendship and become each other's "all-weather" friend; treat
each other as equals; respect each other's sovereignty and refrain
from interfering in each other's internal affairs; seek common
development on the basis of mutual benefit; increase consultation
and cooperation in international affairs; and look into the future
and create a more splendid world.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang said that both China and Africa suffered
tremendously in the past from colonialists and foreign aggressors,
and they have always sympathized with and supported each other in
their prolonged struggles for national independence and liberation.
</P>
<P>
Frequent exchanges of high-level visits have brought about
steady growth and fruitful results in fostering Sino-African
friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four decades, Chinese leaders visited scores of
African nations, and more than 100 African leaders visited China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China, the biggest developing country in the
world, is ready to join hands with Africa, the world's biggest
developing continent, in sharing weal and woe and marching into
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
On July 25, 1995, when addressing the representatives of the
Zimbabwean industrial and commercial sectors, Chinese Vice-Premier
Zhu Rongji outlined three propositions on further consolidating
and developing Sino-African friendship and cooperation in the new
situation.
</P>
<P>
The three propositions are: expand mutual support in creating a
global environment of peace and stability, increase friendly
consultations to help create a better international economic and
trade environment, and promote mutually beneficial cooperation for
common development and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
On July 9, 1992, then Chinese President Yang Shangkun stated
in Cote D'Ivoire that China supports African nations in their
efforts in safeguarding state sovereignty and national
independence, countering external interference and developing
economy.
</P>
<P>
China respects the right of African nations to choose their own
political systems and the road of development in light of their
specific conditions.
</P>
<P>
China supports African states in strengthening their solidarity
and cooperation, seeking strength through collective efforts and
resolving inter-state disputes through peaceful consultations.
</P>
<P>
On a wider scope, China supports the OAU in its efforts to seek
peace, stability, development and economic integration on the
African continent.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Africa's role in international affairs, Yang
reiterated China's support to the African states in their active
involvement as the equal members of the international community
and in their efforts to establish a just and rational world
political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
Yang said China is ready to develop friendly exchanges and
economic cooperation in multiple forms with the African countries
on the basis of the five principles of mutual respect for
sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression and
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and
mutual benefit and peaceful co-existence.

<HEADLINE> Quanzhou Lures More Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Quanzhou, the ancestral home of
millions of overseas Chinese in east China's Fujian Province, has
seen a sustained growth of overseas investment, hitting 7.6
billion US dollars by the end of March this year.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that the city has approved another 121
applications from overseas investors to launch new industrial
projects in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Approximately all the overseas investors are interested in
local industrial manufacturing projects, the sources say.
</P>
<P>
Since early this year, the city has made efforts to direct
overseas cash flows into high-tech industry and infrastructure
projects, and to improve the local investment environment at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the city used a record 225 million US dollars in
overseas investment in the first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The overseas investment in the 121 projects averages about 1.3
million US dollars, up one third from that in the same period of
last year.

<HEADLINE> Zhengzhou Launches River Cleaning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 3 (Xinhua) -- This capital city of Henan
Province, central China, is resolved to clean up the
heavily-polluted Jinshui River during this year and next year.
</P>
<P>
The river used to be one of the city's leading scenic
spots. However, with the drying up of its source and the rapid
development of urban construction, large quantities of sewage
water have been discharged into it without treatment.
</P>
<P>
"The public has lots of complaints about the river, which is
now black and gives off a foul smell," said an official with the
government, adding that visitors too have complaints.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years the city government has launched
several clean-up projects to improve the river water quality, and
has scored some achievements. However, no substantial changes have
been made.
</P>
<P>
The large-scale pollution control project this time includes
pollution prevention, sewage water cleaning and tree planting
along the banks, sources said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a park is expected to be built near the river,
which will cover an area of nearly 85 ha. The construction of the
park is expected to last 18 months at a cost of 150 million yuan
(18.75 million US dollars), and it is scheduled to be completed in
October 1998.

<P>
JAKARTA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and Djibouti signed here
Friday an agreement on economic and technical cooperation, it was
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesia Foreign Ministry said in a press release that the
agreement is a basic accord to enhance trade, economic and
technical cooperation. One of its specific purposes is to
encourage permanent trade relations and partnerships between
companies of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and Djibouti have yet to establish direct trade
relations while Indonesia's commodities so far enter Djibouti
through Yemen and Saudi Arabia, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
The location of Djibouti is strategic, namely, between the Red
Sea and the Indian Ocean so that Indonesia could make Djibouti a
transit point to market its products in East and North African
countries, officials of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Increase Environmental Protection Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 3 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
has vowed to increase environmental protection efforts, and plans
to take several major measures in this regard in the remainder of
this century.
</P>
<P>
The province's environmental blueprint for the rest of this
century involves bringing the total waste discharge volume below
that of 1995, halting the deterioration of the water quality of
its major rivers, keeping air quality at the level of the
early 1990s and reducing noise pollution.
</P>
<P>
In order to reach these targets leading government officials
are instructed to take the major responsibility for pollution
control, and governments above the county level are to establish
environment supervision departments.
</P>
<P>
From this year on, the provincial government will earmark an
annual sum of money for environmental protection, as will the
cities and counties.
</P>
<P>
In addition, backward production facilities that cause serious
environmental problems will be replaced with advanced ones in the
power, chemicals and light industries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, during the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) the
province is to improve the facilities of 23 major polluters and
build sewage-treatment plants with a total capacity of treating
4.15 million tons of sewage water daily.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar to Implement AFTA in 2007 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas predicted that Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar will implement
the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (AFTA) in 2007 or 2008.
</P>
<P>
"If they are admitted to the ASEAN (Association of Southeast
Asian Nations) this year, they will join the AFTA in 2007, or if
they are admitted in 1998, they will implement the AFTA in 2008,"
the minister said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
After accompanying Djibouti Foreign Minister Mahammed Noussa
Chehum in a meeting with President Soeharto, Alatas said he and
his ASEAN colleagues will convene in Kuala Lumpur on May 31 to
recommend to their respective heads of state and government the
timing of the three countries' admission to the regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN foreign ministers will take into account reports by ASEAN
Secretary General Adjit Singh and economic ministers in deciding
on the timing, sources at the presidential palace today quoted
Alatas as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN has given the three countries 10 years to adjust
their trade and investment regulations to the AFTA, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Vietnam will implement the AFTA in 2006, earlier than
the three countries because it joined the ASEAN in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The other six ASEAN countries -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia,
the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand -- will begin implementing
the AFTA in 2003.

<HEADLINE> Former World Champ Withdraws With Injuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Eighth seed Koyama Chire
of Japan, plagued by illness and injuries, withrew from the
women's singles second round at the World Table Tennis
Championships on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old Chire, who had won a world singles championship
for China before marrying a Japanese coach to immigrate to Japan,
has been complaining about chest pain and back injury, said her
father-in-law.
</P>
<P>
Early in the day, Chire told a singapore journalist that she
pulled out of the match because she didn't want to meet China's
world No. 1 Deng Yaping again.
</P>
<P>
Chire upset Deng in the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan.
The former world champion failed to clash with Deng in the Atlanta
Olympic Games last summer as she lost in straight sets to China's
world No. 2 Qiao Hong in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Chire's withdrawal cleared one of the major threats to the
Chinese women. Chinese Taipei's Chen Jing and Tong Fei-Ming, who
both made the last eight in the 1995 world championships, are also
capable of pulling off upsets.
</P>
<P>
Chire had beaten five Chinese youngsters including world No. 5
Li Ju and No. 7 Wang Chen en route to winning the Asian
championship in December last year.
</P>
<P>
No. 16 seed Andrzej Grubba of Poland is the only seeded
casualty in the men's singles event. The Polish veteran, who
turns 39 on May 14, was outlasted by 193rd-ranked Romanian Andrei
Filimon in five sets at the opening round.

MANCHESTER, England, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese teenager Wang
Liqin edged out Sweden's 1989 world champion and No. 14 seed
Jorgen Persson at the men's singles second round of the World
Table Tennis Championships here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Wang, who has beaten the reigning world
champion Kong Linghui several times in China's domestic
competitions despite enjoying little international fame, outlasted
Persson in five sets.
</P>
<P>
The 63rd-ranked Chinese, who had edged out Belgian
Jean-Philippe Saive in five sets early in the day, played an
all-around game with a lethal forehand attack, taking the first
two games 21-19, 21-14.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Swede used his experience and strong backhand
shots to pull two-all, winning the ensuing two sets 21-12, 22-20.
</P>
<P>
There were many spectacular topspin exchanges in the fifth set
until Wang took a 16-14 lead. Persson, jaded and nervous, lost
five points in a row to concede the match point.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who began to play table tennis at the age of six,
finished runner-up in the 1996 Chinese national championships and
combined with Yan Sen to win the men's doubles event at the
Pro-Tour Finals in December last year.

<HEADLINE> Double Olympic Champ Toppled in Table Tennis Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese jubiliation over
their sweep of the team titles was cut short on Friday as men's
double Olympic champion Liu Guoliang and their second best women
player Yang Ying both bowed out of the singles fray at the World
Table Tennis Championships.
</P>
<P>
The world third-ranked Liu, singles runner-up in the last
Worlds and singles-doubles winner in the Atlanta Olympics, fell
apart under the barrages of Yugoslavian Aleksandar Karakasevic in
the second round, losing in five sets.
</P>
<P>
Yang Ying, ranked fourth in the world, made an early exit as
she lost her second round game to Frenchwoman Anne Boileau.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese stars' losses came before their champagne went
flat. Chinese coaches and players had celebrated their final team
victories late into Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Karakasevic, 21, outlasted Liu 17-21, 21-16, 21-10, 18-21,
21-13, stunning a large army of Chinese fans who flew to
Manchester to cheer for their heroes.
</P>
<P>
With each taking two sets, Karakasevic shot to a 9-1 lead with
ferocious forehand attacks as Liu failed to reach his dizzying
height and often misjudged the timing of stroke.
</P>
<P>
The 109th-ranked Yugoslavian built on this cushion and pulled
further clear until he forced Liu into a wayward shot to pull off
the biggest upset of the championships.
</P>
<P>
"Liu was very tired after the team final and he didn't reach
his form in the game," said Chinese coach Yin Xiao.
</P>
<P>
"While trailing 1-9 in the deciding set, Liu's usually tough
nerves cracked under pressure," Yin added.
</P>
<P>
Handshaking Karakasevic plays in a style different from his
father Milivoj, former member of the Yugoslavian national team who
plays in the penhold grip.
</P>
<P>
German Jorg Rosskopf, ranked ninth in the world, was eliminated
by Thomas von Scheele of Sweden in five sets.
</P>
<P>
Yoo Nam Kyu of South Korea, Andrezej Grubba of Poland and
Jorgen Persson of Sweden were the other seeds toppled on Friday.
</P>
<P>
China's world No. 1 and defending champion Kong Linghui, 1992
Olympic champion Jan-Ove Waldner of Sweden and No. 4 Vladimir
Samsonov of Belarus, No. 5 Kim Taek Soo of South Korea and No. 6
Wang Tao of China all sailed into the third round.
</P>
<P>
Yang Ying was the top-seeded casualty in the women's
competition on Friday, losing to Boileau 17-21, 21-11, 21-17,
11-21, 18-21.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Lu Yuansheng was expelled from the courtside
by umpire as he shouted advice to Zhang Hui during her game
against world No. 3 Chen Jing of Chinese Taipei. Zhang lost in
five sets.
</P>
<P>
China's world No. 1 Deng Yaping, No. 5 Li Ju, No. 7 Wang Chen,
No. 9 Wang Nan all moved up into the third round.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Koyama Chire, rated eighth in the world ranking,
withdrew from the second round because of back injury.

the "open skies" agreement will reinforce the dominance of his
country's commercial airlines in Central America.
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- Brazilian gross domestic product (GDP) will reach
in June this year an accumulated growth of 4.9 percent in 12
months, announced the Applied Economic Research Institute
(IIEA).
</P>

ROME, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Italy will field an official challenge
for the 2000 America's Cup, the blue riband international yachting
event, local sponsors confirmed in Santa Margherita Ligure on
Friday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (59-60) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (59-60) in a
question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Will Hong Kong be able to maintain its status as an
international financial center after 1997?
</P>
<P>
Answer: The Basic Law gives a clear-cut answer on this
question. The Hong Kong SAR should provide appropriate economic
and legal environments for maintaining Hong Kong's status as an
international financial center, it says.
</P>
<P>
In terms of economic environment after 1997, Hong Kong will
continue to be a free port, and will have a system of free trade
and low taxation.
</P>
<P>
Appropriate policies will be adopted to promote and coordinate
the development of the region's manufacturing, commercial,
tourist, real estate, transportation, public utilities and
service sectors.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the mainland's healthy, rapid and sustained
economic development will serve as a great impetus for the
long-term prosperity of Hong Kong's financial sector.
</P>
<P>
In terms of legal environment, the Basic Law clearly stipulates
that the Hong Kong SAR government may independently formulate its
monetary and financial policies, and safeguard the free operation
of financial institutions and financial markets while exercising
administration and supervision over them in accordance with law.
</P>
<P>
Also according to the Basic Law: the Hong Kong SAR will not
have foreign exchange controls, the Hong Kong dollar will be
freely convertible, Hong Kong will continue to have open market
for the trading of foreign exchange, gold, securities and futures,
and the Hong Kong SAR government will safeguard the free flow of
capital within, into and out of the region.
</P>
<P>
These provide a legal guarantee for maintaining the status of
Hong Kong as an international financial center.
</P>
<P>
Question: How will Hong Kong maintain its status in the GATT
after 1997?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Hong Kong joined the GATT as a British dependency in
1947 and has since been a GATT member and a separate customs
territory. If China resumes its GATT membership, Hong Kong's
status in the GATT after 1997 will be a non-issue.
</P>
<P>
As a safety measure for Hong Kong, Article 116 of the Basic Law
explicitly stipulates that the Hong Kong SAR may, using the name
"Hong Kong, China," participate in relevant international
organizations and international trade agreements, including
preferential trade agreements, such as the GATT and arrangements
for international trade in textiles.
</P>
<P>
Valid export quotas, tariff preferences and other similar
arrangements previously obtained by Hong Kong and those to be
obtained by the Hong Kong SAR will be enjoyed exclusively by the
region.
</P>
<P>
What is more, the Basic Law provides that Hong Kong may
continue to implement international agreements to which China is
not yet a party but which are now applicable to Hong Kong. This
provision certainly goes beyond the GATT.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group has reached
an agreement on Hong Kong remaining in the GATT and the WTO as
separate member.
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that Hong Kong's position in international trade
after 1997 has been fully guaranteed.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves Financing for Reform Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today announced
the approval of 12 million U.S. dollar equivalent credits to help
boost the reform program in Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
The financing, which will be channeled through the
International Development Association (IDA), the concessionary
lending arm of the bank, includes a 10 million dollar credit in
standard IDA terms for the Mongolia Banking and Enterprise Sector
Adjustment Credit (BESAC) and another credit equivalent to 2
million dollars on standard IDA terms for the Legal Technical
Assistance Credit (BELTAC).
</P>
<P>
These credits will work together to implement a much-needed
reform program of Mongolia's financial, legal and enterprise
sector to facilitate economic growth and promote private
enterprise development.
</P>
<P>
The credit for the BESAC project will be utilized to support
the bank restructuring program already underway, under the
guidance of the government, the International Monetary Fund, the
Asian Development Bank and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The credit for the BELTAC will support the implementation of
the BESAC project by building institutional capacity in Mongolia's
financial and legal sectors to carry out debt workout and loan
recovery programs and assist the government in its commercial bank
capacity strengthening efforts.

NEW YORK, May 2 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks rallied into the
close of a powerful week today, with the Dow Jones industrial
average gaining 94.72, or 1.4 percent, to 7,071.20.
</P>
<P>
For the week, the Dow rose 332.33 points, or nearly 5 percent.
Now it has pulled itself within 15 points of an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
Advancers outnumbered decliners by more than a 4-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 499.73 million
shares as against 459.35 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Other leading stock measures posted big gains too, with Nasdaq
making its biggest gain ever.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 14.44 to 812.97, and
the NYSE composite index rose 7.26 to 422.97.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 34.83 to 1,305.33, pulling back
into positive territory for the year and back above 1,300 for the
first time since mid-March.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 list of smaller companies rose 8.32, or 2.4
percent, to 353.98. The American Stock Exchange composite index
rose 10.00 to 568.50.
</P>
<P>
Investors believed job creation remained modest while wages
edged lower, although the Labor Department reported that employers
hired 142,000 new workers in April.
</P>
<P>
The report also revealed a big drop in the nation's
unemployment rate to 4.9 percent in April, the lowest level since
late 1973.
</P>
<P>
In late March, the Federal Reserve moved to slow the economy by
raising one of its key lending rates. The Fed is widely expected
to raise rates again in May, but investors are hoping it will be
the last tightening move for a while.

LUANDA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila
said here today he will make a temporary stay in Luanda, instead
of going on board the South African Navy ship off the coast of
Congo to meet with ailing Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko.

Kabila, who arrived at Angola's capital earlier today, said he

Only after receiving a formal invitation and getting the

go to the ship to hold face-to-face talks with Mobutu,
said Kabila.

Bill Clinton announced the news in Baltimore and the Republican
leaders made the announcement in the U.S. Capitol.
</P>
<P>
Calling the agreement "in broad but fairly specific terms,"
President Clinton said it would protect America's "investment in
education and science and technology and medical research."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Republican leaders also described it as "a tremendous step
forward for all Americans."
</P>
<P>
The balanced-budget plan envisioned a steady decline of U.S.
federal deficits over the next five years, culminating in a
balanced budget in 2002. Tax cuts would be targeted to families
with children, investors and students of higher education. Estate
tax relief is also envisioned.
</P>
<P>
A provision to extend health care coverage to an estimated 5
million uninsured children -- a key part of Clinton's second term
agenda -- also is part of the plan.
</P>
<P>
Among the major elements of the agreement are five-year
Medicare savings which would total 115 billion dollars and tax
cuts totaling 135 billion dollars which would be partly offset by
roughly 50 billion dollars in other tax increases.
</P>
<P>
Sources to the discussion said earlier that negotiators had
been told they had an unexpected 200 billion dollars or more
available over the next five years. The money could be used for
domestic programs, tax cuts, deficit reduction or retirement of
the nation's enormous debt, leading to an early compromise between
the two sides on the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement marked a startling turnabout from the past two
years, when President Clinton and the Republican majorities of the
House and Senate battled constantly over taxes and spending
priorities.
</P>
<P>
Two government shutdowns in the late 1995 and early 1996
resulted from the struggle between the Democratic government and
the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
The agreement marked the end of one process and the start of
another, as lawmakers begin drafting the legislation to carry out
its provisions.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Up, London Ends at New Peak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- All the major stock markets in Europe
ended the week's trading comfortably higher today, with London
surging to a new record close, inspired by a bullish Wall Street
in the wake of new US economic data.
</P>
<P>
British shares on the London market broke into record territory
as the market took the Labor Party's landslide victory in the
general election in its stride.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index hit a fresh closing high of 4,455.60, up
10.6 points on Thursday and 85.9 points higher on last Friday,
helped by a strong upturn on Wall Street behind the US jobs
figures in April which were much lower than expected.
</P>
<P>
However, trade was thin ahead of the bank holiday weekend and a
possible monetary meeting next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Share prices in both Frankfurt and Paris also closed higher
although, as in London, trading was dull and thin as all the two
markets were closed Thursday for the May Day holiday and many
traders were still away from the markets today.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt's DAX-30 index edged up to a higher close after
spending most of the session rangebound, up 22.30 points at
3,460.37, a rise of 86.27 on last week.
</P>
<P>
Dealers expected the near-term trend to stay positive given the
strong dollar.
</P>
<P>
Paris' CAC-40 index closed 15.84 points up at 2,655.31, rising
119.05 points from seven days ago.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Try to Attract Foreign Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- African countries today were
urged to take concrete steps to continuously strengthen their
international competitiveness and attract more foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The call was contained in a report adopted tonight at the end
of the 18th meeting of the Technical Preparatory Committee of the
Whole.
</P>
<P>
For promoting trade and investment to accelerate Africa's
development, the report noted that African countries have
experienced great difficulty in attracting adequate levels of
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign direct investment to all African countries amounted
about three billion U.S. Dollars annually, which was less than
3.5 percent of such flows to the developing world," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
"Raising domestic savings and attracting substantial flows of
foreign direct investment were two challenges which had to be met
in order to sustain a high investment rate," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said Africa's economy in 1996 witnessed vigorous
recovery with a regional gross domestic product growth rate
averaging four percent as compared to 2.7 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report said "there were many indications that the trend
would continue in 1997 for which preliminary estimates set the
growth rate at 4.2 percent. this was largely based on the good
performance of the agricultural and mining sectors."
</P>
<P>
The report said main problems affecting Africa's development
are instability and the high dependence of African countries
on the exports of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
"It was suggested that in order to attract investors into the
region, African countries should collaborate on efforts aimed at
peace-keeping and stability as necessary conditions for
development," it stressed.
</P>
<P>
The report expressed satisfaction with the positive effects of
the reforms undertaken in many African countries, adding that
those reforms have placed particular emphasis on sectoral
policies to attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting has prepared a draft declaration on
accelerating trade and investment in Africa and five resolutions
for the forthcoming four-day meeting of African economic
ministers which will open here next Monday. enditem
