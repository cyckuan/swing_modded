<HEADLINE> Iran Confiscates 2,600 Rifles in Border Provinces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran's law enforcement troops
confiscated some 2,600 unregistered assault rifles and some other
kinds of light weapons in the past year in Khuzestan and
Kermanshah provinces, both bordering on Iraq, an official report
said today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that armed policemen
so far have arrested 1,612 persons in the two provinces on charges
of possessing unregistered weapons and handed them over to the
judiciary since the beginning of the current Iranian year starting
from March 21, 1995, the report added.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to tighten security before the crucial parliamentary
elections, Iran issued an order last month to all citizens to
surrender their unregistered weapons and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
The 1989-1988 Iran-Iraq war brought about the proliferation of
arms smuggling in Iran. Arms are both smuggled in and out of Iran
through Iran's border with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Light weapons produced by Iran's defense industries are said to
be smuggled outside of the country because of corruption and poor
management in government bureaucracies.

<HEADLINE> Wanted Qassam Activists Ask for Amnesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The "wanted" Izzidine al-Qassam
Units members today issued a statement expressing their desire to
give up violence and turn to political struggle, according to a
report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The statement carried in a leaflet said that they have decided
to "stop all military activity, beginning with the date of this
leaflet, within and outside the Gaza Strip, and begin a new phase
of political resistance in order to realize the goals of our
people, and to use positive resistance methods in order to
participate in the building of this nation."
</P>
<P>
"Our military wing and wanted members will license all the
weapons they need for self defense, and hand in what is left over
to the Palestinian National Authority," they said.
</P>
<P>
"We will hand over explosives and explosive-manufacturing
machinery to the Palestinian National Authority leadership, so
that they may be destroyed or stored, as best benefit national
interest."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the wanted members will gradually
begin returning to normal life, and will respect the laws of the
only authority in the West bank and Gaza Strip, the National
Authority.
</P>
<P>
"We call upon the government of Israel to positively respond to
this stand of ours, and not repeat the crime it committed by
assassinating the Engineer Yahya Ayyash, because we are serious in
our decision, and in our desire to stop bloodshed," the statement
concluded.
</P>
<P>
Izzidine al-Qassam is the armed wing of Hamas, the Palestinian
Islamic Resistance Movement. The movement has claimed
responsibility for several recent suicide bombing attacks on
Israelis.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho King: African Countries Being Marginalised In Global Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 6 (Xinhua)-- African countries were
being increasingly marginalised in the global economy, Lesotho's
King Letsie iii said today, the South African Press Association
has reported.
</P>
<P>
Opening the 27th Regional Conference of the Commonwealth
Parliamentary Association (CPA) in Maseru, capital of Lesotho,
the king said this was evident in the decline of investment
capital and aid to Africa, and in the loss of export earnings and
the diminishing access of African exports to world markets.
</P>
<P>
"This process of marginalisation, coupled with a high degree
of economic mismanagement in our various countries, has
contributed to deepening poverty among many of our people," said
the king.
</P>
<P>
Letsie iii said the CPA should be vocal in calling for more
equitable international trade relations and for support of
sustainable development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the CPA should not just promote parliamentary
democracy but should also encourage economic democracy, which
focused on the alleviation of poverty and improving the material
well-being of africa's people.
</P>
<P>
Democracy also involved good governance, transparency,
accountability, and the provision of services for the welfare of
all and not only for the benefit of elites in positions of power
and trust, added the king.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho is a small land-locked country surrounded by South
Africa. enditem

<HEADLINE> Zambian Farming Experts Urged to Assist Peasants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Agriculture, Food and
Fisheries Suresh Desai today urged agricultural experts in Zambia
to assist peasant farmers in order to increase crop production.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a field-day ceremony at Golden Valley Agricultural
Research Trust (GART) near Lusaka, Desai said, "we have a lot of
agricultural experts heaped at the ministry headquarters and
their knowledge on agriculture is not reaching peasant farmers."
</P>
<P>
Desai said his ministry is being restructured and the exercise
would benefit small scale farmers because some experts in the
ministry would be posted to districts to assist them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he hailed GART for its efforts in research work on
crops production, saying such knowledge would be used as a link
between researchers and the farming community.
</P>
<P>
Varieties of fine seeds and agricultural products were
displayed at the field day.

<HEADLINE> Mandela To Be Released From Clinic Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 6 (Xinhua)-- South African President
Nelson Mandela would be released from Park Lane Clinic on
Thursday, a day earlier than expected, after comprehensive
medical tests found him to be healthy, the hospital said here
tonight.
</P>
<P>
"President Mandela has been fully assessed and found to be
extremely well," said a statement from the clinic.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's heart condition was satisfactory, his lungs were in
excellent condition and there was no evidence of prostrate cancer
or coronary artery disease, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It added that all the tests had been completed, but it would
take another three days to analyse the results before they were
released, with Mandela's permission, to the public.
</P>
<P>
Mandela checked himself into the private clinic yesterday for
the most intensive medical check-up of his life, seen as a bid to
end widespreading speculations about his health.
</P>
<P>
Clinic spokesman Timothy Groom said the president finished
today's tests early and spent this afternoon working and signing
copies of his autobiography in hospital.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's doctor, lung expert Dr. Michael Plit, said earlier
today that the president was in excellent condition.
</P>
<P>
"All this hype about him being unwell and having had a heart
attack is absulutely incorrect," said Plit.
</P>
<P>
Recent rumors about Mandela's health circulating around the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange had sent the local currency rand to
record lows on financial markets. enditem

<HEADLINE> ILO: Migrant Workers Vulnerable to Exploitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Competition for job is making pay down
and working conditions deteriorated for the growing number of migrant
construction workers in parts of Asia and the Middle East, despite a
continuing lack of labour in the category there, the International
Labour Office (ILO) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Illegal migrants risk exploitation, moreover, "there has developed,
even for legal migrants, a 'buyer market' for labour, with attendant
downward pressure on wages and conditions of work", said the ILO in a
report issued during a meeting involving government, employers and
trade union representatives from over 30 countries here.
</P>
<P>
In addition, protective measures offered by the governments of
labour-sending countries are in many cases ineffective, and receiving
countries often fail to find means to enforce their own labour laws
concerning migrants.
</P>
<P>
This problem and other related issues are being examined at the
March 4-8 meeting at the ILO headquarters, which will also discuss
ways of further promoting industrial relations and the application of
international labour standards in the construction sector.
</P>
<P>
Migrant workers are paid generally lower than local workers. In the
Middle-East, a steady decline in wages for migrants has resulted from
rising competition on the labour market, with migrants from the South
Asian countries of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh today joining a large
number of Filipinos and Thais already there.
</P>
<P>
In Bahrain, available data showed wages for construction workers
fell by as much as one third between 1986 and 1989.
</P>
<P>
It has also become apparent that wages vary considerably to
generally reflect the level of wages and standard of living in the
home country of migrant workers, said the ILO report.
</P>
<P>
A survey of wages paid by Korean construction firms in the
Middle-East in 1992 revealed, for example, that "Malaysians earn the
most at 536 U.S. dollars per month, followed by Filipinos and Thais.
At the bottom of the scale are Sri Lankans, at 37.6 dollars per
month."
</P>
<P>
"Very low wages are also paid to Nepalese and Indonesian workers."
</P>
<P>
Compared to the Middle-East, wages in East Asia are much higher.
"The average monthly salary of a Bangladesh construction worker in
Japan is seven times that of a similar worker in the Middle-East."
</P>
<P>
"However", said the report, "wages and benefits are generally well
below those paid to local workers,..." and "the failure of many
countries to recognize their dependence on foreign workers" has led
many migrants to work illegally and fall victim to abuse.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, safety standards are reported to be ignored for illegal
workers, and wages lower than the legal minimum. "Health care", the
report continues, "is another pressing issue. Many migrant workers
could not afford health insurance even if they applied for it."
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, where immigrants from mainland China form a high
proportion of the construction labour, a notable problem "is that its
safety record is poor by international standards."
</P>
<P>
The figure for reportable accidents is "twice that of the United
States, and 25 times worse than in Japan and Singapore."
</P>
<P>
A 1993 survey showed 20 percent of Chinese workers in South Korea
had been injured at work and 76 percent paid medical costs by
themselves.
</P>
<P>
In the report, ILO called for strengthened labour inspection to
help protect migrant workers. The extent to which labour inspection
services "could be used as an instrument for protecting the rights of
migrant construction workers, and the obstacles to be overcome to
achieve that goal, is a subject that deserves greater attention", it
added.
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that "legal action is not an option for
migrants who are working illegally." No solution to their plight is
possible as long as governments remain "reluctant to openly
recognize the need for migrant workers, even when labour shortages
are apparent."

<HEADLINE> GCC Economic Seminar Ends in Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A two-day seminar with the
theme of "GCC economies face regional and international economic
coalitions" ended today in Damman, Saudi Arabia, with a call upon
Gulf states to boost cooperation with multi-national companies to
benefit from their expertise.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kuwait News Agency, a final statement of the
seminar called for devising a comprehensive study of the
activities of these international corporations so as to work out a
strategy that conforms to the nature of production processes in
the GCC states.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and
the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The participants, according to the statement, anticipated
increasing competition because of the application of global trade
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was organized by the Union of Chambers of Commerce
of Gulf States in coordination with the chambers of commerce and
industry of the eastern region.
</P>
<P>
The attendants called on Gulf states to review laws concerning
foreign investments, speed up efforts to establish a common Gulf
market and act jointly to overcome obstacles hampering the growth
of GCC exports.
</P>
<P>
The seminar called for establishing a special organ to gather
data and study markets abroad and propose plans to boost exports,
integrating Gulf Banks with investment companies and linking GCC
bourses.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the executive chairman of the Omani Central Bank,
Hmoud Bin Sanjour, called on GCC Banks to expand their activities
to include investments, but cautioned that monitoring bodies
should be formed to avoid risky investments.
</P>
<P>
Sanjour indicated that new regulations should be devised to
expand the banking activities.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that the GCC banks would face an unbalanced
competition with international banks as a result of the
liberalization of international banking.

<HEADLINE> No Hamas Office in Jordan, Crown Prince Hassan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Crown Prince Hassan, the Regent,
said here today that the Islamic Movement Hamas has no office in
the kingdom, the official Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with a visiting Canadian delegation here
today, the Crown Prince expressed surprise over reports quoting
sources in the Palestinian authority that the military group has
some presence in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Jordan did not need to reiterate its firm stands denouncing
terrorism in all its forms, identity or motives, said Crown Prince
Hassan.
</P>
<P>
Denying that Hamas has any office in Jordan, he said the
kingdom had in 1991 uncovered a Hamas faction along with weapons,
adding that the group was sent to court according to the Jordanian
law which applies to all.
</P>
<P>
The Crown Prince recalled that the Jordanian authorities has
barred from its territory members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad
groups who were expelled by Israel to south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He assured that the Hamas has no official office in the
kingdom, noting that its presence was restricted to holders of
Jordanian passports whose activities were confined only to
information and politics.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's long-standing policy was against those who target at
innocent people under any pretexts, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the kingdom would contribute to any effort
aimed at containing terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether there has been a secret deal between Hamas and
the Palestine National Authority (PNA) during the January
Palestinian elections during which the military group halted its
military activities, the Crown Prince said Jordan only knew there
had been meetings between the two leaderships in Khartoum, Cairo
and Gaza to find common ground.
</P>
<P>
He also said Jordan has recognized the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO), noting that its policy is not to interfere in
the internal Palestinian affairs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Minister Awad Khleifat reiterated Jordan's
condemnation of violence, terrorism and extremism, saying that
the kingdom has no connection with a spate of bombings in Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said Hamas has no office in Jordan and categorically
rejected accusations that Jordan harbored or provided sanctuary to
any group affiliated to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saad Hail El-Sorour, speaker of the Lower House of
Parliament, also said that Jordan has long been a victim of
terrorism and would not be a sanctuary for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
He said the kingdom would back any efforts to counter
terrorism regardless of its origin or motives.

<HEADLINE> Iran Blasts World's "Pro-Israeli" Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei
today condemned world's "pro-Israeli" media for continued
hostility against Iran over the accusation of bombing involvement
in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said at a graduation ceremony of army academics that
Iran becomes the target of terrorism because it is a shining
nation among the Moslem countries.
</P>
<P>
He also called on all the people in the country to turn out and
vote in the fifth parliament elections slated for March 8 as a
nationwide counter measure against the American pressures.
</P>
<P>
Amid wide accusation of Iranian support to terrorism, the
Tehran government felt very nervous and tries to fight back in
different aspects.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry today rejected U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher's accusations on Iran's involvement in bombing
attacks in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammad, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, denied
"uncalculated" statements and accusations by Christopher in
relation to recent incidents in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said American and Israeli officials made
"uncalculated accusations" against Iran in a hasty manner without
any evidence.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also reacted angrily on allegations by French
Prime Minister Alain Juppe on the issue of bombing and summoned
French Ambassador Jean Pierre Masset to give explanation over the
remarks of Juppe at the country's National Assembly in relation
with Iran on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Iranian ambassador to Bonn Hussein Mousavian today termed as
"irresponsible and unacceptable" the statements by Karl Heinz
Hornhues, Chairman of German parliament's Foreign Affairs
Committee, alleging that Iran was supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Hornhues, Mousavian rejected claims by the
Western media on Hamas having military training bases in Iran.
</P>
<P>
However Iranian papers have voiced support for Palestinian
group Hamas.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Abrar published an editorial today saying
 that "Palestinian youth had decided that if they were going to be
killed by Israelis, it would be better that they themselves chose
the manner of their own death."
</P>
<P>
Another Persian daily Jomhuri Eslami in a commentary today
said that the success or failure of the peace process depended not
on the U.S. mediation but only on "the ceaseless struggle of the
unknown selfless Palestinians ready to sacrifice themselves."
</P>
<P>
It advised the Israeli officials to accept the fact that "they
cannot fight a nation (Palestinians) that has turned its whole
existence into a battlefield."

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
finished today's medical tests at Johannesburg's Park Lane Clinic
early and has been back at work, his doctor said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We are finished with him today," said Dr. Micheal Plit,
Mandela's specialist physician for the past four years. "A short
while ago I saw him very busy with some legal documents."
</P>
<P>
Plit said Mandela was in excellent condition. "All this hype
about him being unwell and having had a heart attack is
absolutely incorrect."
</P>
<P>
Mandela is expected to be released from the Park Lane Clinic
on Friday with a clean bill of health.
</P>
<P>
Doctors today are awaiting the results of "an enormous amount
of investigations" but could report that earlier x-rays and heart
tests have had positive results.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Mandela had physiotherapy on his chest and
underwent a "small procedure" under sterile conditions in an
operating theater.
</P>
<P>
Hospital spokesman Timothy Groom said: "the results that have
come back so far are fine, we really do expect a clean bill of
health."
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela's medical check-up has not been discussed at
today's cabinet meeting in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
the 77-year-old president was admitted to Park Lane Clinic
Tuesday to undergo his most comprehensive medical check-up to
date aimed at ending speculation about his ill-health.

<HEADLINE> CBI: Britain's Remaining Outside EMU May Hit UK Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- British business leaders gave
warning Tuesday that longer-term interest rates could be higher if
Britain remained outside the European economic and monetary union
(EMU).
</P>
<P>
Adair Turner, director-general of the Confederation of British
Industry (CBI), said that financial markets might demand an
interest rate premium as insurance against the risk of currency
devaluation and higher inflation if the UK decided not to join the
EMU.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a fact that if we stay outside of the single
currency it's highly likely that we would have somewhat higher
long-term interest rates for quite a period of time," he told a
House of Lords committee.
</P>
<P>
Turner said Britain could become a less attractive location for
investment if companies believed non-participation in the single
currency would result in its partial exclusion from the European
Union's single market.
</P>
<P>
Investors might also be deterred by fears of Britain returning
to the "boom and bust" economic cycle of the past if it did not
submit to the disciplines which monetary union would entail, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Under the Maastricht Treaty, the EU plans to start a single
currency from 1999. Member states which meet specified targets on
budget deficits, government debt, interest rates and foreign
exchange rates will be eligible to take part.
</P>
<P>
But Britain's Conservative government, under pressure from a
strong Euro-sceptic faction among its own members of parliament,
reserved the right to stay out.

<HEADLINE> New Device Combats Blindness Caused by AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 6 (Xinhua) -- An American pharmaceutical
company said that it will soon begin to market a device that can
be implanted in the eyes of AIDS patients to help them fight
blindness.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported today that the Chiron Corporation,
the producer of the device, had received approval from the Food
and Drug Administration to begin selling the product.
</P>
<P>
Sytomegalovirus retinitis, a kind of infection of the retina,
is seen among about 40 percent of AIDS patients. It can lead to
blindness, according to doctors. The current therapy, which
consists of intravenous infusion of ganciclovir three or more
times a week, was costly and unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
The new device, called Vitrasert, is to be used together with
the antiviral drug ganciclovir. By delivering the drug directly to
the eye, Vitrasert should avoid some side effects associated with
the systematic use of ganciclovir, according to doctors.
</P>
<P>
The company said its trial of 188 AIDS patients with newly
diagnosed retina infection demonstrated the progression of the
disease was significantly delayed for those who received
Vitrasert, compared with those on intravenous ganciclovir.
</P>
<P>
The implant is inserted in the outer portion of the eye in an
outpatient procedure taking an hour or less. When the drug is
depleted, after five to eight months, the implant can be removed
and replaced, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Because cytomegalovirus retinitis can spread to the other eye
or to other parts of the body, most patients who receive Vitrasert
will probably also take oral ganciclovir, according to experts.

<HEADLINE> British Tourist Industry Hits Record in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A weak pound and the Northern
Ireland ceasefire helped the British tourist industry secure a
record year in 1995, with total numbers of overseas tourists
rising 12 percent to 23.5 million, official figures show today.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Central Statistical Office show that visitor
spending in the UK in 1995 rose by about 18 percent to 11.8
billion pounds (18 billion US dollars) from 10 billion pounds
(15.2 billion US dollars) in 1994.
</P>
<P>
But the tourist industry remains cautious about the outlook,
pointing out that the competitive pound has been an important
factor in the recent good performance.
</P>
<P>
The ending of the IRA ceasefire and recent London bombing could
hit tourist numbers this summer.
</P>
<P>
Many in the tourist industry also remain concerned that Britain
is failing to increase its market share of world tourism, and they
believe more government spending on overseas promotion is vital.
</P>
<P>
Ms Adele Biss, who chairs the British Tourist Authority, said
the industry needed to work hard to tap into expanding markets,
particularly the Far East.
</P>
<P>
Biss believes that increased spending on tourism promotion can
yield great benefits for the British economy and help the industry
regain its market share, which slipped from 6.7 percent of world
tourism to 4.3 percent between 1985 and 1993.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity in 1995 Up by 1.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. productivity was up by 1.1
percent last year, the best showing since 1992, U.S. Labour
Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said that the 1995 increase in
productivity, which measures output per hour of work, was higher
than the 0.5 percent advance in 1994 and a 0.2 percent gain in
1993. But it was much lower than a 3.2 percent increase in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. productivity also slowed sharply in the last quarter
of 1995 when it fell by 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Productivity is seen as the key measurement of how fast living
standards can rise. Higher productivity means that workers can be
paid with higher salaries because they are more efficient and
turning out more products for the same amount of work.
</P>
<P>
For the year as a whole, the 1.1 percent increase reflected a
2.7 percent gain in output, which outpaced the 1.6 percent rise in
the number of hours worked.
</P>
<P>
Unit labor costs, considered a key factor in inflation, rose
2.5 percent in 1995, up from a 1.6 percent increase in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested for Involvement in Tel Aviv Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 6 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli Arab has been
arrested on suspicion of having smuggling the suicide bomber
of Monday's Tel Aviv bombing attack, which killed at least
13 people and wounded more than 100 others, Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The man, whose name cannot be revealed under a court
order, has appeared in a district court in Israel's northern
city of Tiberias today on charges of aiding terrorist
organization.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, he was arrested Monday, just
hours after bringing the suicide bomber in a truck from the
Gaza Strip to the Dizengoff center in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The man, in his 40s, lives in an Arab village in the north of
Israel and makes his living from working for a truck company. He
made regular trips to the Gaza crossing point to pick up goods for
factories in Israel.
</P>
<P>
He is reported to be a member of the Islamic movement in
Israel, but not an extremist.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he made contacts with the Islamic Jihad
activists from the Gaza Strip and agreed to pick up a man
at the crossing point and bring him into Israel in a box
in the back seat of his truck.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear for the moment how the man passed through all
the Palestinian and Israeli checkpoints beside the crossing point
where goods were permitted to transport from Gaza, despite the
general closure on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The suspected man told his investigators that he had been
paid 1,100 U.S. dollars to transport the man to Tel Aviv,
but added that he did not know the man was a suicide
bomber.
</P>
<P>
He drove the man to Tel Aviv and dropped him off near
the Dizengoff center at 4:00 p.m. local time (1400GMT)
Monday, and a few minutes after he drove off, the bomber
detonated his explosives.
</P>
<P>
Police are looking further into the case.

LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- David irimble, leader of the Ulster
Unionist Party (UUP) which defends British rule over Northern
Ireland, said today that he hoped to have talks with Irish Prime
Minister John Bruton in the coming week.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC TV, Dublin has given a positive
response to his suggestion of a meeting with Bruton.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Dublin's reply as saying: "We're anxious to see if we
can arrange a meeting" before Bruton leaves for the US next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The UUP and the smaller Democratic Unionist Party did not
attend the first session of the current consulations on elections
in Ulster among the political parties in the province presided
over by Britain's Ulster Secretary Patrick Mayhew and Irish
Foreign Minister Dick Spring.
</P>
<P>
The two unionist parties argued that Spring's presence at the
consultations in Stormont, Belfast, is interfering the "internal
affairs" of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
They would rather meet representatives of the Irish government
either in London or in Dublin.

<HEADLINE> EC Economic Report Estimates Gradual Growth in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, March 6 (Xinhua) -- European Commission's 1996 Annual
Economic Report published today estimated that there would be a
"gradual acceleration of growth" of the European Union(EU) economy
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, world trade was still "buoyant",
average annual growth of more than nine percent is forecast for
the 1994-1996 period.
</P>
<P>
As regards exports, the report noted, the EU had so far managed
to maintain its position on the world market and that the capacity
of the central and eastern European Countries to absorb imports
seemed to be increasing.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate in the EU has never been as low: 3.1 percent
in 1995 for the EU as a whole and the rate is around two percent
in most EU member states.
</P>
<P>
The financial situation of EU firms is "broadly favorable"
despite sectoral difficulties which were amplified by currency
fluctuations in some cases in the spring of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Long-term interest rates have fallen markedly, thereby
facilitating a less restrictive monetary policy. In addition,
exchange-rate distortions have been partially corrected.
</P>
<P>
Under these conditions, the report pointed out, there were
"real reason" for hoping for an improvement.
</P>
<P>
Even though it might be some time before the improvement in the
economic situation was reflected in the figures, it said, initial
positive signs were already emerging.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated that the economic growth in the EU as a
whole would be below two percent in 1996, compared with an earlier
forecast figure of 2.6 percent.

LUSAKA, March 6 (Xinhua)-- The Zambian government would not
take any action against civil servants and public workers who
went on strike last week, Labour and Social Security Minister
Newstead Zimba said today.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing at State House here, Zimba said the

misinterpretation of the industrial relations court ruling
regarding the 45 percent pay increment awarded to them.

Zimbia praised leaders of the two public service unions for
urging their members to return to work and public service workers
for responding to their leaders' appeal and ending the
nation-wide strike.
</P>
<P>
He also called for open communication between workers and
employers in the country to avoid further strikes.
</P>
<P>
Zambian civil servants and public service workers ended their
week-long strike on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Geneva Conference Endorses Swift Return of Vietnamese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- An international conference Chaired
by the UN refugee agency UNHCR today endorsed plans to speed up
the repatriation of 39,000 Vietnamese migrants scattered in
Southeast Asian countries and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
After two days of meetings in Geneva, the International
Conference on Indo-Chinese Refugees Wednesday declared that a
Comprehensive Plan of Action it adopted seven years ago to resolve
the Vietnamese boatpeople issues would formally end on June 30,
1996.
</P>
<P>
The decision to end the Plan of Action means that the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will phase out its assistance to
the Southeast Asian camps for the Vietnamese asylum-seekers as of
July 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The only viable option for Vietnamese who have been rejected
the refugee status is return to Vietnam", a final statement issue
by the Conference said.
</P>
<P>
However, in Hong Kong, which shelters more than half of the
boatpeople, the UNHCR will maintain alternative arrangements "with
the aim of completely solving the Vietnamese boatpeople problem in
Hong Kong as soon as possible after June 30, 1996 so as to enhance
the success of the Comprehensive Plan of Action," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
China, which will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong
Kong in 1997, expressed its serious concern about the slow pace in
the repatriation of Vietnamese boatpeople in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Chinese delegate Cheng Shousan told the meeting Wednesday that
with the formal end of the Comprehensive Plan of Action in
Southeast Asian countries as of June 30, China hopes that the
problem in Hong Kong can also be solved shortly after that time.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Government attaches great importance to the
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. Therefore, we have all
along shown great concern over the problem of the Vietnamese
boatpeople and refugees stranded in Hong Kong," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
He said "China have to strongly appeal and demand the
British-Hong Kong government and the Vietnamese government to
carry out their unshirkable responsibilities in real earnest and
lose no time in adopting effective measures to accelerate the
repatriation of the Vietnamese boatpeople still stranded in Hong
Kong."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government is serious in repeatedly annoucing that
no burden or troubles should be left behind to the future Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region government of the People's
Republic of China," Cheng stressed.

<HEADLINE> EU Opposes U.S. Sanctions Against Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) protested
a U.S. draft bill imposing trade sanctions on Cuba, which is
currently going through the Congress, a European Commission (EC)
spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
The draft law would prohibit U.S.-owned or controlled companies
from financing firms which might be involved in economic
transactions with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
It would deny entry into the U.S. market of sugars, syrups and
molasses unless certified as of non-Cuban origin.
</P>
<P>
The EC, the executive body of the EU, considered the
U.S. proposal as violating "the general principles of
international law including World Trade Organization (WTO) rules."
</P>
<P>
The law "constitutes the extraterritorial application of U.S.
jurisdiction" which "has no basis in international law," the
spokesman said, and would "restrict EU trade in goods and services
with Cuba."
</P>
<P>
"The EU cannot accept that the US should seek through
unilateral legislation to determine and restrict the EU's economic
and commercial relations (with Cuba)," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said a formal demarche had been made to the U.S.
State Department urging the U.S. administration to forward to the
Congress the EU's views and prevent the passage of the provisions.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU reserves its rights to defend its interests in
the WTO and other appropriate international fora.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union is giving 33.3
million U.S. Dollars to Zimbabwe for drought relief and health
and education projects, head of the European Commission
delegation Michael Lailder said here today.
</P>
<P>
Of the money, about 19.44 million dollars to be disbursed once
Zimbabwe meets the fiscal targets of the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
Michael Lailder, who is on a visit to Zimbabwe, said the
drought relief funds would assist government efforts to alleviate
suffering in the rural population which had been affected by last
year's massive crop failure.
</P>
<P>
Funds will also be used to ease the serious drugs shortage
facing the government-run hospitals and to finance the country's
education program.
</P>
<P>
''We have been financing the schools books program in the
rural areas with the aim of reducing the ratio of one book per
seven pupils to one per two pupils. We have also financed school
buildings, as well as teacher's training,'' Lailder said.
</P>
<P>
Among other IMF conditions, the Zimbabwean government has to
tighten spending, reduce the budget deficit, and cut inflation
which was pegged at 28 percent in January, to about 17 percent by
mid-year.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that IMF would send a mission to Zimbabwe soon
after the country's presidential elections on March 16 and 17 to
discuss with the Zimbabwean government the future of the reform
program.

<HEADLINE> No Grubby Deals for Peace in Ulster: Major </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
said today that the efforts of the British and Irish governments
to bring lasting peace to Northern Ireland are on course.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told BBC Radio that the two governments
would not be influenced by objections from any quarter, or by a
need to hold on to political power.
</P>
<P>
Recently quite a number of reports claimed that as the
Conservative government's majority in the parliament has been
reduced to two, Major has to strike deals with the Ulster Unionist
Party and Democratic Unionist Party, which enjoy nine and three
seats in the House of Commons respectively, so as to ensure his
government's survival.
</P>
<P>
Major refuted today that he would not do any "grubby deals" to
ensure the government's survival.

BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng described
the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, in northwestern China, as
having its own advantages for greater future development.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark at a panel discussion attended by Xinjiang
deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) now in session.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the measures worked out by the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee to narrow the gap between the
eastern and midwestern parts of the country will provide good
opportunities for Xinjiang to catch up with booming coastal areas
in eastern China.
</P>
<P>
The unity among ethnic groups, steady improvement of
transportation facilities, good neighborly ties with adjacent
countries and abundant resources are all advantages for the
development of Xinjiang, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Governments at various levels in the region should be held
responsible for providing adequate food and clothing to the
people, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He urged local officials to boost the production of cotton,
petroleum and natural gas and strive to work for improved
processing of agricultural and sideline products and animal hides.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Even though the economic results
for the end of 1995 are "disappointing", the conditions exist for
an upturn in growth of the European Union(EU) economy in 1996,
this is the main conclusion of the "1996 Annual Economic Report"
published by the European Commission(EC) today.
</P>
<P>
The Report noted that the EU economy experienced a slowdown
throughout 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to expectations at the beginning of 1995 of annual
growth of three percent, activity lost considerable steam
throughout the year and came to a virtual standstill in some
countries towards the end of the year," the Report revealed.
</P>
<P>
It said that, according to the available data, EU GDP(Gross
Domestic Product) growth amounted to some 2.5 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the Report, the slowdown can be explained by four
main factors: negative impact of movements in stocks, insufficient
budgetary consolidation, the increase in interest rate in 1994 and
currency fluctuation.
</P>
<P>
The Report also noted that growth at the beginning of 1996 has
been "weaker than expected" and estimated that growth in the EU as
a whole would be below two percent this year, compared with an
earlier forecast figure of 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
EC Commissioner responsible for economic, financial and
monetary affairs, Yves-Thibault de Silguy today called on member
states to step up their efforts, particularly those directed at

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Taiwan Deputies attending the
ongoing session of the National Poeple's Congress (NPC) today
pledged their strong support for the statement on the Taiwan issue
in the report delivered by Premier Li Peng to the NPC yesterday.
</P>
<P>
No attempt to split the motherland by the Taiwan authorities
will succeed, they said.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng won repeated applauses when talking about the
Taiwan issue yesterday, said Jiang Shuisheng, deputy director of
the Hubei provincial Federation of Taiwan Compatriots.
</P>
<P>
This indicated the kind intention and pragmatism of the Chinese
government and people to safeguard the state sovereignty and
territorial integrity, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Lee Teng-hui should be held solely responsible for the tension
between two sides of the Taiwan Straits," Jiang said, explaining
that since his governing over Taiwan, Lee has been indulged in
separatist activities, and "would inevitably meet with firm
resistance from all Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
Chen Guizhou, deputy director of the Hainan Provincial
Confederation of Taiwan Compatriots who just visited Taiwan before
coming to attend the meeting, said that although Taiwan
authorities are bent on creating "two Chinas", the public in
Taiwan is aspiring for reunification and peace.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's proposals at the start of last
year on the Taiwan issue has received acclamations from all the
Chinese people, but Lee's activities brought about uncertainty to
the Taiwan society and lead to economic downturns, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If Lee continues to defy the will of the people by gambling
the safety for his separatist goal, he will eat his own bitter
fruit," said Wang Ansheng, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee
of the Anhui Provincial People's Congress.

SANAA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
held talks here today with the visiting U.S. Deputy Assistant
Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Arthur Hughes, dealing
with bilateral relations and aspects of cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
They discussed during the meeting regional and international
developments, particularly the current efforts and good offices to
contain the dispute between Yemen and Eritrea over the Red Sea
island of Greater Hanish. They also reviewed the progress of the
regional peace process and international issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of
State praised Yemen for seeking a peaceful settlement of the
conflict with Eritrea. Such an attitude, he pointed out, is both
constructive and wise and is characterized with self restraint. He
emphasized U.S. support in the search for a lasting and just
settlement of the Yemeni-Eritrean dispute, in consolidating
regional security and stability and in safeguarding international
navigation in the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
Hughes also expressed U.S. interest in enhancing and developing
bilateral relations with Yemen in the best interest of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
On his part, the Yemeni President reiterated his country's
stance in seeking a peaceful resolution of its differences with
Eritrea, welcoming all initiatives particularly the French formula.
</P>
<P>
President Saleh emphasized Yemen's support of the current
regional efforts to establish just and comprehensive peace in the
region, on the basis of the restoration of legitimate Arab rights
and the termination of Israeli occupation of Arab territories in
Palestine, South Lebanon and the Golan Heights. He underlined
Yemen's denunciation and rejection of all forms of extremism and
violence.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Outlines Legal Reform in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 6 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin said today
that legal reform in Russia should unfold in four directions, and
the reform will go ahead if he is re-elected in June.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national congress on legal reform in the Kremlin,
Yeltsin said reform will be focused on such areas as "legislation,
the judicial and legal proceedings, the system of federal and
local executive power and the development of the legal
consciousness of the public."
</P>
<P>
He called it necessary "to develop a mechanism for the timely
drafting and adoption of laws regulating all aspects of the
Russian life" because the process was slow and had lagged behind
the reality.
</P>
<P>
The strategy of law-making should be worked out in the next few
years, he added.
</P>
<P>
As for changes in the judicial system and legal proceedings, he
said they have actually come to a halt.
</P>
<P>
"So far we have only achieved the organizational independence
of the judicial system, but the material and financial guarantees
of its independent functioning are practically non-existent," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin voiced the need to update the system of the executive
power, saying legal reform would be impossible without it.
</P>
<P>
"The economy is already different today, and so is the
political system," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The president said it would be useful to adopt a package of
federal laws, in particular on the Cabinet and the general
principles of executive power, that would define the relations of
the Cabinet with the president, the parliament and the judicial
system.
</P>
<P>
"We have about a dozen controlling bodies, hundreds of
thousands of controllers, but the results of their efforts are
often close to nothing," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed support for the formation of "a powerful
indivisible federal system of government control over the
operation of all executive bodies."
</P>
<P>
He said he wanted to win the June presidential elections "in
order to bring the legal reform to a successful completion."

<HEADLINE> China's Development Plan Beneficial to Hong &AMP; Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China's development program for
the next 15 years will benefit long-term social stability and
prosperity in Hong Kong and Macao, although it does not cover the
two regions, said a high-ranking official on Hong Kong and Macao
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ziying, deputy director of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office of the State Council, made the remark while joining in a
panel discussion attended by Hong Kong members of the country's
top advisory body now in session.
</P>
<P>
"After China takes back Hong Kong and Macao in 1997 and 1999
respectively," Chen said, "special administrative regions will be
established there, ensuring that they retain the existing
capitalist system for 50 years in accordance with the 'one
country, two systems' policy."
</P>
<P>
Although the central government's plan does not cover the
two regions, he noted, the two basic laws for Hong Kong and
Macao have already defined economic and social development
programs for the regions.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, great potentials exist for further economic
exchanges between the two regions and inland China to promote
mutual development.
</P>
<P>
Inland areas can serve as the unfailing backyard support for
Hong Kong's and Macao's development with rich natural resources
and a potential vast market, "which will prove to be a unique
advantage for Hong Kong's future development," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Chen told the Hong Kong members that the increase of China's
foreign trade volume will sharpen Hong Kong's competitive edge in
world trade. Hong Kong is among China's leading trade partners.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade volume jumped from 20 billion US dollars
in 1979 to 280 billion last year, and inland China's trade with
Hong Kong alone is projected to hit 400 billion US dollars in
the next five year.
</P>
<P>
He added China's investment environment will be further
improved in the coming five years, and overseas funds will be
introduced into some major sectors. A world financial center,
Hong Kong will continue to help inland China to use overseas
funds, which will help consolidate its status.

<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- It is the first time in 47 years
since 1949 for members of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) to join in
discussions of the long-range objectives and they will offer more
constructive suggestions for achieving these goals.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made today by Ye Xuanping, vice-chairman of
the CPPCC National Committee, during a panel discussion.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jinglian, a noted economist from the Research Center for
Development under the State Council, said China's future economic
development lies in how to achieve the shifts from the traditional
planned economy to socialist market economy and the shift in
economic growth from being extensive to intensive. But there are
still problems yet to be solved in detailed arrangement.
</P>
<P>
As the reform has become increasingly difficult when it goes
more penetrating, he said, the way out is how the country deepens
the reform. Only by doing so, can China realize the two shifts, he
</P>
<P>
"We shouldn't place too much emphasis on the pace of
development, but on reforming production factors instead," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Members from educational sectors said science and education
play an important role in realizing China's long-range objectives.
By combining the two, the country can train a large contingent of
talented personnel.
</P>
<P>
Gao Ge, professor of Beijing University of Aeronautics and
Astronautics, said his university is in an acute shortage of
talents as many college faculty members have transferred to other
jobs.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Chen Nanxian of Beijing Science and Technology University
suggested that China establish a system of responsibility in the
construction of major engineering projects.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Chen's view is shared by He Zhuoxiu, academician of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, who proposed joint efforts by
different departments to complete a major scientific project.
</P>
<P>
Wen Jiabao, an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee joined the science and
technology group in its discussion. He said the rapid growth of
science and technology requires a good plan, mechanism, contingent
of personnel and a competent leading body.
</P>
<P>
He told the CPPCC members that the State Science and Technology
Commission is working on a long-range objective in scientific and
technological development. The CPPCC National Committee members
can consider such development in a longer term, such as 20 to 30
years, he said.

ANKARA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today offered to hold
tripartite water talks with Syria and Iraq, but rejected a
proposal that such tripartite talks be held within the framework

</P>
<P>
Omer Akbel, the spokesman, said that in fact the original offer
for the tripartite water talks among Turkey, Syria and Iraq was
not proposed by the Arab League, but by Turkey.

Turkish Ambassador to Egypt Yasar Yakis said Tuesday that the
tripartite water talks should be direct, rather than under the
Arab League.
</P>
<P>
Yakis met Secretary General of the Arab League Esmat
Abdul-Meguid, who reportedly told Yakis that the Arab body
wanted Turkey to "make an agreement that would give a
guarantee to Syria for its water needs."
</P>
<P>
Syria and Iraq agreed in Damascus in February to launch
an international campaign to force Turkey to accept "fair and
reasonable sharing" of the Euphrates river, which flows to Syria
and Iraq from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Syria holds that Turkey's multi-billion-dollar plan for the
construction of several dams on the Euphrates has led to a
sharp decline in the flow of water to Syria.

our generation to do what past generations have not
accomplished," he told Qinghai deputies to the National People's
Congress now in session here. The deputies were discussing a
report by Premier Li Peng on China's development plans for the
next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
"We all should have this sense of mission," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also general secretary of the Chinese Communist
Party, expressed confidence in the future of western China.
</P>
<P>
"The state has formulated policies that aim to boost
development in western China. The key to success in this regard is
to implement these policies by taking specific measures and doing
work with one heart and mind," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that, as national economic development shifts
from China's east to its western regions, an increasing number
of people will take part in economic development there.
</P>
<P>
"Economic development in western China has a bright future,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Joining Hubei deputies in their discussion, Jiang expressed
"three hopes" for the province: first, Hubei should play a better
role as a major production base for farm produce; second, with a
concentration of state-owned enterprises, the province should take
measures to boost their productivity; and third, with its central
geographical location, Hubei should play a good role of promoting
economic development in the Yangtze River valley and interior
China by serving as a bridge for broad inter-provincial economic
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Appliance of Science A Winning Formula for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The appliance of science has
become a big money spinner for China, and especially for
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The country's technology transactions were worth 2.68 billion
yuan last year, 17.25 percent higher than the previous year,
according to statistics from the State Science and Technology
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The value of an average contract for a technology transaction
also rose almost 18 percent in 1995 over 1994.
</P>
<P>
Beijing leads the whole country in both the number and level of
transactions reached. Technology transactions in the capital alone
accounted for nearly one-sixth of the total for the country. An
average contract in Beijing was 251,800 yuan, more than double the
national average.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, Liaoning, Sichuan, Shandong, Jiangsu were also major
areas for technology transactions.
</P>
<P>
However, the technology market was uneven across the country,
with most of the transactions done in the eastern part of China
which takes in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Shandong and Zhejiang.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Cuts Repo Interest Rate Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stockholm, March 6 (Xinhua)-- The central Bank of Sweden
Tuesday cut the repo interest rate from 8.05 percent to 7.85
percent, the fifth reduction this year, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Within a two-month period, the central bank has lowed the repo
rate by a total of 106 basis points. However, there were few
immediate positive effects on the Swedish market, as a fall in
the Swedish krona caused market interest rates to rise slightly
yesterday, instead of falling.
</P>
<P>
Most economists now believe that repo rate cuts will continue
through the spring and summer, bringing the repo interest rate
down to 7 percent by May and 6 percent before the end of the
summer.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Finance Minister Goeran Persson is also optimistic
about the repo interest rate trend. "There is no reason for Sweden
to have higher interest rates than in neighboring countries, if
one takes into account our low inflation and the state of the
public finances," said Persson Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Promote Clean Child-Bearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Nepal will launch a program of
clean delivery awareness to protect women and their newborn babies
in more than 2,000 villages across the country Friday, the
International Women's Day.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, about 44,000 women and
45,000 newborn babies die during childbirth every year in Nepal.
The rate of safe deliveries in the country stands at a low 18
percent.
</P>
<P>
Some 92.5 percent of Nepalese pregnant women give birth at
home, while only 24 percent do it with the help of trained
midwives.
</P>
<P>
The clean delivery awareness program is sponsored by the
government in cooperation with some national women's organizations
and international agencies, including the United Nations
Children's Fund and the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
The program is expected to reach more than 13 million people
mostly living in the country's backward areas.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, trained birth attendants will provide local
women with clean delivery training and necessary equipment.
</P>
<P>
Volunteers will conduct poster campaigns, street dramas,
rallies and door-to-door visits as part of the country's largest
coordinated effort to promote clean delivery.
</P>
<P>
Local mass media will also launch a campaign to increase
people's awareness on delivery hygiene.
</P>
<P>
The clean delivery concept, developed by the WHO, includes a
set of simple procedures protecting lying-in women and newborns
from being infected during childbirth.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Activists Clash with Ruling Party  Supporters in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's opposition activists
here today clashed with police and government supporters during
their day-long strike in an effort to prevent a rally by the
ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that several buses and trucks carrying BNP
supporters to its rally came under attack at different points of
the city.
</P>
<P>
Police used tear gas, batons and rubber bullets to disperse the
activists who threw brick bats and stones at the police, the
witnesses said, adding that at least five persons were injured in
the morning and some motor vehicles and auto-rickshaws were
damaged.
</P>
<P>
Last night, the mainstream opposition parties first announced
their decision to shift their dawn-to-dusk strike in the city and
adjoining five districts to March 7 because the ruling party had
earlier changed its rally against opposition's violent activities
from March 6 to 7.
</P>
<P>
But while the BNP decided to shift the date back to March 6,
the opposition also rescheduled their strike for March 6 in order
to prevent the BNP rally.
</P>
<P>
Because of the sudden decision of the strike, normal life in
the city was disrupted. Although government offices had normal
attendance, most private offices, shops and business
establishments remained closed. Train movements were also
disrupted and some trains got stranded on the way. There were few
buses and cars in the streets.
</P>
<P>
According to the opposition announcement last night, they will
continue a nationwide strike Thursday to press home their demand
for cancellation of the BNP-held "farcical" national elections on
February 15 and resignation of the present government to pave the
way for holding fresh elections under a neutral caretaker
government.

<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Top military official Zhang Zhen
today urged officers and men of the People's Liberation Army (PLA)
to contribute more to building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, made
the remark during a panel discussion of PLA deputies attending the
ongoing National People's Congress (NPC) session.
</P>
<P>
According to the country's Ninth Five-year Plan (1996-2000),
the Chinese arms will raise the country's capabilities of its
national defense and its own combat effectiveness with modern and
high technologies, for the sake of self-defence and the cause of
reunification of the motherland and achieving the trans-century
goals for economic and social development, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin has time and again stressed the
importance of keeping a correct political orientation recently,
Zhang noted. Therefore, he added, the armed forces, as an armed
contingent for implementating political tasks, should set higher
standards to carry out these tasks, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces should have better disciplines to shoulder the
country's reform, opening and modernization drive, strictly
following the decisions set by the Chinese Communist Party and
protecting the authoritative power of the Party Central Committee
headed by Jiang Zemin, Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM Meets with Iraqi Oil Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Deniz Baykal said here today that Turkey wanted
Iraq to be a respectable member of international community in the
possible shortest time, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Baykal told reporters after meeting with visiting Iraqi Oil
Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid that their talks were "very
fruitful." He recalled that the economic ties between the two
neighboring countries suffered due to a suspension in accordance
with the United Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Baykal said that Iraq was determined to abide by the
U.N. Resolution 986, adding: "Turkey welcomes this as we hope
that a trade cooperation could be based on medicine and foodstuff
and there could be an export possibility for Iraqi petroleum if
the requirements of the U.N. Resolution 986 were met."
</P>
<P>
Within the framework of this understanding, there is
cooperation opportunity in industry field and various economic
projects, said Baykal, adding: " I hope the Iraqi-Turkish ties
will be boosted to compensate the loss in the past."
</P>
<P>
Rashid, in his turn, said that their meeting was very fruitful
and "The Turkish market has always been a prior market for the
supply of food. Besides economic elements, for political elements
also the Turkish market is the foremost of the markets which will
supply food to Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Rashid and his ten-man delegation traveled along the
Yumurtalik-Kirkuk oil pipeline and reached Turkey through northern
 Iraq Monday and saw that the pipeline was in good shape.
</P>
<P>
Iraq began talks last month with the U.N. on a deal to sell 2
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over a six-month period, on a
renewable basis, to buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The first round of the talks ended two weeks ago without
agreement. A second round is scheduled for March 11 in New York.

JAKARTA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's inflation rate last

<P>
Information Minister Harmoko quoted President Soeharto as
saying that the February inflation rate is still considered high.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed at today's limited cabinet session on
economic, financial, trade, industry and development supervision.
</P>
<P>
Harmoko attributed the high inflation rate to the increase in
prices of various goods and services, such as food and housing.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto called on the economic ministers to make
various efforts to prevent the inflation rate from increasing
further in the following months.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Rules out Conditions for Hostage Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas today ruled out any conditions for the release of the 12
remaining hostages in Irian Jaya kidnapped by the separatist
group, the Free Papua Movement (OPM), on January 8.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed the stand of the Indonesian government on this
issue at the limited cabinet session here today.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that no international law justifies
kidnapping, adding that the whole world has condemned the OPM
abduction of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has been quite flexible in dealing with
the kidnappers as can be seen in its decision to adopt persuasive
measures instead of resorting to force.
</P>
<P>
Asked on the intention of the kidnappers to hold a dialogue
with the government, Alatas said: "We never recognize them.
Hence, it is impossible for us to enter into any dialogue with
them."
</P>
<P>
The OPM kidnapped 26 people, including seven foreigners, on
January 8 and released 14 of them later.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers are still holding 12 hostages, including four
Britons and two Dutch nationals.
</P>
<P>
The OPM has been seeking independence in Irian Jaya since the
late 1960s. The Indonesian government has rejected its demand for
the recognition of a West Papua state in exchange for the release
of the hostages.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Leaders Responsible for Tension: Wang Zhaoguo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese leader put the blame
on some Taiwan leaders for tensions between the two sides of the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
"Some Taiwan leaders have been intent on creating 'two Chinas,'
'one China, one Taiwan' and 'the independence of Taiwan' in the
interntional arena. This is the major cause for tensions in
relations between both sides of the Taiwan Straits since last
May," said Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
and director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Wang expressed the view at a group meeting of CPPCC National
Committee members, who are here attending its annual session.
</P>
<P>
"At present, our main task is to fight against the separatist
forces, protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
Chinese nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said Chinese premier Li Peng reiterated the central
government's stand on the Taiwan issue in his report yesterday to
the National People People's Congress, that is, the central
government is in favor of a peaceful reunification of the
motherland but will not undertake to renounce the use of force.
</P>
<P>
"This is not directed against the Taiwan compatriots, but
against forces that want to bring about 'the independence of
Taiwan' and foreign forces that want to interfer with China's
reunification," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We pin our hope on people in Taiwan and sincerely appeal to
all Chinese including our compatriots in Taiwan to unite and
strive for an early reunification of the motherland," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that more should be done to protect the interests
of Taiwan businesses in the mainland and promote economic
and cultural exchanges across the Straits."

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Urges Self-Reliance for Agricultural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China should develop its
agriculture through its self-reliant efforts and with its vast
population, self-reliance is essential to producing enough grain
to feed its people, said Qiao Shi, China's top legislator here
today.
</P>
<P>
Joining in a panel discussion on Premier Li Peng's report on
China's development goals for the next 15 years, Qiao said China
must take agriculture as the basis for the fulfilment of the
goals.
</P>
<P>
The discussion was held by the NPC delegation from east China's
Zhejiang Province, to which Qiao belongs as an NPC member.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to handle properly the issue of grain
production and the development of the whole sector, and we confide
in achieving it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The NPC chairman also spoke on the importance of protecting
farmland.
</P>
<P>
With the country's double-digit annual economic growth rate
over recent years, more and more farmland has given way to booming
industrial and building projects. For this reason, central and
local authorities have resorted to measures to preserve China's
precious cropland, which accounts for only a small percentage of
its territory.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, vice-premier Jiang Chunyun who is in charge of
agriculture called for "conscientious" implementation of the set
policies that cites agriculture as the top priority and hard work
for a good harvest this year.

MOSCOW, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Chechen field commander Salman
Raduyev, who plotted Kizlyer and Pervomaiskoye hostage crisis in
Dagestan in January, died from fatal wounds in hospital early this
morning, the Itar-Tass news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a reliable Chechen police source as confirming that
Raduyev, 28, died at 02:00 local time in a hospital in

</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass said Raduyev, the son-in-law of rebel Chechen
president Dzhokhar Dudayev, died from submachine-gun wounds in the
head and chest. He was wounded several days ago on a highway
between the villages of Starye Otagi and Urus-Martan, 15
kilometers south of the Chechen capital of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The news agency added a group of 130 Chechen militants loyal to
Dudayev, after penetrating Grozny overnight, have occupied two
militia headquarters and seized five officials of the local
interior department.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Chechnya is getting complicated as fresh

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM Visits Moscow to Boost Bilateral Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati arrived here today for a three-day official visit aimed
at boosting bilateral economic relations and discussing the Tajik
settlement, said official sources here.
</P>
<P>
Velayati is expected to hold talks with his Russian counterpart
Yevgeny Primakov and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Their talks will focus on oil production, atomic energy and
aircraft production.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss how to settle the conflict in
Tajikistan, as both Moscow and Tehran have a major role to play in
negotiations between the Tajik authorities and the opposition.
</P>
<P>
In December 1995, the two countries approved a draft agreement
on long-term economic cooperation and signed an inter-governmental
memorandum concerning the settlement of mutual financial
obligations and an inter-bank agreement on the procedure of
settling accounts.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 and 1995, trade turnover between the two countries
amounted to 500-700 million U.S. dollars. Over 100 Russian
organizations and firms have operated on the Iranian market in the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
En route to Moscow, the foreign minister has visited
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Georgia
and Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Current Account Deficit Climbs Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's current account
deficit in January stood at 1.52 billion U.S. dollars, up 101
percent from the same month last year, the Bank of Korea said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounted for 17.2 percent of the entire 8.82
billion dollar deficit in 1995 and 25.3 percent of the 6 billion
dollar deficit expected this year.
</P>
<P>
The current account comprises trade in goods and services as
well as investment income and government payments.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase was mainly due to higher demand for crude il
caused by cold weather, an import increase in consumer goods
during the lunar new year's holidays and more students traveling
overseas during winter vacation, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
In January, South Korean exports rose by 30.4 percent from a
year earlier to 10.44 billion dollars while imports jumped 35.7
percent to 11.39 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
South Korea registered a record 531 million dollar deficit in
invisible trade in January, including a travel-account deficit of
251 million dollars and a transfer-account deficit of 40 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The capital account enjoyed a surplus of 480 million dollars,
up from 310 million dollars in January last year. The figure was
1.64 billion dollars in December.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange holdings of the bank totaled 33.26 billion
dollars at the end of January, according to the bank.

<HEADLINE> Premier Urges Beijing to Lead Rest of China in Price Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese premier Li Peng urged
Beijing to lead the rest of China in price control, the
invigoration of state-owned enterprises and the implementation of
the "vegetable basket" program.
</P>
<P>
The "vegetable basket" program refers to the production of
meat, eggs, milk and vegetables for city residents.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark at a panel discussion attended by Beijing
deputies to the National People's Congress now in session.
</P>
<P>
Li said, "Inflation should be contained at about 10 percent
this year for the whole nation but, for coastal areas, a higher
demand should be in order: inflation there should be controlled
below 10 percent."
</P>
<P>
Beijing is generally regarded as being within the coastal
areas.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the central government requires that Beijing
function as the country's political, cultural, educational and
scientific center.
</P>
<P>
"Work of the municipal government should concentrate on
boosting these functions of the city so as to better serve the
central government, international exchanges and residents of the
city," he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier urged the city to develop new and high technology
as well as value-added industries.
</P>
<P>
Beijing should make full use of its advantages in light and
textile industries to develop name brand products. It should also
speed up the technical upgrading of its existing enterprises
and establish enterprise groups to achieve economies of scale,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Construction of high-rises must be brought under control and
more attention should be given to building affordable residential
housing for the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li told the Beijing deputies, "The most important tasks for
China today is still to curb inflation."

<HEADLINE> Top Advisors Call for Regulations to Purify Chinese Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Regulations and a law on the
management of the Chinese language and characters should be
drafted as soon as possible to cope with the confusion and
"pollution" in its use, members of China's top advisory body urged
here today.
</P>
<P>
Jin Kaicheng, a Chinese language and literature professor at
the prestigious Beijing University and vice-chairman of the
Central Committee of the non-Communist Jiu San Society, was joined
by four senior officials of four other non-Communist parties to
submit a written motion concerning purifying and standardizing the
Chinese to the ongoing Fourth Session of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee.
</P>
<P>
The five CPPCC National Committee members noted that the modern
Chinese language has drawn some elements from foreign languages,
dialects and classical Chinese at an unprecedented pace since the
country launched the drive of opening-up and reform some 17 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The motion noted that "some unhealthy tendencies have emerged
to the detrimental of the purity of our mother tongue."
</P>
<P>
The unhealthy tendencies constitute four features: alienness;
vulgarness; tending to be feudalistic; and unsmoothness, according
to the members.
</P>
<P>
Some enterprises and their products, though having nothing to
do with anything foreign, have adopted foreign brand names#,the
motion said. And there is even a tendency to giving Chinese
children foreign names.
</P>
<P>
Coarse and rude language can be heard and mouthfuls of
four-letter words are often uttered, with vulgar language
scattered in literary works, the members said in the motion.
</P>
<P>
In the service sector and the naming of daily consumer
products, the motion said, words meaning emperors, imperial
concubines and despotic gentries are common.
</P>
<P>
Unsmoothness in lines of pop songs often make people feel at a
loss, the motion said.
</P>
<P>
"The correct use of the mother tongue is an important
reflection of patriotism, and the Chinese language and its
characters have long been a bond for national unity," Jin said.
</P>
<P>
"Confusion and pollution in the language is harmful to national
dignity and image, and will erode the cohesiveness of the nation,"
Jin noted.
</P>
<P>
To purify the language is of great significance to improving
the national quality and social atmosphere, the professor said.
</P>
<P>
The five members urged government officials at all levels to
list on their work agenda the task of purifying the Chinese
language. They particularly held the press and the media and
cultural departments responsible for the endeavors to help purify
the Chinese language.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Activist Gets Life Imprisonment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian court in the West
Bank town of Jericho has sentenced Muhammad Abu Wardeh, a Hamas
activist arrested by the Palestinian security forces in Ramallah
on suspicion of recruiting the suicide bombers of Jerusalem and
Tel Aviv bombings, to life imprisonment with hard labor.
</P>
<P>
JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in east Jerusalem,
today reported the verdict, saying that it was handed down Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
The court found him guilty of "terrorist activity" and of
jeopardizing the interests of the Palestinian people. The court
said the sentence could not be appealed, and was approved by
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Abu Wardeh, 20, was arrested from the Teacher's College in
Ramallah along with 20 fellow students on March 3, following
the Jerusalem bombing attack that killed 19 people.
</P>
<P>
Before the trial, Abu Wardeh spoke to the Voice of
Palestine radio in Jericho, saying he was sorry for his part
in the bombings.
</P>
<P>
Calling on activists to stop attacks against Israeli targets,
Abu Wardeh said he had realized that such operations are harmful
to the interests of the Palestinian people.

<HEADLINE> Boost for China's High-Speed Information Corridor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The world's most sophisticated
telecommunications transmission system is to play its part in
speeding up phone links between north and south China.
</P>
<P>
The USA made equipment will be fitted to the
Beijing-Wuhan-Guangzhou optical cable, one of the country's
longest cable trunks, it was announced in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
A 19 million US dollar deal for the project was signed today by
China's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) and Lucent
Technologies, formerly AT&AMP;T's systems and technology business.
</P>
<P>
It is the US company's second Chinese contract in a month. On
February 7 a deal worth 16 million US dollars was signed with the
MPT to provide SDH (Synchronized digital equipment) for the
Beijing-Jiujiang-Guangzhou optical cable.
</P>
<P>
Lucent will, under the latest contract, provide four SDH
systems to the 2,886-km Beijing-Wuhan-Guangzhou cable trunk, and
two SDH systems for a branch cable line between Changsha and
Nanning.
</P>
<P>
The equipment will escalate the transmission speeds along the
cables to the fastest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of the Beijing-Wuhan-Guangzhou cable is a key
project of China's telecommunications sector in the Ninth
Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
When completed, the cable, running from Beijing to Guangzhou
via provincial capitals of Shijiazhuang, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, and
Changsha, will become China's longest communications artery, with
the largest system capacity.
</P>
<P>
Together with the Beijing-Jiujiang-Guangzhou trunk line, the
cable will form a super information corridor between the north and
south.
</P>
<P>
Separated from AT&AMP;T recently, Lucent is one of the world's
largest telecommunications companies with assets valued at 20
billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Some 100 Arrested for Violating Election Law in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Some 100 people were arrested
here for violating elections law in the crucial parliament
elections slated for March 8, a press reported said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Today's evening paper Kayhan reported that only in Tehran
over 600 violations are reported to the authorities everyday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3,232 contenders are running for 270 seats of
the 5th parliament in the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
As Iran is gearing up for Friday's parliamentary elections,
the two main rival groups are accusing each other of violations of
election laws.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the main contenders for the
majority seats in Iran's 270-seats parliament are the Society of
Combatant Clergy (SCC) and the liberal group known as G-6
which supports Iran's moderate President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by SCC-controlled Supervisory Committee
overseeing the elections accused Tehran mayor Gholamhossein
Karbaschi, a member of the G-6, of using municipality facilities
for the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran Mayor is under attack by SCC for his liberal
viewpoints. He is also a presidential hopeful which may run
against SCC's main candidate for presidential race, Parliament
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
The statement further accused the mayor of using municipality
telephone lines, cars and buildings to publicize G-6 candidates.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that it has sent the cases of violation by
the mayor to the proper legal authorities for their consideration.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, armed policemen forced a liberal opposition
group to cancel a press conference by confiscating all tapes and
films of foreign and local reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry claimed that the press conference was
illegal and the Freedom Movement of Iran was an outlawed group.

<HEADLINE> Wedding Ceremony is the Ice on the Cake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- If the bride gave an icy look to
her husband-to-be at their wedding ceremony it was hardly
surprising.
</P>
<P>
They exchanged their wedding vows on an iced-covered lake,
while the guests looked on.
</P>
<P>
Other couples in China's capital city, Beijing, are moving away
from traditional civil ceremony buildings to make their wedding
day one they will never forget.
</P>
<P>
Ceremonies on the Great Wall of China are becoming fashionable
among couples wanting to tie the knot with a day steeped in
history.
</P>
<P>
Another popular venue is the Tian'anmen rostrum in the heart of
China's capital.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has seen the emergence of a new industry during the
past few years, marriage celebration companies. More than 30 of
them have already been established around the city.
</P>
<P>
They take all the hassle out of organizing the big day for
couples, and that includes arranging ceremonies in the most
unlikely or exciting places.
</P>
<P>
Some couples have even splashed out on wedding ceremonies
staged on water.
</P>
<P>
One of the companies, The Dazhalan Celebration Service
Center, is even providing a pigeon flying service for customers.
</P>
<P>
It has been established in Beijing to meet more and more
demand from local residents who are quickly catching up with a
new fashion in celebrating.
</P>
<P>
As the birds circle above they send out a melodic ringing noise
from small bells attached to them.
</P>
<P>
The center has invested 400,000 yuan (about 48,192 US dollars)
in building a pigeon breeding base covering an area of almost a
half of a hectare and housing more than 1,000 pigeons, Li Tianjun,
the manager of the center, said.
</P>
<P>
People are showing great interest in the new business, with
consultations and order telephone calls arriving in great numbers,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The number of people who use pigeon flying, music bands,
flowers, and advertisements during celebration ceremonies has
been steadily rising since firecrackers and fireworks in urban
areas were banned in late 1993.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Christopher's Allegation on Bombing Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government today
rejected U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's accusations
that Iran was involved in the recent suicide bombing attacks in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammad, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, denied
"uncalculated" statements and accusations raised by Christopher in
relation to recent incidents in the "occupied Palestine."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the American and Israeli officials
made the uncalculated accusations against Iran in a hasty manner
without any evidence.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the United States and the Israeli regime
had better search the root-causes of their problems in their
past deeds and present policies rather than attributing them to
others.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Iran's official news agency IRNA today
carried a second statement by the Iranian permanent mission
to the United Nations, denying any involvement in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The statement by the mission said "the US secretary of
state echoed the very same baseless allegations which the
Israeli officials had earlier leveled against Iran in connection
with the recent incidents in Palestine."
</P>
<P>
Iran has consistently denounced all acts of violence against
innocent people irrespective of the nationality or beliefs of
the victims or the perpetrators, it added.
</P>
<P>
"This policy has been invariably stated and upheld by the
highest officials in the Islamic Republic of Iran as a
matter of unwavering principal," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
However, it noted, the U.S. secretary of state finds it
convenient to exploit the public sentiments created by the
recent incidents to advance the "ill-conceived and ill-fated" U.S.
policy of hostility toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
Under the current circumstances, the newly intensified
allegations of an unfounded and purely speculative nature
against Iran seem to point to an ulterior motive on the part
of the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Iranian press have voiced support
for the Palestinian group of Hamas.
</P>
<P>
Persian daily Abrar published an editorial today saying
that "Palestinian youth had decided that if they were going
to be killed by the Israelis, it would be better if they
themselves choose the manner of their own death."
</P>
<P>
Another Persian daily, Jomhuri Eslami, said in a commentary
today that the success or failure of the peace process depended
not on the U.S. mediation but only on "the ceaseless struggle of
the unknown and selfless Palestinians ready to sacrifice
themselves."
</P>
<P>
It advised the Israeli officials to accept the fact that
they cannot fight a "nation (Palestinians) who has turned its
whole existence into a battlefield."

<HEADLINE> FINA: No Olympic Games for Foschi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- American swimmer Jessica Foschi
will be banned from the summer's Atlanta Olympic Games, according
to the head of the International Swimming Federation (FINA) in
Lausanne on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mustapha Larfaoui, president of the FINA, said although they
don not have the complete file Foschi must be banned.
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old Foschi, who tested positive last August for
steroids at the U.S. National Championships, was given only a
two-year probation by the U.S. swimming governing body and was
allowed to swim this weekend at the U.S. Olympic trials, citing
the case of Australia's Samantha Riley.
</P>
<P>
FINA gave Australia's Samantha Riley only a warning for using a
banned substance at the World Short Course Championships last
November in Brazil. Riley's coach admitted giving her an improper
painkiller by mistake.
</P>
<P>
"The two cases are totally different. Foschi took steroids and
Riley a simple painkiller," said Larfaoui.
</P>
<P>
FINA are expected to make a final decision in July.

<HEADLINE> More Foreign Fund Flows Into S.Korean Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The net inflow of foreign funds into
South Korea's stock market amounted to 321 million U.S. dollars in
February, up a whopping 141.4 percent from January this year, the
Bank of Korea said here today.
</P>
<P>
It is the highest monthly figure since last September when a
total of 679 million dollars in foreign funds entered the country
in net capital.
</P>
<P>
In February, foreigners brought in 863 million dollars to buy
South Korean stocks, in contrast to a remittance of 542 million
dollars, the central bank added.
</P>
<P>
The inflow of foreign money began to increase in late January,
and the net inflow for the first two months of the year reached
454 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The steady increase in the net inflow is attributed to the
government's plan to raise the ceiling on foreign investment from
15 percent to 18 percent of a company's capitalization beginning
April 1.
</P>
<P>
Since the country's stock market opened all its doors to
foreigners in January 1992, the net inflow of foreign funds has
reached 12.56 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Law, Stipulations concerning Troops to Station in HK underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, March 6 (Xinhua) -- China is drafting a Law concerning
Troops to be Stationed in the future Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, said a top military officer.
</P>
<P>
The law is expected to define the responsibility and power of
PLA troops in Hong Kong, their judicial administration, and the
relations between the troops and the SAR government, said Liu
Huaqing, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
Liu, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
made the remark in a panel discussion of deputies from the PLA
group to the ongoing session of the National People's Congress
(NPC).
</P>
<P>
After 1997, the SAR government and the stationed troops of the
Chinese People Liberation Army (PLA) will operate independently in
accordance with their respective administrative and military
systems without interfering in and subjection from each other, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Central Military Commission will draft a series
of rules and regulations regarding the PLA troops to be stationed
in Hong Kong, involving military exercises and maneuvers,
education and management of armymen, and logistics work.
</P>
<P>
China's military departments have edited and compiled books and
other reading materials to help acquaint the armymen with Hong
Kong laws and way of life there.
</P>
<P>
The stationing of PLA troops in Hong Kong symbolizes the
resumption of the exercise of power over Hong Kong by the Chinese
government and is also an indispensable factor for maintaining the
long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. Therefore, the
Party Central Committee, the State Council and the Central
Military Commission have set high demands on this, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-chairman noted that the PLA troops to be stationed in
Hong Kong will prove, with their concrete deeds, that it is a
security guarantee for Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the principles of
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and "high-degree autonomy"
will strictly be implemented, and its existing system will remain
unchanged for 50 years to come, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The PLA troops to be stationed in Hong Kong will abide by the
principle of "one country, two systems" set forth by Deng
Xiaoping, perform their duties of defense and help maintain a
prosperous and stable Hong Kong on the basis of China's
Constitution and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, Liu Huaqing said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Seeks Cyprus' Support for War against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government has
sought support from the Cyprus government for its war against
terrorism and asked the island's government to explain to the
Palestinians and Arab countries the consequences terrorism would
bring about in the region.
</P>
<P>
The request was made by Israel's ambassador to Cyprus Shemi
Tzur during a meeting here today with Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides, according to Cyprus News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place following the latest wave of suicide
bombing attacks in Israel, which left more than 60 people
dead.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli ambassador told the press after the meeting
that his country had appealed to Cyprus for "support and
understanding of the action that Israel is going to take".
</P>
<P>
"We asked Cyprus, which has good relations with the
Palestinians and Arab countries, to explain to them how harmful
this terrorism is, not only to the Israelis but to the
Palestinians themselves and other countries," Tzur said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli diplomat said he explained to the President
the measures taken by the Israeli government to cope with
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In his response, Tzur said, President Clerides wants to send
his condolences to Israel to express the friendship of Cyprus to
the Israeli people.
</P>
<P>
"He condemned terrorism and supported the Israeli position to
take all measures to stop terrorism," Tzur added.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador noted that the war against terrorists has
nothing to do with the Palestinians themselves.
</P>
<P>
"They (terrorists) are going to pay for their action and they
will pay severely," Tzur added.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he believed that Israeli interests in Cyprus will
be targeted, Tzur replied "I do not think so. We are
confident and we trust the police authorities on the island.
We are also taking our own measures."

<HEADLINE> Hot Water On Tap in Chinese City -- Thanks to Nature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A 2.78 million US dollar hot water
well, built as a joint venture between China and Iceland, has been
completed.
</P>
<P>
The first Sino-Iceland geothermal development project in
Tianjin is already proving to be a success.
</P>
<P>
Iceland agreed to loan the money for the project to China in
1993 as part of an agreement between the two countries. The loan
was used to develop rich geothermal resources in Tanggu, a
satellite town of China's third largest city, Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The co-operation agreement includes joint work on three wells
that will supply heating to homes across a 240,000 square meter
area, the launch of a geothermal research center, with technical
help from Iceland experts, the installation of a
computer-controlled geothermal heat and a water supply system.
</P>
<P>
Tanggu town on the coast of the Bohai Sea has a rich
geothermal resource. Since 1987, the town has developed 21 wells
that now supply 4.15 million cubic meters of hot water and
provide heating to 720,000 square meters of houses.
</P>
<P>
The town has also succeeded in developing geothermal resources
for aquatic product growing, swimming, bathing and as mineral
water. More than 100,000 of its residents now use geothermal
hot water in their houses.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Last Proposal of a CPPCC Member </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Gao Zhenning, a member of China's
top advisory body, started to draft a proposal for the annual
session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) late last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the 67-year-old aeronautics expert could not wait to
submit his proposal in person to the session now in progress here
in Beijing: he died of cancer on February 23, nine days before the
session began.
</P>
<P>
His proposal has been published by the conference organizor
and is being passed among members.
</P>
<P>
His proposal is entitled "On the Importance of Emancipating
Scientific and Technological Productivity for Invigorating
State-owned Enterprises."
</P>
<P>
Gao was a vice-minister of aviation industry. He designed
China's first generation of bombers and "Qiang-5" aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Gao started to draft the proposal at the end of last September
when he knew he had cancer. Knowing he had few days to go, he kept
work on his proposal after being hospitalized in Shanghai last
November. One day before he passed away, he made oral revisions to
his proposal on bed.
</P>
<P>
The written proposal now in the hands of CPPCC members is the
fifth edition.
</P>
<P>
In the last days of his life, Gao did not forget his duty as a
member of the country's top advisory body. Last October, he led a
delegation on an investigation tour to Dalian, a port city in
northeast China. Even while his cancer was spreading, he joined
other well-known scientists writing to the central government that
development of the aviation industry be included in the Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996--2000).
</P>
<P>
In his 3,000-word proposal, Gao warns against the tendency of
neglecting technological advances in some state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Progress in science and technology should be given priority in
the process of building a modern enterprise system," he says in
his proposal.
</P>
<P>
The proposal contains his last words, a valuable legacy not
just for the aviation industry but also for its symbolism -- the
devotion of a CPPCC member and a scientist to his country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today pledged
support for China's 15-year economic construction drive.
</P>
<P>
Help for major projects in Beijing has been promised by the
World Bank when a high ranking official met the mayor of the
Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Nicolas Hope, director of the China and Mongolia Department of
the bank, expressed interest in China's Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000), and its long-term target for 2010. He said the World
Bank had a willingness to participate in China's grand economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
Hope made the remarks at a meeting in Beijing with mayor Li
Qiyan today.
</P>
<P>
Hope, who is in China at the invitation of China's Ministry of
Finance, said that the bank will provide support for the
renovation of Beijing's fourth-ring road, the renovation of the
city's electricity network and a waste water treatment project.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed gratitude to Hope for the bank's support in the
city's public facilities construction, environmental protection
and housing projects over the past five years. He said that the
bank's aids played a positive role in helping Beijing accomplish
the aims of its Eighth Five-Year Plan.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Beijing will continue to import advanced
technology, equipment and loans in the future. He reaffirmed that
the city will not divert loans from abroad for other use, but will
use them strictly as prescribed in the contracts.
</P>
<P>
Hope attended two seminars in Beijing, one on external debts
and another on the reform of state-owned enterprises. He will also
be carrying out a study on China's financial reform and the reform
of state-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Upgrade Tornado Fighter Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The British Defense Ministry has
decided to upgrade the Tornado F-3 fighter jets, abandoning its
original plan to lease F-16 fighters from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The ministry would upgrade up to 100 Tornado planes at a cost
of 125 million pounds (188 million U.S. dollars) to plug the gap
until the Eurofighters are ready to take over early next century,
Minister for Defense Procurement James Arbuthnot announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"A contract will be placed with the British Aerospace to
upgrade the principal fighters of the Royal Air Force to make them
capable of carrying advanced medium-range and short-range
air-to-air missiles," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Together with radar improvement and joint tactical information
distribution system, this upgrade will greatly enhance the
capability of the Tornado F-3 planes," he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the original leasing plan, the ministry would spend
600,000 pounds (900,000 dollars) every year on each F-16 fighter
plane.
</P>
<P>
The British Aerospace and its sub-contractors had strongly
opposed to the plan, which could force them to cut some 5,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Major has reportedly intervened personally
to stop the leasing plan.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The central government
solicits views from the economic community and non-Communist
parties before it makes or implements major policies and reform
plans.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made by Li Yining, an economics professor who
has just been made a vice-chairman of China Democratic League, at
a press conference organized by the ongoing session of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) this morning.
</P>
<P>
Three other newly-elected leaders of non-Communist
parties also briefed Chinese and foreign journalists on the role
played by China's non-Communist parties.
</P>
<P>
Li said he personally participated in the formulation of the
draft Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) for National Economic and
Social Development and Long-Term Goals for the Year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The league's Economic Committee, of which Li is a deputy
director, has submitted to central government departments a number
of reports and proposals on reform of state-owned enterprises,
balancing local government budgets and curbing inflation, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xuan, a vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Jiu
San Society, which is composed mainly of intellectuals, said his
experience in converting research results into high-tech
industries has enabled him to better participate in deliberations
on and administration of state affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The Jiu San Society can play an active role in revitalizing
China through science and technology," said Wang, who is also an
academic of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a professor of the
prestigious Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Siwei, a vice-chairman of China Democratic National
Construction Association and a vice-minister of chemical industry,
said, as a government official as well as a leader of a party, he
has always dealt with criticisms and proposals raised by members
of the CPPCC National Committee in an earnest manner.
</P>
<P>
"I try hard to resolve problems or explain things if
resolution of problems is impossible," he said.
</P>
<P>
When he himself raises criticisms and proposals, he said, he
always does as much research as possible beforehand to make them
reasonable and practical, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Huanxi, a vice-chairman of the Central Committee of China
Association for Promoting Democracy, has been recently elected
vice-governor of Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Born into a family of teachers, he said, he has had no
influential connections. He explained why he can have become a
vice provincial governor.
</P>
<P>
"The system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation
under the leadership of the Communist Party has provided a
precondition for my growth.
</P>
<P>
"The policy of promoting young people with professional
knowledge in this era of reforms has given me opportunities.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate has ratified
the Bicameral Conference Committee report on the bill prescribing
lethal injection as the means of carrying out the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
The bill was approved with 16 affirmative votes, two negative
votes and five abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the death penalty through lethal injection will
start to take effect between March 1997 and October 1997.
</P>
<P>
The measure was passed to provide the means of execution for
death convicts, considering that the electric chair originally
prescribed under the Death Penalty Law is not available in the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to penal experts, administering lethal injection is
less costly than constructing a new electric chair to executive
death convicts.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Runoff Scheduled For March 18 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The presidential runoff in
Sierra Leone originally scheduled for March 15 will now take
place on March 18, informed sources in the Interim National
Electoral Commission (INEC) said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
''We are plagued with logistical problems ranging from the
arrival of the ballot papers (from London), the inclusion of some
130,000 names of refugees in Guinea and Liberia to the use of the
indelible ink from India,'' one of the source said.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Sierra Leonean Head of State Julius Maada
Bio late Monday, the INEC Chairman James Jonah spoke of ''great
concerns of the commission in conducting the runoff elections on
March 15.''
</P>
<P>
According to state radio, Jonah said the printing of the
ballot papers will ''definitely require time.''
</P>
<P>
He said that voters who had lost their registration cards will
be allowed to use their ID cards including passports or drivers
licence.
</P>
<P>
Jonah said that 30,000 eligible voters, who are now refugees
in Liberia and 100,000 in Guinea, will be registered on Friday by
INEC officials.
</P>
<P>
The refugees were not registered for the February 26 and 27
elections because clearance were not given by the Guinean and
Liberian governments for the exercise to take off.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, pressure continues to mount for the runoff election
to be cancelled and a coalition government put in place.
</P>
<P>
Catholic priests in the south yesterday issued a communique
appealing to Bio ''to avert'' a runoff.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued by the Vicar General of the Catholic
Archdiocese, Rev Father Simon Gbondo,said: ''The cancellation is
necessary in view of renewed threat by the RUF to disrupt the
coming elections.''
</P>
<P>
There has been an increase in rebel attacks in the north and
south of the country in the past 24 hours, according to reports
reaching the capital early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At least 20 people died after RUF rebels attacked seven towns
and villages at Buya Romende Chiefdom, 122 kilometres from the
capital on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Sees 261 Million Dollar Surplus In December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA PUMPUR, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today announced that
it recorded a trade surplus of 653 million Malaysian ringgit
(about 261 million US dollars) for December 1995, compared with a
trade deficit of 40 million ringgit (about 16 million dollars) in
November 1995.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Anwar
Ibrahim in releasing the trade figures here today said the
improved performance for December was due to slowing down of
imports which grew only 10.5 percent while exports grew 20.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said for the whole of 1995, Malaysia recorded a trade
deficit of 9.2 billion ringgit (about 3.68 billion dollars)
compared with a deficit of 9.8 billion ringgit (about 3.92 billion
dollars) in the first 11 months of last year, and 9.6 billion
ringgit (about 3.84 billion dollars) in the Treasury's 1995/96
Economic Report.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who read from a prepared text, did not provide details
about the total export and import for 1995, but he said for the
whole of 1995, average import growth was 24.8 percent and export
growth was 20.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the improved overall trade situation would provide a
positive effect to the current account of the country's balance of
payment.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, Malaysia's current account
deficit reached 18.1 billion ringgit (about 7.24 billion dollars)
at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Anwar said the government would continue to closely
monitor the balance of payment situation to ensure the country's
external balance was strong and sustainable.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Rejects PNA Officials' Accusations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has rejected accusations by
some Palestinian officials that Jordan was not doing enough to
curb the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), which has claimed
responsibility for recent bombing attacks in Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Tuesday, Awad Khleifat, Minister of
Interior, broke official silence by dismissing as unacceptable a
statement made by Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath.
</P>
<P>
Shaath has reportedly said that the "instructions given to
military wings of the Islamic groups, Islamic Jihad and Hamas,
always came from outside," and that Jordan is where "the historic
leadership of Hamas resides."
</P>
<P>
Khleifat, who returned home Tuesday after delivering a letter
from King Hussein to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, said that
members belonging to Hamas in Jordan "are Jordanians who have no
relation with terrorism or whatever is happening in Israel or the
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Shaath attended the meeting he had with Arafat in
Gaza and heard "Jordan's condemnation of all forms of terror."
</P>
<P>
"We will not accept any responsibility for such acts under any
circumstance," said Khleifat.
</P>
<P>
He described Ibrahim Ghosheh and Mohammad Nazzal, the two
Jordanian spokesmen for the Islamic Movement Hamas in Amman, as
Jordanian citizens who act in a peaceful manner and are subject to
Jordanian laws.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot possibly deport Jordanian citizens, that's against
the law," he argued.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, acting Minister of Information Mohammad Daoudiyeh
expressed regret at Shaath's statement and described it as
"completely unfair."
</P>
<P>
In an apparent reference to the PNA, he said that Jordan would
not shoulder the responsibility of others to stem violence in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
A well-informed Jordanian official said that the presence of a
Hamas press office in Jordan was not or should not be a point of
contention between the PNA and the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials said here that they are maintaining silence
over accusations against Jordan because Jordan does not in any
way want to undermine the authority and credibility of the
elected Palestinian leadership.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti reiterated prior to his
departure to New York today that the kingdom would cooperate and
coordinate with Israel and all parties concerned on means to fight
against "regional terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said Jordan will support Egyptian efforts
to convene a regional conference that would deal with terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti pledged that his government would not hesitate in
taking any action against any organization in the kingdom that
Jordan thought was involved in any terrorist activities in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Minister On Transfer Of Technology From Developed Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 6 (Xinhua) --The lack of maintenance on
the side of the third world nations has led to the failure of smooth
transfer of technology from the industrialized countries,reported
the local press today quoting a Tanzanian minister.
</P>
<P>
Opening a workshop on maintenance culture for sustainable
development in Tanzania held in Arusha yesterday, Minister for
Science, Technology and Higher Education Jackson Makweta
said such a hindrance was a major setback to the stimulation of
economic development in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Lack of maintenance of the different technological inputs,
which were transferred to the Third World including Tanzania,
has led to dilapidated highways and machinery, which has been
left to rot away after serving for less than its usual life
span," he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking of the attitudes of the people, which
always talk about buying new equipment and not maintaining the
old ones, the minister said such an outlook was disastrous as it
has a far reaching impact on the facilities.
</P>
<P>
He said that neglecting of existing facilities also reduce the
physical production capacity of the economy.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of such capacity minimization, productivity in
many of the facilities is reduced and in some cases production of
goods and provision of vital services has completely stopped," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Makweta appealed to the people to change attitudes and
instill a culture of maintenance as part of the community's life.
</P>
<P>
He assured participants that the government of the day was
committed to development of maintenance capacity as a means and
strategy for achieving sustainable development.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Mayor Refers Development over Revolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Tehran's liberal mayor
Gholamhossein Karbaschi said today that domestic development, and
not exportation of Islamic Revolution, should be the main aim of
any future government.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that his group known as G-6 would
focus on development in a bid to "remove the structural problems"
facing the Iranian nation.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi, a former seminary student, told reporters that
there was no need to export the Islamic Revolution to other
countries.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Revolution of Iran itself was not imported. It
emerged on the scene from the Islamic ideas in Iran," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the principles of Islam are clarified, then the people
around the world would be attracted to Islam," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now if you want to call that an exportation of revolution,
that's fine. But ideas are not goods that can be exported. They
emerge from the context of the society and from among the people
themselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Karbaschi's view is much different
as compared with most of clergies who insist in principles of
Islamic Revolution and opposition to relations with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
They believed that the Tehran mayor holds pragmatic stands
to both domestic and foreign policies. Thus, he is popular among
the people and becomes the target of various kinds of attack from
the conservative and ruling clergies.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi is one of the six members of the liberal group known
as G-6, which has vowed to end the rule of conservative Society
of Combatant Clergy (SCC) in Iran's parliament known as Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Known as a can-do mayor who has turned Iran's war-torn capital
into a modern city with crisscrossing highways and public
services, Karbaschi has emerged as G-6 ideologue.
</P>
<P>
He is said to be planning to run for the presidential
elections of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Today, he did not deny that he was planning to run for
presidency but he said that he had to abide by the laws that
required people to declare their candidacy only two months before
the elections.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had any "intention" to run, he said "Call me two
months before the elections and I will tell you."
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, he admitted that the capital city of
Tehran faced with such problems as overpopulation, lack of
sufficient public services, air pollution, ecological problems,
unemployment and housing shortage.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi stressed that privatization was one of the means to
achieve development. But he regretted the absence of a viable,
production-oriented private sector in Iran.

<HEADLINE> Advisor Urges Early Start of Water-Diversion Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Preparatory work for a huge
project to divert water from the country's south to north should
be stepped up, a member of China's top advisory body said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The project was proposed by Premier Li Peng as part of a plan
for national economic development in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The project is to divert water from three places along the upper,
middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River to northern and
northwestern China.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to divert 40 billion cubic meters of
water each year, about half of the total flow of the Yangtze
River, according to a plan for the project.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xuejun, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, urges an early start
of the western route of the project, which will divert water from
the Tongtianhe, Yalongjiang and Daduhe rivers, tributaries of the
Yangtze River, to the upper reaches of the Yellow River, China's
second largest. Investigations on this route was first started in
1952.
</P>
<P>
"Field inspections and researches have shown that the western
route is technically feasible," said Chen, who is also a
vice-chairman the Central Committee of the Jiu San Society,
a non-communist party.
</P>
<P>
Chen, also a professor of Xi'an Jiaotong University, said that
water diversion along this route will bring great economic
benefits to Gansu and Shaanxi provinces and the Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region in the northwest, and to northern Shanxi
Province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region -- areas that have
long been plagued by water shortages.
</P>
<P>
The route is expected to divert 10-20 billion cubic meters of
water to the Yellow River a year, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that a coordinating agency be established to tackle
the issue of raising funds for the western route project.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Install New Power Generating Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Macao is to install a set of new
power engines this year to improve its power generating capacity
to 366 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
Custodio Miguens, chairman of the board of directors of the
Macao Electricity Co. Ltd., announced that a new generating unit
will be installed soon this year.
</P>
<P>
But he said that other new plant will not be built until the
year 2000 because the growth rate of power consumption has slowed
down over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
The consumption of electricity in Macao totaled more than one
billion kilowatt-hours last year, among which 12 percent was
imported from China's mainland. The consumption was an increase
of 4.6 percent from that of the previous year, the lowest rate
since 1964.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the average increase rate of power
consumption topped 10 percent. In 1993, the consumption ever rose
14.6 percent from that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The drop in the consumption of power was mainly the result of a
declining economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the chairman said his company will continue to
import power from the mainland although new power plants will be
built in Macao.

<HEADLINE> UNFPA Official Issues Statement on International Women's Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The International Women's Day,
March 8, '96, provides a unique opportunity to commit oneself to
the women's empowerment and gender equality, said Dr. Nafis Sadik,
executive director of the United Nations Fund for Population
Activities (UNFPA) here today.
</P>
<P>
In her statement on the occasion of Women's Day, Dr. Sadik
re-iterated the goals and recommendations adopted at the
International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) and
the Fourth World Conference on Women (FWCW) and the responsibility
for the women all over the world.
</P>
<P>
"The road to women's empowerment starts with the road to health
particularly reproductive health," she said.
</P>
<P>
Thus a life circle approach should be taken with respect to
women's health. Women should be able to have the information and
services they need to bear and bring up their children in health
and safety, she said.
</P>
<P>
The human rights of women include their sexual rights -- to
have control over and decide on matters related to their sexuality
including sexual and reproductive health free from coercion,
discrimination and violence, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
She called on both governmental and non-governmental
organizations and institutions as well as international
organizations to contribute to the implementation of the women's
empowerment and gender equality agenda, provided by the Beijing
Platform for Action at the FWCW.
</P>
<P>
She announced that UNFPA will continue to collaborate, within
its mandate, with all relevant partners, both within U.N. system
and outside it, to meet the needs of individual men and women and
to make the contract with the world's women a reality.
</P>
<P>
She said that UNFPA is fine-tuning its policies to make them
more gender sensitive so that gender concerns can be mainstreamed
into population and development policies and programs, and UNFPA's
collaboration with non-governmental organizations can be
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
UNFPA is providing reproductive health information and services
to men and women in the context of primary health care, and
advocating for the promotion of universally accepted human rights
including reproductive rights, for education of girls and the
elimination of traditional practices that are harmful to the
health of women and girls, she said.

<HEADLINE> Donors To Start Disbursing Funds To Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Donor countries and
agencies can start disbursing committed aid funds for Tanzania
suspended since late 1994, after the country clinched an
agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Dar es
Salaam, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tha position was expressed by the IMF Deputy Director for
Africa, Goodall Gondwe here on Tuesday just before he left the
country, after having led the IMF delegation in decisive talks
with the new Tanzanian government for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
"I have held some talks with members of the donor community
yesterday, who have said they will start disbursing some of the
aid they have frozen for Tanzania immediately," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Donor countries have usually reaffirmed the view that they
would only resume aid to the country after an agreement was
reached with the IMF. They complained that the Tanzanian
government had failed in collecting taxes, mainly import duties,
estimated at about 125 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The IMF wanted guidance about various aspects of fiscality,
and found the views of the government quite encouraging, which
permitted the IMF to expect that the country's financial
situation should improve in the near future, he said. "This is
not only my view but the institution's point of view, too,"
Ggondwe stressed.
</P>
<P>
His overall impression of the government's course of action in
meetings with President Benjamin Mkapa and Prime Minister Frederick
Sumaye, was absolutely impressive, he said. "The two have an
appropriate agenda for the country's economic growth which, given
time, will improve a lot," the IMF official added.

DAR ES SALAAM, March 6 (Xinhua) --The Tanzanian Government has
obtained funds from Japan and the Food Agricultural Organisation
(FAO) for locust control campaigns in the country which will
start later this week.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister for Agriculture, Livestock Development and
Co-operatives Paul Kimiti said on Tuesday that Japan has donated
about 0.23 million US dollars while FAO provided to Tanzania 0.4
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said regions of Kigoma, Rukwa, Dodoma, Singida and Tabora
had been invaded by locusts, among them, Dodoma was the most
affected.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Mr. Peter Spurgen, a specialist in
locust spraying chemical, has been assigned by FAO to assist in
chemical usage.
</P>
<P>
Other assistance in the exercise is expected to come from the
International Red Locusts Control Organization for Central and
Southern Africa and the Desert Locusts Organization for Eastern
Africa in which Tanzania is a member.
</P>
<P>
"Locusts are very dangerous insects. They can destroy about
80,000 tonnes of grains a day", kimiti warned. He called for
concerted efforts of the Tanzanians to control the insects.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Foreign Banks in Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- All of the eleven foreign-funded
banks operating in this port city in north China have made
profits, which totalled eight million US dollars, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"It shows that foreign-funded banks here can not only earn
profits but have large room for further development," said an
official with the local branch of the People's Bank of China, the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year Tianjin hosted 22 foreign-funded
financial institutions, including 11 branches and six
representative offices of foreign banks, and five representative
offices of foreign insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
The foreign bank branches had 1.12 billion US dollars in
assets, and provided 790 million US dollars in loans for more than
400 foreign-funded firms.
</P>
<P>
The foreign banks harvested satisfactory profits because
Tianjin has nearly 10,000 foreign-funded enterprises with
investment topping ten billion US dollars, explained the official
with the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Last year four overseas insurers, including the Transamerica
Life Insurance Co. Ltd and the John Hancock Insurance Co. Ltd,
both from the United States, opened representative offices here.
</P>
<P>
"A traditional financial center in north China and an economic
hub of the Bohai Sea region, Tianjin has strengthened exchange and
co-operation with foreign financial institutions," said the bank
official.
</P>
<P>
Many other overseas financial institutions are satisfied with
Tianjin's investment environment and financial advantages and have
expressed the intention to set up branches or representative
offices here.

LUSAKA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The zambian government has denied
that ruling party cadres were being recruited into the police
force in readiness for the general and presidential elections
late this year, "Zambia Daily Mail" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister Chitalu Sampa was quoted as saying that
only grade 12 school leavers would be selected into the force on
merit.
</P>
<P>
The government would not make similar mistakes committed by
the previous regime, Sampa said.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties claimed here at the weekend that
recruitment of cadres of the ruling Movement for Multi-party
Democracy (MMD) into police would likely to bring chaos in the
country during the elections.
</P>
<P>
Sampa said the government was re-organizing the police force
so that it could deal with criminals of all sorts, especially
during the election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that the police would not leave any stone
unturned in their fight against sophisticated criminals.
</P>
<P>
Zambia police plans to increase its members from 8,000 to
10,000 by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Emerges as China's Major Nonferrous Metals Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region is able to turn out 200,000 tons of copper,
lead, zinc, nickel, aluminum, magnesium, titanium, antimony, tin,
and mercury annually, with a total output value surpassing three
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The region has emerged as a national major nonferrous metals
producer, with 101 kinds of mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the region put more efforts into deep
processing of aluminum, tin, antimony and zinc, and raised money
through many channels to set up a group of key enterprises which
boast a series of new technologies in ore mining, dressing,
smelting and processing.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 the region ranked second in the country in the output
of nonferrous metals.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the government's support, the Dachang Mining Industry
Bureau has become the nation's biggest tin producer, capable of
mining and dressing two million tons of ore, and smelting 16,000
tons of fine tin and 3,000 tons of lead and antimony annually.
</P>
<P>
The bureau is expected to become a large group company by the
year 2000, with annual total industrial output value exceeding
three billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Pingguo Aluminum Company, China's largest aluminum base,
has completed its first phase of construction, involving more than
four billion yuan in investment.
</P>
<P>
Importing technologies and equipment from about ten developed
countries, Pingguo is expected to have an annual production
capacity of 1.2 million tons of alumina oxide, 500,000 tons of
electrolytic aluminum, 2.5 million tons of fine aluminum ore, and
300,000 tons of aluminum products after completing its all
construction plans.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Slow Down Privatization Process, Leader Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia will slow down its
privatization process and readjust its privatization policy this
year, said Deputy Premier Alexandr Kazakov today.
</P>
<P>
However, the slowdown doesn't mean that Russia is going to
abandon its policy to privatize the economy, the deputy premier
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
What the government is up to is to be more cautious in
privatizing enterprises in order to avert serious mistakes, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He criticized former First Deputy Premier Anatoly Chubais for
deciding to distribute half of the shares of enterprises to their
employees, saying that the decision is the "source of all crimes."
</P>
<P>
Most of the shares proved to have passed into the hands of
illegal speculators, Kazakov said.
</P>
<P>
Kazakov also said that he was opposed to taking privatization
as a means of increasing national revenue. Instead, the money
should be used for investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kazakov, together with First Deputy Premier Vladimir
Kadannikov, took over privatization affairs from the hands of
Chubais after he was sacked by President Boris Yeltsin on January
16.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania To Form Task Force On Women's Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
will form a task force to look for ways of improving the social
and economic status of women in the country.
</P>
<P>
This was said here on Tuesday by the Vice-President, Omar Juma
when inaugurating the Women's Week at Msimbazi Social Center.
</P>
<P>
Juma said the government was fully informed of the problems
hindering women's efforts to improve their status.
</P>
<P>
He said such vices included lack of capital, technology and
markets while some women, citing the "Mama ntiliie" (women food
vendors), were harassed by urban authorities.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot overlook the contribution of women to national
development", said the Vice-President. He stressed women deserved
unreserved support from the government.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that his office was fully committed to support women
in their efforts to emancipate themselves.
</P>
<P>
Juma underscored small scale industries as ventures which
could be supported by the government to alleviate poverty and
unemployment among women.
</P>
<P>
He added that this called for concerted efforts by the
government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as well as
individuals.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Minister for Community Development, Women Affairs
and Children, Ms. Mary Nagu said several laws would be reformed
to empower women.
</P>
<P>
Such legislations included the Marriage Act and those
governing custody of children in case of separation. Ms. Nagu
said the law of inheritance would also be amended.
</P>
<P>
She also said plans were on the drawing boards to enact a law
which would enable women to own land to improve their economic
status.
</P>
<P>
Between 10 and 20 percent of community development budget would
be pumped into a special credit facility fund to provide women with
soft loans, She Added.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Nagu pointed out the level of women participation in
decision-making would be improved by ensuring that they hold 30
percent of all positions from wards to national level.

<HEADLINE> Iran Refutes US-Israeli Allegations on Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran today once again strongly
rejected allegations concerning Iranian involvement of any bombing
incidents in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA today published the second
statement by the Iranian Permanent Mission to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister for International
and Legal Affairs, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said "Iran categorically
denies any link with or involvement of any sort in these or
similar incidents, and rejects in the strongest terms Israel's
irresponsible and reckless accusations."
</P>
<P>
Today's statement by the Iranian mission said "the
U.S. Secretary of State (Warren Christopher) echoed the very same
baseless allegations which the Israeli officials had earlier
leveled against Iran in connection with the recent incidents in
Palestine."
</P>
<P>
Iran has consistently denounced all acts of violence against
innocent people irrespective of the nationality or beliefs of the
victims or the perpetrators, it added.
</P>
<P>
"This policy has been invariably stated and upheld by the
highest officials in the Islamic Republic of Iran as a matter of
unwavering principal," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
However, it noted, the U.S. secretary of state finds it
convenient to exploit the public sentiments created by the recent
incidents to advance the ill-conceived and ill-fated U.S. policy
of hostility toward Iran.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Erupts in Chechen Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Fighting broke out today between
Chechen rebels and Russian troops in central Grozny, the Chechen
capital, one day before Russia's powerful Security Council is to
meet Thursday on a peace plan for the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
The rebels took five Chechen policemen hostage after 130
secessionist guerrillas had attacked on several fronts, the
Itar-TASS news agency reported, quoting officials of the
pro-Russian Interior Ministry in Grozny as saying.
</P>
<P>
The fighting was concentrated in the center of the capital
city, along the river Sunzha near the seat of Presidential Palace,
which was destroyed by Russian troops last month.
</P>
<P>
In another development, about 1,000 people fled from a Chechen
village in Sernovodsk, about 45 kilometers west of the Chechen
capital city, through a safety corridor, Interfax news agency said
today. The village has been besieged and shelled by Russian troops
since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 Chechen refugees have fled to Ingushetia
since Russian troops stormed into the breakaway republic in
December 1994 to quell its three-year independence bid.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yelstin has been meeting with senior
officials to try to work out a strategy for Chechnya before a
Thursday session of Russia's powerful Security Council discusses a
peace plan for Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president has openly ruled out two possibilities,
namely a withdrawal of troops or massive use of force to crush the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Fighting in Chechnya has intensified this year as pressure
grows on the Kremlin to solve the issue before a presidential
election in June, in which Yeltsin is seeking a second term.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Denies Arrest of Government Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Tehran mayor today rejected
allegations by the powerful Guardians Council that some government
officials have been arrested in a bid to undermine the liberals
backed by Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Gholamhossein Karbaschi, said at a press conference held at
Tehran Municipal Building, that only the private contractors were
arrested for violating election campaign laws governing March 8th
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
"Only some of the private contractors involved in advertising
around the city were arrested," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Supervisory Committees under the conservative
Guardian Council, announced on Sunday that it arrested a number of
government officials for violating election laws.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Supervisory Committee, Gholamreza Rezvani,
was quoted by the official news agency IRNA as saying that
officials were charged with abusing their authority in favor of a
certain groups.
</P>
<P>
However, the report gave no details about how many people were
arrested or their identities.
</P>
<P>
As Iran is approaching Friday elections, the election campaign
has reached its climax. The streets and squares in cities are
decked with numerous banners and posters. The liberal camp and
the conservative camp are going for each other's jugular.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi is one of the six members of the liberal group known
as G-6, which has vowed to end the rule of conservative Society of
Combatant Clergy (SCC) in Iran's parliament known as Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Known as a mayor who has turned Iran's war-torn capital into a
modern city with crisscrossing highways and public services,
Karbaschi has emerged as G-6 ideologue. He is said to be planning
to run for the presidential elections of 1997.
</P>
<P>
He did not deny that he was planning to run for presidency but
he said that he had to abide by the laws that required people to
declare their candidacy only two months before the elections.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had any "intention" to run, he said "Call me two
months before the elections and I will tell you."
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi has come under fire by the conservative politicians
for trying to turn Tehran into a secular city.
</P>
<P>
Assadollah Badamchian, a theoretician of SCC, told Xinhua that
Karbaschi led the move toward Westernization in the capital
city. He said that Karbaschi's plan for Tehran was not in harmony
with the traditional Islamic values.
</P>
<P>
Another SCC ideologue, the influential Ayatollah Mohammad Reza
Mahdavi Kani, has attacked the establishment of cultural centers
around the city by the municipality, charging that cultural
centers were meant as rivals for the mosques where clergies rule
supreme.
</P>
<P>
An informed source told Xinhua that Karbaschi planned to lead
G-6 even though the group was formed originally to support the
development programs initiated by Rafsanjani, Iran's moderate
president.
</P>
<P>
"As his role becomes more prominent in the G-6, Karbaschi
will come under more attack for his ideas, plans and what he has
already done for Tehran," said the source.
</P>
<P>
During the press conference today, Karbaschi dissociated
himself from any secular group, saying that he only supported the
rule of law.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would condemn the action of the security
forces Tuesday in forcing the opposition group, Freedom Movement
of Iran (FMI), to cancel its press conference.
</P>
<P>
"If the said group (FMI) had the permission to hold elections,
I condemn the disruption caused," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized both the extremist right-wing groups and
even opposition groups for taking the law into their own hands.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn any group that wants to trample the law and
disrupt the social order," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gholam Hussein Bolandian, the deputy interior minister for
security affairs, explained that the main reason for cancellation
of the press conference by the FMI was that the meeting was
illegal and the FMI was an outlawed group.

<HEADLINE> Commentary Lashes Lee's "Independence" Speeches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A commentary released by Xinhua
News Agency today condemns Lee Teng-Hui's ulterior motive of
separating Taiwan from China under the cloak of "popular
sovereignty".
</P>
<P>
The commentary points out that Lee played his two-faced
tactics, which he is well known for, again on the eve of Taiwan's
leadership change. He is worming his way into the Taiwan people's
trust under the banner of "democracy", and trying to conceal his
pro-independence stance, labelled "two Chinas" or "one China, one
Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
In his latest election speeches Lee made a reckless explanation
of the idea of "popular sovereignty", which was first proposed by
Sun Yat-sen, founder of the Republic of China. Lee boasted in
every corner of the island that he was "working with all my might"
for Taiwan's democracy.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that Lee's new fondness for "popular
sovereignty" is actually driven by the urgency to gloss over his
separatist activities, and to stress Taiwan's "political entity
supported by the people's will". Under the camouflage of "popular
sovereignty", which can eventually evolve into "Taiwan's
sovereignty held by Taiwanese" as Lee wishes to see, a nation with
sovereignty can be created in Taiwan, while denying the fact that
the island is a part of China.
</P>
<P>
Lee's frequent stress on "popular sovereignty" is his way of
seeking foreign support by touting a "two Chinas" or "one China,
one Taiwan" policy, the commentary says. By this means he hopes
to escalate the "Taiwan independence tendency" to a dominant
position in the island, according to the commentary.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four decades, the Chinese government and people
have consistently given unswerving support for the Taiwan people's
struggle against dictatorship and pursuit of democracy, and highly
respected their demand for political democracy, the commentary
notes.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that what the Chinese Government and people
oppose is Lee's attempt to create a new dictatorship through the
"reform toward constitutional politics," and his advocacy of the
"Taiwan independence movement".

<HEADLINE> Chinese Copyright Violator to Be Punished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The State Copyright Administration
announced here today that it has decided to punish a publishing
house that has violated the copyright of Chinese translators.
</P>
<P>
The violator is the Inspection Publishing House, according to a
spokesman of the administration.
</P>
<P>
Last December the publishing house published a three-volume
translation of the collected works of French writer Jean-Paul
Sartre, without the copyright authorization for publishing it.
</P>
<P>
According to China's copyright law and relevant regulations,
the publishing house must destroy the pirated books at once. And
it will be fined 50,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Copyright Administration has asked Chinese publishing
houses to find out the real copyright owners when they compile and
publish books of collected works by Chinese or foreign
writers. And they must have the copyright contracts and
identification certificates from the true authors of each work.
</P>
<P>
"No publishing houses are allowed to publish products before
they obtain copyright authorizations," the spokesman said.

on agriculture and hard work to ensure a good harvest this year.
</P>
<P>
"State policies have long been set treating agriculture as top
priority for national economic development," said Jiang Chunyun, a
vice premier of the State Council, in charge of agriculture. "Now
is the time to implement these policies in real earnest."
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark at a panel discussion attended by
deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC), who come from
Shandong province. The deputies were examining China's

Jiang emphasized two changes that are necessary to further
boost agricultural production. One is to improve services for
farmers, in particular the establishment of markets and sales
channels for farm produce. The other is to enhance economic
returns and productivity in the farming sector through progresses
in science and technology.

The Australian dollar rose to 76.32 US cents from 75.88

The possible issue of the dual currency bond will boost demand for

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia To Introduce Great Amounts of Overseas Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Inner Mongolia, north China, will
have used a total of six billion US dollars in actual overseas
investment, and its annual trade volume is expected to reach two
billion US dollars by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>

overseas capital with an agreed investment of 1.53 billion US
dollars during the 1991-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
The region will build more exports processing bases, and

Uliji said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang Fengqi, vice-chairman of the regional
government, noted that with its abundant natural resources, Inner
Mongolia has great potentials in the development of raw material
industry.
</P>
<P>
The region will achieve the goal of drawing in a total of six

<HEADLINE> Israel Clamps Curfew on 465 Palestinian Villages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli forces have blockaded
465 Palestinian villages and sealed off Palestinian-ruled cities
in the West Bank, putting 1.2 million Palestinians under virtual
siege, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the new security measures which have been
implemented throughout Israel following Monday's suicide bombing
attack in Tel Aviv, which killed at least 13 people and wounded
more than 100 others.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army Tuesday launched an intensive hunt for Moslem
extremists, rounding up over a hundred Hamas activists in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
"The army also sealed off eight homes of terrorists, including
the home of Yihye Ayyash, 'The Engineer,' in the village of Rafat
near the West Bank town of Hebron," said the radio.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Peres announced, after a special cabinet meeting of
the Israeli government following the suicide attack in Tel Aviv,
that a number of new security measures were going to be
implemented.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the cabinet's decision, 500 additional
soldiers were brought into Jerusalem Tuesday to reinforce the
1,000 troops deployed in the city on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there had been 400 extra policemen and 300 soldiers
in Tel Aviv, and more police and civil guard volunteers had been
placed in Haifa and other major cities.
</P>
<P>
There is also a ban on employing Palestinian workers in Israel
and on Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,
Israelis and Palestinians caught defying these orders will be
severely punished.
</P>
<P>
Peres also had announced that Israel is at a total war with
Hamas after the Islamic Resistance Movement claimed
responsibility for a series of five suicide attacks against
Israeli targets in eight days, which left more than 50 dead and
150 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Izzadin Kassam, the armed wing of Hamas, issued a
statement in Gaza offering to suspend attacks against Jews until
July, but warned that suicide attacks could resume if Israel
maintains its attacks on Hamas.
</P>
<P>
The statement came several hours after Hamas leaders in Gaza
gave a press conference demanding an end to the attacks "until a
position can be developed for serving our people."
</P>
<P>
However, a senior security source said Tuesday night that
police and security services had received intelligence information
that Hamas is planning additional attacks in heavily populated
areas in Israeli cities over the next few days.

<P>
JERUSALEM, March 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. shipment of hi-tech
bomb-detection devices arrived in Israel this morning.
</P>
<P>
Maj.-Gen. Yigal Pressler, Prime Minister's Advisor on
Terrorism, was on hand at the Ben-Gurion Airport to welcome
U.S. specialists accompanying the equipment.
</P>
<P>
Pressler said the hardware will aid efforts to detect
terrorist explosives.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton dispatched a U.S. Air Force plane
to transport the equipment to Israel.
</P>
<P>
The shipment was one of four steps the White House announced
following a meeting of national security officials Monday evening
to formulate a response to the Jerusalem and Tel Aviv bombings.
</P>
<P>
The shipment consists of seven explosive-detecting devices. A
senior U.S. official said in Washington that the U.S. initiated
the transfer several months ago but that the sides had been
bogged down by the question of payment. He added that the U.S. is
now paying for the equipment.
</P>
<P>
Additional equipment will be shipped on an "emergency basis"
later this week.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will also send anti-terrorism experts to offer
technical assistance to Israeli specialists, and is assembling a
"comprehensive package of training, technical assistance and
equipment" for improving anti-terrorism coordination among Israel,
the Palestinians and others in the region.

<HEADLINE> Noted Tibetan Figure Says He Lost Faith in Dalai Lama (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- "I have become disappointed with
the Dalai Lama," said, Lhalu Cewangdoje, a noted Tibetan figure
who has been the former's close associate, who is here attending
the on-going session of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Lhalu was born into an aristocratic Tibetan family, which had
brought forth two Dalai Lamas. And one of his four sons is a
reincarnated living Buddha.
</P>
<P>
The mere mention of the 14th Dalai Lama in exile abroad
disappointed people, Lhalu said with contempt, during an interview
with reporters at a hotel in Beijing's suburbs. "He is no match
for any Dalai Lamas in history. He does not behave like a
reincarnated living Buddha but is a stooge of the Westerners."
</P>
<P>
"I hope the central government can abrogate him if he goes on
turning his back on the motherland," he said.
</P>
<P>
Son of a high-ranking Tibetan official appointed by the Qing
emperor, Lhalu, who was adopted by the 12nd Dalai Lama clan, is a
legendary person serving as a minister in the old Tibetan local
government, then chief in charge of military and administrative
affairs for East Tibet. He was commander of rebelling troops in a
rebellion staged and led by the Dalai Lama in 1959.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 years later, however, the 83-year-old Lhalu became a
member of the CPPCC National Committee, China's top advisory body,
and vice-chairman of the Tibetan Regional People's People's
Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
In a hotel room in Beijing's southwest suburb, Lhalu, tall and
thin, was seen wearing a cashmere shirt with neckties. Speaking
the Tibetan language, he talks in a manner like a scholar.
</P>
<P>
In his childhood, Lhalu attended a private school at the foot
of the Potala Palace in Lhasa and then a school for children of
secular officials at Jokhang Monastery, one of the most important
Buddhist temples in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"In old Tibet, only sons of the aristocrats like me could go to
school," he said. "After the democratic reform in 1959, children
of commoners can go to school. Many people from the families of
the emancipated serfs have become skilled workers and even experts
upon graduation in different sectors in today's Tibet."
</P>
<P>
Lhalu was fortunate for not having followed the Dalai Lama to
go in exile. "I have witnessed great changes in people's life
after the peaceful liberation in 1951. In the past, the Tibetans
were deprived of any freedom and they lived in poverty. Since
1959, one million serfs stood up and become masters of their own
destiny," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has scored rapid economic growth with a prosperous market
and ample supply over the past decade, Lhalu said. He expressed
his particular satisfaction with the efforts by the central
government and other provinces and municipalities to help
construct 62 major projects in his home region after 1994. These
projects, he noted, are closely related to the locals' livelihood
and will bring remarkable economic benefits for Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The central government has time and again extend its welcome to
the Dalai to return and contribute to Tibet's development, he
said. "But over the past decades, however, the Dalai has been bent
on the activities to undermin the construction and development of
Tibet and disrupt the people's happy life."

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Economic Terms in Li Peng's Report Explained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- In his report on China's medium-
and long-term development programs at the current session of
the Eighth National People's Congress, Chinese Premier Li Peng
used some terms. Following is a brief explanation of them.
</P>
<P>
-- Three-step development strategy. China worked out a
three-step development strategy in the early 1980s to achieve the
country's modernization. The three steps are: to double the
country's 1980 per capita GNP in the first ten years of the
strategy's implementation with adequate food and clothing for the
people as the goal (first step), to redouble the doubled per
capita GNP by the end of the century (second step), and to achieve
modernizations by the middle of the next century (third step).
</P>
<P>
-- Comfortable-life housing project. In housing reform, the
state will offer financial assistance to workers and teachers with
difficulty in housing to ensure that each person will have a
living space of at least eight sq m. The project started in 1995
and will take five years to complelte.
</P>
<P>
-- System of provincial governors having responsibility for the
"rice bag". This means governors are held responsible for local
grain supplies.
</P>
<P>
-- System of mayors having responsibility for "the vegetable
basket". This means mayors must work hard to ensure adequate
supplies of meat, eggs, milk and vegetables for their respective
cities.

<P>
The provincial Science and Technology Committee has sent
scientific observation teams to Brazil, Peru, Mexico, Argentina,
Ecuador and other South American countries, and has signed
scientific co-operation contracts with those countries.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Fertilizer Prices Up Again In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Prices of locally manufactured
fertilizers in Zimbabwe shot up again yesterday, with prices of
compound fertilizers hiked by 14.8 percent and prices of
nitrogenous ones by 12.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time that fertilizer prices rose within a
year. fertilizer prices last went up in August last year when
prices of nitrogenous fertilizers were increased, barely four
months after a 47 percent hike which followed the deregulation of
prices in the industry.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the two fertilizer companies, Windmill and ZFC
limited, said yesterday the recent hikes which took effect from
yesterday, were necessitated by the ever increasing production
costs and devaluation of the Zimbabwe Dollar against major
currencies.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation of the Zimbabwe Dollar has caused an increase
in the cost of imported raw materials and spares for maintenance
of manufacturing plants.
</P>
<P>
Farmers have consistently complained about the hikes in
fertilizer prices which they say erode their viability. The
latest price increases come at a time when farmers are just
emerging from the drought and are still battling to get back to
full production.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Tightening up Laws Against Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The provincial and autonomous
regional governments in northwest China have taken effective steps
to tighten up laws against drug trafficking and crack down on the
crimes in time and severely.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995) a series of local
laws and regulations were worked out to cope with the new crime
trends in the northwestern provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu and
Qinghai, and the Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Each of the five governments has drawn up local regulations
against drug trafficking, and detailed punishments have also been
worked out to deal with various kinds of crimes.
</P>
<P>
Anti-drug departments have been established in governments at
various levels, and nearly 70 drug rehabilitation centers have
also been set up.
</P>
<P>
In addition, massive anti-drug publicity activities have also
been held widely, enhancing people's legal awareness and
encouraging them to participate in the anti-drug campaign.
</P>
<P>
The government of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region has allocated
440,000 yuan (about 53,000 US dollars) for anti-drug publicity
activities, and has produced massive publicity materials in three
languages, educating more than a million people.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The People's Construction Bank of
China (PCBC) organized 192.9 billion yuan, 68.5 percent more than
in 1994, for state key projects and enterprises last year.
</P>
<P>
One of China's four state commercial banks, the PCBC provided
20 billion yuan in loans in a timely manner to large and
medium-sized state projects and purchased 14.1 billion yuan in
financial debentures issued by state policy banks in 1995.
</P>
<P>
It paid back 9.1 billion yuan in re-lendings to the People's
Bank of China, bought nine billion yuan in financing bonds issued
by the central bank and underwrote 18.8 billion yuan in three-year
treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
To act in line with China's tight financial policies, the bank
has made more efforts to improve fund management. It raised
interest rates to encourage its branches to save surplus funds. At
the end of last year, the branches deposited 44.5 billion yuan,
24.8 billion more than at the beginning of the year, with the
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The PCBC has also strengthened its control over reserve
funds. In each city the PCBC branch opens only one capital account
in the local branch of the People's Bank of China for its
subsidiaries so that the reserve funds can be deposited in one
account and be used according to an overall plan. The move is
aimed at reducing the amount of idle funds and making better use
of capital.
</P>
<P>
At the same time the bank has hastened the clearance process to
effectively stop funds from being issued as loans or used by
businesses before they are remitted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's development must rely
on support from other areas in China, and it is ready to aid
less-developed areas to achieve common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai vice mayor Zhao Qizheng made the remarks here. He is
attending the ongoing session of the National People's Congress,
the Chinese parliament, which opened yesterday.
</P>
<P>
As the biggest commercial and industrial center in the
country, Shanghai enjoys great advantages in financial, talent,
management, and technological resources, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
The city intends to set up businesses in some less-developed
areas or transfer some plants with technical staff to these areas
to assist their economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The main thrust of Shanghai's economic expansion will be toward
areas along the Yangtze river, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will not threaten Hong Kong's status as a financial
center in Asia after the colony's return to the motherland, nor
does he wish to see its decline as a financial center, he said.
</P>
<P>
A relatively developed corridor in east and southeast Asia with
Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore as its major cities today
has a quarter of the world's total amount of foreign exchange
reserves and its economic growth averages six to seven percent
annually.
</P>
<P>
"These cities may well complement each other even while they
compete," he said. "Hong Kong's continued prosperity can only
benefit Shanghai."

<HEADLINE> Turkish Official Calls on Iraq, Syria for Tripartite Water Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish ambassador called for
tripartite water talks with neighboring Iraq and Syria and ruled
out such talks within the framework of the Arab League, a local
daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Daily News quoted Turkish Ambassador to Cairo
Yasar Yakis as saying that the tripartite talks should be direct,
rather than under the Arab League, to which Turkey is not a
member.
</P>
<P>
Yakis met Secretary General of the Arab League Esmat
Abdul-Meguid, who reportedly told Yakis that the Arab body wanted
Turkey to "make an agreement that would give a guarantee to Syria
for its water needs."
</P>
<P>
Syria and Iraq agreed in their talks in February to launch an
international campaign to force Turkey to accept "fair and
reasonable sharing" of the Euphrates river, which flows to Syria
and Iraq from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
They urged banks and firms to stop aiding the building of the
projects on the Euphrates.
</P>
<P>
Syria holds that Turkey's multi-billion-dollar plan for the
construction of several dams on the Euphrates has led to a sharp
decline in the flow of water to Syria which uses it for drinking
and irrigation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey says that Turkey, Iraq and Syria should first come
together for technical talks and work out the inventory for
respective land and water needs.

<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji
said here today that the Chinese government warmly welcomes and is
looking forward to Thai Prime Minister Banharn Silpa's China visit
later this month.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the visit will further the Sino-Thai
friendly ties in various fields, Zhu noted during his meeting with
his Thai counterpart Amnuay Virawan this morning.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay arrived here Tuesday to attend a seminar on Thai-Chinese
trade and investment sponsored by the Thai Embassy, which opened
here today. The Thai deputy prime minister addressed the seminar
earlier today.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting Zhu spoke highly of the development of
Sino-Thai relations, saying that the two-way trade has enjoyed
rapid development in recent years, and the frequent exchanges of
visits by senior leaders of two countries have spurred the
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The prospects for such relations are bright, he added.
</P>
<P>
Thailand made great contributions to the success of the first
Asia-Europe Meeting, which it hosted recently, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also briefed the visitor on China's Ninth Five-Year Plan
and development program to the year 2010, as well as the current

<HEADLINE> China Criticizes Lee Teng-hui's Deceptive Statements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Major Chinese newspapers today
carried a commentary by Tai Hai, which refutes Lee Teng-hui's
recent statements on relations across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that Lee's speeches on February 10 and
February 23 contained deceptive statements that pretended to be
willing to relax relations across the Straits.
</P>
<P>
In them, Lee said that if he were elected "president" of
Taiwan, he would "spare no effort to push forward" to "put an end
to hostilities across the Straits, sign a peace agreement between
the two sides to create a peaceful environment, and develop
relations of reciprocity and mutual prosperity". He also hinted
that there were "possibilities" for meetings between leaders of
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The commentary pointed out that Lee, without mentioning the
"one China" principle and reunification of the motherland,
intended to strengthen his stand on "two equal political entities"
and "Taiwan independence" in the name of "the Republic of China on
Taiwan". His idea is that of turning the current state across the
Straits into a permanent split.
</P>
<P>
Lee's statement ran counter to President Jiang Zemin's
statement on January 30 of last year, that negotiations on the
peaceful reunification should be conducted within the framework of
the "one China" principle. That is, ending of hostilities across
the Straits is aimed at peaceful reunification, but Lee took a
"divisive" stance to talk about "putting an end to hostilities"
and "reciprocity and mutual prosperity", attempting a peaceful
split.
</P>
<P>
The two views are completely different, and it's no wonder that
when Lee's words first appeared, some Hong Kong and Taiwan
newspapers pointed out that he was playing a trick in a move to
win votes without having any good intention.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on February 23, Lee noted that he would
"take the middle road, pursuing neither independence nor
reunification", and added that "it is very difficult" to talk
about reunification.
</P>
<P>
The commentary pointed to the fact that everyone knows that
it's in his nature to push for "de facto independence" in the name
of "the Republic of China on Taiwan", or an "independent Taiwan",
or "Taiwan's independence"; while "not pursuing reunification" is
his basic intention.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion in Taiwan and Hong Kong was that Lee knew the
"survival rule" very well, that is, that he could change in order
to protect himself when the situation turned unfavorable and when
it was favorable again, he could resume his original posture.
</P>
<P>
During the crucial "election" period, the commentary noted, Lee
changed his words from time to time to conceal his true self, but
his nature of dividing the country cannot change. These were a
result of his strategy, as he disclosed privately, of "a knife in
one hand, and candy in the other" in dealing with relations across
the Straits.
</P>
<P>
The commentary noted that Lee's deceitful actions are having
less and less of an effect.

<HEADLINE> Dole Sweeps Eight GOP Presidential Primaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole today swept Republican presidential primaries in eight states
and seized an overwhelming lead in the party's race to win
nomination for presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
U.S. television reports said tonight that 72-year-old Dole won
primaries in the states of Georgia, Vermont, Connecticut,
Maryland, Maine, Massachusetts, Colorado and Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
Dole's victories were all the more striking by their size. In
Maryland, Colorado, Connecticut, Vermont, and Rhode Island, Dole
won by 2-1 margins. In Maine and Massachusetts, his lead was
over 20 points. Only in Georgia, his lead was in the single digit.
</P>
<P>
"Tonight we have proven the Republican Party is not spinning
apart but coming together," Dole told a victory rally in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Today's results showed that the GOP voters had made a concerted
effort to stall U.S. columnist Pat Buchanan's extreme conservative
insurgency in the Republican presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Buchanan, who has been advocating trade protection and
"American First," won successive victories in earlier GOP's
primaries and caucuses last month.
</P>
<P>
But Buchanan later suffered repeated and unexpected defeats as
the GOP mainstream publicly denounced his extreme conservative
slogans.
</P>
<P>
Dole's margins were so overwhelming that his two lagging rivals
in the party -- former Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander and
Indiana Senator Dick Lugar -- were reportedly preparing to quit
the race on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> US Senate Approves Tougher Sanctions Against Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate today passed a
bill to tighten U.S. economic sanctions against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton bill, sponsored by Senate Foreign Relations
Committee Chairman Senator Jesse Helms and Representative Dan
Burton, is aimed specifically at driving foreign investors away
from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
A central provision would create a new legal right to allow
Cuban Americans to sue in U.S. federal courts companies doing
business on their property confiscated by the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
Another provision would deny entry into the United States of
foreigners who buy, sell or develop the expropriated property.
</P>
<P>
Canada and other countries with normal trade relations with
Cuba have strongly opposed the U.S. move.
</P>
<P>
After approval by the House of Representatives later this week,
the bill will be handed over to President Bill Clinton to sign.
</P>
<P>
Cuba downed two American civilian planes owned by Cuban exiles
in the U.S. on February 24. Havana has accused the United States
of violating the air space of that island country. Reports said all
four crew members were killed.

Clinton vowed to punish Cuba for the incident by tightening the
30-year-old embargo against the Caribbean country.

said would be made available to the press after it reached Hasina.
</P>
<P>
A BNP source disclosed that the letter contained Khaleda Zia's
proposal for a non-party government to supervise all future
elections, an invitation for talks to settle all matters relating
to such a government and proposal for another general election.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream opposition parties have launched a series of
movements across the country in protest against the BNP-dominated
February 15 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the government's move to ease the political tension,
Bhuiyan said some of the opposition leaders were released Tuesday
and the others would also be freed later.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties have rejected the dialogue proposal made
by BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia in her nation address Sunday but
said they would like to hold talks with President Abdur Rahman
Biswas on ways to resolve the prevailing political crisis.

YANGON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Former drug warlord Khun Sa is now
kept in a military security camp in Myanmar's capital city of
Yangon, two months after he surrendered to government troops at
his Homong headquarters in Shan state, according to well-informed
sources here today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister U Ohn Gyaw said last month that the government
would deal with Khun Sa according to Myanmar's law and practices,
stressing that Myanmar has no intention to extradite Khun Sa to
another country.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13,382 men of the Mong Tai Army under Khun Sa's

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia Defuse Poultry Trade Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Russia
have defused a potentially explosive trade dispute over U.S.
poultry exports to Russia.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Vice President Al Gore said today he had received
assurances from Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin that
Russia will continue to import U.S. poultry.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by the vice president's office, Gore
also said that the Russian prime minister confirmed that a
threatened stoppage of poultry imports from the U.S. beginning on
March 16 would not take place.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin's message was relayed to Gore through Russian
Economics Minister Yevgeny Yasin during a meeting at the White
House earlier in the day, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Russia, the number one export market for U.S. chicken parts,
purchased roughly 550 million U.S. dollars of poultry in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Russia threatened to stop imports last month because of deep
concerns about industry standards and quality of the U.S. poultry.
</P>
<P>
U.S. government officials reacted sharply, accusing Russia of
attempting to carry out protectionist trade policies.
</P>
<P>
Gore announced he would send senior U.S. trade officials
to Moscow for further discussions.

<HEADLINE> US Senate Approves Tougher Sanctions Against Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate today passed a
bill to tighten U.S. economic sanctions against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The Helmes-Burton bill, sponsored by Senate Foreign Relations
Committee chairman Senator Jesse Helms and Representative Dan
Burton, is aimed specifically at driving foreign investors away
from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
A central provision would create a new legal right to allow
Cuban Americans to sue in U.S. federal courts companies doing
business on their property confiscated by the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
Another provision would deny entry into the United States of
foreigners who buy, sell or develop the expropriated property.
</P>
<P>
Canada and other countries with normal trade relations with
Cuba have strongly opposed the U.S. move.
</P>
<P>
After approval by the House of Representatives later this week,
the bill will be handed over to President Bill Clinton to sign.
</P>
<P>
Cuba downed two American civilian planes owned by Cuban exiles
in the U.S. on February 24. Havana has accused the United States
of violating the air space of that island country. Reports said all
four crew members were killed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton vowed to punish Cuba for the incident by tightening the
30-year-old embargo against the Caribbean country.

DHAKA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi mainstream opposition
parties called for a dawn-to-dusk hartal (general strike) today in
the capital city of Dhaka and adjoining districts, according to an
announcement made by Awami (People's) League (AL) Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The hartal earlier decided to be deferred to March 7, was
retained for today, following the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) again rescheduled its public meeting from March 7 back

</P>
<P>
BNP chairperson and Prime Minister Khaleda Zia is expected to
address the meeting at Manik Mia Avenue, Dhaka. BNP and all its

procession.
</P>

Observers here said that the opposition's cat-and-mouse play
was to resist any public meeting of Khaleda Zia at any place of
the country.
</P>

After the February 15 general election boycotted by opposition
parties, the three major opposition, Awami league, Jatiya Party
and Jamaat-e-Islami, launched a series of movements to press home

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Ruling Party Leader Calls for Party Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior leader of Nepal's main
ruling Nepali Congress (NC) Party Tuesday called for unity of his
party.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of NC workers at a local village about 50
kilometers southeast of Kathmandu, Girija Prasad Koirala, former
prime minister of the 1991-94 NC government, said that his party's
defeat in the last general election was due to the lack of
necessary interaction between party leaders and workers.
</P>
<P>
In the 1994 election, the Communist Party of Nepal (UML)
overtook the NC party and won most parliamentary seats. The UML
party later formed a minority government to replace the Koirala
government.
</P>
<P>
However, the UML government stepped down last September when it
lost a non-confidence vote in the parliament to a NC-led three-
party coalition.
</P>
<P>
The present coalition government is led by young NC leader Sher
Bahadur Deuba, who is also NC parliamentary party leader.
</P>
<P>
Koirala, 72, does not seem to be ready to retire from his
political career and had decided to contest for the NC presidency
at the forthcoming party general convention slated for the end of
this month.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the defeat of the NC party in the 1994
election was largely due to the inner party struggle between
factions loyal to Koirala and to party president Krishna Prasad
Bhattarai.

BANGKOK, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa has said that the official list of new senators will
be announced on March 21, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister rejected the opposition's call to make the
list public before it is presented to the king for royal
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Banharn had appointed a four-member panel to
pre-choose candidates from at least 1,000 nominees from all walks
of life for the senate whose current term will expire on March 21.
</P>
<P>
Banharn also said that a screening committee for the new
260-member senate will be set up soon to prepare the list.
</P>
<P>
An official close to the prime minister said that Banharn would
have to chair the committee himself to prevent conflicts among
members which could delay the process.

<HEADLINE> Thai Officials to Visit Japan for Agriculture Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March (Xinhua) -- Senior Thai officials will visit
Japan next month for talks aimed at setting standards for
agricultural exports to that country.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture and
Cooperatives, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well as the
Livestock Department, the Fisheries and Agriculture Extension
Department and the Office of Agricultural Economics will visit
Japan from April 22 to 27.
</P>
<P>
Discussions will center on fixing criteria for setting
standards for agricultural goods since current standards have
emerged as obstacles to the export of Thai goods, Permanent
Secretary of the Ministry of Agricultural and Cooperatives Anan
Dalodom was quoted today by the local newspaper Bangkok Post as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Anan said it was crucial that Thailand understands all of the
regulations set by Japan so that the quality of agricultural goods
could be improved to meet Japanese standards.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Thailand plans to ask Japan to scrap the
regulation stipulating that a Japanese official must be stationed
in Thailand to check the standards of agricultural goods,
especially fruits.
</P>
<P>
Because Thailand must pay 500,000-800,000 baht (20,000-32,000
US dollars) per month to employ the Japanese officials, it is put
at a competitive disadvantage, Anan said.
</P>
<P>
Japan will also be asked to further open its markets to Thai
frozen black-tiger prawns, frozen pork, fried pork and mangos.
Japan had previously alleged that Thai shrimps and prawns
contained harmful substances.

<HEADLINE> Latin America Faces Challenge of Eradicating Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A popular Mexican saying
goes:" Not every child arrives in the world with a sandwich in his
hand," meaning not every child is born into good fortune.
</P>
<P>
Hunger and poverty not only linger in Mexico, which has been
battered by its worst economic crisis in 13 years, but also haunts
all the 19 countries of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Everyday scenes of real poverty throughout the
continent: thousands of jobless people roam the streets of Mexico
City making a meager living as "fire-eaters" or trinket-sellers;
the notorious "street kids" of Brazil invade the beaches of Rio de
Janeiro, scaring off tourists; beggars with hands outstretched
wander around downtown Lima in the cold weather.
</P>
<P>
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) sources say that some 40
million children live in the streets across the region, four times
the number of street children in Europe after the end of World War
II.
</P>
<P>
Statistics are cold but convincing evidence of how serious the
situation is.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures from the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin
America and the Caribbean, headquartered in Santiago, show that
poverty affects about 170 million Latin Americans, 46 percent of
the continent's total population of 370 million.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the 92 million Mexicans and 150 million
Brazilians live under the poverty line. Sixty-five percent of
Peruvians and 84 percent of Venezuelans are living in precarious
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Poverty is manifested in malnutrition, the lack of drinking
water, sewerage and drainage systems, the shortage of medical
care, school rooms and jobs.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Latin American Economic System, based in
Caracas, shows that 44 percent of all Latin Americans suffer some
form of malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
As traditional exporters of raw materials, Latin American
countries have been the victims of unequal international trade for
many years.
</P>
<P>
Uneven development and endemic corruption were another two
catalysts of poverty.
</P>
<P>
In many countries, economic growth lags far behind population
growth. The emergence of big industrial centers and the
concentration of the population in cities have left the
countryside almost deserted, deepening rural impoverishment.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the 90's, Latin America has reported a significant
economic recovery thanks to restructuring and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, economic growth has not been accompanied by an
improvement in the well-being of the people. Social indicators
show that instead of eradicating injustices and inequality, growth
has exacerbated income disparity and polarization in society.
</P>
<P>
Austerity measures and neo-liberalism, fashionable in the
region, have forced millions of workers out of jobs, according to
the IDB.
</P>
<P>
Some 10 million Latin Americans seek jobs without success
everyday, while another 54 million struggle in the so-called
informal economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank, Latin America leads the regions
of the world where wealth is poorly distributed.
</P>
<P>
Despite five years of sustained growth of more than 5 percent a
year, Chile's poorest, who account for 10 percent of the
population, share only 1.7 percent of the GDP, while 40.8 percent
is pocketed by the wealthiest who also make up 10 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
In Mexico, 53.5 percent of the wealth is concentrated in the
hands of the richest 20 percent of the population, while the
poorest 20 percent owns only 4.4 percent of the nation's wealth.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is the country with the most unequal distribution of
income in the region. Ten percent of Brazilians own 51.3 percent
of the GDP. The poorest 10 percent of the population share only
0.6 percent of the country's wealth.
</P>
<P>
If the problem is not addressed, worsening poverty will
threaten social stability and sustainable growth. Social
discontent has already led to violence in several countries.
</P>
<P>
To meet this enormous challenge, Latin American governments
have implemented a variety of social programs in order to spread
the benefits of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
A few programs have yielded positive results.
</P>
<P>
In Mexico, the population living in extreme poverty decreased
8.7 percent in the period from 1989 to 1992 thanks to the National
Solidarity Program.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the number of poor Peruvians has
dropped by almost 6 percentage points, and 1.6 million Colombians
have benefited from the Social Solidarity System.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian government has earmarked 65 percent of the funds
budgeted for the 1996-1999 Investment Plan to the social welfare
sector. Similarly, the Chilean government is devoting 70 percent
of its budget to social spending.
</P>
<P>
Combating poverty is one of the top priorities in the Mexican
government's National Development Program for 1995-2000, and the
Peruvian government budget for 1997 gives priority to the
construction of infrastructure in extremely poor areas.
</P>
<P>
Latin America has so far made moderate progress in reducing
poverty. But IDB experts calculate that 57 percent of all Latin
Americans will still find themselves living below the poverty line
in the year 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Kai Tak airport
ranked the world's 15th busiest airport in 1995, up three places
over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
A total of 28.04 million passengers passed through the airport
last year, 8.1 percent more than that of 1994, according to
today's South China Morning Post, which quoted statistics from
Geneva-based Airports Council International (ACI).
</P>
<P>
Kai Tak also moved up two places in the cargo list, ranking
sixth with 1.48 million tons handled in 1995, up 12.6 percent,
said the English newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The passenger and cargo growth is because airlines have
employed bigger aircraft since the airport has few landing slots
available.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the airport saw a 160-percent rise in
passenger traffic. Only 10.6 million passengers went through in
1986, the paper reported. Kai Tak, with a single runway, was
designed to handle 24 million passengers a year.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong airport is the third busiest in the Asia-Pacific
region in terms of passenger traffic, behind Tokyo's Haneda and
Seoul's Kimpo.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Protect Light, Textile Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia is planning to use tariffs
and spend 1500 billion rubles (about 311 million U.S. dollars) to
help its textile industry fight foreign competitors at home,
President Boris Yeltsin said today.
</P>
<P>
It was illogical to allow foreign goods, much of them poor
quality, to dominate Russia's domestic market, Yeltsin told a
meeting of employees from light and textile industries in
Moscow province.
</P>
<P>
He added that levies on imported cotton and fibre would be
reduced.
</P>
<P>
Russia also has signed accords on cotton and fibre supply with
Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Kirgizstan, partly in a bid to raise
Russia's share of the textile market in the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
The CIS has the potential to become a regional textile market,
with sufficient raw materials, huge productive capacity,
up-to-date technology and good expertise, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the expansion of Russia's light and textile
industries was inconceivable without effective cooperation between
Russia and other CIS member states.
</P>
<P>
He called on the other CIS member countries to speed up
economic integration and to expand the CIS market with Russia.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives today passed a bill to set up a federal commission
to study the economic and social impact of gambling.
</P>
<P>
Democrats and Republicans were alarmed at the enormous
expansion of legalized gambling in recent years, with 48 states
now having one or more forms of legalized gambling.
</P>
<P>
"We simply need more scientific and behavioral data concerning
gambling," said Illinois Republican Representative Henry Hyde,
Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Lacking information, state and local officials considering the
legalization of gambling are often vulnerable to exaggerated
claims about the positive effects of gambling and the prospects of
painless revenue generation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The commission would review gambling's positive and negative
effects, potential criminal connections, the impact political
contributions play on public gambling policy, demographics of
gamblers and the effectiveness of laws against illegal gambling.
</P>
<P>
The bill, criticized by some lawmakers from big gambling
states, is yet to clear the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Menem not to Visit Britain Without Fishing Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Saul Menem will not go to London until fishing agreements with
Great Britain have been signed, Argentine Foreign Minister Guido
di Tella said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that as long as circumstances remain unchanged, in
which the British authorities on the Georgia Islands require
Argentine fishing boats to pay in order to fish in the zone, it is
not suitable for President Menem to visit Britain.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Mayor has invited Menem to visit
Britain at a convenient date.
</P>
<P>
President Menem has made clear Argentina's rejection of the
fishing licenses required by Britain in the Georgia Islands
zone, according to local press today.
</P>
<P>
"We do not share Britain's attitude and we are lodging
all the pertinent complaints through the means within the law and
the international conventions that we have signed," Menem said.
</P>
<P>
The President also stressed Argentina's full sovereignty
over the Malvina (Falkland) Islands.
</P>
<P>
Menem said that both countries are in negotiations over fishing
rights in the South Atlantic. He added that Britain's decision to
require fishing boats to pay for licenses to fish in the region
has affected the negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Experts Save Rare Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have made a
breakthrough in preserving the rare crested ibis, according to
today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The endangered bird, which is considered to be a living
oriental fossil and can be traced back 60 million years, now lives
in the wild only in China and was down to just seven wild birds in
1981.
</P>
<P>
The number of the rare bird has now risen to more than 60
thanks to an intensive research and breeding program, according to
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
After more than 10 years of research, experts now know much
more about the endangered bird, including the bird's distribution,
breeding habits and the reasons for the threat the bird is facing.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of years ago, the species was found in large numbers
in most parts of China, as well as in Japan and Germany.
</P>
<P>
With modern industrial development and great changes in
agriculture, much of the bird's natural habitat has been
destroyed, which endangered the bird's existence.
</P>
<P>
Commonly used chemical fertilizers and pesticides leave residue
poison in loaches, a fresh-water fish which is the ibis' major
source of food in paddy fields.
</P>
<P>
The ibis migrates in tune with the seasons of seedling
transplanting and rice reaping, and always breeds in March.
</P>
<P>
In May, 1981, Chinese scientists found seven wild crested ibis
in Yangxian County in the southern part of northwest China's
Shaanxi Province and immediately began their protection and
research work.
</P>
<P>
The Shaanxi Crested Ibis Protection and Observation Station was
established by the Ministry of Forestry and Shaanxi provincial
government.
</P>
<P>
Scientists in the Animal Research Institute of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, the Shanghai Zoo and the Shaanxi Animal
Research Institute began their research on every aspect of the
bird, along with their Japanese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Japanese wildlife protection organizations
provided the research program with funds and facilities worth over
three million yuan (about 360,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
A feed station for the ibis was set up in 1991 in Yangxian
County to ensure the bird to get enough healthy food.
</P>
<P>
From 1993, scientists tried many times to breed the bird
artificially and in 1995, three birds were hatched by the
scientists in the feeding station.
</P>
<P>
The area now is home to 14 crested ibises.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: China's Key Projects in Coming 15 Years (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
-- A project to divert water from south to north. It is a key
project to supply water for farming and industry in northern
China, mainly Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei Province, and to bridge
river shipping between the southern and northern parts of China.
Water will be diverted from three places along the upper, middle
and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, reaching destinations
after flowing more than 1,000 km through Hubei, Henan, Hebei,
Jiangsu and Shandong provinces. Each year 40 billion cubic meters
of water will be diverted, about half of the total water flow of
the Yangtze River. An overall feasibility study of the project
started in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
-- A network of state highways. This will link Beijing with all
provincial capitals, big cities with a population of more than one
million and most cities with a population of more than 500,000.
According to a plan, the network will have 12 high-grade trunk
lines with a total length of 35,000 km, including five north-south
lines and seven east-west lines. The project is expected to be
completed in 2010.
</P>
<P>
-- Shanxi coal production base. Shanxi in north China ranks
first in both the deposit and explorable amount of coal among all
provinces. Coal output of the province in 1993 exceeded 300
million tons for the first time, about one-quarter of the
country's total. Since 1993, the province has supplied annually
200 million tons of coal to 26 provinces and municipalities, 80
percent of the total amount of trans-provincial coal transfer.
</P>
<P>
-- Shaanxi coal production base. There are abundant coal
deposits in the northern part of Shaanxi Province. The
Shenfu-Dongsheng coal field located along its border with southern
Inner Mongolia is discovered to cover 31,200 sq km, with 223.6
billion tons of coal deposits, one quarter of China's total. In
the near future, China plans to carry out coal mining in an area
covering 3,481 sq km with estimated coal deposits of 35.4 billion
tons. A super large coal mining base will take shape there.
</P>
<P>
-- Inner Mongolia coal production base. The Ordos area in the
southwestern part of Inner Mongolia is abundant in coal resources.
Coal deposits discovered up to now reach 149.6 billion tons,
one-seventh of the national total. The Jungar Coal Field, with an
investment of 6.8 billion yuan (about 818 million US dollars), is
the most capital-intensive coal field in China over the past four
decades. Coal deposits of 26.8 billion tons have been discovered
there in a 1,365 sq km area. The Dongseng Coal Field is a major
producer and exporter of fine coal. In 1996, its coal production
is expected to reach 14.2 million tons and its annual output 20.8
million tons by the end of the century.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- In his report on China's medium-
and long-term development programs at the Fourth Session of the
Eighth National People's Congress, Chinese Premier Li Peng talked
about a number of big projects for the next 15 years. A brief
account of them is as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- Nanning-Kunming Railway. This will be a 398-km electrified
railway between Nanning, capital of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, and Kunming, capital of Yunnan Province in southwestern
China. The project started in May 1990 and will be completed in
1997 at a cost of 6.5 billion yuan (about 7.8 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
-- Optical fiber trunk lines. A total of 22 trans-provincial
optical cables totaling 37,000 km have been built in China. During
the coming five years, construction of more optical fiber lines is
expected to result in a total length of 210,000 km of such lines.
</P>
<P>
-- Three Gorges Dam Project. It is one of the country's major
projects that aims to harness and develop the Yangtze River,
integrating the functions of preventing floods, generating
electricity and boosting river shipping. The super dam will be
1,983 m long and 185 m in crest elevation. Total holding capacity
of the reservoir behind the dam will be 39.3 billion cubic meters
of water. A maximum 100,000 cubic meters of water can be
discharged per second through the dam. The project's hydropower
station will be installed with 26 generating units with a combined
generating capacity of 17.68 million kw and an annual electricity
output of 84 billion kwh. The project's permanent ship lock is
able to let 10,000-ton ships pass. The project started in 1993 and
the first group of generating units is expected to turn out power
in 2003.
</P>
<P>
-- Yellow River Xiaolangdi Water Control Project. It is the
largest water conservation project along the river and is second
only to the Three Gorges Dam Project in terms of workload. The
project, located 40 km to the north of Luoyang City in central
China's Henan Province, aims at preventing floods and ice run and
reducing silt deposit. It will also have the functions of water
supply, irrigation and power generation. Total holding capacity of
the reservoir is 12.65 billion cubic meters. Generating capacity
of the hydropower station will be 1.8 million kw. It will be able
to add four billion cubic meters of water supply each year. The
project is expected to take 11 years to complete, in 2001. There
is a plan to use more than one billion US dollars in
overseas-sourced funds.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Sweden continues to pursue a
"one-China" policy, Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen told
parliament today.
</P>
<P>
"Like other countries in the world, Sweden pursues
a 'one-China' policy," said Hjelm-Wallen. "That means we do not
recognize Taiwan as an independent state and we cannot have
state-to-state relations with Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
But that won't prevent Sweden from cooperating unofficially
with Taiwan in many fields, the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that relations across the Taiwan Straits have taken
many positive changes over recent years, which will help to unify
the country peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The unification of China should be realized through peaceful
means by the Chinese themselves and "international participation
should be aimed at easing, not heightening, the tension," she
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Start Spring Sowing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- All Chinese farmers are busy
preparing for spring sowing, hoping for a bumper summer harvest.
</P>
<P>
The southernmost part of the country began to raise rice
seedlings late last month, while northern China will wait until
late this month.
</P>
<P>
Local plans show that the increase in grain acreage will
continue this year, said Zeng Yande, head of information
collection at the Ministry of Agriculture, as quoted by today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
China's summer harvest of grain usually accounts for more than
20 percent of the annual total, which reached a record 460 million
tons last year.
</P>
<P>
Zeng warned that more efforts will be needed for field
management in northeast, north, and northwest China because of
severe droughts.
</P>
<P>
The central government issued a circular last Saturday, urging
local officials to help farmers in spring ploughing.
</P>
<P>
The circular also pointed out that prices of production
materials, especially fertilizers, are too high for farmers.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has called on local governments to give priority
to water conservancy projects, in a bid to relieve droughts and
possible floods.
</P>
<P>
It also urged officials to ensure abundant supply of
fertilizers and to allocate enough funds and loans to purchase
farmers' surplus grain and cotton.

CANBERRA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Two Australian yachting athletes,
one an Olympic bronze medalist, went to court for not being
selected for their country at the Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
John Forbes, who won bronze in the Tornado class at the 1992
Barcelona Olympics, and his partner Darren Bundock, has asked the
New South Wales Supreme Court to rule on the validity of the
selection process for the 1996 Games.

Mitch Booth, Forbes' partner in Barcelona, and Andrew
Landenberger were chosen by the Australian Yachting Federation
for the Tornado class after a series of preliminary races.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Forbes argued at a preliminary hearing in Sydney on
Tuesday that the federation changed its selection criteria,
benefiting Booth.
</P>
<P>
Forbes and Bundock claimed that the federation allowed Booth to
change crews after the first selection regatta even though points
are awarded to crews and not individuals. Booth and Landenberger
did not sail together in the first race.

<HEADLINE> Escaping Poverty North of Huaihe River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Over 500,000 people north of the
Huaihe River in east China's Jiangsu Province have managed to move
above the poverty line thanks to the province's efforts.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the number of people living at the poverty line, with
annual incomes not exceeding 800 yuan (about 96 US dollars based
on 1990 prices), was estimated at two million. Most of them were
in an area north of the Huaihe.
</P>
<P>
The province has pledged to wipe out poverty for the area by
the year 2000, and has intensified investment in transportation,
energy, and telecommunications to boost economic development in
the area.
</P>
<P>
Construction work on key projects have started, such as the
Nanjing-Lianyungang and Nanjing-Xuzhou highways, the Xinyi-Huaiyin
railway line, and Tongyu Canal.
</P>
<P>
Projects for improving water quality, controlling pollution,
and improving low- and medium-yield farmland have also been done.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the provincial government sent groups to ten
counties and provided money and materials amounting to 123 million
yuan, three times 1993's figure.
</P>
<P>
Richer cities or counties in the southern part of the province
have also paired up with their poorer counterparts in the north to
co-operate in economic development.
</P>
<P>
Zhangjiagang City in the south and Fengxian County in the
north, for example, started 24 projects in a five-month period
last year, and Wujiang City established several joint ventures in
Huaiyin County and has had good returns.

percent in 1995, a considerable improvement after a negative

<HEADLINE> Evans Rips Foschi Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- American world record holder
Janet Evans slashed at United States Swimming on Tuesday for
repealing the doping suspension of Jessica Foschi, according to a
Reuter report on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I am ashamed and embarrassed to be part of an organization
that can't stand up for what it believes in," Evans was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Last year their whole thing was as soon as someone tests
positive for steroids, regardless if they know it or not, they're
out," she added.
</P>
<P>
"Look at the Chinese, they were banned, no questions asked
whether they were sabotaged or got the steroids from their
coaches. U.S. Swimming pushed for the Chinese to be banned and
then when it happens to one of our own, they can't stand up for
what they believe in and I'm ashamed. It irritates me," said the
triple world record holder and four-time Olympic gold medalist.
</P>
<P>
Foschi, a 15-year-old schoolgirl, tested positive for steroids
at last summer's national championships. The U.S. Swimming Board
of Review first put her on a two-year probation. U.S. Swimming
then reversed the decision and banned her for two years.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Swimming rescinded the mandatory two-year ban when FINA,
the sport's international governing body, decided to give
Australian world champion Samantha Riley only a "stern warning"
despite the fact she tested positive for a drug that usually
brings a two-year ban, the Reuter report said.
</P>
<P>
"It's bad for our sport, it's bad for the future and for kids
seeing this happening and thinking maybe they can get away with
it, too," Evans was quoted in the report.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. Swimming is to blame for no real control in this
situation. This is an issue that could change the whole drug
issue for the future."

<HEADLINE> IRA Warns Protestant Loyalist Armed Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army (IRA)
said today that it has "every reason to take seriously" the threat
of a return to violence by Protestant loyalist paramilitary
groups, reported BBC TV this evening.
</P>
<P>
The IRA in a statement said that they had no desire for any
type of military engagement with loyalism, and loyalists should
consider their position very carefully.
</P>
<P>
On March 3, a splinter group from the Ulster Volunteer Force,
one of the Protestant loyalist armed organizations, threatened to
break its truce and attack leading members of the IRA and its
political wing Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
The splinter loyalist armed group argued that the current peace
efforts were a farce in which protestants were being humiliated
into making concessions to the IRA.
</P>
<P>
David Ervine, leader of the Progressive Unionist Party, a
fringe Protestant political party which politically represents the
Ulster Volunteer Force, said earlier today that there were
"serious difficulties" in holding the loyalist cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
But the loyalist armed groups have held on to their cease-fire
since the IRA plotted its first bomb explosion in London on
February 9.

<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein, political wing of the
Irish Republican Army (IRA), indicated today that it is ready to
seek the resumption of the IRA cease-fire, which was bombed apart
on February 9.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the University of Ulster in Londonderry, the second
largest city in Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator
with the British government Martin McGuinness said that his party
would only urge the IRA to restore cease-fire "if we can be
absolutely certain that all-party negotiations on the future of
Northern Ireland will begin."
</P>
<P>
He said there was no guarantee that the IRA would agree to do
so, but Sinn Fein could try.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has been excluded from the consultations process on
a plan for elections in Ulster which started in Belfast Monday
because the IRA has so far failed to revive its cease-fire as
demanded in the Anglo-Irish joint communique issued in London on
February 28.
</P>
<P>
The communique stipulates that an elective body will be
produced following the consultations among political parties in
Northern Ireland, presided over by the British and Irish
governments from March 4 to 13.
</P>
<P>
Then all-party negotiations on the future of the
crisis-stricken province will start on June 10.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Parties Asked to Refrain from Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
today demanded that all concerned in Burundi refrain from all
acts of violence, incitement to violence.
</P>
<P>
It also demanded that all concerned refrain from seeking to
destabilize the security situation or depose the Burundi
government by force or by other unconstitutional means.
</P>
<P>
In a unanimously adopted resolution, the Security Council
condemned all acts of violence perpetrated against civilian,
refugees and international humanitarian personnel and the
assassination of government officials.
</P>
<P>
The council called upon the leaders of Burundi to settle their
differences and resolve their fears through dialogue instead of
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
The resolution followed a report of Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali who described the political and security situation
in Burundi as defined by "visceral fears and brutal struggles for
power."
</P>
<P>
According to Boutros-Ghali's report, much of the Tutsi
minority, historically dominant, lives with the phobia of its
physical elimination, while the Hutu majority demands proper
political representation.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 6 million population, 85 percent are Hutu and only
14 percent are Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
In reiterating its invitation of members states to cooperate in
the identification and dismantling of radio stations which incite
hatred, the council requested the U.N. chief to consider the
possibility of establishing a U.N. radio station in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
It also asked the secretary-general to plan, on a contingency
basis, for a rapid humanitarian response in the event of
widespread violence or a serious deterioration in the humanitarian
situation in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to the
United Nations, said the resolution on Burundi reflected the
Security Council's determination to continue efforts to promote
comprehensive dialogue in the country so that mutual confidence
can be built and national reconciliation can be realized.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the internal problems of a country can

<HEADLINE> Justice Department Asks for Clinton's Video Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Justice Department today
asked President Bill Clinton to be allowed to testify via
videotape, instead of in person, at the Whitewater trial in Little
Rock, Arkansas, of two former business partners and the governor
of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
The president's "unique status under the Constitution
distinguishes him from other executive officials," and he should
be able to pick the time and place for the testimony, Assistant
Attorney General Frank W. Hunger argued in court papers, the
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
James and Susan McDougal have subpoenaed Clinton to testify at
their alleged fraud and conspiracy trial, saying only he can
counter allegations expected from David Hale, a former banker.
McDougal wants the president to testify in person.
</P>
<P>
Hunger said that such a request could damage the president's
ability to do his job.
</P>
<P>
The McDougals and Governor Jim Guy Tucker are accused of
misusing nearly 3 million dollars borrowed from two federally
backed lending companies. They allegedly lied to the bankers about
how the money would be used.
</P>
<P>
Hale is expected to testify for the prosecution that Tucker and
then-Governor Clinton pressured him to make bad loans. Clinton has
denied the allegation.

<HEADLINE> UK Furious Over Euro-Ruling on Fishing Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- British Deputy Prime Minister
Michael Heseltine said here today that the British government
would press for changes in the European law on fishing quotas.
</P>
<P>
Heseltine made the statement following a European court ruling
allowing Spanish fishermen to claim compensation for being banned
from fishing in British waters.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that Britain would put forward the issue and
demand further action at the coming Inter-Governmental Conference
to be held in Turin, Italy, later this month.
</P>
<P>
British Fisheries Minister Tony Baldry today launched fierce
verbal attacks upon the ruling, saying the ruling was "quite
crazy" and the British government would introduce a new "charter
of the seas" to protect British fishermen.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice ruled earlier
today that the European Union (EU) governments must compensate
individuals for damage caused by the failure to enact European
law.
</P>
<P>
Under the ruling, Spanish fishermen would be able to claim
compensation estimated at 46 million U.S. dollars from the British
government.
</P>
<P>
The European ruling was prompted by a shipping law Britain had
passed imposing strict nationality and residential requirements on
fishermen and the new shipping law has forced nearly 100 Spanish
fishing firms to tie up their boats.

systems geared toward the demands of the market, traffic flows,
operating results and conditions for the development of
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Thailand Becoming Auto Capital in Asia: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The three leading auto
manufacturers in the United States are attempting to penetrate
into the auto market of Thailand, which is now dominated by
Japanese car makers.
</P>
<P>
But when a 65-member General Motors delegation flew to Bangkok
in January to seek investment opportunity, they found the response
was not very encouraging, according to a report of The USA Today
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The truth is, the paper said, the world's largest automaker may
need Thailand more than Thailand needs GM. Even without GM, this
nation of 60 million people, is becoming Southeast Asia's
unchallenged auto capital, it said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is home to 17 car makers, 12 major assembly plants and
nearly 350 parts suppliers. The country, following the U.S., is
also the No. 2 market for light trucks in the world.
</P>
<P>
Annual sales of automobiles in the country jumped 17.6 percent
last year to 572,000 vehicles, making Thailand far and away the
region's largest market.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the top five car and light truck brands in Thailand
were all Japanese. Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mitsubishi and Isuzu
dominate the Thai market, holding an 86 percent of the market
share, compared with 2 percent for the three leading auto makers
of the U.S., the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Ford and Mazda broke ground on February 6 on a 500 million U.S.
dollar plant located in Rayong, on Thailand's eastern seaboard.
The plant eventually will produce 135,000 pickups -- half for Ford
and half for Mazda.
</P>
<P>
Ford hopes to seize 10 percent of the local truck market, up
from the 0.5 share it has now.
</P>
<P>
GM owns 37.5 percent of Isuzu, No. 2 to Toyota in Thailand. But
GM hasn't been able to take advantage of its Isuzu stake, the
paper said. GM moved into the Thai market in 1994 with its Opel
Corsa, whose market share faded to 3.1 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler, the third largest auto manufacturer in the U.S.,
is slow in entering Thailand. The company began assembling
right-hand-drive Jeep Cherokees in Bangkok last fall. It expects
to sell 2,000 Cherokees this year.

<P>
LAGOS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Inspector-general of
Nigerian police Alhaji Nuhu Aliu said here today that the police
would adopt new strategies to combat violent crimes, especially
bank robberies.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the crime situation in Nigeria, Alhaji Nuhu told
newsmen that the police were making concerted efforts to put the
situation under control by deploying more men.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Alhaji Nuhu noted that what the police
needed now was the cooperation of the public to break armed
robbery gangs, saying, "we need information from members of the
public on the activities of armed robbery gangs. They live in
houses."
</P>
<P>
The police leader disclosed that some bank officers were
collaborating with suspected armed robbers by giving them
information on the movement of money by the banks.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Coalition Cabinet Approved by President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
approved here tonight a cabinet list for the minority coalition
government between the Motherland Party (ANAP) and the True Path
Party (DYP).
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz announced the cabinet list after
meeting with Demirel, thus ending more than two months of
"government crisis."
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz submitted the 33-member cabinet list to the president
for the approval after holding a 50-minute meeting with DYP
Chairwoman and caretaker Prime Minister Tansu Ciller.
</P>
<P>
Nahit Mentese (DYP) takes the post of deputy prime minister and
state minister, Emre Gonensay (DYP) acts as foreign minister,
Oltan Sungurlu (ANAP) works as national defense minister, Ulku
Guney(ANAP) as interior minister and Lutfullah Kayalar (ANAP) as
finance minister. Names of other ministers are not immediately
given.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz was borne in Rize Province along the Black Sea in 1947
and took the post of the prime minister for 4 months in 1991
before the ANAP was defeated by the DYP then led by Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Under a protocol for the formation of the 53rd government
signed by Yilmaz and Ciller on Sunday, Yilmaz will head the
government on a rotating basis until the end of this year, then
Ciller will take over as prime minister for the next two years. In
the fourth year, Yilmaz will take another turn and in the fifth
and the final year, the partnership will be led by a deputy from
the DYP until new elections.
</P>
<P>
Ciller confirmed that she would not take part in the coalition
government while Yilmaz leads it.
</P>
<P>
A vote of confidence is expected on the new government in the
parliament on March 12.
</P>
<P>
However, the Coalition government may not be up to the task of
taming high deficits and runaway inflation, though it has gained
strong support from the majority of the Turkish people.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Buy US Chicken if Sanitary Norms  Observed: Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin told U.S. Vice-President Albert Gore Wednesday that
Russia will continue to buy U.S. chicken if international sanitary
norms are observed, the Interfax new agency reported.
</P>
<P>
However, the Russian premier also made it clear that the
current suspension of imports cannot be lifted immediately.
</P>
<P>
"We are going and shall buy chicken in the United States, but
with obligatory observation of international sanitary norms."
Chernomyrdin told Gore during a 30-minute telephone conversation.
</P>
<P>
The conflict over U.S. chicken erupted after Russia suspended
the imports from February 16, putting in doubt the sanitary
quality of the food. Besides, import duties were raised by 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
"This is not discriminatory measure against U.S. foodstuffs
and, surely, it cannot be assessed as a double increase of the
duties. This measure was introduced to protect domestic
producers of the same foodstuffs," Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the problem of sanitary norms should be solved
jointly by Russian and U.S. experts. "We cannot resort to any
hasty measures," he added. He explained that sanitary requirements
to U.S. chicken had not been toughened.
</P>
<P>
"The veterinary certificate of that type of food products has
been valid since 1993. Its norms did not change and they fully
correspond to the existing international standards," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier reply to Russia's move, Gore warned that the
Russian decision could have serious political and trade
implications for both sides. To prevent this from happening, he
called for an immediate renewal of import licenses and tariff cuts.
</P>
<P>
But Chernomyrdin wrote in a letter to Gore that the Russian
government sees no serious grounds for a cooling of Russian-U.S.
relations because of Moscow's suspension of licenses for poultry
imports from the United States and a 5 percent rise in import
tariffs from February 16.
</P>
<P>
According to Interfax, Chernomyrdin also pointed in the letter
to incidents of violation of the international sanitary
regulations by U.S. produces who exported low quality poultry to
Russia last year. As a result, about 2,000 tons of chicken was
destroyed after findings by Russian and U.S. experts, he added.

<HEADLINE> France, Germany and S. Africa Want Dialogue with Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The ambassadors of France, Germany
and South Africa have expressed their countries' readiness to
enter into dialogues with Nigeria over the country's transition
program.
</P>
<P>
The envoys who were recalled home by their governments to
protest against the November 10 hanging of nine Ogoni activists
for murder in south Nigeria and have recently returned to
Nigeria, voiced their determination in Abuja on Tuesday when they
called on Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi.
</P>
<P>
French ambassador to Nigeria Pierre Garrigue-Guyonnaud said
France was interested in the prospect of Nigeria's
transition-to-civil-rule program scheduled to commence this month
with local government elections.
</P>
<P>
Describing Nigeria as a major country in Africa, the French
envoy said France had issues of mutual interest to discuss with
Nigeria and hoped that the situation would lead to "meaningful
dialogue with the Nigerian government."
</P>
<P>
"With great human and material resources, Nigeria has a great
future," he added.
</P>
<P>
German ambassador to Nigeria Johannes Lohse who recalled that
Germany had earlier criticized Nigeria's delay in the
implementation of the transition program, said his country "would
now rather talk about the democratic process on the ground."
</P>
<P>
"We came back with the intention of entering into substantial
dialogue with members of the Nigerian government in the hope that
dialogue will lead to common views on how best to restore
democracy and human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
South African High Commissioner to Nigeria Siphon George Nene
said he returned to Nigeria after "extensive consultation"
between his country and other countries that were concerned about
developments in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Nene pointed out that South Africa and Nigeria had great
responsibilities to their peoples, and the people of Africa.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that South Africa and Nigeria had "little problems so
that we can contribute to the development of the continent."
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Foreign Minister has earlier solicited support
from the three countries for Nigeria's transition program,
saying, "our democracy is that which recognizes our cultural,
economic and social circumstances."
</P>
<P>
"We count on the cooperation of leading countries in the
world," Ikimi noted.

<HEADLINE> Arafat's Advisor Criticizes US Congress Decision to Freeze Aid to PA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Hani al-Hassan, political advisor to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, criticized here today
U.S. Congress' decision to freeze indefinitely the 50 million
U.S. dollar aid to the Palestinian Authority (PA).
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa, al-Hassan described the decision as a grave mistake,
saying that it would victimize the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The advisor also criticized the Israeli military closure of the
Gaza Strip and West Bank following the suicide bombings carried
out by the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in Jerusalem and
Tel Aviv on Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace agreements between the Palestinians and Israel,
he said, the two sides should negotiate to contain the situation
resulting from the attacks, which he said were not carried out
from the areas under the control of the Palestinian security
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said he discussed with al-Hassan developments of the
Middle East peace process and measures taken by the PA to maintain
the peace march.
</P>
<P>
He said that he will meet with Arafat in Gaza Thursday to
discuss with him various aspects of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa is due in Gaza Thursday to take part in the inauguration
of the Palestinian legislative council.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's advisor said that he came here for consultations with
Egypt on Palestinian future policies. Egypt has been a key
mediator between the Palestinians and Israel.
