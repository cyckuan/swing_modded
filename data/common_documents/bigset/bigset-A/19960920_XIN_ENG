<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Struggles for Spending Bills for New FY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- As the current fiscal year
is drawing to a close and the new fiscal year starting soon, the
U.S. Congress is struggling to make progress on spending bills and
to avoid budget showdown with the White House.
</P>
<P>
With the approvement of a 12.6-billion-dollar transportation
bill in the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives on
Wednesday, six spending bills for the fiscal year of 1997 have
passed the Congress as yet and the other seven remain to be
discussed and approved in the next ten days.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal year of 1997 will begin on October 1.
</P>
<P>
But as Republican leaders looked to that deadline and the
election-year need to recess by early October, they were well
behind schedule and blaming the Democrats of "play games".
</P>
<P>
There are wide gaps between the spending bills of the Congress
and the government for the fiscal year 1997 and many hard work is
needed to be done in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
The dispute between the Republican-controlled Congress and the
White House on the spending bills for fiscal year of 1996 resulted
in two government shutdowns totaling 27 days.
</P>
<P>
But Analysts said it will not happen this year because the
presidential election and the election of the Congress.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Tom Daschle, Democratic leader in Senate, has said that
the Congress would "stay here and work on the CR for several
weeks, maybe even a month or so, to deal with some of these
concerns."
</P>
<P>
The CR, or continuing resolution, is the catchall
appropriations measure that the White House and Congress must
agree on if some spending bills are not finished when the fiscal
year begins.

<HEADLINE> Russia, China Win Openers at World Volleyball Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia beat the United
States 3-1 while China crushed the Netherlands 3-0 in their
openers at the last leg of the World Women's Volleyball Grand Prix
preliminaries here this evening.
</P>
<P>
Russia's 15-13, 12-15, 15-6, 15-10 triumph avenged their defeat
at the hands of the same opponent in the Grand Prix second leg in
Osaka, Japan, two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Russia led the first set 10-5 before American captain Tara
Cross-Battle scored three points to key a 8-4 run to come as close
as 14-13.
</P>
<P>
But Russia's top scorer Elena Godina had a successful blocking
to stop any further rally of the Americans.
</P>
<P>
The United States dominated the net in the second set but lost
steam in the third and fourth sets.
</P>
<P>
American coach Taras Liskevych said his players' form had been
affected by the long air travel from the last leg in Honolulu and
had to adjust to the jet lag.
</P>
<P>
In the other match, China's ace spiker Sun Yue scored nine
points while Lai Yawen, Li Yan and Wu Yongmei added six each to
inspire the Olympic silver medallists to a 15-7, 15-4 and 15-6
victory over the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Lang Ping said: "We played well in fast
attacks and were successful in blocking and defense. The Dutch
services failed to disrupt our reception."
</P>
<P>
China meets Russia while the United States faces the
Netherlands on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The top three teams on the overall grand prix rankings,
excluding China, will advanceinto next week's finals in Shanghai,
China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese squad automatically qualifies as the host.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan's Devious Attempt To Join UN (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan authorities have once
again attempted to split the motherland and create "two Chinas",
or "one China, one Taiwan", by raising the issues of Taiwan's
"representation" and "participation" in the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
A signed article released by Xinhua today says that on July 17,
at the instigation of the Taiwan authorities, Nicaragua and a
number of other countries brought up the matter of Taiwan's
"representation" in the UN, and on August 21, the Taiwan
authorities clamored about "participation in the UN" again, with
the motive of splitting the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The article notes that on October 25, 1971, the UN General
Assembly passed Resolution No. 2758, which restored all the
legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the UN and
expelled the so called "representatives" of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The UN resolution has become Taiwan's largest barrier in trying
to sneak into the UN. The Taiwan authorities are peddling the idea
everywhere that Taiwan is the "foundling of the UN" and the
resolution is a "product of the Cold War".
</P>
<P>
The Western nations headed by the United States, responding to
cold war needs, adopted a policy of blockading, isolating and
containing China and tried every means possible to obstruct the
restoration of China's membership in the UN, thus leading to the
illegal occupation of China's seat in the UN by Taiwan for as much
as 22 years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Starts Up Sharply in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Housing starts in the U.S.
shot up by 4.5 percent in August to the highest level in nearly 2
and half years, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said construction of new homes and apartments
totaled 1.53 million at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, up from
a revised 1.46 million in July. It was the highest since a 1.53
million rate in March 1994.
</P>
<P>
The new data also showed that starts fell 2 percent in July,
more than the original 1.3 percent estimate. But it also showed
that construction in June rose 0.8 percent rather than an earlier
reported 0.3 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
The report said that single-family starts jumped 8.3 percent
to a 1.24 million rate, wiping out a 5.5 percent drop in July. It
was the biggest increase since an 8.6 percent gain in July 1995
and the highest level since a 1.28 million rate in March 1994.
</P>
<P>
Construction of apartment and condominiums, often volatile but
not as sensitive to interest-rate changes, fell 9.5 percent to a
287,000 rate. It had shot up 12.8 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
Starts were up in every region except the Midwest. Housing
starts climbed by 13.5 percent in the West, 7 percent in the
Northeast and 2.8 percent in the South. But they declined by 2
percent in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
Applications for building permits--often a barometer of future
activity--fell by 4.4 percent in August to a 1.39 million rate,
the third decline in four months. Permits for single-family homes,
about 80 percent of new residential construction, were flat after
falling for three months.
</P>
<P>
The stronger-than-expected report on the U.S. housing market
sent stock and bond prices lower in early trading.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts expect the overall economy to slow down during
the second half of the year from its strong second-quarter growth.
If not, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) is prepared to boost
short-term interest rates to cool down the economy. The Fed
policy-makers will meet on September 24 next time.

<HEADLINE> UK Retail Sales up 1 Percent in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in Britain rose
by one percent between July and August, enjoying their biggest
boom since the late 1980s, but making it increasingly unlikely for
the Chancellor to cut interest rates again.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Office for National Statistics today
show that the rise of one percent in the volume of goods sold last
month took year-on-year growth to 4.4 percent, the highest since
March 1989.
</P>
<P>
Last month's rise followed a fall of 0.6 percent in July, but
the City said that the underlying rise in consumer spending was no
longer in any doubt.
</P>
<P>
In the three months to August, a better guide to the underlying
trend, retail sales volumes were 1.6 percent higher than in the
previous three months, the strongest growth rate since August
1988, and 3.5 percent above their levels of a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Within total retail sales, textile, clothing and footwear sales
over the last three months grew at their strongest pace for a
decade.
</P>
<P>
The rise of consumer spending is being linked to higher
earnings, falling unemployment, interest rates cuts, lower taxes
and financial windfalls.
</P>
<P>
Many City economists said that the strength of consumer
activity sharply reduced the chances of further cuts in interest
rates for the foreseeable future.

<P>
FIFA has already turned down the idea of increasing the number

<HEADLINE> Taiwan's Devious Attempt To Join UN (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article continues that in 1971, the 26th UN General
Assembly finally passed Resolution No.2758, which reflected the
view of the majority of UN members, particularly the Third World
countries in safeguarding the spirit and principle of the UN
Charter and in opposing interference in China's internal affairs
by foreign powers.
</P>
<P>
UN Resolution No.2758 is, therefore, certainly not a "product
of the cold war", but a result of opposing the cold war, and the
legitimacy and justice embodied by the resolution are beyond
question, the article stresses.
</P>
<P>
To pose a challenge to UN Resolution No. 2758, the Taiwan
authorities absurdly spoke of "the Republic of China in Taiwan",
and of attempting to "participate in the UN" in the name of "the
Republic of China in Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
The name 'the Republic of China' is closely connected to the
government of the Republic of China, which ruled China before
October 1, 1949, but was overthrown by the Chinese people and
replaced by the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming majority of countries in the world do not
recognize the existence of the so called 'Republic of China'. UN
Resolution No. 2758, reflecting the reality of China's political
situation since 1949, fairly and thoroughly resolved China's
representation in the UN, politically, legally and
procedurally.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Moves to Encourage Cotton Planting Pay off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The steps taken by the
Egyptian government to encourage farmers to plant cotton have
paid off as the cotton-growing land increased from 720,000
feddans (302,400 hectares) last year to 920,000 feddans (386,400
hectares) this year.
</P>
<P>
The steps included guaranteeing growers a minimum delivery
price of 500 Egyptian pounds (147 U.S. dollars) per kantar (45
kilograms) and making available to farmers the necessary
fertilizers and pesticides, a local English-language newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also offered training programs for
agricultural engineers and farmers, Al-Ahram Weekly said.
</P>
<P>
Yassin Osman, head of the Agricultural Guidance Department at
the Ministry of Agriculture, was quoted as saying that this
year's harvest of cotton will increase to 8.5 million kantars
(382.5 million kilograms). Last year's harvest brought in five
million kantars (225 million kilograms).
</P>
<P>
"This is considered to be the highest cotton yield Egypt has
realized since 1990," he said.

<HEADLINE> Armenian President Expected to Win Second Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Incumbent President Levon
Ter-Petrosyan is regarded by political observers as the favorite
to win a second five-year term in Armenia's presidential election
on Sunday, reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls show that Ter-Petrosyan, a 50-year-old
academic, would probably get 40 to 50 percent of the vote and
avoid a second-round runoff with his strongest challenger, former
ally and prime minister Vazgen Maukyan who is chairman of the
National Democratic Union.
</P>
<P>
Communist Party leader Sergei Badalyan and Ashot Manucharyan
from the Party of Science and Industry are also in the ballot.
</P>
<P>
A second round between the top two candidates will be held in
two weeks if no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Ter-Petrosyan, who has been president since the country gained
independence in 1991, has gained support from Armenia's six major
parties, including his own Pan-Armenia National Movement.
</P>
<P>
Another 14 parties and 69 social organizations issued a joint
statement recently, calling on Armenians to vote for Ter-Petrosyan.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Taiwan's Devious Attempt To Join UN (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UN Charter and international law state that one country has
only one legitimate government to represent the rights and
interests of its people in the UN. This means that the government
of the PRC also represents the rights and interests of the
Taiwanese people in the UN. It is useless to deny the fact by
saying that "Taiwan is the foundling of the UN."
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities this year urged their "friendly
countries" to clamour for a "model of parallel representation" to
help Taiwan's "participation in the UN".
</P>
<P>
It should be pointed out that when the 26th UN General Assembly
passed Resolution No. 2758, it also rejected a motion for "dual
representation" raised by the United States and a small number of
other countries for retaining the seat of the Chiang Kai-shek
clique in the UN General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
In fact, both "parallel representation" and "dual
representation" have been designed to create "two Chinas", or "one
China, one Taiwan" in the UN and in the international community,
but they are doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities' attempt to divide the motherland will
in no way benefit the Taiwan compatriots. Most people in Taiwan
want social stability and are in favor of developing relations
across the straits, promoting economic development and improving
the standard of living. What the Taiwan authorities are doing,
however, run against the fundamental interests of the Taiwan
people.
</P>
<P>
It is time that the Taiwan authorities stop dreaming of
"participation in the United Nations."

<HEADLINE> Sound Economic Relations Between Interior And Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Economic and trade relations
between the Chinese inland areas and Hong Kong continued to enjoy
a sound development in the first half of this year, with Hong Kong
still serving as the major source of overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong directly invested in 5,925 projects in inland areas
between January and June, accounting for 42 percent of the total
overseas-funded projects nationwide during the period, according
to statistics from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
The total amount of contractual investment from Hong Kong
increased by 14.62 percent over the same period last year to 17.94
billion US dollars, accounting for 39 percent of the country's
total, the statistics show.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, import and export volume between
the inland areas and Hong Kong was 54.432 billion US dollars
worth, or about 43 percent of the country's total foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The exports to Hong Kong were worth 28.518 billion US dollars,
down by 23.1 percent from the same period last year, while imports
from Hong Kong were worth 25.914 billion US dollars, a decrease of
eight percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Although there is a drop in trade between the inland areas and
Hong Kong during the period, an official with MOFTEC pointed out,
they still maintain good economic and trade relations.

<P>
CAIRO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Local telephone communication companies sent their
final bids Wednesday for a 100 million-dollar deal to complete the
Lebanese government's plan to expand the telephone network,
Beirut's Ad-Diyar daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The deal is the last stage of the government's project to
ensure 1.7 million telephone lines all over the country and the
total cost of the project amounts to 800 million dollars, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
500,000 lines on the bids will be equally distributed to
northern Lebanon, southern Lebanon, the eastern Beqaa and Mount
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Ghasan Assi, director general for the construction and
equipment in the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, said
that his ministry had invited 19 local companies to provide
their bids and received bids from 11 companies.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Qatar Islamic Bank plans to set up a
328-million-riyals (90 million dollars ) real estate fund in the
United States in cooperation with the Union Bank of Switzerland,
according to the English-language newspaper the Peninsula
available here today.
</P>
<P>
The privately-owned Qatar Islamic Bank, which is based in Doha,
will have an investment share worth 109 million riyals (30
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The remaining amount will be raised from the U.S. market, the
daily added.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt is considering a plan to expand the cultivation
of artificial forests to reduce its dependence on imported wood,
which costs some 3.5 billion U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
Since Artificial forests do not require excessive water
resources and are compatible with Egypt's dry climate, the
Ministry of Agriculture has approved a project to cultivate
500,000 tropical African mahogany trees each year.
</P>
<P>
The wood of these trees, which are naturally found in the
African rain forests, is proven by the ministry to be stronger
than that of beech trees, Al-Ahram Weekly quoted Amin Okasha, head
of the ministry's Horticulture Research Institute, as saying.
</P>
<P>
These trees can survive both on fresh and sewage waters, making
it possible to grow them around sanitary drainage stations. So the
ministry began cultivating mahogany trees on a small scale about
28 years ago, Okasha said.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The steps taken by the Egyptian government to
encourage farmers to plant cotton have paid off as the
cotton-growing land increased from 720,000 feddans (302,400
hectares) last year to 920,000 feddans (386,400 hectares) this
year.
</P>
<P>
Local English language weekly Al-Ahram Weekly said the steps
included guaranteeing growers a minimum delivery price of 500
Egyptian pounds (147 U.S. dollars) per kantar (45 kilograms) and
making available to farmers the necessary fertilizers and
pesticides. The ministry has also offered training programs for
agricultural engineers and farmers, Local English language weekly
Al-Ahram Weekly said.
</P>
<P>
Yassin Osman, head of the Agricultural Guidance Department at
the Ministry of Agriculture, was quoted as saying that this
year's harvest of cotton will increase to 8.5 million kantars
(382.5 million kilograms). Last year's harvest brought in five
million kantars (225 million kilograms).

<HEADLINE> Burundi's Army Accuses Rebels of Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Rebels killed three
civilians today when they ambushed a minibus in southern Burundi,
according to a report reaching here, quoting spokesman of the
government troops.
</P>
<P>
"They definitely died of a rebel attack," said
Lieutenant-Colonel Isaie Nibizi, the army spokesman, adding that
three others were wounded when rebels opened fire on their
minibus near Rumonge, 75 km south of the capital Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a radio report said another person was killed today
in an ambush near Bugarama, northeast of Bujumbura, on the road
to Burundi's second biggest city, Gitega.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Roman Catholic church in Gitega was preparing
to bury murdered Archbishop Joachim Ruhuna, whose body was found
by government troops on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ruhuna, burundi's senior catholic prelate, was killed on
September 9 when gunmen ambushed a four-wheel-drive vehicle north
of Gitega. Two nuns were also killed.
</P>
<P>
Four people in the vehicle survived the attack, which the
government troops blamed on Hutu rebels. However, the rebels said
the Tutsi-dominated military was responsible.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people, most of them civilians, have been
killed in last few years in Burundi.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto to Dissolve Lower House on September 27 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 19, (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto is widely expected to dissolve the House of
Representatives on September 27 and hold a general election on
October 20, Kyodo News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, president of the Liberal Democratic Party, proposed
dissolving the House of Representatives on September 27
immediately after an extraordinary session of the Diet
(parliament), during a meeting of leaders of the tripartite ruling
coalition, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Shoichi Ide, leader of the New Party Sakigake and Tomiichi
Murayama of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the two other
members of the coalition, agreed to his proposal but opposed
dissolving the lower house immediately after the Diet sitting
begins, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet will formally approve the opening of the
parliamentary session on September 27 at a meeting on Friday, it
said.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, both Murayama and Ide demanded that
Hashimoto make a policy speech and that debate on the speech
should be held during the extra Diet session.
</P>
<P>
However, Murayama and Ide told reporters after the meeting that
Hashimoto, who replaced Murayama as prime minister in January, did
not mention when he wants to dissolve the powerful lower house for
a snap general poll and made no particular comment on the SDP and
Sakigake`s objection to an early dissolution of the house.
</P>
<P>
The current term of the lower house expires in July next year,
and only the prime minister enjoys the power to dissolve the lower
chamber for an election.
</P>
<P>
Japan`s constitution stipulates that a general election must be
held within 40 days of the dissolution of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The next general election will be the first in three years and
will also be the first under the new voting formula combining 300
single-seat constituencies and 200 proportional representation
seats.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians to Consider Changes in Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian
official said today that the Palestinians would not agree to
renegotiate on the Israeli army's redeployment in Hebron, but
would be willing to consider several changes in the security
arrangements in the West Bank town.
</P>
<P>
Israel Television quoted Saeb Erekat, Local Government Minister
in the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), as saying that
Israel should pullout its troops from Hebron in accordance
with the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, also head of the Palestinian team in the
Israeli-Palestinian Steering Committee for implementation of the
Oslo accords, added that the Hebron redeployment was the main
focus of Wednesday night's meeting between PNA President Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference following the meeting, Arafat
declined to say if he had agreed to make any changes in
the Hebron redeployment, but only said that "the Steering
Committee will carry out all these details.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have reportedly agreed that the Steering
Committee will meet next week and hold further talks on the
Hebron redeployment issue.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the committee held its first session since the
new Israeli government assumed power in June, but failed to
reach an agreement on the Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio initially reported that the Israeli and
Palestinian officials had agreed at that meeting that the
redeployment in Hebron would take place, but with a few
modifications.
</P>
<P>
However, Erekat, who led the Palestinian team to the
meeting, later denied this report, and told Xinhua that the
Palestinian side "will not even want to hear the word of
modification."
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords between Israel and the
Palestinians, the Israeli army was originally supposed to
have completed its redeployment in Hebron by March 28.
</P>
<P>
But, following a series of suicide bombing attacks in
Israel in February and March which left over 60 people dead
and more than 100 wounded, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres
delayed the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In May, the former Israeli government announced that the
army's withdrawal from Hebron would be carried out after the
May 29 general elections, due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres, defeated by Likud Chairman Benjamin Netanyahu
in the elections, said afterwards that he would leave the
decision of the redeployment to the new prime minister and
his government.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, some 40 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem, is a
place of pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and Muslims alike,
and tradition has it that patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and
their wives are all buried in the Machpelah Cave (Haram
al-Khalil).
</P>
<P>
There are some 400 Jewish settlers now living in the
center of Hebron, who moved back to the city's old Jewish
neighborhood after the 1967 War, during which Israel took over
the town from the Jordanian authority.
</P>
<P>
Surrounding the Jewish community, more than 200,000
Palestinian residents are living in most other parts of the
city.

BONN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat today warned of war at the beginning of his two-day
visit to Germany, reported the Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA).
</P>
<P>
"Enmity and war appear to be again on the horizon," Arafat said

</P>
<P>
He criticized the approval of 1,800 new houses for Jewish
settlers in the West Bank by the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Israel's refusal to pursue peace is dragging the region back
toward extremism, terrorism and violence, the DPA quoted Arafat as
saying.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Arafat is due to meet the influential Chairman
of Germany's Central Council of Jews Ignatz Bubis as well as
senior government leaders including Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
and President Roman Herzog. Chancellor Helmut Kohl is away from

<P>
TEHRAN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran has started manufacture
and repair of some components of U.S.-made F-14 jet fighters,
Iran's official news agency IRNA said today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted an air force officer as saying that Iran's
air force has managed to manufacture some parts of the fighter
plane.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier General Akbar Tavangaran, deputy commander of Shahid
Babaei air base in Isfahan, said some modifications have been
made on the aircraft, such as replacing its conventional
air-to-air missiles with air-to-ground missiles.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources, the number of U.S.-made jet
fighters accounts for about 50 percent of the Iranian air
force.
</P>
<P>
The maintenance of the American aircraft is a big problem for
Iran since the two countries severed ties in 1980.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Farmers Demonstrate Against Sinking Beef Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,000 tractor-driving
Swiss farmers caused traffic chaos on Thursday when they took to
the country's motorways in protest at the desperate situation of
the domestic beef market and a government plan to slaughter
230,000 cattle.
</P>
<P>
Swiss television reports showed that the farmers, organized by
a farming group from Gruyere, drove their tractors onto
the autobahn between Vaulruz and Matran in the canton of Fribourg
in western Switzerland at ten o'clock in the morning.
</P>
<P>
Police blocked the section of the motorway and diverted other
traffic onto nearby cantonal highways during the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government on Monday announced a plan to slaughter up
to 230,000 cattle in a bid to eliminate the threat of "mad cow"
disease in the country. The cattle to be slaughtered represent a
quarter of the country's total herd.
</P>
<P>
Swiss farmers associations strongly protested the plan, saying
that it was meaningless and would worsen the suffering endured by
farmers since the "mad cow" disease hit the headlines in March.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland trails only Britain in the number of reported cases
of mad cow disease, which is formally called bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE). The cumulative total reported in September
was 223 cases.
</P>
<P>
The European beef market has plummeted since March when the
British government announced there could be a link between the
deadly BSE and a similar disease in humans contracted by eating
infected beef.

BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, a member of the
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, met here today with a group from the Cambodian People's
Party (CPP), led by Simka, one of the CPP's senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Wei, who is a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee, exchanged views with Simka on bilateral relations of
the two countries and on party ties. He said that China and
Cambodia are good neighbors, and that the Cambodian people are
devoting themselves to building their country and revitalizing the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the CPC appreciates the CPP's stance of adhering to the
"one China" policy, and its recognitions of the government of the
PRC as the sole representative of China, and of Taiwan as an
inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
"The CPC is willing to maintain its friendly relations with the
CPP on the basis of independence and self-determination, equality,
mutual respect, and non-interference into each other's internal
affairs," he added, which will help the continued growth of
good-neighborly and friendly ties between the two countries.
</P>

Simka said that the CPP spoke highly of China's great changes
and development in recent years, and that the CPP will make an
effort to develop Sino-Cambodian friendly cooperative relations.

<P>
Progress has been slow in matters directly related to the
transfer of power, Zhao said, and in some cases, there has been no
progress at all.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that the Chinese side made a proposal that the two
sides' experts hold talks on transfering the Hong Kong
government's assets and Hong Kong's archives, to exchange views
better and increase work efficiency.
</P>
<P>
But, the British side did not agree with this reasonable
proposal, something that is extremely difficult to understand, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao pointed out that holding the next round of meetings on
defense affairs is badly needed, but that the meeting has been
delayed for a long time because the British side kept tying the
issue to other matters.
</P>
<P>
He said that they also discussed the Western Corridor
Railway. The Chinese side believes that this is a huge project
that will be started after 1997, so that these issues, including
preliminary evaluation and design, should be discussed by the
liaison group.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side expressed the hope that an expert group will
be formally set up, but it is regrettable that the proposal has
not been responded to by the British side.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Tension with Syria under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said today the recent tension with Syria had
been brought under control after exchanges of messages.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks at a joint interview with European
reporters held at the Prime Minister Office after Israeli fighter
planes and artillery fires struck Hezbollah positions in
south Lebanon today.
</P>
<P>
Israel, for the past few days, has asked both the U.S. and
Egypt to relay peace messages to Syria, whose troop deployments
near the Israeli borders have aroused fears of a possible military
confrontation. Syria has also reportedly sent calming messages via
parties concerned to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Israel was still watching very carefully the
Syrian moves, although "there have not been any new movements in
recent days."
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at it. We are looking at the developments on
the ground ... We are vigilant and cautious. But we are careful
not to take any action that could escalate the matters," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu claimed that the ball was now on the Syria's side
if the Israeli-Syrian talks could resume.
</P>
<P>
"We are, in any case, watching the situation. We are
proceeding with (the peace talks with )the Palestinians, it is
now up to (Syrian) President Assad if he is interested while we
are interested in resuming peace talks," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed he was willing to talk about "new ideas" to
resume the stalled talks with Syrians, but refused to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Netanyahu held talks with U.S. peace
coordinator Dennis Ross, whose visit was mainly aimed at resuming
the Israeli-Syrian talks.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Ross and Netanyahu's diplomatic adviser
Dore Gold have worked out a draft formula to restart the peace
talks with Syria. Israel would accept partial "non-paper"
commitments made by former Labor government, which promised to
withdraw from Golan Heights if normalization and security
arrangements were made with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Overtly, Netanyahu has so far refused to relinquish even an
inch of the Golan Heights which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967
Mideast war. Syria demands Israeli withdrawal from the Heights
before making full peace.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Orient House in east Jerusalem, Netanyahu
reiterated the stern warning that Israeli government will refuse
to receive any European foreign minister who intends to visit
the place.
</P>
<P>
Israel has claimed Jerusalem as its only indivisible and
eternal capital, while the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
also wants East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future Palestinian
state. The Orient House is the de facto representative office run
by the PNA.

protest after November 1, if the problem of unpaid wages was not
settled, said Spartak Orzhavkin, chairman of the Federation of
Trade Union of Workers and Employees of the Russian armed forces.

communal services and military carriages reached about 25 trillion
roubles(some 4.9 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Orzhavkin told reporters that if today's action yielded no
results, the trade unions would declare a state of pre-strike
readiness, which would rule out the ultimate expression of
mistrust to the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
The "trade unions have given the premier (Viktor Chernomyrdin)
time to take the necessary measures until October 1," he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Attacks Hezbollah Positions in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes mounted
today two raids on positions of Hezbollah, or Party of God, in
south Lebanon after two Israeli soldiers were killed and two
others wounded in a clash.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports said the Israeli bombers fired four missiles on
Hezbollah targets, which exploded and fire spread to several areas.
However, there were no reports on damage or casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army, for the past few hours, has also shelled
Hezbollah positions in the Iglim al-Tuffah area just outside the
Israeli self-declared "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli raids, the worst fighting in south Lebanon in five
months, came as tension rose between Syria and Israel, the two
main players in Lebanon, following recent Syrian troop movements
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The clashes came amid reports about Israeli military build-up
inside the Israeli-occupied border belt, where the Israeli forces
massed up in the past 24 hours 125 tanks, pointing to a possible
expansion of Israeli attacks by air and sea on south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is to release a statement on the outcome of the
Israeli attack later today.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll of Iraqi Kurds Rise to Eight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The death toll rose to eight
at Iraqi Kurd refugee camp in Siranband, northwestern border area
of Iran, the Iranian official news agency IRNA said here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that five Kurds who had been seriously injured
earlier died at a medical center, thus bringing the death toll
of the Kurd refugees to eight.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, a local official from Kurdestan province
said that heavy artillery shelling of the refugee camp at
Siranband killed three and wounded 54 others.
</P>
<P>
Siranband border point, 23 kilometers from the Iranian
northwestern city of Baneh, has been converted into a temporary
camp ground for more than 35,000 Iraqi Kurd refugees.
</P>
<P>
A report from West Azerbaijan province said that the Red
Crescent Society in the northwestern province has offered
medical treatment to 6,000 Kurd refugees at the refugee camps on
border points of Piranshahr and Sardasht during the past 10
days.
</P>
<P>
It said that 161 wounded refugees underwent surgery immediately
after the establishment of two field hospitals equipped with
surgical operation rooms and other medical equipment at Sardasht
and Piranshahr border points.
</P>
<P>
The society has provided the refugees with humanitarian
assistance, including 7,000 blankets, 35 tons of flour and
loaves of bread, four tons of potatoes, two tons of sugar, three
tons of rice, 11,000 canned foods and a considerable volume of
other items.

<HEADLINE> Juppe Raps Le Pen for his Racist Speeches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain
Juppe today sharply denounced Jean-Marie Le Pen, president of the
far-right National Front, as "profoundly, and almost innermostly,
a racist, anti-semitist and xenophobe,'' whose ideas must be
"strongly fought".
</P>
<P>
In a speech to some 200 French youths in Montpellier, southern
France, Juppe, who is also president of the ruling Rassemblement
pour la Republique (RPR), said that he was not surprised to hear
the "openly and manifestly racist" speeches Le Pen made recently,
"because it is in the logic of what he has always said."
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the prime minister to condemn in
public the repeated declarations by Le Pen that he "believes in
racial inequality".
</P>
<P>
It also came after the government has refused to launch legal
inquiry against Le Pen, as has been called by some leftwing
political figures. The government decided instead to reinforce
legislations against provocation of violence, hatred and racism.
</P>
<P>
The denouncement made by Juppe also came at a moment when
France is debating whether to adopt a system of proportionality in
its legislative election mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Some minority parties, including the National Front and the
Green Party, have asked the government to let them enter the
National Assembly by creating extra seats in the parliament
through proportionate voting.

<HEADLINE> Four Militants Killed in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian security forces killed
four fugitive militants in the eastern mountainous area in Assuit
province, southern Egypt, at dawn today.
</P>
<P>
The killed were believed to be Islamic militants, who were
taking shelter inside a number of caves when the security forces
came to crack down on the terrorist activities there, according to
Egypt's new agency MENA.
</P>
<P>
The four "terrorists," as so called by the government, were
killed when they exchanged fire with the security forces.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown came in the wake of recent criminal attacks, MENA
said, adding that cash, forged identity cards and food were found
in the caves.
</P>
<P>
The security forces are still pursuing the fugitives who fled
to the depth of the mountainous area, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Also today, an court convicted eight Moslem militants of
killing 12 Christian villagers in 1992 and sentenced them to
up to 25 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Five defendants were sentenced to 25 years for hard labor,
another one was sentenced to five years in prison and the other
two were given one-year sentences at hard labor.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years, Moslem militants have waged a violent
campaign against the government in an attempt to install strict
Islamic rule in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Christians have been often targeted by militants in their
terrorist attacks.

<HEADLINE> France Renews Arrest Order on Libyans Suspected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- France today announced that it
will renew its arrest order on two Libyan officials suspected of
being involved in the bombing of a UTA DC-10 passenger plane in
September 1989.
</P>
<P>
Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere, who is in charge of the case for a
Paris court, said that Abdessalem Issa Shibami, and Abdessalem
Hammouda, both of them members of Libya's secret service, are
suspected to have played an active role in preparations for the
bomb attack.
</P>
<P>
Bruguiere has just concluded his investigation into the bombing
and has recently made a trip to Libya to interview some of the
people concerned with the case.
</P>
<P>
A UTA DC-10 plane exploded on September 19, 1989, above Niger,
on its flight from Brazzaville to Paris, killing all 170 people on
board.
</P>
<P>
Some of the relatives of the victims in the bombing today went
to the military airport of Bourget outside Paris to see the cabin
of the plane, which has been reconstructed from its debris
recovered from the desert of Tenere in Niger.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Francis Szpiner, attorney for the SOS-Attacks
association, said that Bruguiere has in hand the evidence which
proves "the guiltiness of the state of Libya".
</P>
<P>
He said that Bruguiere has documents which say that Musbah
Arbas, one of the four Libyan agents suspected in conducting the
bombing, was still alive in 1992, but the Libyan government said
that he was dead in 1990.
</P>
<P>
This seriously put into question the sincerity of Libya in its
cooperation with France in the investigation, he said.

<HEADLINE> Transfer Hatches Open between Russia's Mir Station, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 19 (xinhua) -- After several hours of radio
talks, the crew members of the Russian Mir orbital station and the
U.S. space shuttle Atlantis got an opportunity this morning to
greet each other in person, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Transfer hatches between the shuttle and the orbital station,
which successfully docked at 07:13 Moscow time today, were opened
at 09:45 Moscow time.
</P>
<P>
The first hour of the joint stay of the cosmonauts in the orbit
will be taken up by a festive ceremony, including speeches and the
exchange of souvenirs. Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
After the transfer hatches were opened, the U.S. astronauts
went over to the "Russian territory" of the orbital complex from
the Atlantis shuttle weighing some 100 tonnes. The U.S. spacecraft
brought to the Mir station equipment, personal belongings and
foodstuffs including fruit.
</P>
<P>
The most important part of the shuttle's mission is that it
brought to the Mir station NASA astronaut John Blaha, who is to
replace Shannon Lucid, who began her space mission last March.
</P>
<P>
Lucid, the 53-year-old U.S. woman cosmonaut, has spent half a
year in conditions of weightlessness and became an absolute
record-holder among woman by the duration of staying in space.
</P>
<P>
Taking part in the docking operation were Russian cosmonauts
Valery Korzun and Alexander Kalery, U.S. astronaut Lucid, and the
newly arrived apsce shuttle crew -- Willian Readdy, Terence
Wilcutt, Jerome Apt, Thomas Akers, Carl Walz and Blaha.
</P>
<P>
After the joint flight is over, Blaha will continue to work
aboard the Mir station as second Flight Engineer of the 22nd main
space expedition together with Korzun and Kalery, the news agency
said.

KUWAIT CITY, September 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. ground forces
deployed in Kuwait will start military exercises Friday, a
U.S. military commander said here today.
</P>
<P>
Kornnell Robert Pollald, Chief of Staff at Doha Camp in eastern
Kuwait, said at a press conference at the camp this evening that
the training exercises, codenamed "Intrinsic Action," will last
for three or four months.
</P>
<P>
The 207 army personnel that arrived here this afternoon from
the United States are leaving tonight for the exercise range 50
miles from the Kuwaiti-Iraqi border to joint the 1,200 soldiers
already there, the commander said.
</P>
<P>
The heavy armored equipment including Abrams tanks and
Bradley vehicles were all seen in preparation for the desert
training range.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers in uniform to adapt to the desert environment were
busily checking the state of the equipment deployed in Kuwait
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
With the first group of the announced 3,500 troops sent to
Kuwait, the 207 personnel had flown for almost 18 hours to Kuwait
to carry out what the commander described as their "training
mission" here.
</P>
<P>
The remaining soldiers will arrive in Kuwait in the next few
days, Pollald said. The U.S. had already deployed eight stealth
F-117 fighters and eight Patriot missile launchers here in
preparation for a possible further strike on Iraq.

BEIRUT, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon will lodge an urgent
complaint with the committee entrusted with monitoring the
cease-fire in south Lebanon in protest against the Israeli
aircraft and artillery attacks on guerrilla positions in south
Lebanon today.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes mounted two raids on positions of Hezbollah,
or Party of God, in south Lebanon after two Israeli soldiers were
killed and two others wounded in a clash.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports said the Israeli bombers fired four missiles on
Hezbollah targets, which exploded and fire spread to several areas.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army, for the past few hours, has also shelled
Hezbollah positions in the Iglim al-Tuffah area just outside the
Israeli self-declared "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The attack left a citizen injured.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz said that his government
decided to hand the complaint to the committee, comprising the
U.S., France, Israel, Syria and Lebanon, which was formed in
accordance with a cease-fire understanding reached between Lebanon
and Israel on April 26.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli raids, the worst fighting in south Lebanon in five
months, came as tension rose between Syria and Israel, the two

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Auto Company to Assemble Scania Trucks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Tanznia
Automobiles Manufacturing Company Limited (TAMCO) will resume its
activities of assembling Scania Trucks at its Kibaha Factory in
the Coast Region with effect from next November.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of TAMCO Board of Directors Ben Moses told newsmen
here today that the decision to resume its activities followed
the 1996/97 government budget in favour of local assembly of
motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The TAMCO was established in April 1978, as a joint venture
between State Motor Corporation (SMC) and Saab Scania of Sweden
with the objectives of assembling Scania heavy duty trucks and
buses.
</P>
<P>
The activities started in early 1982. In 1994 the plant was
opened up for assembly of other makes of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The plant has a installed capacity to assemble 1,200 heavy
commercial vehicles in a single shift and 2,000 on double shief.
</P>
<P>
The company's business operations during the 1980's were
profitable, but became uncompetitive following the complete
withdraw of import duty and sales tax on commercial vehicles for
both completely built (CBU) and completely knocked down (CKD)
vehicles in June 1992.
</P>
<P>
The company has now secured orders to assemble various makes
of commercial vehicles on contract basis for locally based share
holders. This arrangement will enable the factory to utilize at
least 50 percent of its installed capacity during 1997.

<HEADLINE> UK, China Reach Agreement on Trade Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and British companies
have agreed on a new five-year training initiative to gain a
better understanding of each other's markets.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was confirmed by an official from the Department
of Trade and Industry (DTI) in an interview given to Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding was agreed upon Wednesday night
by the DTI, the State Economic and Trade Commission of China and
Rolls-Royce on behalf of a consortium of UK private sector
companies. The document will come into effect in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the initiative, President of the Board of Trade Ian
Lang said, "This agreement is further evidence of the ever
improving commercial relationship between the United Kingdom and
China."
</P>
<P>
The development of closer education and training links also had
a major role to play in sustaining and expanding bilateral
business relations and in providing valuable assistance to China
as it becomes a major international economy, Lang added.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum of understanding has five main elements:
</P>
<P>
-- An advanced studies placement program for Chinese middle
managers and specialists into UK firms;
</P>
<P>
-- A seminar program to be held annually in China;
</P>
<P>
-- A consultancy program in China for British industrialists
involved in the seminar program;
</P>
<P>
-- An annual senior management industrial strategy program for
those holding very senior positions in state enterprises; and
</P>
<P>
-- A scholarship program to study at British universities.
</P>
<P>
Lang visited China earlier this month, when he met with
Chen Jinhua, chairman of the Chinese State Economic and Trade
Commission. Both agreed that the Rolls-Royce initiative was an
exciting development which would do much to enhance bilateral
cooperation.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today congratulated the two parties in
Guatemala on their agreement which is regarded as a further step
towards final peace.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged his continued support to the two parties in
fulfilling their pledge to conclude the negotiating process in the
course of this year, said his spokesman Sylvana Foa.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general gave his congratulation and pledge of
support as the the government of Guatemala and the Guatemalan
National Revolutionary Union are scheduled to sign the Agreement
on Strengthening of Civilian Power and Role of the Army.
</P>
<P>
"Following the signing of the Agreement on Social and Economic
Aspects and Agrarian Situation on 6 May 1996, the conclusion of
this agreement is another major step towards the signing of a
final peace agreement," Foa said.
</P>
<P>
Based on the parties' recognition that the end of the war
offers a historic opportunity to overhaul, strengthen and further
democratize Guatemalan institutions, the agreement provides for
several significant reforms to be carried out in such sensitive
areas as the administration of justice, the police, the army and
the intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
In particular, under a reformed Constitution limiting the
army's role to external defense, the government will carry out a
redefinition of military doctrine, education and deployment.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement provides for a 33 percent reduction in troop
strength in 1997 and a 33 percent reduction in the army's budget
by 1999.

compromises to keep a major immigration bill on track for passage
this month.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott told reporters that
Republicans were looking at two approaches today aimed at passing
a bill before year-ending adjournment: dropping the schools
provision altogether or weakening it.
</P>
<P>
House Republicans seemed unwilling to consider abandoning the
schools language.
</P>
<P>
Lott's Democratic counterpart, Senator Tom Daschle, said other
issues in the bill need to be addressed as well but that dropping
the schools provision "would be very helpful."
</P>
<P>
A compromise proposal that would delay action on the schools
provision for a year by ordering a study of illegal immigrants in
public schools appeared to raise fresh objections Wednesday. It
was among several ideas under study by the House Republican
leadership, congressional aides said.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, who generally supports immigration
reform, has promised to veto the immigration bill if it denies
public education to children of illegal aliens. Republican
presidential candidate Bob Dole wants it left in the immigration
bill.
</P>
<P>
States participating in such a study would identify students
who are in the country illegally, that most opponents of the
schools provision would find unacceptable, a key Senate aide said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The schools provision was an amendment to a House immigration
bill that passed earlier this year. The Senate version of the bill
doesn't not include that provision.
</P>
<P>
The legislation would nearly double the size of the Border
Patrol, increase penalties for document fraud and alien smuggling
and establish pilot projects for employers to verify job
applicants' work eligibility. It also would toughen penalties on
illegal aliens caught in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The current compromise version would allow states to bar
children who are illegal aliens from schools or charge tuition to
families who can't prove their children are legal U.S. residents.
Such children in public elementary schools as of September 30
would be able to remain through the eighth grade, and high school
students would be allowed to graduate.

<HEADLINE> Solana Pledges Further NATO Commitment in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana has promised that the NATO alliance would remain engaged in
the Bosnia peace process after the current NATO-led peace
implementation mission expires at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a speech to the International Institute for
Strategic Studies in London this afternoon, Solana said, "I
believe that the international community, including NATO, must
remain engaged in Bosnia beyond this year after the entry into
force fo the Dayton Peace Agreement."
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the Dayton Peace Agreement, the one-year
mandate of the current NATO-led peace Implementation Force (IFOR)
of some 55,000 troops runs out at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
"On the security side, there may well be a requirement for a
continued military presence in Bosnia after IFOR, albeit smaller
and for a strictly limited term," he said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief made it clear that "its objective would be to
assist progress towards stability in the region and provide an
environment of security while durable institutions are established
and parties fully assume their responsibilities."
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, reconstruction must continue and its pace
must be maintained and even increased. And hardening of internal
boundaries must be prevented," he added.
</P>
<P>
Solana said, "The enlargement of NATO is inevitable. It is a
vivid expression that in this new Europe sovereign states are free
to choose their alignments and they are not subject to the old
pattern of spheres of influence."
</P>
<P>
"If all goes well, I believe that a decision should be taken by
heads of state and government at a NATO summit in 1997 to invite
several partners to begin accession negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general placed great emphasis upon the relations
between NATO and Russia by saying, "Both Russia and NATO are major
contributors to European security and stability and we need a
long-term relationship that reflects this fact."
</P>
<P>
He said, "Our relationship with Russia will not be an optional
add-on. It will be part of a new NATO in which there will be
constant two-way dialogue and interchange and at long last we will
enjoy the strategic benefits of Russia and NATO working together."

<HEADLINE> Boutros-Ghali Urges Tajikistan to Cease Hostilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali has urged the government and opposition
forces in Tajikistan to cease hostilities immediately, according
to a report available today.
</P>
<P>
In the report to the Security Council, Boutros-Ghali noted that
the situation in Tajikistan has deteriorated in the last three
months.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, intense fighting continued between
government and opposition forces in the area of Tavildara, where
the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan had to
follow the events through monitoring troop movements and persons
fleeing the area as they were unable to obtain first-hand
information.
</P>
<P>
Fighting in the Tavildara sector has caused numerous casualties
on both sides. The fighting has destroyed completely 15 percent of
the town, heavily damaged another 25 percent and disrupted the
main roads, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The situation has deteriorated elsewhere in Tajikistan. In the
north, repeated demonstrations were held in Leninabad province.
Demonstrations in Tursunzade, to the west of Dushanbe, turned into
violent clashes. Disturbances also occurred in the Shaartuz
district of the souther province of Khatlon, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Though the agreements reached in Ashgabat last July provided an
opportunity to stop fighting, they have not been implemented, the
report noted.
</P>
<P>
"In the present circumstances, it is imperative to resume the
political dialogue," the U.N. secretary-general stressed.
</P>
<P>
As the people of Tajikistan are faced with an acute crisis,
displaced civilians and vulnerable groups of people have increased
rapidly, he also urged the international community to provide
humanitarian assistance.

<HEADLINE> 10 Minutes Delay of UN Meeting Costs 875,000 Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- An average of 10
minutes delay for each meeting of the United Nations will cost the
international organization 875,000 U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Sylvana Foa, a spokeswoman for the U.N.
secretary-general, at a press briefing here today.
</P>
<P>
Improving efficiency has been on the agenda of the reforms of
the United Nations. There have long been complaints about meeting
delays in the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Foa said, "If the opening of every meeting being held in the
U.N. is delayed by 10 minutes, we lose 875,000 U.S. dollars." This
is because interpreters sitting idle in their booths, waiting for
the meeting to begin, and secretaries and officials had to rush
from one meeting room to another. One meeting would affect another
chronically, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
She urged delegates of all the member states to attend meetings
on time in order to help overcome the financial crisis of the U.N.

<P>
LONDON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Leading European stock markets
lost some of their early gains and ended mixed today after latest
U.S. economic figures damaged sentiment in New York.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economic data, rekindling U.S. interest rate rise
worries, and a weak opening on Wall Street trimmed the FTSE 100
index's 32 points rise, another new high, back to around 18
points.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt closed marginally lower in
lackluster trading, with the DAX-30 index down 1.26 points.
</P>
<P>
The lack of a Bundesbank rate cut came as little real surprise,
dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse finished the session also off their highs,
with the CAC-40 index ending 9.6 points higher.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that French stocks posted moderate gains on the
back of the Bank of France's move to trim its intervention rate by
10 basis points to 3.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading
British shares closed 18.6 points higher at 3,974.3. The Frankfurt
DAX-30 index closed 1.26 down at 2,6624.44. The Paris CAC-40 share
index finished up 9.6 at 2,082.33.

<HEADLINE> Labor Party to Refresh UK Foreign Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Labor party
promised today to end what it called Britain's growing isolation
in world affairs by taking a positive lead in Europe and boosting
the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
The party's foreign affairs spokesman Robin Cook said a Labor
government would reverse the "narrow nationalism" of the ruling
Conservatives, which he said was making the United Kingdom the odd
man out in world forums and costing it opportunities in global
business.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to businessmen in Leeds, northern England, Cook
said that the Labor party could provide a fresh start because it
understood the real world and wanted to be part of it.
</P>
<P>
The Labor leads the Conservatives in opinion polls ahead of a
general election, due to be held next spring.
</P>
<P>
Cook said, "We want to get Britain back to the heart of Europe,
leading in Europe, leading reform in Europe, putting an end to the
marginalization which has done so much damage to our country's
interests."
</P>
<P>
He said the priorities for the European Union were to open up
to the emerging democracies of central and eastern Europe and, in
the economic sphere, to realize the full potential of the single
market and tackle unemployment.
</P>
<P>
At the biennial summit of the Commonwealth that Britain will
chair in Autumn 1997, Cook said he would propose measures to
improve economic cooperation and dialogue among the 53 members of
the group, which links Britain to its former colonies.

<HEADLINE> US, Ukraine to Form Joint Commission on Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Ukraine will form a joint commission to increase cooperation
between the two countries, Vice President Al Gore's office said in
a statement today.
</P>
<P>
The commission, to be headed by Gore and Ukrainian President
Leonid Kuchma, will meet annually to assess the work of four
committees charged with promoting cooperation on foreign policy,
security, trade and investment and the economy, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the United State has arranged 1.9 billion
dollars within the international community this year in financial
commitments to support the economy of Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
"Ukraine is the third leading recipient of U.S. assistance, 330
million dollars in grants and 675 million dollars in bilateral
credits for 1996," it said.
</P>
<P>
"For its part, Ukraine has firmly established democratic
elections and market reforms have gone far toward stabilizing the
economy and creating a foundation for growth," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has also overseen the removal of all nuclear weapons on
its territory, "thereby setting a sterling example of
nonproliferation," the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Perot Ready to File Lawsuit Over Debate Exclusion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Ross Perot, presidential
candidate for the Reform Party, said today that he was filing a
lawsuit against a ruling to exclude him from presidential
debates in the run up to the election in November.
</P>
<P>
The Texas billionaire said the Commission on Presidential
Debates "violated the constitutional rights of the voters" when it
recommended Tuesday that debates be limited to U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Republican challenger Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
The commission recommended excluding Perot from the debates,
saying he has no chance of winning the presidency.
</P>
<P>
The first debate was originally set for September 25 in St
Louis. But that was ruled out by Clinton's camp as the president
is addressing the U.N. General Assembly the day before.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Dole's campaigns are still deadlocked over
rescheduling it. But Perot challenged Dole to meet him in St Louis.
</P>
<P>
"Bob Dole says he's going to go to St. Louis on September 25
and he'll be there whether President Clinton is there or not,"
Perot said on ABC Friday. "I'll be there, and so I say to Bob
Dole, `Meet me in St. Louis, Bob Dole, tell me you'll be there.'"
</P>
<P>
"I will see that the arena is readied. I will have everything
taken care of and it will be interesting to see if he will show up
and debate," Perot said on NBC.
</P>
<P>
Perot said the debate commission's logic was invalid, and
"violated the constitutional rights of the voters."
</P>
<P>
The commission had proposed 90-minute presidential debates on
September 25 in St. Louis, October 9 in St. Petersburg, Florida,
and October 16 in San Diego, and a vice presidential debate on
October 2 in Hartford, Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
The debate commission's recommendation to exclude Perot was
based in part on the commission's view that he had no realistic
chance of being elected. A Harris Poll afterward found 76 percent
of those surveyed thought Perot should have been included, even
though few thought he could be elected.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Legal Panel of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) has held its fifth session to discuss proposals on
dealing with existing Hong Kong laws submitted by the legal panel
of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) of the Preparatory
Committee of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Also discussed were the International Organizations And
Diplomatic Privileges Ordinance, Consular Relations Ordinance,
Secretary of State for Defence (Succession to Property) Ordinance,
Royal Hong Kong Regiment Ordinance, Compulsory Service Ordinance,
and Army and Royal Air Force Legal Service Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
It was suggested that the ordinances not be adopted as laws of
the future Hong Kong SAR, because they contravene the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
After the People's Republic of China resumes sovereignty over
Hong Kong, the Central Government will be responsible for the
SAR's defence and foreign affairs, and diplomatic and consular
privileges and immunities will be protected by laws that apply to
the Hong Kong SAR, according to the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The Crimes Ordinance was also discussed at the meeting. Members
said they agree with the PWC legal panel's opinion and suggested
that it become law in the Hong Kong SAR.

SHANGHAI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Steel output is expected to
be close to 100 million tons in China and steel products more than
82 million tons this year, both of them a record, according to a
conference at the '96 Shanghai International Metallurgy Expo in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
China's steel output has gone from 65.35 million tons in 1990
to 93.5 million tons last year, a 7.4 percent annual increase, or
5.63 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Output of high-quality steel plate and steel tube reached 32
million tons in 1995, accounting for 37.6 percent of the year's
total rolled steel output.
</P>
<P>
The varieties of high-quality steel products that meet with
international standards increased from 19 in 1991 to 115 last
year, while output jumped from one million tons to 12 million
tons during that period.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ninth Five-Year Plan, China's steel output
will top 110 million tons by the year 2000, with an annual
increase of three percent, and output of steel products will
exceed 96 million tons, with an annual increase of 3.7 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Local Government
in the Palestinian Saeb Erekat said that the recent meetings
between the Palestinian and the Israeli leaders did not yield any
tangible results so far.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official made the remarks during an interview
with the Egyptian Sawt Al-Arab (the Voice of Arabs) radio today.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli side tries to renegotiate the already-negotiated
and agreed-upon issues," Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there were 34 articles in the interim
Palestinian-Israeli agreement which the Israeli side did not
carry out.
</P>
<P>
The statements of the new Israeli government concerning the
Palestinians mean the undermining of the Middle East peace
process and the return to violence and counter-violence, Erekat
said.
</P>
<P>
The defect of the peace process is the bias of the United
States, which is a co-sponsor of the peace process, in favor of
Israel, he added, noting that it was unacceptable to deal with
Israel as if it were above law and had rights without duties.
</P>
<P>
Erekat praised the efforts of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
to push forward the peace process, adding that these efforts were
"the only approach to support the Arab rights on the
international arena."

<HEADLINE> France to Maintain EU Ban on British Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- France said today it will
maintain the European Union's (EU) ban on British beef with "total
firmness," following London's decision Thursday to suspend
slaughtering cattle suspected of mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
French Agriculture Minister Philippe Vasseur said he regretted
Britain's unilateral decision and said he had called for the
tightening of border controls on British cattle and beef.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the British decision will change nothing --
and instead could make us more vigilant -- about the ban on
British cattle products and their by-products," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain decided to stop what it called the "big cattle cull"
after a research group from Oxford University said that mad cow
disease will die out naturally by 2002. About 125,000
British cattle are due to be slaughtered because they are believed
to be at risk of carrying mad cow disease, or BSE.
</P>
<P>
The cull was part of a package agreed at the EU summit in June
in return for a gradual lifting of the ban on British beef. The
European Commission imposed the world-wide ban in March after the
British government admitted a possible link between BSE, a deadly
disease affecting cattle, and a similar brain-wasting disease in
humans which could have been contracted by eating contaminated
beef.
</P>
<P>
Britain's decision to suspend the cull has triggered an outcry
from nearly all other EU members.
</P>
<P>
The French minister said that France does not intend to wage a
beef war with Britain, and that Paris wishes to maintain "a
cordial relationship with London."
</P>
<P>
Luc Guyau, president of the Federation Nationale d'Exploitants
Agricoles, a major French agricultural trade union, said that the
ban should be respected to the letter because it protected the
security of consumers as well as producers.
</P>
<P>
French beef farmers have been badly hit by the mad cow crisis,
with beef prices falling by one third in the past several months.

<HEADLINE> French Schools Stop Classes to Discuss School Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Primary, secondary and
professional high schools stopped classes all across France for
two hours this morning to discuss school violence after a teenage
pupil shot a schoolmate by accident.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Francois Bayrou ordered all schools to start
a debate today on violence which, he said had become a serious
problem for pupils.
</P>
<P>
He issued the order after an unidentified 15-year-old was
accidentally shot dead by another schoolboy as he was leaving for
home Tuesday afternoon in the town of Montereau, some 60
kilometers south of Paris.
</P>
<P>
Bayrou said the debate was aimed at raising social awareness of
school violence among parents, staff and pupils and giving
children the chance to speak out.
</P>
<P>
But the call also aroused controversy among some groups and
teachers, who said Bayrou was over-reacting by presenting schools
as "a place of life and death."
</P>
<P>
Marc Blondel, leader of the trade union Force Ouvriere,
said such a move risked encouraging children to turn their games
of cops and robbers into real-life dramas.
</P>
<P>
Eric Depardieux, a researcher on school violence, said that if
schools are to be better protected against violence and brutality,
"one should take seriously all less spectacular forms of violence
such as rudeness."
</P>
<P>
However, he said the current situation in French schools was
not yet at boiling point.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the French schools inspectorate, the
total number of violent incidents reported by educational
establishments in "sensitive areas" of one academic prefecture
between 1993 and 1994 was between 200 and 300.
</P>
<P>
Among the cases, 75 percent were reported by secondary
schools, 15 by professional high schools and 9 percent by
general and technical schools, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It said that 58 percent of the cases were physical aggression,
35 percent verbal aggression, 12 percent stealing, six percent
racketeering, and 16 percent "degrading action."
</P>
<P>
Teachers are not exempt from school violence. J. Mario
Hrenstein, a psychiatrist from the General Mutuality of National
Education, told Le Figaro that he has been in contact with 269 school
teachers who have been violently attacked by their students.
</P>
<P>
Twelve percent suffered serious psychiatric traumas, while 25
percent asked for a change of job, he said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Ready to Maintain Troops in Bosnia if Needed </HEADLINE>

KUALA LUMPUR, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is ready to
continue stationing its troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina even beyond
the current mandate of the United Nations Implementation Force,
which expires on December 20, Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar
said today.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the situation in the Balkan state has

said his government had decided to offer Malaysian troops for
continued peacekeeping duties there.
</P>
<P>
"But the decision (to continue stationing Malaysian troops
there) depends on whether NATO and the Bosnian government want
international troops to remain in that country after the
deadline," he was quoted by Malaysia's official news agency
Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The role and size of our troops there after December 20 also
depend very much on their (NATO and the Bosnian government's)
decisions," Syed Hamid said.
</P>
<P>
At present, over 1,000 Malaysian troops are in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
He said the continued presence of a multinational force in
Bosnia was in line with the international community's aspiration
to ensure lasting peace and stability there.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia feels that international troops are still needed in
Bosnia to guarantee the country's smooth reconstruction and
development in accordance with the Dayton Agreement which ended
the fighting, he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is expected to make a decision by November
on whether to extend the mandate of the U.N. Implementation Force,
according to Syed Hamid.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls for Early Implementation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 20 (Xinhua) -- An official Iraqi newspaper
spelled out today the necessity of establishing an appropriate
mechanism to implement the memo of understanding signed by Iraq
and the United Nations this May, and reducing what it called
unjustified obstacles and hurdles.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the United Nations signed the agreement on May 20 which
will let Iraq sell 1 billion U.S. dollars of oil every 90 days to
buy food and medicine for its suffering people.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal has been delayed in the wake of Iraq's
military operation in late August in a Kurdish safe haven in northern
Iraq set up by the U.S.-led allied troops after the Gulf War in
1991.
</P>
<P>
The official paper Al Thawra in its today's edition
accused the U.S. Administration of obstructing the
implementation of the memorandum.
</P>
<P>
It said that such a behavior on the part of Washington was not
directed against Iraq alone, but it was also constituting a
challenge to the will of the international community, so that
it represented a threat to the moral structure of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper added that four months have lapsed since the
signing of the memorandum, yet, its implementation is still
subject to procrastination and delay on the basis of "unfounded
allegations," the last of which has been U.S. objection to the
pricing of Iraqi petroleum and the obstruction of banking
procedures at the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
It indicated that U.N. Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali had expressed on several occasions his understanding
of Iraq's conditions as well as his intention to expedite the
implementation of the memorandum.
</P>
<P>
The next step ought to focus on the application of the various
articles of the memorandum without delay, particularly the fact
that the U.N. secretary general was authorized to supervise the
execution, the paper claimed.
</P>
<P>
The firm stance taken by Russia, France, China and many others
within the U.N. Security Council and outside it has been decisive
in persuading the U.S. to abandon its plans to postpone the
memo's implementation, it said.
</P>
<P>
It expressed hope that the stance will be maintained in support
of the U.N. and that the said states will continue to pressurize
Washington to give up its policies of "fabricating disputes and
creating pretexts" to obstruct the implementation of the memo.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was ready to cooperate fully with the parties concerned so
that the memorandum could be implemented as soon as possible, and
that the U.S. desire to "starve and harm" the Iraqi people would be
diminished, the paper concluded.

CAIRO, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today ended 10 days of
massive military maneuvers participated by some 35,000 soldiers
from the army, navy and air force.
</P>
<P>
The war games, Egypt's largest since the 1973 Middle East war,
were successful, Defense Minister Field Marshal Mohammed Hussein
Tantawi said.
</P>
<P>
The maneuvers, code-named "Badr '96," were the first of its
kind since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces started the exercises on September 10 with an
aim of testing their fighting capabilities in various strategic
directions, according to military sources.
</P>
<P>
New weapons and equipment were used during the maneuvers,
which ended near the Red Sea, Sudan and Libya, or in the east,
south and west of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Tantawi has said that the exercises are not directed against
anybody.
</P>
<P>
"They are just part of a previously scheduled program that has
nothing to do with current regional and international
conditions," Tantawi, also Commander-in-Chief of the army, said
at the beginning of the war games.

<HEADLINE> Macao Stops Transferring Money to Portugal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Macao stopped transferring
money to the so-called "Oriental Foundation", which sends the
money from Macao to Portugal, from January 1 this year, officials
revealed today.
</P>
<P>
Guo Jiading, chief representative of the Chinese side of the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG), told reporters today
after meeting with his Portuguese counterpart Antonio Santana
Carlos that this was a result of consultation between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
"That has provided a basis for the settlement of the question
of the 'Oriental Foundation,'" said Guo. "We hope that the two
sides would move forward on that basis and achieve a solution
beneficial to Macao."
</P>
<P>
Established several years ago and aimed at transferring money
from Macao to Portugal, the "Oriental Foundation" was strongly
opposed by local Macao residents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two ambassadors discussed questions on
nationalities of Macao-born Portuguese in today's meeting,
alongside with topics to be discussed in the 27th session of the
JLG to be held in Beijing on October 29.
</P>
<P>
Guo said that the Chinese government is willing to adopt a
flexible policy, which, on the basis of the Chinese nationality
law, allows Macao-born Portuguese to choose either Chinese
citizenship or Portuguese citizenship, and will never force them
into Chinese citizenship.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that those people will continue to live in Macao and
contribute to the prosperity and stability of Macao," Guo said.
"Their rights will be fully guaranteed in accordance with the
Basic Law of Macao."
</P>
<P>
Carlos said that he hopes common ground would be found as soon
as possible through joint efforts of the two sides on such
questions as nationality.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting between the two ambassadors was in preparation
for the upcoming 27th session of the JLG.

JAKARTA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia plans to install
five million telephone lines in the 6th five-year development plan
which began in 1994, an official said.
</P>
<P>
The plan to install the large number of telephone lines is in

national development, Secretary General of the Ministry of
Tourism, Post and Telecommunications Jonathan L. Parapak said in
Palembang, South Sumatra on Thursday.
</P>

<P>
HONG KONG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The upside potential for
Hong Kong's stock market in 1996-97 will range between 10 to 15
percent, below the long-term average but broadly in line with
expected earnings growth, according to Salomon Brother, one of the
 world's major investment banks.
</P>
<P>
In a recent report, Deep Kapur, Salomon's chief regional
strategist, said that earnings forecasts in other regional markets
 have been revised downwards over the past few months, but
forecasts for Hong Kong have remained stable.
</P>
<P>
Kapur said that declining unemployment, rising consumer
confidence and an expected revival in the territory's consumption
growth will push its economic growth for 1996-97 above that of
1995.
</P>
<P>
He said that against a background of cyclical recovery in the
economy and positive revisions in earnings estimates, compound
annual earnings growth ranging between 10 and 15 percent is
achievable over the 1996-97 period.
</P>
<P>
Salomon's most favorable sectors in Hong Kong include banks and
 telecommunications, while the firm is neutral on conglomerates
and property and underweight on utilities and other smaller
sectors.

PHUKET, THAILAND, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Parliamentary
delegates from Southeast Asian nations today moved closer towards
the establishment of an electronic board bulletin system as part
of efforts to strengthen inter-parliamentary cooperation in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The 17th General Assembly of the ASEAN Inter-parliamentary
Organization has agreed to hold a technical workshop to this end
in the Philippines early next year, according to a resolution
adopted at the meeting here.
</P>
<P>
The resolution asked all members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to send technical personnel to
participate and cooperate actively in the workshop.
</P>
<P>
"In the electronic age, it is now possible to communicate on a
regular basis, through the computer modem without people having to
leave their offices," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The idea was proposed by the Philippine delegation during the
last AIPO General Assembly held in Singapore on 18-23 September
1995.
</P>
<P>
The new facility for the exclusive use by lawmakers,
parliamentary staff and policy research bureaus will be utilized
to conduct regular exchanges of views at the staff and managerial
levels to widen perspectives and generate consensus on regional
and international issues.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was ending today, also called on member
countries to continue to consult each other and create an
effective inter-parliamentary mechanism to strengthen their
legislative cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Somali Warlords Accused of Receiving Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Somali warlord Hussein
Mohamed Aidid today accused another two warlords, Ali Mahdi
Mohamed and Osman Ali Atto, of receiving bribes from a foreign
company.
</P>
<P>
Hussein's Radio South Mogadishu claimed the two men have
received a sum of 1.5 million U.S. Dollars from the former
Somali-Italian owned fishing company of SHIFCO during their visit
in Yemen early this north.
</P>
<P>
The bribes were given to facilitate the release of the
company's two fishing ships, named Farah Omar and 21 October and
being held at Igo Beach, 350 kms north of Mogadishu, by the Ali
Mahdi's militiamen since July 12 this year, said the radio.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Hussein's officials as saying that they have all the
evidence to prove that the bribes had already been transferred
into foreign bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for Ali Mahdi Mohamed denied the
accusation made by Hussein Aidid's faction and described it as
"total misleading propaganda."
</P>
<P>
"The two chairmen (Mahdi and Atto) have been there for new
tentative to pave the way for a broad based national
reconciliation conference," said Mohamed Moallim, press secretary
of Ali Mahdi.
</P>
<P>
More than seven foreigners from Italy, Tanzania and Portugal are
believed to have been held as hostages by the gunmen in the two
ships. So far, the gunmen have not made any demands of ransom.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Honorary President of the
China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), Bo
Yibo, met with Stephen Perry, vice-chairman of the China-Britain
Trade Group, here today.
</P>
<P>
The China-Britain Trade Group was formed by combining the
Sino-British Trade Council and the 48 Group of British Traders
with China in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Bo welcomed Perry to China and mentioned the efforts of the 48
Group of British Traders, with Stephen's father, Jack Perry, as
one of the founders.
</P>
<P>
"Jack is an old friend of mine," Bo said, and "that two
generations of your family have been devoted to developing
Sino-British trade is indeed worth noting."
</P>
<P>
In speaking about the senior Perry and others of the 48 Group
who broke the economic blockade of Western countries against China
in the 1950s to get involved in Sino-British trade, Bo said he
hopes that Stephen Perry will continue the pioneering business
spirit and make a greater contribution to bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
Bo also briefed the guests on China's developments since the
reforms and opening-up policies were introduced, and said that, as
a developing country, China will continue the policies.

<HEADLINE> 96th Inter-Parliamentary Conference Closes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The 96th conference of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) closed here this afternoon,
adopting three resolutions respectively on human rights, food and
anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, "Promoting Greater Respect and Protection of
Human Rights in General and in Particular for Women and Children,"
was adopted after a draft presented by the Chinese Group had been
revised following examinations.
</P>
<P>
The final resolution stresses that all countries should, in the
spirit of the Charter of the United Nations, shoulder the
responsibility for promoting and encouraging respect for human
rights and fundamental freedoms of all people, regardless of
race, skin color, sex, language, religion and social status.
</P>
<P>
It also calls on all governments to promote and protect human
rights on the basis of equality and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the resolution urges the United Nations to take
into consideration the negative effect of trade sanctions on the
rights of women and children.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, "Policies and Strategies to Ensure the Right to
Food in this Time of Globalization of the Economy and Trade
Liberalization," appeals to the international community to make
more efforts to solve the problem of food shortage in developing
countries, especially African and the least developed countries,
so as to contribute to the elimination of hunger and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
The resolution stresses the need to improve the world economic
situation, in particular through debt relief and the encouragement
of direct foreign investment in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the resolution "Worldwide Ban on Anti-personnel
Mines and the Need for Mine Clearance for Humanitarian Purposes,"
the Chinese Group made an explanation on its reservations on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
It explained that the delegation of China's National People's
Congress appreciates and supports the humanitarian efforts of the
international community to seek ways of preventing civilians from
being killed by mines.
</P>
<P>
Like many other countries, China believes that, when there is
no other effective alternative, mines are a means for legitimate
defense by sovereign states, especially those with a long land
boundary.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation believes that efforts to solve
mine-related problems should seek to achieve balance between
humanitarian concern and justifiable military need. Therefore,
indiscriminate and complete ban on anti-personnel mines is neither
reasonable nor practical.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarians from various countries delivered speeches at
the closing session, praising China for its outstanding
organizational work for the conference.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Sorour, president of IPU Council, extended thanks to the
National People's Congress, the Government and the people of China
for their contributions to success of the conference.
</P>
<P>
Tian Jiyun, president of the 96th Conference of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union and vice-chairman of the Standing
Committee of China's National People's Congress, said the
conference will have positive effects on strengthening cooperation
between parliaments, enhancing friendship among peoples in all
countries, and promoting world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
The group of China's National People's Congress conducted
extensive exchanges with other parliamentary groups, Tian said,
adding that the NPC and its Standing Committee will continue to
enhance exchanges and cooperation with parliaments of other
countries.

<P>
MOSCOW, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, Chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), arrived here this afternoon for an official
and goodwill visit to Russia, the final leg of his five-nation
European tour.
</P>
<P>
The visit is the first of its kind by the CPPCC chairman.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued on his arrival at Moscow's
Bnukovo airport, Li said "in recent years, satisfactory results
have been achieved in Sino-Russian relations."
</P>
<P>
"The frequent exchanges of high-level visits has injected fresh
vitality into bilateral ties, and bilateral cooperation in the
economy and trade, culture, as well as science and technology has
deepened steadily," he said.
</P>
<P>
"During the visit to China by President (Boris) Yeltsin last
April leaders of the two countries announced that China and Russia
would develop a strategic and cooperative partnership based on
equality and mutual trust geared towards the 21st century, thus
ushering in a new era of Sino-Russian relations."
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that the new relationship between China and Russia
not only serves the fundamental interests of the two countries and
their peoples, but also contributes to peace, stability and the
development of the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
He believes that his current visit, which will further enhance
understanding between the two peoples and promote mutual
beneficial cooperation between the two countries, will be a
complete success.
</P>
<P>
Li was invited to Russia by the State Duma, the lower house of
the Russian parliament. He had already been to Poland, the
Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland before arriving in Russia.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Li is expected to meet with Russian leaders

bodies, and the World Trade Organization to take appropriate
action to readjust the current international economic order and
establish fair and just relations between all countries of the
world.
</P>
<P>
It emphasizes the need for creditor countries to take effective
measures to cancel or reduce the debt burden of developing
countries and eventually solve their debt problems.
</P>
<P>
It points out that the current world economic order is still
unjust, and therefore hinders the realization of human rights and
fundamental freedoms and adversely affects women and children in
particular.
</P>
<P>
In the same time, it expresses deep concern about the
deterioration of living conditions in developing countries which
deprives their inhabitants of full enjoyment of their human rights
and, in particular, about the harmful effects of economic hardship
and a heavy foreign debt burden on the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The resolution says that in many parts of the world there are
many forms of discrimination and violence against women and
children resulting from poor social and economic conditions,
natural disasters, armed conflict, economic and sexual
exploitation, terrorism and drug trafficking, and hunger. The
conference is deeply concerned with this situation and requires
nations and the international community to take immediate and
effective remedial measures against it.
</P>
<P>
The resolution appeals to all countries to settle disputes and
differences peacefully through negotiations, to make concerted
efforts to promote economic and social development and to create
an environment conducive to the full enjoyment of human rights,
particularly by women and children. It also urges all governments
to take immediate measures to punish and eliminate all forms of
violence against women.
</P>
<P>
It calls on national parliaments, governments and the
international community to initiate an open in-depth debate to
adopt measures that will tackle the root causes of child
labor. And it urges national parliaments and governments to ensure
the provision of compulsory primary education and health care for
all children, particularly for girls and children from
marginalized groups.
</P>
<P>
The resolution calls on parliaments and governments worldwide
to strongly condemn and combat drug production and trafficking and
terrorism, as their destructive action begins with children and
through them, affects society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
It also calls on relevant parliaments and governments and the
international community to take emergency measures to protect the
rights of the child and particularly those of girls, abandoned
children, street children, children who are victims of economic
and sexual exploitation, including child pornography, child
prostitution or trafficking in human organs, children suffering
from diseases including AIDS, refugee and displaced children,
detained children, children suffering owing to armed conflict,
famine, drought and harm caused by other emergency
situations.

<HEADLINE> Japan Proposes New Law to Improve Living Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese National Chamber
of Agriculture made a proposal today, urging the government to
formulate a new agriculture law to improve people's living
standard.
</P>
<P>
A new basic agriculture law was needed to give priority to
improving people's livelihoods, according to a report of the
chamber submitted to Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister
Ichizo Ohara.
</P>
<P>
"Maximum efforts need to be made to reduce prices gaps between
home and abroad on farm products," the document was quoted as
saying by a Kyodo news agency report.
</P>
<P>
But it added that the unilateral liberalization of agricultural
markets would undermine Japan's self-sufficiency in farm products,
which should be secured particularly in staple foods like rice.
</P>
<P>
The chamber was expected to make a set of proposals on Japan's
agriculture policy at the requirement of the agricultural minister
in March last year.

<HEADLINE> IPC Resolution Calls for Solution to Food Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A resolution passed at the
96th Inter-Parliamentary Conference (IPC) which closed here today
calls on the international community to make more efforts to solve
the problem of food shortage in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
It urges more contribution made to elimination of hunger and
malnutrition in developing countries, especially African and the
least developed countries.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 parliamentarians from over 120 countries
expressed their deep concern over the fact that some 800 million
people in developing countries are suffering from food shortage
and 200 million children under the age of five from malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
They urged governments and international organizations to adopt
effective measures to promote economic and social development of
these countries and achieve global food security.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution named Policies and Strategies to Ensure the
Right to Food in this Time of Globalization of the Economy and
Trade Liberalization, the conference holds the view that the
problem of global food shortages has worsened over the past two
decades, and most developing countries have encountered
difficulties hard to surmount, such as unfavorable fluctuations of
food prices on international market, trade protectionism,
increasing debt burdens and imbalance in resources distribution.
</P>
<P>
The resolution recommends developing nations "give higher
priority to supporting food production and setting up the
necessary structures for efficient marketing and distribution,
which in turn will create jobs, in order to ensure an adequate
food supply and the equitable distribution of foodstuffs."
</P>
<P>
It also calls on the countries to increase investment in the
agricultural sector, in the process of accelerating
industrialization, and formulate policies to encourage bilateral
and multilateral international cooperation in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The conference urges the international community to support
training and scientific researches in developing nations to
advance the development of sustainable agriculture, and to
increase exchange of information on food production, processing
and storehousing techniques.
</P>
<P>
The resolution calls on the international community to adjust
the structure of aids to developing countries so as to ensure the
aids are used to ensure food supplies and eliminate hunger in the
accepting countries. And developed countries should take concrete
measures to increase the supply of basic foodstuffs to
least-developed and net food-importing countries.
</P>
<P>
It stresses the need to improve the world economic situation,
in particular through debt relief and the encouragement of direct
foreign investment in developing countries; and developed nations
should, following the relevant principles of the World Trade
Organization, facilitate trade of agricultural commodities with
poorer countries, and establish specific dispensations for
developing nations whose agricultural sector plays a key role in
the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also emphasizes the right to food is "one of the
basic fundamental human rights," and rejects "any use of the food
issue by one or more countries to exert political and economic
pressure on other countries."

<HEADLINE> Interpret Our Monetary Policy Correctly: Bank Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank governor
has called for a correct interpretation of the country's stringent
monetary policy in order to ensure its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, told an
international seminar attended by senior company executives that
China will continue to follow a relatively tight monetary policy
during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000) and make
inflation control the first task of its financial macro-control.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental goal of our appropriately tight monetary
policy is to stabilize the value of our currency and make the
inflation rate drop significantly," Dai said. "And the nucleus of
the policy is a combination of quantitative control and qualitative
upgrading, rather than being merely quantitatively tight."
</P>
<P>
The governor said that the relatively tight monetary policy has
three major aspects: keeping inflation below the economic growth
rate, setting a reasonable growth rate for the money supply, and
improving the financial macro-control system through the
introduction of more indirect monetary policy instruments.
</P>
<P>
"The relatively tight monetary policy should be carried out in
keeping with its stability and continuity," Dai said, "and at the
same time there must be some flexibility."
</P>
<P>
In other words, some elasticity should be allowed in financial
macro-control and the implementation of the monetary policy, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"We must not oversimplify the policy and interpret it in terms
of absolutes, and we must not regard any readjustment in financial
macro-control as turning around or abandoning the relatively tight
monetary policy," Dai noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has this year twice cut the interest rates,
but only in response to a declining inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we cannot draw the conclusion that the central bank
has loosened its grip on credit supply," Dai said.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the cuts were aimed at slowing down the expansion of
the broad money supply (M2) and spurning the growth of the narrow
money supply (M1), in order to coordinate the short-term target of
achieving an economic soft landing and the medium and long-term
targets of reducing potential inflationary pressures, he said.
</P>
<P>
The M1 and M2 money supplies are expected to grow at an average
annual rate of 18 and 23 percent in the five years to 2000,
according to a central bank plan.
</P>
<P>
Dai reiterated that the appropriately tight monetary policy
will not be changed during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period, though
there will be occasional readjustments in financial
macro-control.

the two countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Qatar's National Oil Distribution Co. raised
lead-free gasoline production to 5,500 barrels per day this year,
up from 1,500 barrels a day in 1994, according to Thursday's
Peninsula daily available here today.
</P>
<P>
The rise by the state-owned company aims at meeting growing
demand in domestic and foreign markets, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a company official as saying that lead-free
gasoline production will reach 10,000 barrels per day in 1999,

ships sailing between Egyptian ports on the Mediterranean and
Aqaba even enjoy a 25 percent reduction in fees for transiting the
canal.
</P>

operating between Aqaba port and the eastern Mediterranean ports
via Israel.

<HEADLINE> African Anthem Composer to Be Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The name of Enoch
Sontonga, father of Nkosi Sikelel' Iafrica (God Bless Africa),
will be immortalized on heritage day, September 24, a local daily
''the Citizen'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
While showground road in Johannesburg would also be renamed
after him and a memorial erected at his new-found grave in
Braamfonte im cemetery, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Nkosi Sikelel' Iafrica, is a National Anthem of South Africa
and most English-speaking countries in the continent as well.
</P>
<P>
Enoch Sontonga, born in the Uitenhage district of the Eastern
Cape in 1873 and died on April 118, 1905, composed the music and
wrote the first verse and chorus of Nkosi Sikelel' Iafrica in
1897.
</P>
<P>
In 1927, the poet Samuel Mqhaye wrote the additional seven
verses that make up the whole song.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on Thursday, Johannesburg Mayor Isaac
Mogase said it had been approved that Sontonga's grave in the
original Christian native area on the northern side of the
cemetery adjacent to showground road be declared a national
monument.
</P>
<P>
During the heritage day celebrations, President Nelson Mandela
was expected to unveil the Enoch Sontonga Memorial and Gauteng
Premier Tokyo Sexwale would rename the burial site to Enoch
Sontonga Memorial Park.
</P>
<P>
While Mogase would rename showground show road to Enoch
Sontonga avenue in honor of the 32 year-old composer.
</P>
<P>
Sontonga's grave was discovered after two years of research
initiated by the national monuments council and Hal Shaper,
author and musician studying the life of Enoch Sontonga.

<HEADLINE> IPC Resolution Calls for Solution to Food Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A resolution passed at the
96th Inter-Parliamentary Conference (IPC) which closed here today
calls on the international community to make more efforts to solve
the problem of food shortage in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
It urges more contribution made to elimination of hunger and
malnutrition in developing countries, especially African and the
least developed countries.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 parliamentarians from over 120 countries
expressed their deep concern over the fact that some 800 million
people in developing countries are suffering from food shortage
and 200 million children under the age of five from malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
They urged governments and international organizations to adopt
effective measures to promote economic and social development of
these countries and achieve global food security.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution named Policies and Strategies to Ensure the
Right to Food in this Time of Globalization of the Economy and
Liberalization, the conference holds the view that the problem of
global food shortages has worsened over the past two decades, and
most developing countries have encountered difficulties hard to
surmount, such as unfavorable fluctuations of food prices on
international market, trade protectionism, increasing debt
burdens and imbalance in resources distribution.
</P>
<P>
The resolution recommends developing nations "give higher
priority to supporting food production and setting up the
necessary structures for efficient marketing and distribution,
which in turn will create jobs, in order to ensure an adequate
food supply and the equitable distribution of foodstuffs."
</P>
<P>
It also calls on the countries to increase investment in the
agricultural sector, in the process of accelerating
industrialization, and formulate policies to encourage bilateral
and multilateral international cooperation in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The conference urges the international community to support
training and scientific researches in developing nations to
advance the development of sustainable agriculture, and to
increase exchange of information on food production, processing
and storehousing techniques.
</P>
<P>
The resolution calls on the international community to adjust
the structure of aids to developing countries so as to ensure the
aids are used to ensure food supplies and eliminate hunger in the
accepting countries. And developed countries should take concrete
measures to increase the supply of basic foodstuffs to
least-developed and net food-importing countries.
</P>
<P>
It stresses the need to improve the world economic situation,
in particular through debt relief and the encouragement of direct
foreign investment in developing countries; and developed nations
should, following the relevant principles of the World Trade
Organization, facilitate trade of agricultural commodities with
poorer countries, and to establish specific dispensations for
developing nations whose agricultural sector plays a key role in
the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also emphasizes the right to food is "one of the
basic fundamental human rights," and rejects "any use of the food
issue by one or more countries to exert political and economic
pressure on other countries."

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Economic, Technological and Industrial Zones Become Pillars of Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's New Technology
Development Zone, Economic and Technological Development Zone and
district and county level industrial zones are expected to play a
key role in local economic development in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
To date, these zones have attracted some 6,000 enterprises, of
which more than 1,200 are overseas-funded firms. Total overseas
investment in the areas has exceeded 1.2 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 famous overseas companies, including GE, GM, AT&AMP;T,
IBM, Founder, Stone, Hewlett Packard, Kenkel Kgaa, ABB,
Mitsubishi, Matsushita, Sumitomo and Hitach have opened agencies
in the zones. In 1995, industrial output value reached 20 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
These zones are mainly engaged in the development of electronic
information, biological engineering, integration of machinery and
electronics, and new materials.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing New Technologies Development Zone, the first such
region approved by the State Council, has attracted over 4,400 new
technological enterprises since it opened in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of June, the zone's total
income from technological development, industry and trade reached
10.93 billion yuan, up by 26.4 percent over the same period two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Mayor Hu Zhaoguang said that by the year 2000, the ratio
of the zone's GNP to Beijing's total GNP should reach 25 percent,
up from the current 3.8 percent, and the ratio of the zone's
industrial output value is to rise from the current 2.3 percent to
some 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
From its construction in 1992 through the end of July, the
Beijing Economic and Technological Development Zone had attracted
more than 140 enterprises, 75 of which are overseas-funded firms
involving 520 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight enterprises which have gone into operation
realized 370 million yuan in industrial output value in the first
half of this year.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that the zone will have an annual industrial
output value of 30 billion yuan by the year 2000, and its earnings
from exports are to reach one billion US dollars. The figures
should double by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
A group of district and county level industrial development
zone have also emerged and are playing important roles in
promoting local economic development.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that the total industrial output value of all
these development zones will come to 110 billion yuan and
pre-taxation profits will hit 20 billion yuan by the year 2000.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin
Mkapa said trade sanctions imposed by Burundi's neighbors would
not be lifted until the military junta of Major Pierre Buyoya
initiated unconditional return to democracy in that country.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa told visiting U.S. congressmen Harry Johnston
and Douglas Peerson, who called on him at the State House here on
Thursday evening that Tanzania and other Great Lakes countries
were keenly watching developments in Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
He said the neighboring states were consulting to hold a
meeting soon to review the situation in Burundi, according to a
statement issued by the State House.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that Tanzania understood the
suffering caused by the sanctions but said the embargo was
necessary to end ethnic killings in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"The neighboring states are not being unnecessarily vicious in
their imposition and maintenance of the sanctions. We are
following with keen interest the developments in that country for
any indications of serious moves toward an unconditional
negotiating process," he told the congressmen.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. legislators, who had just returned from a visit to
Benaco, the largest refugee camp in the country located in Ngara
District, commended the government and Tanzanians for their
hospitality to refugees.

<HEADLINE> Reform Makes Fengyang Attractive (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, the local government organized surplus rural
laborers to work in economically-developed coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Many whose ideas were broadened by city life, and who learned
advanced skills and made money, have gone back home to start
businesses. Some skilled and business people from coastal areas
also have come to work in Fengyang.
</P>
<P>
Cai Quansheng, who formerly worked at a street-run enterprise
in Suzhou, an economically booming city in Jiangsu Province, works
at the Liufu Automobile Repairing Plant in Fengyang.
</P>
<P>
"Although this is a township plant, its system suits me best,
and I can display all my talent here," said Cai, who earns 12,000
yuan annually -- twice as much as his former wages in Suzhou.
</P>
<P>
Lin Xiang left his private plastic factory in Wenzhou in
Zhejiang Province two years ago to buy shares in the Fengyang
Cement Plant.
</P>
<P>
"It is worth working here, and I have earned more than 100,000
yuan from my shares and wages a year, twice as much as my former
income in Zhejiang," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu Zhaoren, a noted agro-technician in Anhui Province, said that
the change of China's economic policy has made Fengyang, which was
deserted by local residents in the past, attractive.
</P>
<P>
"The flowing of people from coastal areas to interior areas
indicated the beginning of limiting the gap between the
economically developed east and the comparatively backward central
part of the country," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The booming of rural industrial enterprises has promoted the
local economy: Anhui Province's gross industrial output value rose
by 18.2 percent annually from 1981 to 1995.

BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
welcomed a well-known energy enterprise in the United States to
invest in China by building power projects.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with E. Linn Draper, chairman of the board of
directors and chief executive officer of the American Electric
Power (AEP), Li said here that it is a good beginning that the AEP
proposes to build joint venture power factories using Chinese-made
equipment, noting that China's power-generating equipment is
competitive both in quality and price.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that cooperation between the two sides can be
continuously promoted," he added.
</P>
<P>
Draper said that the AEP values its cooperation with China, and
will continue to do so in the future.
</P>
<P>
The AEP is greatly interested in expanding its cooperation with
China, he said, adding that it is an important measure for the AEP
to build such power factories using Chinese-made equipment.

<P>
HEFEI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Millionaire Gao Yunlian, a
native of Fengyang, now finds it hard to believe that he went
begging with his parents as a child.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, Gao was a migrant worker in coastal Jiangsu and
Zhejiang provinces, which had better economic foundations than
his hometown in Anhui Province. In 1990, he returned home to open
a share-holding cement plant.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old Gao, now chairman of the board of directors and
director of Fengyang Cement Plant, which has fixed assets of more
than 30 million yuan, attributes his success to China's current
reform policy and opening up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
"Without the reform, I might be still a farmer who could
hardly make both ends meet, and go begging with my children, just
like my parents and grandparents," he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 people in Fengyang have had similar
experiences, as beggars who became workers outside their hometown,
eventually becoming businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Fengyang County in northeast Anhui Province was known as the
"Hometown of Beggars," where about 50,000 poor farmers left their
hometowns to turn to others for handouts every year. It is also
famed for taking the lead in carrying out the national rural
economic reform in 1978.
</P>
<P>
"Now these same people with the same land not only have enough
to eat and wear, but also have surplus grain," said Wu Tingmei, a
county official.
</P>
<P>
The county has more than 20,000 enterprises employing more than
100,000 surplus rural laborers and over 20,000 outsiders, one
fourth of whom came from coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
He believes Fengyang's low grain output stemmed from the
egalitarian "iron rice bowl" policy, which dampened farmers'
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Fengyang led the country in successfully carrying out
a contracted household responsibility system with remuneration
linked to output. Its grain output reached 600 million kilograms
last year, up from 150 million kilometers in 1978, and became a
well-known market-oriented grain production base in the
country.

Meanwhile, he added, foreign banks could help ABC to modernize
its services and facilities as well as train bank personnel.
</P>

According to Shi, ABC, with a total assets of 1,230.9 billion
yuan, ranks the third among all Chinese banking institutions. The

CANBERRA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
continued its bumping ride today by ending the week's trade firmer
on cross rates.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was traded at 79.19 US cents on the close

</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was entrenched in a narrow range between
78.70 and 79.20 US cents. Weakening commodity prices in world

between Australia and the United States cast a shadow on the
short-term movement of the Aussie dollar.
</P>
<P>
However, local economists expected the Australian dollar to
surge to a record high in the next 18 months, because the world
economy is picking up speed.
</P>

The Australian dollar ended at 86.88 yen against the Japanese
yen from 86.36 yen on Thursday.

It was also firmer against the German mark, ending at 1.1974

<HEADLINE> Middle East Peace Process at Risk: Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat said on Thursday that the Middle East peace process
was "at risk," as Israel would not honor the accords it had
already accepted and the commitments made.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who was on a two-day visit to the central German state
of Hessen, strongly denounced the Israeli policy when he was
addressing the state parliament, saying that it did not make any
contribution to building up common life and trust between Israelis
and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Hostility and war seem to be appearing again on the horizon,"
said Arafat. "Disappointment and frustration are increasing, and
it is just such things which would drag the region back to
extremism, violence and terrorism."
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinian leader stressed that his people would move
on to seek justice and peace in the region together with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat urged all those who are concerned about peace,
especially Germany, which "has its outstanding position and
influence in the Middle East," to persuade Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to respect Israel's commitments.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is expected to visit Germany next Thursday to hold
talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
In order to break the "stagnation" of the Middle East peace
process resulting from the Israeli policy, six important political
issues -- the issue of Hebron, the redeployment of Israeli troops,
the lift of economic embargo, the end to building Israeli
settlements, the release of all political prisoners and the
opening of a security corridor between Gaza Strip and Israel --
should be sincerely resolved, Arafat added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also made a brief visit to Bonn and met with German
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, as well as President Roman Herzog.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Declines in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total trade
declined by 6.5 percent in August as non-oil domestic exports fell
by 6.3 percent, the Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB)
announced today.
</P>
<P>
It said that on a monthly basis, total trade decreased by 6.5
percent in August this year as growth in both non-oil domestic
exports and re-exports remained volatile. Non-oil domestic exports
slid by 6.3 percent in the month after an increase of 6.3 percent
in July and a drop of 6.1 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, re-exports went down by 4.2 percent in August after
a rise of 5.8 percent in July and a decline of 2.2 percent in
June.
</P>
<P>
The TDB noted that on a three-month moving average basis, total
trade at current prices decreased by 0.8 percent in August. In
line with the slowdown of global demand for electronics and
related products as well as oversupply of semiconductors, non-oil
domestic exports shrank by 2.3 percent while oil domestic exports
jumped by 12.2 percent due mainly to an increase in oil prices, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The 2.3-percent fall in non-oil domestic exports to about 5
billion U.S. dollars in August was reflected in Singapore's key
markets, mainly the United States, the European Union, Malaysia,
Japan and Hong Kong. However, exports to Korea and China remained
strong at 16.5-percent and 27.5-percent growth respectively, the
TDB said.
</P>
<P>
It also said the emergence of Thailand as a regional oil
exporter and the expansion of refining capacities in South Korea
have contributed to the weakness of oil exports by Asian
countries, including Singapore which saw its growth of domestic
oil exports moderating to 12.2 percent to reach about 857 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports in August stood at about 10.29 billion dollars, 1.3
percent less than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The decrease was largely in integrated circuits, computer parts
and peripherals, crude petroleum, parts of diodes, parts of VCRs
and other products.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, increases were registered in the import of disk
drives, other fuel oils, computer tapes and discs, other machines
and mechanical appliances, other electronic valves and tubes and
color television sets, the TDB said.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Approve New Expansion Plan on Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai is reviewing a new plan to build about 3,000 new
homes in the Palestinian territories despite strong protests.
</P>
<P>
The construction plan was presented to Mordechai after its
approval by the civil administration, the English-language daily
The Jerusalem Post quoted an administration spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
It came only two days after Mordechai ratified other plans
to build 1,800 new homes in Kiryat Sefer of the West Bank,
which was strongly criticized by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
According to the new plan, some 1,400 homes will be built
in Alferi Menashe, 1,160 in Emmanuel, over 200 in the Jordan
Valley, 122 in Kedumim and 16 in Otniel, which are all in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Settlement leaders said the plan was only among some 300
in the bureaucratic pipeline for years, which were frozen by the
former Labor government in order to conduct peace talks with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The new hardline government, led by Likud leader Benjamin
Netanyahu, lifted the freeze on expanding settlements in August
and has already approved several plans to build thousands of
new homes in settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel's plans to expand settlements have aroused repeated
protests from the Palestinian Authority (PA), whose
President Yasser Arafat called for a general strike and a
protest prayer in east Jerusalem late in August.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, during his ongoing visit to Germany, blast Thursday the
expansion plans as "provocative and hostile", warning that
"hostility and war appear again on the horizon." The PA
Information Ministry also said that such plans were tantamount
to "declaration of war."
</P>
<P>
However, the settlement leaders tried to play down the
significance of the new plans.
</P>
<P>
"These plans have all been in the pipeline for the last four
years, the approval can be revoked, and little was approved for
the heartlands in Judea and Samaria," said Yehiel Leiter,
spokesman for the Council of Jewish Settlers in West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"If Netanyahu is serious about preventing (the establishment
of) a PLO (independent Palestinian) state, the government had
better start approving building in the heartland," he added.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli opposition and peace organizations are critical of
the expansion plans which they said could disrupt the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
A leading peace organization Peace Now said that, with these
permits, the government was "burying any hope for peace."
</P>
<P>
Meretz leader Yossi Sarid charged that the government's plans
to massively increase settlements " will bring disaster on
Israel and take us back to the old, bad, and dangerous
Middle East."

SINGAPORE, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Three men were on Friday
charged with offering a Philippines soccer player a bribe during
the 10-nation Tiger Cup tournament in Singapore earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian businessmen Kandasamy Karuppanb and Yam Phung Fei
and Singaporean personnel manager Chong Thin Hoong were charged
with offering defender Saluria Bearneza Judy 50,000 U.S. dollars
on September 6, a spokesman for the Corrupt Practices

<P>
The three were alleged to have sought a 7-0 win for
Singapore. The match ended 3-0.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the charge referred only to the offer of
money and did not say whether it was accepted.
</P>
<P>
The three had been granted bail and their passports impounded,
the spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The supply of pork, poultry,
eggs, fresh vegetables and aquatic products rose 80 percent in the
past decade in Shanghai, China's largest industrial and financial
city.
</P>
<P>
The success was reportedly due to a "vegetable basket project,"
initiated by the municipal government in 1986, and aimed at
speeding up production of these items in order to provide adequate
non-staple food to the city's millions of urban residents.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has built vegetable farms with a total acreage of
11,700 ha, 69 pig farms that each breed more than 10,000 pigs, and
161 large milk cow farms.
</P>
<P>
So far, the city has been self-sufficient in output of aquatic
products, and can supply itself with 70 percent of the vegetables
and eggs and 30 percent of the pork needed for the urban
population.
</P>
<P>
More than 330 farm produce wholesale markets have opened,
bringing in a yearly transaction volume of 6.5 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Supreme Leader Warns of US Conspiracies to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei warned of U.S. conspiracies to divide Iranian Kurds in
its two northwestern provinces of Kurdistan and Azarbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the Iranian
commander in chief made the warning while reviewing a special
armed forces parade in Orumiyeh, capital of West Azarbaijan
province Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The statement by the Iranian leader could be interpreted as a
fear of the Islamic regime for a grave problem of Kurds, which
make up five percent of Iran's total population of 65 million.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of latest development in northern Iraq, Khamenei
said "the same kind of conspiracies were devised by the enemies
for the Iranian Kurdistan and Azarbaijan provinces."
</P>
<P>
"Where are those who had falsely claimed to be the
representative of the Kurdish tribe to see for themselves the
most conspicuous truth and prominent fact in Orumiyeh, Mahabad,
Bukan and other provincial cities and come to the realization
that the Kurds like other big tribes in the Islamic Iran are the
indivisible part of this great Iranian nation," he was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
With the powerful presence and vigilance of the Islamic
Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), the armed forces and law
enforcement, Iran considered their plots useless, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ayatollah stressed that such plots will be rendered
impotent in the future as well.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian commander in chief called on the armed forces
to maintain thorough norms of discipline, display bravery and
exhibit commitment in dispensing their duties.

<P>
CHANGSHA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Dong Qingrao, a former
government official in central China's Hunan Province, was
executed here today.
</P>
<P>
Dong was found guilty of the most serious incidence of bribery
in the province since the founding of New China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Dong, 56, was formerly the general manager of the Shaoyang City
Real Estate Development Corporation and the general manager of the
corporation's Huizhou Branch in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
From June 1992 to February 1993, he accepted bribes of 1.12
million yuan, 935,000 Hong Kong dollars and an apartment worth
121,600 yuan. He made an additional 300,000 yuan by other illegal
means.
</P>
<P>
On December 19, 1995, a local court sentenced Dong to death for
taking the bribes. He appealed to a higher court, which rejected
his appeal.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Court approved Dong's death sentence and
the confiscation of all of his illegal earnings.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Evaluation Commission See St. Petersburg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic evaluation
commission expressed satisfaction with its visit to St. Petersburg
on Thursday but remained tight-lipped about the city's chances of
hosting the summer games.
</P>
<P>
"The candidacy (for hosting the games) is the only Olympic
competition in which there is only one medal," commission chairman
Thomas Bach told reporters after four days examining facilities
and hearing pitches from leaders in cash-strapped St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
The 15 commission members met with city officials and Russian
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who flew up briefly from the
capital Moscow. The delegates also took a whirlwind tour of
existing arenas and suggested sites for new venues.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed further improvements, particularly in the realm
of infrastructure," Bach said. "I am confident that, if the 2004
Olympics take place here, the city wll benefit enormously."
</P>
<P>
But many wonder whether St. Petersburg, with its financial
troubles and crumbling infrastructure, can handle an event that
strained the much more modern Atlanta this past summer.
</P>
<P>
Burdened with a deteriorated subway system, atrocious roads and
poor telephone lines, St. Petersburg is betting on the nomination
to kick-start investment from home and abroad. Local and federal
officials have pledged a total of one billion U.S. dollars toward
the effort.
</P>
<P>
"The demands of commission were quite high," said Alexander
Kozlovsky, vice president of the Russian Olympic Committee. "It
was difficult to put together the requested data, but now we know
what we need to work with."
</P>
<P>
Kozlovsky recently called city's chances "average".
</P>
<P>
The city was the first of 11 cities visited by the commission.
Cape Town, Athens and Rome are considered favorites. The other
hopefuls are Stockholm, Lille, Seville, Istanbul, Buenos Aires,
San Juan and Rio de Janiero.
</P>
<P>
After its tour, the evaluation commission will compile reports
on the candidate cities basesd on 19 criteria including athletic
facilities and housing potential for athletes. A final decision
will be made in September 1997.

XIAMEN, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-two Chinese bicycle
producers have won an anti-dumping case filed by three bicycle
producers in the United States, according to China Chamber of
Commerce for Machinery and Electronic Products.
</P>
<P>
Three US bicycle producers launched an anti-dumping
investigation of China's bicycles exported to the US in April,
1995. Involved export volume is valued at 200 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 22 Chinese bicycle manufacturing enterprises and foreign
trade companies took measures to counter the charge, with help
from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the
China Chamber of Commerce for Machinery and Electronic Products
and the China Bicycle Association.
</P>
<P>
Following a year-long investigation, the US International Trade
Commission decided on June 4 that China-made bicycles exported to
the US were not an economic threat to the related industries in
the United States, and ruled in favor of the Chinese firms.

LUSAKA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government will
take measures to prevent the country from becoming a dumping
ground for appliances like refrigerators and fire extinguishers
which use ozone depleting gases.
</P>
<P>
''We shall soon take measures because developed countries are
supposed to stop using these by the year 2000 and there is a
danger that third world countries like Zambia might be used as a
dumping ground,'' Peter Mwanfuli, Permanent Secretary of the
Ministry of Environment said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mwanfuli said that the government would train Zambia revenue
authority officials to identify any equipment which used the
dangerous gases.
</P>
<P>
The government would also encourage industries to change their
technology to ozone friendly substances and would provide
incentives for that, Mwanfuli said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that industries such as the Zambia Consolidated
Copper Mines should start changing their technology now because
when the time came no organization or individual would be allowed
to use the ozone depleting gases.
</P>
<P>
There is no law yet in Zambia barring anybody to bring in such
items especially that they can be used until the year 2010 when
all countries in the third world are expected to stop using ozone
destructive technology.

according to today's The Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah gunners also fired dozens of rounds of mortars at
the area and at the nearby Israeli positions at Soujud and Rehan,
which prompted heavy return fires by the Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
Israeli planes twice struck at Hezbollah bases, and helicopter
gunships were also in action. The pilots reported accurate hits
and all planes returned safely, the newspaper quoted an Israel
Army spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hezbollah gunmen fired mortars at Israeli targets
in the Beit Yahom region in the western sector of the zone, Alman
in the central area, and the Ali Tahr hill range in the eastern
section.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said that there have been more than 100 attacks
against Israeli target by Hezbollah since the ceasefire agreement
signed in late April after Israel launched the 17-day Operation
Grapes of Wrath.
</P>
<P>
It claimed at least 14 of such attacks were in clear violation
of the ceasefire deal which bans attacking from civilian
villages. General Livine was quoted as saying that Israel would
again lodge complaints to the international monitoring group on
the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday charged Hezbollah
for having waged a constant war against Israel, which he
described as a part of the ongoing situation as a result
of so-called "Hezbollah-Syria connection." Israel regarded Syria
as the major supporter of the Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu said that there has been no change in
Israel's defense policies regarding the current conflicts, saying
sometimes Israel had to pay "painful prices."
</P>
<P>
So far in the year, a total of 18 Israeli soldiers have
been killed in clashes with Hezbollah forces in south
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Russia, China Share Same Interests: Russian Parliamentary Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia and China share
identical strategic interests from many aspects, and can learn a
lot from each other's experience, a leading Russian parliamentary
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"China is a great country, a "strategic partner" of Russia, and
a country with which Russia can cooperate and from which Russia
can learn a lot," said Gennady Seleznev, chairman of the State
Duma, Russia's parliament.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by Xinhua at the 96th Inter-Parliamentary
Conference, he noted that a one-polar world and hegemonism are
absolutely unacceptable to both countries, and peace should be
built on the basis of many perspectives, Seleznev said.
</P>
<P>
Neither country wants to see the emergence of a hegemonic
power, he added.
</P>
<P>
Every country has its own historical path, and has the right to
choose its own mode of development, and the implementation of one
standard is in contradiction with natural laws, he noted, adding
that Russia and China share the identical views in safeguarding
world peace, and solving regional and global issues.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, China offers Russia a great deal of valuable
knowledge gained from the former's experience in economic
development and many other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Seleznev spoke highly of the achievements scored by the Chinese
Government in the field of human rights protection. The right to
subsistence and development is the priority of human rights, and
is also the basis of other rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
He complimented China for ensuring pensions for the elderly and
providing medical services to its huge population.
</P>
<P>
"Some Western nations criticize China under the guise of human
rights, just because the success of Communist-led China does not
comply with their view," Seleznev said. "Guaranteeing the people
the right to food and education is democracy. Democracy should not
have only one mode of existence."

<P>
OTTAWA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien met with visiting Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen here today, both sides pledging efforts to
further enhance cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qian welcomed Chretien to attend the annual
meeting of Canada-China Business Council in Shanghai in November
and to join Chinese Premier Li Peng at the signing ceremony of the
contract on Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant.
</P>
<P>
The successful exchange of visits by Premier Li Peng and Prime
Minister Chretien in the past two years have given a boost to
Sino-Canadian relations, and economic and trade cooperation in
particular, Qian was quoted as saying by a Chinese foreign
ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Qian also noted the growing trade between the two countries and
expanded investment. China will contribute actively to bringing
Sino-Canadian trade to 20 billion Canadian dollars by the end of
this century, he added.
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to its relations with Canada.
As major powers along the Pacific rim, the two countries has no
conflict of fundamental interests and pose no security threat to
each other, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the two countries share common interests and
major responsibilities for the peace, stability and development of
the world, and of Asia-Pacific in particular, he added.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed the hope that the two governments will not only
focus their attention on the present, but also on the overall
situation and the future, so that bilateral relations will always
be moving in the direction of friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Extending welcome to Qian, Chretien said China is a major
country in the Asian-Pacific region. Canada has no political
problem with China, and the two countries should help each other
and expand cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian prime minister also expressed his pleasure with
the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
China's economic growth is in the interests of the Chinese
people and of the world, Chretien said, adding that China's huge
market thus created will be a great boost to world trade.
</P>
<P>
He also told Qian that Canada is willing to strengthen its
cooperation with China in the United Nations and other
multilateral organizations.

<HEADLINE> US Chemical Mogul to Expand Business in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Monsanto, a chemical
transnational corporation headquartered in the United States, will
further enlarge its China operations through innovations in
chemical, agricultural, health care and food processing fields in
the years to come.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed today by Kai San Chiu, General Manager of
Greater China Monsanto Co. at the on-going '96 China Chemical
Conference (fine and speciality chemicals) in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"As a global company with a rich experience of serving diverse
markets, we hope to share knowledge and learn from the
scientists and business people in the countries where we live and
work," said Chiu.
</P>
<P>
"China, of course, is one of the most desirable partners we
seek worldwide," he added
</P>
<P>
Chiu pointed out that China appreciates the combination of
science and agricultural production and has worked out a master
plan for its future.
</P>
<P>
Monsanto's herbicide "Roundup" is the world's best-selling
product for weed control. In 1995, the company donated Roundup to
help rid Beijing's Forbidden City of many of the unsightly weeds
that had grown up throughout the historic complex.
</P>
<P>
While trying to apply its advanced agro-biotechnology in China,
Monsanto is also awaiting commercial approval for a chemical that
would aid in creating highly-desired wheat hybrids. The chemical
giant is working with some provinces to test this agent in the
country.
</P>
<P>
As part of its business commitment, the company plans to expand
its research and development function into China, Chiu said.
</P>
<P>
It announced earlier this year that it would donate 100,000 US
dollars over the next five years to both Fudan University and
China Agriculture University for research work.

<HEADLINE> Foreman Would Fight Morrison again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- George Foreman, who lost
by decision to Morrison three years ago, said on Thursday he would
fight Tommy Morrison again.
</P>
<P>
"I'll fight him, I sure would and I would try to knock him
out," a report quoted Foreman as saying. "He's not going to get
past me because someone said that he's got the virus."
</P>
<P>
Former heavyweight champion Foreman made his comments in Miami
where he is part of the television broadcast team for Friday's
World Boxing Council welterweight title fight between champion
Pernell Whitaker and Wilfredo Rivera.
</P>
<P>
Morrison, in a prepared statement at news conference in Tulsa,
said a fight would be the best way to raise money for Knockout
AIDS, the organisation he founded to benefit children suffering
from the disease.
</P>
<P>
Morrison does not have a date, site or an opponent for his
return.
</P>
<P>
Foreman offered another reason as to why Morrison would want
to fight again after announcing his retirement eight months ago
after testing positive for the virus which causes AIDS on the eve
of a fight in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
"He makes the announcement, but the credit card companies
don't say you no longer owe us. Bills go on," Foreman said. "He
has to continue to make a living."

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A new oil and natural gas
field has been put into operation in central Myanmar and efforts
are under way to enhance its production and distribution.
</P>
<P>
The Kyaukkhwet-Letpando oil and gas field, one of the two new
onshore fields in Myanmar, was found in May 1995, and crude oil
and gas have been struck at six test wells on commercial scale,
according to today's official paper The New Light of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Many offshore gas fields, including Yadana and Yedagun in
Mottama and Taninthayi offshore areas, have been found since 1988.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's state-run Oil and Gas Enterprise has been undertaking
oil and natural gas exploration and production with foreign oil
companies.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas from the Yadana gas field will be sold to Thailand
under a contract signed with the Petroleum Authority of Thailand
in February 1995, said an earlier official report, adding that the
sale of gas will start in mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
The oil and gas sector has been dominating foreign investment
in Myanmar with 1.43 billion US dollars out of a total of 3.34
billion dollars as of the end of May 1996, according to official

<HEADLINE> India Replies to Nepal on Treaty Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
replied to a letter from the Nepali government seeking
clarification on a few issues about the Mahakali treaty, a local
newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The Indian reply undertook to ensure "mutually satisfactory
understanding between the two countries at the time of preparing
the detailed project report" when implementing the treaty, the
Kathmandu Post daily reported.
</P>
<P>
However, the reply from the Indian side was not considered to
be a commitment demanded by Nepal's main opposition party as
precondition for the Mahakali treaty's ratification.
</P>
<P>
Nepal and India signed the treaty on the integrated development
of the Mahakali river, Nepal's western border river with India, in
February 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government, under pressure from the main opposition
Communist Party of Nepal (united Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML),
earlier this week wrote to India asking for clarification on the
issues about the treaty, including the status of the Mahakali
river and India's proposed power purchase from Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The Mahakali treaty is pending for ratification in the Nepali
parliament which is expected to vote later today to decide the
fate of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
CPN-UML, the single largest party in the parliament, holds the
key to the treaty's ratification as it needs a two-third majority
support in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The party earlier decided to ratify the treaty only after
obtaining India's written commitment on the issues raised by it.

<HEADLINE> NATO to Expand Partnership for Peace: U.S. official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) is working on plans to expand its "Partnership
for Peace" program to embrace countries which are not among the
first nations to become the alliance's members, a U.S. diplomat
said here today.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Finland Derek Shearer said that non-aligned
countries which do not seek NATO membership, like Finland,
Switzerland and Austria, could also participate in the "super" PfP
initiative, the Finnish News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the super PfP would boost non-members' military
cooperation and political contact with NATO. The plan is also
designed to demonstrate to Russia that NATO is not belligerent and
ease its concerns over NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
"Let's include the Russians," said Shearer.
</P>
<P>
Shearer said that of the 27 current members of the PfP scheme,
between 15 to 20 could join a super PfP, which could involve
specific liaison officers and working groups.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland
were possibly the first nations to join NATO and the next group
might include Romania, Bulgaria, and Baltic states Estonia,
Lithuania and Latvia.

<HEADLINE> Romania Culls out Small Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Nearly three quarters of
Romania's political parties have collapsed this year because they
failed to meet the strict demands on party registration set by
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The number of parties has reduced to 50 from 180 as a result of
the "political general cleaning," the local newspaper Adevarul
(Truth) said today.
</P>
<P>
Various political parties sprang up in Romania after 1990 as
the country began to pursue a multi-party system.
</P>
<P>
Any group of 250 people could form a party and get offices and
funds from the government at that time.
</P>
<P>
Legislation on party registration passed by the Romanian
parliament this year stipulated that only parties which had at
least 10,000 members in 15 counties had the right to register.
</P>
<P>
As a result, small parties broke up and returned their offices
to the government.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen parties won seats in the parliament in the 1992
general elections.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided that 0.04 percent of the budget, or
4.5 billion lei (about 1.4 million U.S. dollars), will be assigned
for the operation of parties.

<P>
OTTAWA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today arrived here on a four-day
visit aimed at strengthening bilateral ties with Canada.
</P>
<P>
Qian met Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy and attended
a working luncheon hosted by the Institute for International
Affairs and the Alliance of Manufacturers and Exporters of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese visitor reiterated on both occasions that it is to
the benefit of Chinese and Canadian peoples and in the interest of
peace and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region to maintain close
Sino-Canadian cooperation, which started in 1970 when the two
countries established full diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Canadian trade reached a record high of 4.214 billion
U.S. dollars last year, up 29.8 percent over the previous year and
27 times that of 1970.
</P>
<P>
Canada has so far invested 4.148 billion dollars in a total of
2,907 projects in China and it has become one of the largest
receiving countries of the overseas investment from China.
</P>
<P>
Qian and Axworthy also compared notes on such issues as the
reforms of the United Nations and human rights.
</P>
<P>
At the luncheon, the Chinese foreign minister described the
so-called "China threat" as illogical and untenable.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that Hong Kong's prosperity and stability are
guaranteed as China is to materialize its "one country, two
systems" policy.

<HEADLINE> "China Threat" Untenable: Chinese FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice-Premier
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today described the so-called
"China threat" as "illogical and untenable."
</P>
<P>
"Some people in the West always feel unhappy about China's
development. They relish spreading the so-called 'China threat'
in an attempt to contain China and stop its progress," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
These people believed that when a country was developed and
strong, it was bound to threaten the security of others. "This is
illogical and untenable," Qian told a gathering at a luncheon
hosted for him here today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister said that in its modern history,
China had never engaged in invasion or expansion. Instead, it
once suffered a lot from invasion and bullying by imperialist
powers.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people know full well that state sovereignty,
national independence and territorial integrity have not come by
easily," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we fervently wish to maintain a peaceful
international environment," he said. Qian is here on a four-day
visit as guest of Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
Qian said China pursued an independent foreign policy of peace
and opposed all forms of hegemonism and power politics.
</P>
<P>
"China poses no threat to any country, nor will it do so when
it becomes developed with greater overall national strength," he
told the luncheon hosted by the Institute for International
Affairs and the Alliance of Manufacturers and Exporters of Canada.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, a stable and developed China is an indispensable
factor contributing to peace, stability and prosperity of the
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China will forever live in amity with all countries in the
world on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence
and is committed to world peace and development," Qian added.
</P>
<P>
The five principles are mutual respect for territorial
integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, non-interference
in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and
peaceful coexistence.

<HEADLINE> China, Canada to Strengthen Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Reforms of the United Nations
and human rights were among issues discussed when Chinese
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met his Canadian
counterpart Lloyd Axworthy today.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy said Canada paid great attention to its friendly
cooperation with China and he was pleased to have the opportunity
to exchange views with Qian on the Canadian-Chinese ties.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the rapid growth of relations since the two countries
established diplomatic ties in 1970 has born fruitful results in
all areas.
</P>
<P>
Despite differences of national conditions, social systems and
ideologies, China and Canada had no conflict of fundamental
interests, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"We value our friendly cooperation of equality and mutual
benefit with Canada." China was willing to enhance consultations
and collaboration with Canada in international affairs, Qian added.
</P>
<P>
On human rights, Qian said that due to differences in social
systems, economic and social development, historic and cultural
background, each country might have a quite different view about
the issue.
</P>
<P>
As long as each country approaches the matter in a patient,
understanding and cooperative manner, the dialogue will lead to
increased understanding.
</P>
<P>
China was for dialogue about human rights, but against
sanctions, Qian stressed.
</P>
<P>
Canada hopes to strengthen exchanges and dialogue with China in
this area, Axworthy said.
</P>
<P>
On the U.N. reforms and role, Qian said that as an
international organization, the United Nations should play an
active and balanced role in the maintenance of world peace and
promotion of common development.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations should pay more attention to the needs of
developing countries, and help them eradicate poverty, maintain
stability and achieve development, the Chinese visitor added.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy said his country supported the UN's role in the
maintenance of peace and in promoting the resolution of world
economic and social problems.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qian also asked Axworthy to convey Chinese
Premier Li Peng's invitation to Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien to visit China later this year.
</P>
<P>
Chretien's visit would produce a positive impact on bilateral
relations, Axworthy said.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Qian and Axworthy signed two consular
understandings.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Military Leader Meets Italian Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Hegemonism and power politics
have no supporters in the world and are doomed to failure, said
Liu Huaqing, vice-chairman of the Chinese Central Military
Commission, here today.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Italian Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta,
Liu, who arrived here on Thursday for a seven-day visit to Italy,
said that world peace, national stability, economic development
and human progress are the common wills of the people across the
world.
</P>
<P>
Liu noted that the economic boom in Asia will create a larger
market and more opportunities for development for the rest of the
world as well as the region itself.
</P>
<P>
On China's foreign policy, Liu said that the Chinese government
firmly pursues an independent foreign policy and works for the
maintenance of world peace and the promotion of common development.
</P>
<P>
While stating that China would strengthen friendly cooperation
with all countries in the world on the basis of the five
principles of peaceful co-existence, Liu reiterated that China
would never go into alignment with any big powers or blocs.
</P>
<P>
Liu added that China sternly opposes hegemonism, power politics
and the practice by any country to interfere in the internal
affairs of other countries on the pretext of ethnic, religious or
human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
On China's defense policy, Liu said China would never resort to
aggression or expansion, nor would it station troops or build
military bases overseas.
</P>
<P>
Briefing on China's domestic situation, Liu said China's
18-year reform had achieved significant success, but added that
the job of development is a long and arduous task for China,
because China is a big country with a huge population.
</P>
<P>
Liu reaffirmed that China's policy of focusing on the central
task of economic construction and of reform and opening to the
outside world will not change in 100 years.
</P>
<P>
He denounced the so-called "China threat" theory, calling the
advocates of the theory as "having ulterior motives."
</P>
<P>
On China's bilateral relations with Italy, Liu said he hoped
the two countries would further develop a long-term and stable
relationship of friendly cooperation with an eye on the 21st
century, including cooperation in military affairs and military
industry.
</P>
<P>
Andreatta on his part said each country should decide its own
positions on world affairs according to its practical conditions.
</P>
<P>
Western democracy could not be exported; it sometimes causes a
lot of chaos, said Andreatta.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said that dialogues and cooperation
between China and Italy are conducive to global stability.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the wish that the two countries, which have no
conflict of interests, would strengthen cooperation between their
armies and in military industry.
</P>
<P>
Before arriving in Italy, Liu just concluded an eight-day
official visit to France.

<HEADLINE> French Government Unveils Budget Proposals for 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The French government is
determined to continue its austerity program and fabulous cut in
budget deficit as it made public its budget proposals for fiscal
1997 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The total expenditure of the new budget will be 1.5529 trillion
francs (304.4 billion U.S. dollars) whereas the total budget for
fiscal 1996 was 1.5519 trillion francs (304.2 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Public expenditure has hardly increased in the new budget after
deducing inflation factors.
</P>
<P>
Budgets have been cut for such sectors as transportation, urban
construction, commerce and foreign aid while slight increases have
been made for education, scientific and technological research,
environmental protection, post and telecommunication and labor
management.
</P>
<P>
State revenue for 1997 will be 1.2692 trillion francs (248.8
billion dollars), 51 billion francs more than the preceding year.
</P>
<P>
A tax break program will cut out another 25 billion francs (4.9
billion dollars) from the state coffer and the program was
described by the government as relieving low-income families of
their burdens and honing the edge of consumption.
</P>
<P>
France is tightening its belt so as to meet the requirement by
the Maastricht Treaty for joining the single currency framework.
</P>
<P>
The treaty requires that the budget deficit cannot be higher
than 3 percent of a country's gross national product.
</P>
<P>
With the new budget, France is aimed at bringing its budget
deficit to within 283.7 billion francs (55.6 billion dollars) in
fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
At the Madrid summit held last December, leaders of EU member
states agreed unanimously that the European single currency, to be
known as Euro, will be formally launched on January 1, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Stability, Prosperity Guaranteed: Chinese FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice-Premier
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said today "China's policy toward
Hong Kong will remain unchanged," and Hong Kong's "long-term
stability and prosperity are fully guaranteed."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will firmly pursue the policy of "one
country, two systems" after July 1, 1997. It will strictly
fulfill the commitments it has made in the Sino-British Joint
Declaration, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a special administrative region of China, Hong Kong will
"enjoy a high degree of autonomy and carry out the principle
of 'Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong'," Qian told a
working luncheon.
</P>
<P>
The current socio-economic system and way of life in Hong Kong
will remain unchanged. Likewise, "the laws previously in force in
Hong Kong will basically be maintained," the Chinese vice-premier
said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong will continue to serve as a free port, a separate
customs territory, and an international trade, financial and
transportation center," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign economic interests in Hong Kong will be taken care
of," Qian said at the luncheon, which was hosted by the Institute
for International Affairs and the Alliance of Manufacturers and
Exporters of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that China's commitment to maintaining its Hong Kong
policy for 50 years has something to do with its long-term
economic development strategy.
</P>
<P>
For many years, "Hong Kong has contributed positively to the
economic development of China's mainland, which will continue to
need Hong Kong as a window of reform and opening-up and a channel
to the world market in implementing its modernization strategy,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the reform, opening-up and development of
the mainland have become an important factor in Hong Kong's
economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Over the last 17 years, Hong Kong has moved a large number of
its manufacturing industries to the mainland, which has greatly
reduced the cost of its products and increased its competitiveness
on the world market, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 90 percent of Hong Kong's entrepot trade is
mainland-related. "This was an important contributing factor for
Hong Kong to maintain a relatively high growth while the West was
suffering from economic recession a few years ago," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The social stability and sustained economic growth of the
mainland will continue to provide a reliable guarantee for Hong
Kong's prosperity and stability," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister, on a four-day visit as guest of
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, also expressed the hope
that the Canadian business community will continue to actively
participate in Hong Kong's economic activities, and use Hong Kong
as a base from which to open up the mainland market.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Has Almost 21 Million Illiterate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has 20.8 million
illiterates above the age of 10, Minister of Education and Culture
Wardiman Djojoegore said.
</P>
<P>
Of that total, the government is focusing on 5.7 million people
between the ages of 10 and 44 in its literacy campaign, the
minister said here Thursday in connection with the International
Literacy Day on September 8. Celebration of International Literacy
Day in Indonesia will be held on September 24.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the campaign is to provide literacy training for
the 5.7 million people over the next three years, local newspapers
today quoted Wardiman as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Ministry of Social Services data, as of July 1996,
there were about six million children aged between seven and 15 in
the country could not attend school for various reasons.
</P>
<P>
The national literacy campaign was launched last year by the
Ministry of Education and Culture and some other ministries and
non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 data revealed that most the illiterate people, or 16.9
million, live in the villages. Out of this number, 11.4 million
are women.

<HEADLINE> Expanded ASEAN Called Positive for Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The planned expansion of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a positive
development for the region, provided it is carried out in a
pragmatic way,
political scientists and observers from the Asia-Pacific region
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The current drive by the Southeast Asian people themselves to
be one Southeast Asia of 10 countries is really a milestone in the
region's history," Hasjim Djalal, Indonesian ambassador-at-large
for the law of the sea and maritime affairs, told a workshop here.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, held by the Jakarta-based Center for Strategic
and International Studies to mark its silver founding anniversary,
was called "One Southeast Asia in a New Regional and International
Setting."
</P>
<P>
Formed in 1967, ASEAN currently groups Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's members will be increased to 10 countries with the
inclusion of Cambodia and Laos next year and Myanmar later. The
average annual economic growth of ASEAN's current members ranges
between 6 and 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, political analyst Liao Shaolian of China's Institute
of Southeast Asian Studies of Xiamen University said that since
ASEAN has provided a better example of flexible regional
cooperation than any other international organizations, it could
play a greater role in regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
Although most speakers agreed on the positive development ASEAN
has achieved, a number of participants voiced worries that the
organization, with its extended membership, may not achieve as
much as it did before. They feared that the economic growth of
some member countries may slow down as a result.

COLOMBO, September 20 (Xinhua)-- The Sri Lankan government has
plans to lease out the oil storage tanks at Trincomalee in the
Eastern province constructed by the British during World War II,
according to official sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The government has appointed a 3-member Tender Board and a

companies, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The recent response to the leasing of the 110 oil storage tanks
came from a Singapore based multi-national Glencore International.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently two Korean companies and several Indian trading
firms have also shown interest, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The initial overtures were made some years back during the
former regime by Japanese and American multinationals. However,
fears of antagonizing India compelled the Sri Lanka government to
delay responding at that time.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Pop King Leaves Moscow Without Sword </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The self-proclaimed United
States pop king, Michael Jackson, left Moscow overnight without
carrying an ancient sabre he received as a gift from Alexander
Korzhakov, former security chief of Russian President Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
"The antique sabre remains in Russia," said Antonina Yevseyeva,
a spokeswoman of the Russian Customs.
</P>
<P>
She said Jackson had to have either permission from the Culture
Ministry to take the sabre out of the country or a document
providing that it had no cultural value.
</P>
<P>
While presenting the sabre to Jackson on Monday upon his
arrival at Moscow Vnukovo airport, Korzhakov said it was a weapon,
with which Tsar Nicolas the Second used to award Russian army
officers for merit on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
"Jackson is not a Russian and not an officer while Korzhakov is
not an emperor," commented the local newspaper, Izvestia.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the customs as saying that a probe would
be launched into how the former top presidential bodyguard had
obtained the ancient weapon.
</P>
<P>
The Russian State Customs Committee's press service stated that
the antique sword would remain in Russia until the committee
determined its origin, and looked into how it fell into the hands
of the deposed Korzhakov.
</P>
<P>
A government official said that if Jackson was interested in
the sword, after a certain period, all customs difficulties would
be overcome, and the sabre would be sent to him.
</P>
<P>
In a comment on Jackson's single concert on Tuesday, the
newspaper said it was "a cynical sadist show," which was delayed
for more than two hours. About 40,000 Russian fans, on a windy and
cold day, four to five degrees above zero, had to wait in a
open-air stadium.
</P>
<P>
"Jackson delivered a blow to the health of Russians," Izvestia
said. The show itself "had no artistic value" and was exactly what
everybody had expected, "nothing more, nothing less."
</P>
<P>
The status of Michael Jackson, nevertheless, ... gathered
around itself "enough onlookers to make business good in any part
of the planet," the comment said.
</P>
<P>
The pop idol arrived in Moscow on Monday by his "Kingdom
Entertainment" aircraft to continue his "History Tour," which
started from Prague earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Jackson was mobbed everywhere by predominantly
teenage fans, who cried "Jackson, Jackson" in adulation and craned
their necks to glimpse the world-renowned singer.
</P>
<P>
Russian fans waited nearly three years to see their
idol. Jackson came to Moscow in 1993 in his "Dangerous Tour" which
was canceled late that year when the" King" admitted to an
addiction to painkillers.

<HEADLINE> Power Cut Ends in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 20 (Xinhua)-- The Sri Lankan government
announced today the end of a countrywide power cut and removal of
restriction on the use of air conditioners and lighting.
</P>
<P>
Power cuts were introduced on March 21 due to a drastic drop in
the hydro-catchment reservoirs following the failure of the
southwest monsoon rains. Over 80 percent of the country's
electricity supply is from hydropower.
</P>
<P>
In March, the power cut imposed was for four and half hours
daily and this was gradually increased to eight hours till the end
of July. As the rains in August increased the water level of the
hydro-catchment reservoirs, the power cut was reduced finally to
one hour a day this month.
</P>
<P>
Industry was severely affected as a result of the power cut and
it is estimated that the country lost as much as 240 million U.S.
dollars because of an all-round drop in production.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said the reservoirs now have enough water to
allow for the removal of the power cut.
</P>
<P>
Measures have also been taken to prevent a repetition of the
power cut even if the monsoons fail to produce enough water next
year, the sources added.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Guatemalan government
and guerrillas signed an agreement today on bolstering civilian
government and reducing the role of the military in a democratic
society.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached after three months of negotiations,
paved the way for a final accord to end the 36-year-old armed
conflict in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
It calls for a 33-percent reduction of the 43,500 troops and a
new function of the armed forces in a society free of war.
</P>
<P>
It also restricts the armed forces' mission of protecting the
sovereignty and allows the defense minister to be a civilian. So
far, the military has dominated the government.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached this week by government representatives
and the Guatemala National Revolutionary Unity, was the last of
six agreements on social, economic and political issues.
</P>
<P>
Other agreements dealt with human rights, resettlement of
displaced people, identity and rights of indigenous peoples,
socio-economic issues and agrarian reform.
</P>
<P>
A final accord is expected to be signed later this year.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala's 36-year-old armed conflict has left 175,000 people
dead, 45,000 missing, and more than a million displaced.

start in the European clubs' championship Thursday with a 67-64
win over Greece's Olympiakos, finalist in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
Alba trailed 32-38 in the first half at the group B tie but
recovered in the second half. Forward Sasa Hupman was dominant
inside the D with a total 20 points and 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
The Germans managed to force a slow pace with a zone defense
which confused the fast Greek guards in the dying minutes, while
Olympiakos's towering pivots Dragan Tarlac and Panayotis Fasoulas
were kept in check by Hupman and fellow forward Stefan Arigbabou.
</P>
<P>
Olympiakos playmaker David Rivers collected 18 points and
Tarlac 15.
</P>
<P>
Former NBA player Willy Anderson, who joined the Greeks this
season, scored only eight points and clearly needs time to adjust
to European play.

KUALA LUMPUR, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is developing a
zoological and botanical park on a 120-hectare site in the State
of Sabah, East Malaysia, to promote nature, tropical rain forests
and wildlife resources, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Tourism and Environment Minister Bernard
Dompok who performed the ground-breaking ceremony for the park
yesterday as saying that the park at a cost of about 10 million US
dollars would be developed in two phases with the first phase to
be completed by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
The features to be built under the first phase would include
wildlife habitats, forest canopy, forest floor, a large auxiliary
animal display and a conservation center.
</P>
<P>
Dompok said the park was aimed at raising the consciousness of
the people on the value and importance of wildlife and their
habitats, and encouraging their assistance in preserving nature.
</P>
<P>
It could also serve to attract tourists by providing a modern
world-class animal display facility and would provide facilities
and resources to undertake meaningful environmental education
programs for visitors and students, he said.
</P>
<P>
The park will breed rare and endangered forms of indigenous
wildlife, according to the reports.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Ross Perot's Reform Party
will file a lawsuit against the Commission on Presidential Debates
next Monday in an effort to keep the Texas billionaire on the the
debates, an attorney representing the party said today.
</P>
<P>
"There is such a level of public outrage and sense of scandal
that either the court or the commission will have to turn this
decision around," the United Press International quoted attorney
Jamin Raskin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Raskin was talking about the commission's ruling that the
Reform Party presidential candidate should not be included in the
debates.
</P>
<P>
Raskin, associate dean of the American University Law School,
was hired by the Reform Party Wednesday to help in its fight to be
included in the presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
Perot on Wednesday called the commission's ruling "a blatant
display of power by the Republicans and the large donors who fund
their campaigns".
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S., Japan Consider Relocating Air Base in Okinawa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Japan have agreed to conduct intensive studies on possible
solutions of relocating the Futenma air base on the island of
Okinawa as a way to make the American military presence less
intrusive in the face of residents' protests.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry was speaking at a joint
news conference today after he and Secretary of State Warren
Christopher held a so-called two-plus-two meeting with their
Japanese counterparts: Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda and Defense
Minister Hideo Usui.
</P>
<P>
It was the second cabinet-level meeting between the two
countries, which covered a variety of issues, including that of
dispelling the Okinawan residents' anger over U.S. military
intrusion into their daily life.
</P>
<P>
The pressure for a reduced U.S. presence in Okinawa has been
very strong, which was reflected most recently in the outcome of a
referendum among Okinawan residents. Most of local residents
turned out to be opponents of the 27,000 U.S. troops occupying
one-fifth of the Japanese island.
</P>
<P>
Perry said the United States and Japan talked over three
possible solutions, including creating a floating off-shore
facility where Washington would be able to transfer some assets
located at Futenma air base.
</P>
<P>
"The vision in me hopes that this floating off-shore facility
will be the solution," Perry said, adding that as an engineer, he
is aware that difficult technical problems must be overcome.
</P>
<P>
The floating off-shore facility is one of the three options
being considered as part of the effort to revamp the American
presence in Okinawa, he said.
</P>
<P>
The other two involve establishing heliports at local bases.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. defense secretary also disclosed that they discussed
the F-2 fighter aircraft program. Japan will spend over 10
billion U.S. dollars producing the F-2's with over 4 billion
dollars going to American companies and creating American jobs.
</P>
<P>
At the joint news conference, reporters asked Christopher about
an incident in which South Korean troops killed seven people of
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, who came ashore from a
submarine.
</P>
<P>
Christopher urged "all parties" to avoid further provocative
actions. "We wish that all parties would refrain from taking
further provocative actions," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar was traded at
109.67-70 yen early Friday morning in Tokyo, rising slightly from
late Thursday's quote of 109.33-36 yen.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was changing hands at 109.40-50 yen in New York and
109.30-40 yen in London late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Traders said they bought the dollar back because it was likely
that interest rates would be hiked at the policy-setting meeting
of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee due to be held next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that the topside of the dollar would remain
below the 110 yen line because of selling for profit.
</P>
<P>
Traders said they expected the dollar to fluctuate in the upper
half of the 109 yen level in Tokyo for the rest of the day.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Wants More Trade With Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas has expressed the wish to increase trade
between his country and Brazil, which he described as at a very
low level now.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian visitor, accompanied by 70 businessmen, arrived
in Brasilia on Wednesday. He will end his visit on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian-Indonesian trade reached 600 million U.S. dollars
last year, with a 148-million-dollar deficit against the Asian
country.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said in Brasilia that bilateral trade is very skimpy and
that Indonesia is interested in Brazil's experience in services,
investigation and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The visiting minister said that it is necessary to drop some
mistaken ideas, such as those about the long distance between
Brazil and Indonesia, which has often been considered as an
obstacle to more exchanges of goods and services.

<HEADLINE> OAS Chief in Guatemala to Back Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary-General of
the Organization of American States (OAS), Cesar Gaviria, arrived
in Guatemala today to push forward the peace process in this
Central American country.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Guatemala City said Gaviria was expected to
discuss with President Alvaro Arzu the participation of the OAS in
tasks and projects that will contribute to peace.
</P>
<P>
Peace-making in Guatemala was not only a goal of the people and
the government, but also a desire of all the American peoples,
said Gaviria on his arrival.
</P>
<P>
He added that the OAS would start projects and apply resources
together with other international organizations to consolidate
peace in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
The 33-member OAS was founded in Santafe de Bogota, Colombia,
in 1948 (succeeding the International Union of American Republics)
to foster peace, security and mutual understanding among the
nations of the western hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports said the Guatemalan government and the
guerrillas signed an agreement today that would pave the way to a
final accord to end the 36-year civil war in the country.
</P>
<P>
It was the last of the six agreements on social, economic and
political issues between the civilian government and the
Revolutionary National Unity of Guatemala since the peace process
started in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for a 33-percent reduction of the armed
forces and allows the defense minister to be a civilian.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Police Find No Clues of Kidnappers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Costa Rican police found
no clues to the whereabouts of the kidnappers who had abducted a
Dutch couple on August 25 in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, the kidnappers are former members of
Nicaraguan armed groups who were very familiar with the areas,
where they fought against the Nicaraguan Sandinista government
during the last decade.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch couple, Huite Sierd Zijlstra and Jetty Cuors, who
were freed on Tuesday, told the press that they were treated well
by the kidnappers during their detention.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican police are searching the northern region in the
San Juan River, Costa Rica's natural border with Nicaragua, for
the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch couple were released 23 days after a
600,000-U.S.-dollar ransom was paid.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican authorities have coordinated with their
Nicaraguan counterparts about the hunt for the kidnappers. The
Costa Rican police said the abductors have tried to cross the San
Juan River to enter Nicaraguan territory.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers had asked for 1.5 million dollars of ransom,
plus 2 million colons (approximately 9,500 dollars), but the
amount was reduced to 600,000 dollars after negotiations.
</P>
<P>
This was the second kidnapping in the same area in Costa Rica
since early this year. In January a German tourist and her Costa
Rican guide were kidnapped and freed 71 days after the payment of
a 200,000-dollar ransom.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Bombing Suspect to Sue For libel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Richard Jewell, who was
named as a suspect in the Olympic bombing earlier, said Thursday
he would sue those who have defamed him, a television report said.
</P>
<P>
"Myself and my attorneys are looking at everyone and anyone who
has said libelous things," Jewell was quoted as saying by CBS-TV.
</P>
<P>
Jewell, 33, was the security guard who reported spotting a
suspicious package in the Olympic Centennial Park minutes before
it exploded on July 27, leaving two people dead and injuring 112.
</P>
<P>
At first he was hailed a hero for the warning that prompted an
evacuation that probably prevented more fatalities, but since he
has been the subject of intense scrutiny by investigators.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has questioned Jewell
several times and searched his home but has not charged
him. Jewell, who maintains his innocence, has since sought an
apology from the government, but has not received one.
</P>
<P>
In a partial transcript of the interview, to be aired on CBS'
"60 Minutes" newscast Sunday, Jewell said his career in law
enforcement was ruined because of the allegations of his
involvement.
</P>
<P>
Jewell recently won the right to see copies of documents of FBI
evidence against him.
</P>
<P>
The US government has not formally charged anyone in the
terrorist act.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government, MILF Closer to Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A Moro rebel group moved a
step closer to signing a formal ceasefire agreement with the
Philippine government by submitting a list of its members who will
work out the ground rules for the truce, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The group, which is called the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF), was left out of the recently concluded peace talks between
the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the government.
</P>
<P>
The Ramos administration has reiterated that since the MILF had
been opposing the peace agreement the government signed with the
MNLF, the government would hold separate peace talks with the
MILF.
</P>
<P>
Al Haj Murad, MILF vice chairman for military affairs, said on
Thursday that they had submitted a list of "technical committee"
members to executive secretary Ruben Torres, but no date has been
set for the signing of the ceasefire truce.
</P>
<P>
At the same day, Torres said the signing of the ceasefire
accord, which was supposed to take place on Thursday, has been
postponed to give more time for refining some provisions.
</P>
<P>
"Some matters still have to be resolved first. Some provisions
in the agreement should be worked out," he said. But he did not
say when and where the new schedule of signing will take place.
</P>
<P>
The postponement also pushed back the preliminary peace talks
between the government and the MILF, which were supposed to begin
10 days after the signing.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Tianjin municipal
government has intensified its nine-year-long scientific and
technological popularization campaign by opening the 10th
Scientific and Technological Week on Wednesday in a bid to improve
the city's investment climate.
</P>
<P>
During the week, 600 science and technology activities are
expected to be held around the city.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot vitalize our economy without a boom in science and
technology," said Major Zhang Lichang during the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The mayor attributed the economic boom to the increase in
science and technology among the city's 9 million people, since
the popularization campaign was launched in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Attendance at scientific and technological activities adds up
to about 6 million persons every year.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the campaign has trained more qualified employees,
which became part of the reason for the proliferation of the
world's leading computer and communication companies, which chose
Tianjin as their production base in China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that economic value resulting from
scientific and technological upgrading accounts for 30 percent of
the city's total economic growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The President of
Turkmenistan, Saparmurad Niyazov, has called for a grains
production target of 1.2 million tons for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the grain production program, Niyazov said the
agriculture department must make every effort to achieve
self-sufficiency in food as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan was expected to harvest one million tons of grain
this year, the same as in 1995, but only 500,000 tons had been
gathered in so far because of slow harvesting, Niyazov told the
local press.
</P>
<P>
The president ordered a harvesting speed-up and the seeding of
winter crops to be completed on schedule by the end of September.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture in Turkmenistan has been gradually recovering in
recent years as the result of reforms, with food production
increasing every year since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The country planned to achieve an annual grain production of
2.5 million tons by the year 2002, under the program.

<HEADLINE> NAM, Boeing Urge Congress to Improve US-China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National
Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and the Boeing Company urged
the Congress today to improve U.S.-China trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the NAM before a House International
Relations joint sub-committee hearing, William Hudson, president
and chief executive officer of AMP Incorporated, said that it is
important for the United States to build solid, mutually
beneficial trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is the "first step" that "we translate MFN
(most favored nation)" to mean "normal trade."
</P>
<P>
"Other steps include bringing China into the World Trade
Organization, liberalizing the U.S. export control laws, and
ending the sanctions that the United States imposed on China,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"American companies, and indeed the American people, have a
very large stake in our ability to succeed in foreign markets,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Hudson said that although the U.S. trade deficit with China is
rising and the potential for problems exists, "the larger trends
are very positive."
</P>
<P>
"China has made enormous progress towards international norms
and a better life for its people since 1979," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the challenge for "all of us" is to keep the good
news coming while responding but not over-reacting to the bad.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that a serious effort to create a genuinely normal
commercial relationship with China is one of the best tools we
have for doing that," Hudson concluded.
</P>
<P>
The NAM is the oldest and largest broad-based industrial trade
association, which consists of 14,000 member companies and
subsidiaries. They produce about 85 percent of U.S. manufactured
goods.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, Lawrence Clarkson, senior vice president of
the Boeing Company, also called for a normal U.S.-China commercial
relationship.
</P>
<P>
"The need for a normal U.S.-China commercial relationship
becomes all the more apparent and necessary," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the commercial normalization between the United
States and China should be recharacterized by two sets of policy
objectives.
</P>
<P>
"The first would be to end the annual, divisive debate over
China's MFN trading status and grant such trading status
permanently," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The second would be to complement the current bilateral trade
relationship with a multilateral relationship and multilateral
dispute settlement," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Permanent MFN for China is in our national interest because
we, as a nation of producers and consumers, benefit greatly from
China trade, and the stability of permanent MFN will further
promote the development of our commercial relations," he added.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Parliament Speaker: Serbs Want Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb parliament
speaker Momcilo Krajisnik said today the Serbs "fully accept the
Dayton accords" and want peace instead of war.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir Zubak in the
Serb capital of Pale, Krajisnik told reporters, "This generation
has created a Bosnia under the Dayton accords with two entities,
and created better conditions for the coming generations after it
achieved a peaceful settlement of the tragic conflict on the lands
of Bosnia-Herzegovina."
</P>
<P>
Speaking about his talk with Zubak, the Serb leader said that
the Serbs would not form a coalition against a third party.
</P>
<P>
During the September 14 elections, Krajisnik, Zubak and Muslim
leader Alija Izetbegovic won the seats in the three-member Bosnian
presidency.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik added that "somebody is deliberately accusing" the
Republika Srpska of being unwilling to cooperate with other bodies
of power in Bosnia and this was untrue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, international High Representative for Bosnia Carl
Bildt said today in Sarajevo that the members-elect of Bosnia's
presidency had expressed the willingness to meet and work
together.
</P>
<P>
Bildt told reporters that he had been informed of this at
separate meetings with all three members-elect of the Bosnian
presidency -- Izetbegovic, Krajisnik and Zubak.
</P>
<P>
Bildt said that the presidency would hold its first session
most likely in Sarajevo, immediately after the publication of
final official election results, expected to be announced by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on September
25.
</P>
<P>
He said that the international community would fully support the
new bodies of power in Bosnia in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
"With the world's help, problems will eventually be eliminated
and the new institutions will function, but this cannot happen
overnight," Bildt said.

UNITED NATIONS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today decided to send a special emissary to
Kinshasa on Zaire's televised accusations against the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Zairean soldiers beat up two U.N. staff members last weekend
after a television report that the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees was helping armed Rwandans infiltrate across the border.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali, rejecting the accusations, said the broadcast
had caused "serious security problems for United Nations personnel
working in the region."

U.N. spokesman Sylvana Foa said the U.N. chief was sending
Assistant Secretary-General Ibrahima Fall, a human rights official

<HEADLINE> Panama Hopes to Optimize Efficiency of Canal, UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali said Panama's primary objective in hosting a
universal congress was to prepare for the upcoming transition of
the canal to Panamanian hands, according to a report available
today.
</P>
<P>
In his report on the Universal Congress on the Panama Canal,
the U.N. chief noted that at the congress to be held next
September, Panama hoped to convey the importance of a partnership
between the Panamanian government and the users of the canal so as
to optimize efficiency and responsiveness in canal operations.
</P>
<P>
On January 25, 1995, Panamanian President Ernesto Perez
Balladares called for the holding of the congress. The United
Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution on November 7,
supporting the initiative of the Panamanian government.
</P>
<P>
Following the resolution, the organizing commission submitted
requests to the European Union, China, France, Germany, Japan,
Britain, the United States and eight other countries, asking for
their collaboration in the congress, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the treaties concluded between the Panamanian
government and the United States, the canal will be under full
Panamanian control in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The Panama Canal Treaties provide a guarantee for
international commerce that the Panama Canal will remain
accessible and neutral after the transition on December 31, 1999,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
During the congress held from next September 7 to 10,
governments, international bodies, public and private academic
institutions, maritime users and international shipping companies
will discuss the transition, the future of the canal and
investment opportunities.

<HEADLINE> CIA Head Says Coalition Weakens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The coalition formed
during the 1991 Gulf War by the United States with its European
and Arab allies has been weakened, which has to some degree
strengthened Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's position in the Gulf
region, CIA Director John Deutch told lawmakers today.
</P>
<P>
"There is a perception of weakened determination of the
coalition to deter Iraqi aggression," Deutch said when he
testified at the Senate Intelligence Committee.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. cruise missile strikes on September 3 against Iraq and
the follow-up American military buildup in the Gulf region ordered
by U.S. President Bill Clinton have been greeted with coolness,
protests and doubts among U.S. allies as to his intentions for
doing so. Many countries have rejected American requirement for
use of their military bases to attack Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The allies arrayed against Iraq seem divided, Deutch admitted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, international arms and trade sanctions have failed
to weaken Saddam's hold on power, he said. Iraq retains enough
military power to "threaten regional neighbors" and Turkey's new
leadership appears to be interested in opening commercial doors to
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"All of these factors contribute today to a strengthened
position for Saddam Hussein in the region," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Deutch predicted that Saddam will continue to challenge the
United States and its allies.
</P>
<P>
The CIA director, however, said that tensions in the Gulf have
eased, and he pointed out that Iraq has not threatened allied
planes reinforcing northern and southern no-fly zones for several
days.
</P>
<P>
The United States has expanded the no-fly zones in southern
Iraq to Baghdad's southern outskirts and has dispatched more than
3,000 U.S. troops to Kuwait recently in addition to other moves of
military buildup in the region.
</P>
<P>
When asked the likelihood of Iraq attacking Kuwait, Deutch
said, "At present, we would estimate that to be very low, indeed."
</P>
<P>
The CIA director also confirmed that Kurdisatn Democratic Party
leader Massoud Barzani, who has invited Saddam's forces to help
drive out his rival faction leader jalal Talabani in northern
Iraq, has approached Western allies "for protection in an effort
to hold Saddam Hussein at arm's length."
</P>
<P>
"Saddam Hussein is putting increasing pressure on Barzani to
negotiate a framework for autonomy under Baghdad's overall
control," Deutch said.

comprises the Province of British Columbia, will be extended to
include the Province of Alberta and Yukon Territory.
</P>
<P>
The consular district of the Chinese Consulate General in
Toronto, which at present comprises the Province of Ontario, will
expand to include the Province of Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Canada's Consulate General in Shanghai, which at
present comprises Shanghai Municipality, Jiangsu Province and
Zhejiang Province, will also include Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
The consular district of the Canadian Consulate in Guangzhou,
which currently comprises Guangdong Province and Guangxi Zhuang
Nationality Autonomous Region, will include Fujian Province and

the electronic bulletin board for its Special Data Dissemination
Standard (Special Standard).
</P>
<P>
The move is designed to provide information about the data
dissemination practices of its subscribing member countries.

</P>
<P>
As of today, the metadata for 18 countries on the Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board and 34 countries have subscribed to the
Special Standard.
</P>
<P>
The standard and system is set up at the request of the IMF's
ministerial-level Interim Committee in April 1995 to guide IMF
member nations in providing economic and financial statistics to
the public. The Special Standard on statistics includes four
categories of real sector, fiscal sector, financial sector,

<HEADLINE> More Children Killed by Automobile Air Bags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 19 (Xinhua) -- As automobile air bags
become more common across the United States, more children are
being killed by them, according to a two-year study by the
National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one children have been killed by air bags, including 12
so far this year compared with one in 1993, said the board,
putting most of blame on parents who ignore safety recommendations
and put their children in the front seat, where they can be
injured by the bags as they expand with explosive force.
</P>
<P>
The numbers of air bags are rising rapidly to about 22 million
by the end of this year, and by an estimated 13 million a year
thereafter, according to a New York Times report.
</P>
<P>
Passenger air bags will be required in all cars soon, for they
expand almost instantly in an accident, providing a cushion to an
adult. Currently, the bags are designed to meet a safety standard
of protecting the life of an adult who is not wearing a seat belt
when a car crashes into a brick wall at 30 miles at an hour.
</P>
<P>
The auto industry and the Federal government have begun a 10
million u.s. dollar public education campaign to warn parents not
to put children in the front seat.
