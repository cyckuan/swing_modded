TEHRAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- In a move against the challenges of
the conservatives, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami Sunday
appointed impeached Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri as vice
president in charge of development and social affairs.
</P>
<P>
The appointment was announced by the official news agency IRNA
hours after Nouri failed to gain a vote of confidence from the
conservative Majlis (Parliament) which accused him of creating
tensions in the country, delivering provocative statements and
using inexperienced persons for managerial positions.

<P>
At the Majlis open session Sunday afternoon, 137 Majlis
deputies voted for a no-confidence motion against Nouri while
117 voted against the motion and 11 deputies abstained.

<P>
The new appointment indicated Khatami's strong support for
Nouri and his uncompromising stance toward the challenges of
the conservatives.

Khatami and his moderate supporters have strongly supported
Nouri. Soon after 31 Majlis deputies called for an impeachment
against Nouri, they warned that Nouri's absence from the cabinet
would be detrimental to the government.
</P>
<P>
So far, Khatami did not announce any nominee to replace Nouri
as the interior minister. But the moderates have suggested that

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Three rocket-propelled grenades
were fired toward the U.S. embassy in Beirut on Sunday, causing
no human and material losses, the National Broadcast Network radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place at 13:00 local time (1000 GMT) when no
diplomats were in the U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
The grenades landed only 500 meters away from the embassy on
the edge of Beirut, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security forces have found part of the time device on
the scene and launched investigation.
</P>
<P>
The press official in the U.S. embassy refused to make any
comments on the incident, saying only that Lebanese police would
deal with it.
</P>
<P>
During Lebanon's 1975-1990 sectarian civil war, Americans had
become targets of kidnapings and murders. A total of 241 U.S.
servicemen were killed in a suicide bombing in Beirut in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. lifted a 10-year ban on its citizens from
visiting Lebanon last July, it warned that the country was still
unsafe.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said the firing of the grenades was aimed at
undermining the stability of Lebanon which is seeking to project
an image of security to the world.

<P>
BORDEAUX, France, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Austria did not have problem
in confidence when they face powerhouse Italy on Tuesday, coach
Herbert Prohaska said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Austria's problem obviously has nothing to do with confidence
since we have equalized during injury twice. In defence, we played
calmly, without making too many mistakes in placing the ball and
relaunching play," said Prohaska in Margaux near Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
Prohaska believed his strikers would have a mountain to climb
facing a Italian defence that features Paolo Maldini, Alessandro
Nesta, Fabio Cannavaro and Alessandro Costacurta.
</P>
<P>
He added, "We'll probably see some one-on-one situations with
Roberto Baggio and Alessandro Del Piero."
</P>
<P>
However, Prohaska pointed out the Italians may face more pressure
than his squad do in their last group B match in the new Stade de
France in St. Denis outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
"If Austria loses, it won't be the end of the world, but it would
be for Italy. If Italy doesn't run away with the game, Austria could
be all right, so long as my team doesn't make any mistakes."

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Jerusalem Plan Change No Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Sunday that the controversial expansion plan of
Jerusalem will not change the status of the holy city.
</P>
<P>
The plan is only aimed at strengthening the economic basis of
Jerusalem and does not have any political indications, Netanyahu
told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the plan does not violate the peace accords signed
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The plan, approved by the Israeli cabinet in the day after a
five-hour debate, would extend authority of Jerusalem to areas
surrounding the city by setting up an "umbrella authority" over
eight West Bank Jewish settlements to the east, south and north of
the city.
</P>
<P>
The United States has called the plan "a provocative step at
the sensitive time" in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and
urged Israel to reconsider it.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Sunday denounced the
plan as a new attempt to destroy the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Tibi, senior advisor to PNA President Yasser Arafat,
told Israel Radio that by adopting the plan Israel will annex
large part of the occupied territories of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the plan is a serious violation of the peace
accords between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace agreements, neither side should take unilateral
actions over Jerusalem before a final peace agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled since March
last year when Israel began construction of a Jewish settlement in
the traditionally Arab East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want
as the capital of their future independent state.

Stoichkov had thrown her No. 8 jersey to the French World Cup
Organizing Committee president on his way to locker room but the

"I would never have offered my jersey to someone for whom I didn't
have deep respect. It was truly a friendly gesture," he said.

"I was very annoyed to read in a French paper that it was
interpreted as an act of definance towards Michel Platini. He and I

<HEADLINE> Jordan Denounces Israel's Jerusalem Expansion Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister for
Development Jawad Anani Sunday issued a statement to denounce the
Israeli government's plan to expand Jerusalem's municipal
authority over eight Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Jordan strongly condemns Israel's plan to "expand Jerusalem,
annex new lands to it to be under Israeli control, annex the
settlement territories and build new tunnels and roads to link the
settlements, in addition to building an industrial complex for
technology," Anani, also the foreign minister, said in his
statement.
</P>
<P>
Jordan condemns the plan because it forms an open aggression
against the Palestinian territories and an open violation of the
agreements already signed with the Palestinians, according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government holds that Israel should be fully
responsible for this "provocative" decision and considers it to
be null and void, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government urges the Israeli government to stop
these measures because they are anti-peace and hindering the
whole Middle East peace process, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government also calls on the U.N. Security
Council and other international and regional organizations to
repulse these measures, Anani added.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which was approved after a five-hour debate in the
Israeli cabinet, would create an "umbrella authority" over West
Bank settlements surrounding Jerusalem to the north, south and
east.
</P>
<P>
It intends to put the settlements under the city's authority
mainly for building and planning.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured East Jerusalem in 1967 and later annexed it in
a move that has failed to win international recognition. The
Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future
state.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have been deadlocked for 15
months over Israel's settlement building in East Jerusalem and
long-delayed withdrawal from the West Bank. Israel has rejected a
U.S. initiative on further redeployment, which was accepted by the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is one of the two Arab countries which signed peace
treaties with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Factions Agree to Cease Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 21 (Xinhua) - Leaders of the Burundi
government and the opposition factions agreed to cease fire in
Arusha, north Tanzania, Sunday, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The parties concerned have agreed to a truce not later than
July 20 when the second round of peaceful talks is called up in a
bid to realize the national reconciliation and end years of
bloody conflicts.
</P>
<P>
A joint declaration made by the 17 parties said that six
committees will be established to deal with the problems of
genocide, refugees, peace and public security and others.
</P>
<P>
"All armed parties to the conflict (agree to) declare a
suspension of hostilities to take effect not later than the 20th
of July 1998," the declaration said. "(We) pledge to resolve the
Burundi conflict through peaceful means, and to put an end to all
forms of violence."
</P>
<P>
"We will create a climate of lasting peace in our country and
to bring to an end the constant cycle of violence and fratricidal
killings which have afflicted Burundi for a long time," it said.
</P>
<P>
Concluding their week-long talks, first of its kind since
Pierre Buyoya took power of the tiny central African country two
years ago, some 50 leaders and representatives of the parties
committed to return to Arusha in July to start the second round
of talks facilitated by former Tanzanian president Julius
Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to put on the agenda the issues like nature of the
conflict and genocide in Burundi and their solutions,
constitutional and judiciary arrangements, public security and
permanent cease-fire arrangements, refugees rehabilitation and
resettlement.
</P>
<P>
The agenda also includes the economic and social
reconstruction and development, transitional institutions as well
as guarantees on implementing the agreements emanating from the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The parties also agreed to adopt at an appropriate time a
submission from facilitator Nyerere that will spell out the
methodology, time frame, organization and administrative
arrangements and rules of procedure.
</P>
<P>
"These will deal with, particularly, issues of participation,
conduct of deliberations, code of conduct of participants,
organization of the secretariat, working languages,
communications and logistics," the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi peace talks began last Monday when Burundi
President Pierre Buyoya told the opening session at the Arusha
International Conference Center that his government would like to
hold talks with all the opposition factions in an effort to begin
the national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Under mediator Nyerere, the talks brought together Burundi's
President Buyoya and leader of the main Hutu rebel group Leonard
Nyangoma, for the first time in a public forum since Nyangoma
fled the country in 1994 to join the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
Among the Hutu rebel groups at the talks were Nyangoma's
National Council for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD), the
National Liberation Front (Frolina) and the Party for the
Liberation of the Hutu People (Palipehutu).
</P>
<P>
Leaders from these groups, plus opposition FRODEBU, PARENA and
UPRONA and parliament made statements, saying that being tired of
the endless bloody conflicts, they hope all the factions should
shoulder the interests of the nation and the people, and seek
lasting solutions through sincere and serious talks.
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, Nyerere has been holding separate and
secret talks with all the parties in the five-star Novotel Mount
Meru Hotel and hosted an all-party talks finally.
</P>
<P>
"I hope all the main actors in Burundi will forget the past
and greet a bright future," Nyerere told the opening session,
which was attended by Presidents of Tanzania, Uganda, and Rwanda,
the Vice-President of Zambia and Kenya's Foreign Minister.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the U.N.
Secretary-General sent messages, saying that they were inspired
by the gathering of the Burundi leaders and promised support to a
real national reconciliation in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
As a gesture to answer the calls by sanctions imposers and to
ease the internal tension, Buyoya, an ethnic Tutsi, signed later
a new transitional constitution and named two vice-presidents
including an ethnic Hutu leader of the main opposition party.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in
bloody conflicts between the ethnic Hutu majority and the ruling
Tutsi minority since the assassination of Melchior Ndadaye, the
first president elected under a multi-party system in 1993.

<P>
DAMASCUS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
Sunday held talks with European Union's Mideast peace envoy Miguel
Angel Moratinos on the stalled Middle East peace process and
efforts exerted to break the current impasse.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the talks, Moratinos told reporters that he and
al-Assad discussed the latest developments in the peace process
and the deadlock in the process due to the intransigent policies
of the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos stressed that the EU attaches great importance to the
Mideast peace process, underlining the importance of continuing
the peace process on the basis of Madrid principles.
</P>
<P>
He said al-Assad expressed the hope that Europe would play a
more active role in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The EU, in a final statement of its summit in Cardiff, Britain,
early this week, called for the Israeli recognition of
Palestinians' right to self-determination.
</P>
<P>
The EU envoy arrived here Saturday morning for a visit to Syria
as part of his tour in the Middle East to consult with leaders of
the region on the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Iranian President Fights Back Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- In a move to counter the challenges
of the powerful conservatives, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
Sunday appointed impeached Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri as
vice president for development and social affairs.
</P>
<P>
The immediate appointment was considered as Khatami's reaction
to the no-confidence motion against Nouri by the Majlis
(Parliament) dominated by the conservatives and support for the
disgraced official.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said in a decree that he appointed Nouri to the new
post for the reason of his competence and ability, and the
importance of sustainable social and political developments.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one conservative Majlis deputies raised a no-confidence
motion against Nouri on June 10. They accused him of creating
tensions, delivering provocative statements and supporting Tehran
Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi, who is on trial on graft charges.
</P>
<P>
At a Majlis open session Sunday, 137 Majlis deputies voted for
the no-confidence motion, 117 against it and 11 abstained.
</P>
<P>
At a cabinet session in the afternoon after the Majlis session,
Khatami praised Nouri for his efforts to maintain the country's
security and stability and push forward political reforms.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet will surely continue to use Nouri's ability and
experience, he said.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the Majlis for the no-confidence motion at an
improper time, but saying that he and his government respect its
decision.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the conservatives raised the impeachment motion,
Khatami and his moderate supporters showed strong support for
Nouri. They warned that Nouri's absence would be detrimental to
the government.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that despite of the failure to save Nouri's
position as interior minister, Khatami managed to keep him in the
cabinet, giving him a free hand to continue his efforts to promote
social and political developments by supervising the affairs of
the interior ministry without conflicting with the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Khatami has made it clear that he has the
responsibility to keep his promises made during the presidential
election campaign in May last year that he would promote freedom
and civil rights defined in the country's constitution.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese FM Accuses Israel of Conducting Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares
Boueiz Sunday accused Israel of conducting the explosion near the
U.S. embassy in Beirut in the day.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of the People radio quoted Boueiz as saying that the
explosion took place when the Israeli government is taking
hard-line policy in the peace process and refusing to make any
compromises.
</P>
<P>
Israel is trying to divert people's attention from its stance
on the Mideast peace process through undermining Lebanese
stability, he added.
</P>
<P>
At noon Sunday, three rocket-propelled grenades exploded about
500 meters away from the U.S. embassy in Beirut, causing no human
and material losses.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security forces have found part of the timing device on
the scene and launched investigation.
</P>
<P>
This is the second explosion in less than a week which took
place in the capital. Three days ago, a booby-trapped bomb in a
car exploded in a commercial area in downtown Beirut, killing the
driver and a passer-by.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said these explosions are aimed at undermining
the stability of Lebanon which is recovering from the damages in
the 1975-1990 civil war and seeking to give the world an image of
security.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
Sunday rejected as illegitimate the Israeli plan to extend
Jerusalem municipal authority over eight Jewish settlement in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The plan would only lead to instability of the city and change
its status which should be defined through negotiations on a final
agreement between the Palestinians and Israel, Moussa told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
After a five-hour debate, the Israeli cabinet Sunday approved a
controversial plan on extending the Jerusalem municipal authority
over eight West Bank Jewish settlements surrounding Jerusalem to
the east, north and south.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority has denounced the plan as a
new attempt to destroy the peace process. It accused the Israeli
move of violating the signed agreements, which call on the two
sides to refrain from unilateral actions concerning the city.
</P>
<P>
"The plan is another provocation to both the Arab and Islamic
world as well as the international community," Moussa said, urging
the Israeli government to reconsider its policy which constitutes
another encroachment on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the traditionally Arab East Jerusalem in the
1967 Mideast War. The Palestinians want it as the capital of their
future independent state.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been deadlocked since
March 1997 when Israel began construction of a Jewish settlement in
East Jerusalem.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on Monday
recommanded, on health grounds, limitation of the exposure of the
general public to electromagnetic fields.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, EU's executive body, noted in a draft
recommendation that there are concerns regarding the potential
effects of man-made electromagnetic fields.
</P>
<P>
As listed in the document, sources of such fields are power
lines, electric appliances, railway systems, broadcasting
equipment, cellular phone systems and radars.
</P>
<P>
These sources, however, are essential to modern life, said the
draft submitted to the EU council of ministers for adoption.
</P>
<P>
Their potential health hazards, especially by non-ionizing
radiation, include electric shocks, skin burns and negative
influence on human central nervous and cardiovascular systems.
</P>
<P>
To address these risks, numerous safety regulations have been
in place both at EU and EU member state levels, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The new recommendation, once adopted, is expected to provide a
framework on basic restrictions and reference levels, and ensure
the consistency of EU-wide health protection policies.
</P>
<P>
It will help EU's 15 member states to provide for detailed
rules on how the guideline will apply in their countries.

<HEADLINE> Ogata Urges Regional Leaders to Help Solve Refugee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees Sadako Ogata has appealed to regional heads of state
to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Guinea Bissau, as
fighting in the West African nation stretched into its third week.
</P>
<P>
"Already, many tens of thousands of men, women and children
have fled the capital (of Bissau)," Ogata told the presidents of
Guinea Bissau, Senegal, and Guinea in a letter dated June 19 and
made public here Monday in a UNHCR press release.
</P>
<P>
Ogata warned that the confrontation "could generate a major
humanitarian crisis."
</P>
<P>
The high commissioner appealed to all parties to find "a
peaceful and prompt settlement."
</P>
<P>
She also asked U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
Organization of African Unity Salim Ahmed Salim, the Economic
Community of West African States and the U.N. Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to help solve the refugee
crisis.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR said that it had no news of the almost 5,000 refugees
from Senegal who live in villages in the Cacheu region of northern
Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
Reports indicate that fighting has also broken out in this
region, where the Jolmete refugee camp is located.
</P>
<P>
"Immediate consequences could be famine, refugee outflow into
neighboring countries and threats to the safety of the 5,000

<HEADLINE> More Countries Recall Ambassadors From Belarus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States, Poland and Japan
joined the European Union (EU) on Monday in recalling their
ambassadors from Minsk because of a row over a residential complex.
</P>
<P>
Media reports reaching here said U.S. ambassador Daniel
Speckhard, his wife and three children are scheduled to leave the
Belarussian capital on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Japanese ambassador Shigao Natsui is to depart Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the ambassadors of Lithuania and Turkey
already left the former Soviet republic on June 19.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, ambassadors of EU countries officially informed
Belarus that they would leave on Monday after the government cut
off water and gas supplies to the residential compound and denied
access.
</P>
<P>
Only five EU countries have embassies in Minsk. They are
Britain, France, Germany, Greece and Italy.
</P>
<P>
The EU countries' move does not represent an end of diplomatic
ties with Belarus, said an Itar-Tass report. The embassies will be
headed by charges de affaires during the interim.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors accuse Minsk of violating the Vienna Convention
on diplomatic rights in asking them to move out of the posh Drozdy
complex to allow for plumbing work.
</P>
<P>
Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko, who also lives in
the complex, said repairs are needed to the houses.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EU is also asking Belarussian ambassadors to
return to Minsk to convey the EU's attitude toward the Belarussian
actions.

<HEADLINE> Blair Promises Millennium Dome Not to Be Torn Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Monday hailed the Millennium Dome which will provide the focus for
Britain's millennium celebrations as "too good to be torn down."
</P>
<P>
The giant structure for the millennium celebrations had been
built to last, not to be taken down as envisaged, he said while
visiting the Dome construction site in southeast London.
</P>
<P>
"This will be the most famous new building in the world in the
year 2000," he said of the giant building which is still under
construction in Greenwich close to the River Thames.
</P>
<P>
Blair also praised the workers for their "extraordinary" work
and "spectacular" efforts and said he was proud of them.
</P>
<P>
What had been a piece of derelict land a year ago had been
built "on time, on track and on budget," he told building workers
at a ceremony to mark the "topping out" of the structure, which
was still viewed by many Britons as a waste of money.
</P>
<P>
Blair first visited the site a year ago when it was an empty
space of reclaimed industrial wasteland in Greenwich. He gave the
green light to continue the project, originally devised by the
previous Conservative government.
</P>
<P>
Its budget is 758 million pounds (1.3 billion U.S. dollars), of
which 400 million will come from the National Lottery and the rest
from business sponsors and the entrance money paid by an expected
12 million visitors. The dome will open with a spectacular concert
on the eve of the millennium date, December 31 1999.

<HEADLINE> China Pledges to Improve Trade Action Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUCHING (Malaysia), June 22 (Xinhua) -- China, at the Trade
Ministers Meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
Monday, committed itself to improving its individual action plan
(IAP) for trade and investment liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting which opened here Monday afternoon,
Long Yongtu, chief representative for trade negotiations of
China's Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Ministry, said
China has always underscored the importance of implementation and
improvement of IAP.
</P>
<P>
China, he said, regards IAPs as the major instrument to achieve
the goal of trade and investment liberalization and facilitation
as envisaged by APEC leaders.
</P>
<P>
Long said, "We have put in enormous efforts for this purpose
year after year. Under the revised individual action plan for this
year, China is committed to bringing its average tariff level down
to 10.8 percent for industrial manufactured goods by the year
2005."
</P>
<P>
"In addition, the opening-up schedule for services on
environmental protection and energy has been added to the new
action plan and in accordance with the Industrial Catalogue
Guiding Foreign Investment, China has reinstituted some
preferential policies which will allow imported equipment and raw
materials for foreign-invested enterprises to be exempted from
tariff and import VAT (value-added tax)," he added.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that in the days ahead, China will, in an active,
serious, pragmatic and responsible manner, continue to flesh out
and improve its individual action plan.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to submit the plan for leaders' review in
November according to the agreed schedule," he said.
</P>
<P>
The IAPs and collective action plans are one agenda discussed
on the first day of the two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
Long also said that over the past two years, APEC members, by
formulating, implementing and revising individual and collective
action plans, have successfully advanced the trade and investment
liberalization and facilitation process.
</P>
<P>
The ministers at Monday's meeting also deliberated on
electronic commerce, which Long said is a brand new subject and
China follows closely and attaches great importance to its
development.
</P>
<P>
"We are supportive of APEC's efforts in research and
cooperation in this area," he pledged.
</P>
<P>
He said that at the initial stage, China proposes that
exchanges of experience and policy dialogue be intensified so that
members could get a better understanding of E-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said China is hoping that APEC could actively
advance technical cooperation and assist developing members in
enhancing their capacity building.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the progressive approach on E-commerce will
help APEC members achieve common prosperity as designed by leaders
in the APEC Leaders' Meeting in Vancouver," he said.
</P>
<P>
APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Chinese Taipei,
Chile, China's Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia,
Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Minister Expounds on Sino-U.S. Relations (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tang noted that President Clinton's coming visit will be the
first by an incumbent U.S. president in the past 10 years. He said
the two leaders will engage in extensive and in-depth exchanges of
views on international and regional issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government attaches great importance to the visit,
said Tang. The two sides have completed extensive preparations for
the event with mutual visits and talks, as well as thorough
exchanges of views on increasing cooperation and exchanges between
the two countries in areas such as the economy, trade, energy,
environmental protection, science and education, culture, military
contacts and laws. The two sides have made positive progress in
related efforts, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides have engaged in cooperative efforts and
consulted extensively on wide-ranging issued including the
financial crisis in Southeast Asia, dealing with the South Asia
nuclear arms race triggered by India's nuclear testing, and other
major issues directly related to both global and regional peace,
stability and development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side sincerely hopes and believes that successful
mutual visits by the two presidents will further enhance mutual
understanding between the two nations, promote extensive exchanges
and cooperation, develop ties based on the three communiques and
the Sino-U.S. Joint Declaration, and help fulfill the goal of
establishing a strategic partnership oriented with the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Tang stressed that Sino-U.S. ties represent one of the most
important bilateral relationships in the world and as such should
fully consider the world as a whole and long-term strategic
perspectives for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The world continues to witness profound changes with peace and
development representing the themes of the times, said Tang.
</P>
<P>
"However, the world remains far from peaceful and many
unstable factors continue to exist," according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
China, the world's largest developing country, and the United
States, the largest developed nation, are permanent members
of the United Nations Security Council. He said the two nations
share broad common interests and shoulder important
responsibilities for maintaining world and regional peace and
stability, as well as promoting global economic development,
safeguarding the environment and addressing other major
issues.

Closer ties are not only in the interests people in the two
countries, but also reflect the requirements of the times and
expectations of people throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Tang cited hope, opportunities and severe challenges in terms
of specific steps for consolidating and developing bilateral
ties. "The evolution of the international situation has expanded
common interests and provided us with a broad scope of
opportunities for development and cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Developing stable and constructive relations between China and
the United States will not only benefit the two peoples, but will
also contribute positively to maintaining world and regional peace
and security, and promoting both global and regional economic
development, said Tang.
</P>
<P>
During last year's U.S. visit, President Jiang Zemin and
President Clinton decided that the two sides would strengthen
cooperation in dealing with challenges and promoting world peace
and development, and committed themselves to the establishment of
a strategic partnership between the two countries, according to
Tang.
</P>
<P>
He said that steps the two sides have taken based in the
spirit include:
</P>
<P>
-- further expanding negotiations and cooperation concerning
major world issues;
</P>
<P>
-- maintaining and increasing high level visits and contacts;
</P>
<P>
-- promoting mutually beneficial economic and trade cooperation;
</P>
<P>
-- expanding exchanges and cooperation in the fields of energy,
environmental protection, science, education, culture and law;
</P>
<P>
-- strengthening ties between the armed forces of the two
countries;
</P>
<P>
-- developing all forms of people-to-people contacts.
</P>
<P>
Tang pointed to the new international situation and stressed
that a bright future exists for the development of healthy and
stables Sino-U.S. relations if the two sides scrupulously abide by
the principles specified in the three Sino-U.S. communiques,
promote mutual understanding and properly handle differences,
especially in terms of the Taiwan issue.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar, Vietnam Hold Joint Commission Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar and Vietnam Monday held the
third meeting of the two countries' Joint Commission for Bilateral
Cooperation (JCBC) here, state-run Radio Myanmar reported.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Foreign Minister U Ohn Gyaw and visiting Vietnamese
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam jointly
chaired the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed matters relating to the two countries'
ties and cooperation, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar-Vietnam JCBC was established in May 1994 when
former Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet visited Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The first JCBC meeting, held in Hanoi during Myanmar leader
Senior General Than Shwe's return visit in March 1995, agreed on
mutual cooperation in drug abuse control and forestry.
</P>
<P>
The second JCBC meeting, which took place in Hanoi during the
Myanmar foreign minister's visit in January 1997, further
discussed measures to promote multi-sided cooperation,
particularly in trade, agriculture and forestry.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, relations between Myanmar and Vietnam have
continued to develop with exchange of visits by leaders of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
In May last year, the then Vietnamese Party General Secretary
Du Muoi visited Myanmar and the two countries' ties were further
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
The visit to Myanmar by Vice-Minister of National Defense of
Vietnam and Chief of the General Staff of Vietnam People's Army
Lieutenant-General Pham Van Tra in June last year and one to
Vietnam by Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Defense
Services General Maung Aye in May this year also boosted
cooperation between the two countries and the two armed forces.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Following are the text of the statement
issued by the German Football Federation issued on Monday following
the violence in Lens which involved German fans:
</P>
<P>
"It was with dismay and incredulity that (German Football
Federation President) Egidius Braun, the delegation and the entire
team of Germany learned late on Sunday evening of the serious
disturbances that had occurred after the match between Germany and
Yugoslavia in Lens.
</P>
<P>
"Egidius Braun said 'Our deepest sympathy goes to the injured
policeman and his family. We can assure him and his family we will do
everything we can to help him immediately and directly, although we
hope and pray he will return fully to health.'
</P>
<P>
"The delegation of the German team, national coach Berti Vogts and
all players explicitly demand that state authorities finally and at
last take rigorous action against all those who commit acts of
violence and who abuse the popularity of football for their senseless
misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
"Before the match in Lens there were already concrete indications
that people whose names were recorded on a computer list as individals
who habitually commit acts of violence in connection with sport would
travel to France without tickets.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason Wilhelm Hennes, security chief for the German
Football Federation, urgently wrote to the authorities on June 19
asking them to take the necessary preventative action.
</P>
<P>
"The hooligans responsible for these misdeeds are declared enemies
of society who trample over the reputation of sport and Germany. These
people are criminals who should not be mentioned in the same breath as
the millions of fans who love football and who go to stadiums only for
the enjoyment of the game.
</P>
<P>
"For many years the German Football Federation has been introducing
a series of security measures and has been working closely together
with fan groups in order to overcome these weighty problems. We have
seen in stadiums that the atmosphere is overwhelmingly joyous and
positive but when these hooligans take these acts of violence outside
the stadium and further afield then, as is the case with any criminal
act, only the state security forces can be held responsible.
</P>
<P>
"The delegation and the team of Germany regret yesterday's
incidents all the more because the time they have spent in France so
far has been characterised by outstanding hospitality and a superb
cooperation with the police authorities."

<HEADLINE> "Shock" Needed to Shore up Oil Prices: Kuwaiti Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh
Saud Nasser Al-Sabah said here Monday that the world oil market
needs "a shock" to shore up the prices.
</P>
<P>
"A shock is what the (world oil) market might need because the
situation is very bad," Saud said before leaving for Vienna to
attend a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) due on Wednesday. But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is in the interest of OPEC states to reconsider
the announced output cuts, adding that the matter will be
discussed in the coming meeting.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC meeting is expected to discuss further reduction of
oil production of its members to help shore up the oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela agreed early this month to
slash oil output by 450,000 barrels per day. Some other countries,
including Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Iran, have
announced to follow suit to cut oil output by 270,000 barrels per
day.
</P>
<P>
Oil producers reached an agreement in March to reduce oil
output in a bid to raise the prices. But it has failed to achieve
tangible results.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Kuwait is ready to make further cuts, the Kuwaiti
minister said that "if it will lead to an improvement in prices,
then what is the harm."

SAINT-ETIENNE, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Scotland coach Craig Brown
said before his team's last group match against Morocco that
preparations had gone "very well".
</P>
<P>
Barring an unexpected victory for Norway over Brazil, a draw
will be enough for Scotland to squeeze through on goal difference.
</P>
<P>
But Scotland players know they can not afford to risk playing
for a point against the Moroccans who are quite strong in attack.
</P>
<P>
"There is keen anticipation among all the squad to get on with
this game," said Brown, "They know this is the biggest game of their
lives with so much resting on it."
</P>
<P>
Morocco, coached by Henri Michel who led France into the
semi-finals of the 1986 World Cup finals, have no injury worries. But
mdifielder Said Chiba will miss the match due to suspension.
</P>
<P>
Scotland will also miss suspended forward Darren Jackson and
injured defender Colin Calderwood.
</P>
<P>
Jackie McNamara is expected to fill the place of Jackson while
Michel is expected to bring in Matt Elliott as the player has
impressed him in training.

<P>
NEW DELHI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee Monday urged Pakistan to engage in dialogue with
his country to resolve all outstanding issues in accordance with
the Simla Agreement reached between the two countries 26 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported from Simla, a summer
resort in northern Himachal Pradesh where Indian President
Kocheril Raman Narayanan and the prime minister are having a
sojourn, that Vajpayee also cautioned Pakistan against
internationalizing the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
"With our common experience of colonialism in the subcontinent,
as a cautionary lesson, no attempt should be made to
internationalize problems in our region," Vajpayee was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
On economic sanctions imposed by the United States and other
countries following India's nuclear tests in May, Vajpayee said he
had never threatened retaliation against the United States but
asserted that his country would boldly face such punitive measures
and never compromise on its security.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported last week that Vajpayee said in an
interview with the paper that India could retaliate if the United
States "rigorously imposed" economic sanctions on his country.
</P>
<P>
The United States announced last week the details of sanctions
worth about 2 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Minister Expounds on Sino-U.S. Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) - Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan granted an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency
today and noted that successful mutual visits between Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Clinton will propel
steady and healthy Sino-U.S. relations towards the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, despite twists and turns in recent years,
Sino-U.S. relations have improved and are moving in a positive
direction," said Tang.
</P>
<P>
He explained that people in the two nations share the common
aspiration for the development of relations between China and the
United States, and noted that the two countries share extensive
common interests and enormous potential for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government seriously violated the three
Sino-U.S. joint communiques in 1995 and to a great extent
obstructed relations by allowing a visit to the U.S. by Lee
Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
"Past lessons should be drawn," said the foreign
minister, noting that the relations between the two countries
have since improved and developed due to the concerted efforts of
both sides. A major indication was the highly successful state
visit Chinese President Jiang Zemin paid to the Untied State last
fall.
</P>
<P>
"The decision the two leaders made during the visit to engage
in concerted efforts to establish a constructive Sino-U.S.
strategic partnership set the direction and framework for
Sino-U.S. relations in the 21st century," said the foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have proceeded in accordance with the
Sino-U.S. Joint Declaration by increasing exchanges and
cooperation in a variety of fields such as politics, economy and
trade, military contacts, law, energy and environmental
protection. The two countries have continued to make progress in
efforts to improve relations, said Tang.

June 25 and July 3 at the invitation of Chinese President Jiang
Zemin.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Minister Expounds on Sino-U.S. Relations (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I believe that successful mutual visits between Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Clinton will ensure
steady and healthy Sino- U.S. relations continue in the 21st
century," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that properly handling the Taiwan question is the key
to the sound and steady development of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
"History tells us that properly handling the Taiwan question
will ensure the relatively smooth development of
Sino-U.S. relations. On the other hand, improperly handling
the question will lead to setbacks and quite possibly
retrogression in bilateral relations," said Tang.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister pointed out that the three Sino-U.S. joint
communiques put forward a correct guiding principle for dealing
with the Taiwan question. The U.S. government has made an explicit
commitment to observe the "one China" policy and abide by the
principles outlined in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques,
while at the same time steadfastly refusing to advocate "one
China, one Taiwan" or " two Chinas", refusing to support the
independence of Taiwan or its efforts to join the Untied Nations
and other international organizations which are composed by
sovereign countries.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that strict adherence to the three Sino-U.S. joint
communiques and the principles in the Sino-U.S. Joint Declaration
will promote the sound and steady development of
Sino-U.S. relations," said Tang.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the two sides quite naturally hold
different views concerning various issues due to different social
systems, historical backgrounds, cultural traditions and economic
development levels.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of differences, our view centers on enhancing
understanding and reducing differences by engaging in equal
consultations on a mutually beneficial basis," said Tang.
</P>
<P>
He noted that if some differences cannot be resolved quickly,
common ground should be sought. He stressed that two sides
should not let differences become obstacles affecting the
development of relations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Sets Three Conditions for Marcos' Burial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- President-Elect Joseph Estrada
Monday set three conditions for the burial of former President
Ferdinand Marcos at the Manila heroes' cemetery on July 11.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference held here, Estrada, who would assume
office on June 30, presented to the media a copy of his letter to
Imelda Marcos, the widow of Marcos, which was dated June 21 and
outlined the three conditions.
</P>
<P>
The first condition set by Estrada bars both Marcos loyalists
and anti-Marcos elements from attending the burial which, Estrada
said, should "strictly be solemn and religious."
</P>
<P>
Marcos' remains shall be ferried directly to Villamor Air Base
and forthwith to the cemetery for burial, Estrada said in the
letter.
</P>
<P>
"There shall be no stops and no organized groups shall be
allowed along the route to the cemetery," he said, stressing he
will see to it that his order will be strictly followed.
</P>
<P>
The second condition is the limit on the number of people who
can attend the burial. Estrada said that only 50 members of the
immediate family of the Marcoses can be present.
</P>
<P>
"This will be a private affair of the Marcos family," Estrada
said, assuring the public that he would instruct the military not
to give honors to the late president.
</P>
<P>
The third condition set by Estrada is that "the rites should be
strictly religious in nature and no political statements shall be
made."
</P>
<P>
Estrada added that the media will not be given access to the
event so that the ceremony can be "as solemn as possible" and that
the event would not be used for political purpose.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that by finally laying to rest his mortal remains, the
decade-long turmoil over the (Marcos) issue will subside. We can
then face our uncertain future as a united nation," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president-elect assured that no government funds
will be used for the burial, saying this is a private affair which
should be funded by the Marcoses.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, it was reported that Marcos' remains will be taken
from his hometown to Manila by a C-130 cargo plane of the armed
forces while the Marcos family will be flown by a Fokker plane,
also of the Philippine Air Force.
</P>
<P>
Should the Marcoses decide to use government planes, Estrada
said, they will have to pay for the gasoline and for the use of
the planes.
</P>
<P>
Estrada's plan to bury Marcos was opposed by some opponents led
by former President Corazon Aquino. The anti-Marcos groups accused
Marcos of killing thousands of Filipinos and looting state
treasury.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos has expressed his opposition to the
burial. He has also ordered an investigation into who ordered the
construction of Marcos' grave at the heroes' cemetery.
</P>
<P>
Marcos fled to Hawaii, the United States, in a popular revolt
in 1986 and died there three years later. His remains were allowed
to be returned to the Philippines in 1993.

<HEADLINE> 33 Tamil Rebels Killed, 100 Injured in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-three Tamil rebels were
killed and more than 100 others injured Monday in fierce fighting
in East Sri Lanka between the rebels and government troops,
according to a military spokesman here.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Irk Dewage said the troops Monday engaged in
operation to capture Vakarai in Batticaloa district in Eastern
Province.
</P>
<P>
Vakarai has been used by the rebels as one of their major bases
in the province and the rebels put up resistance initially but
then fled the area. Prior to fleeing the area, the rebels had
destroyed the Vakarai Hospital and a few other buildings in the
area, he said.
</P>
<P>
One soldier was also killed in action and four others were
injured.
</P>
<P>
A main base at Vakarai and a number of small rebel camps in the
area were demolished by the troops, who also destroyed a port
maintained by the rebels at Vakarai for boat movement.
</P>
<P>
Capture of Vakarai area by the troops will hinder the sea
movement of the rebels between the north and the east, the
spokesman said, adding that successful operation was carried out
by the army, the navy and the air force jointly.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting a war against the
government for a separate state in the north and east of the
country since 1983.

<HEADLINE> India's Ex-Prime Minister Seeks Ouster of Vajpayee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Former Indian Prime Minister
Chandra Shekhar Monday accused the government headed by Atal
Bihari Vajpayee of failure on all fronts and asked secular
parties, particularly Congress, to work out a way to replace it.
</P>
<P>
During a press conference here Monday, Shekhar said India is
isolated due to the "unwise" decision by the Vajpayee government
to conduct the nuclear tests last month which also invited
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He charged the government with making compromise on all fronts
during its three months in office for the sake of remaining in
power.
</P>
<P>
"This government has failed to deliver the goods and it should
go," said Shekhar, who was India's prime minister from November
1990 to June 1991.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that he sought an early ouster of the
government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), saying,
"Within seven days an alternative government can be formed if all
secular parties are united."
</P>
<P>
He asked the Congress party to take the initiative and said he
is "ready to cooperate with anybody and everybody" for the ouster
of this government.

<HEADLINE> EU-Belarussian Relations Deteriorating: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Relations between the European
Union (EU) and Belarus further deteriorated after EU nations
withdrew their ambassadors from Minsk, an EU official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, said Lousewies van der Laan, spokeswoman for European
Commissioner Hans van den Broek, the European Commission, EU's
executive body, is behind the decision to withdraw ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation EU and Belarus are expected to continue dialogues
through the British presidency of the union or the troika -- the
current EU presidency plus its predecessor and successor, she said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the head of the European Commission's delegation
in Ukraine, who is also accredited to Belarus, would be refrained
from having any official contact with Belarussian authorities.
</P>
<P>
Italy, France, Britain, Germany and Greece were the five EU
countries that had ambassadors in the former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
But they called back ambassadors following the EU objection to
the cut-off of water and electricity supplies and phone services
to their diplomatic residences on the excuse of house repair.
</P>
<P>
The EU also alleged that the Minsk authorities refused to allow
EU ambassadors' vehicles to enter their residential complex.
</P>
<P>
These were against the Vienna Convention, EU officials said.
</P>
<P>
A written statement by the British EU presidency said the
Belarussian ambassadors in EU capitals would be requested to
return to Minsk, a step to convey in strongest terms the
disapproval of EU governments of the latest Belarussian actions.
</P>
<P>
Ties between the two sides began to sour since last November,
when EU decided to give no public recognition to neither the new
constitution nor the new parliament of Belarus.

JOHANNESBURG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Former South African state
president P. W. Botha, 82, married 57-year-old legal secretary
Barbara Robertson in a small, informal ceremony Monday Morning at
his home in Wilderness, Western Cape.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was attended by about 14 guests, including
Botha's two daughters and his son, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Botha's wife, Elize, died a year ago. He was engaged to

JOHANNESBURG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Graca Machel, the widow of
late Mozambican president Samora Machel, will share her
information on her husband's death in 1986 with South Africa's
Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) at a closed-door
inquiry Tuesday, The TRC said in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
This follows two days of testimony earlier this month in Cape
Town on the crash of Machel's plane near South African-Mozambican
border, in which 35 people died.
</P>
<P>
The TRC's investigative unit questioned nine people, including
Craig Williamson, a former military intelligence and security
police operative.
</P>
<P>
Over the last decade, Graca Machel has made her own inquiries
into the death of her husband, and hopes to share this with the
TRC, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The commission would also hear testimony from Abdul Minty,
deputy director-general of the Foreign Affairs Department. Minty

<HEADLINE> Israel Ready for Exchange of Israeli, Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Israel is preparing to return
the bodies of 40 Hezbollah guerrillas and to release other 60
Lebanese detainees in exchange for the remains of an Israeli navy
commando, Israel Radio reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the arrangement, which Lebanese sources said has
been finalized, the body of Israeli Sergeant Major Itamar Ilya
will be transported to Israel by a French military plane via
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The plane will then return to Beirut with the bodies of 40
Lebanese, and the 60 Lebanese detainees will be transported by
bus and handed over to the Lebanese government through the
International Red Cross (IRC).
</P>
<P>
Ilya was one of 12 Israeli navy commandos killed in an
abortive raid in South Lebanon last September. One of the bodies
Israel is expected to return is that of Hadi Nasrallah, son of
Lebanon's leading guerrilla group Hezbollah (Party of God) leader
Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah.
</P>
<P>
France and the IRC have worked to make an exchange deal among
Israel, Hezbollah and the Lebanese government. Israel Radio said
the exchange, which had been postponed several times, will
probably take place within the week.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its northern
border from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is fighting to oust Israeli troops and their local
South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia allies from the zone.
</P>
<P>
Six Israeli soldiers and at least 10 SLA soldiers have been
killed in the zone since the beginning of this year.

<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Italy will try to finish top of Group
B by beating Austria in a match at Saint-Denis on Tuesday to avoid
Brazil in the second round of World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
To do this, the Italian team should show the killer instinct in
the crucial match.
</P>
<P>
The deciding factor will be whether Italy's attack led by
Christian Vieri gets the support from the rest of the team.
</P>
<P>
Italian coach Cesare Maldini had critised the team's midfield,
which instead of moving forwards, has gone into reverse gear.
</P>
<P>
Maldini said:"We have to keep getting better. If we don't,
we'll be going home."
</P>
<P>
If the forwards get the support they need, then the Italian team
will be stronger than they appeared in their first two matches.
</P>
<P>
Vieri said:"I'm a striker and scoring goals is my job. And one
thing is for sure, I'm not stopping at three goals. I've got to
make the most of being on form."
</P>
<P>
The Italian coach knows that Austrians will not give up their
fight though they have not beaten Italy since 1960.
</P>
<P>
Austria have twice earned a 1-1 draw in the closing seconds
earlier in the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Autraian coach Herbert Prohaska said:"I don't think the record
counts for very much. But if Austria were to win, it would go down
in our history, like the time we beat West Germany in the 1978 World
Cup in Argentina."
</P>
<P>
"We made a lot of mistakes against Chile and Cameroon. But we
worked hard and kept running, and were able to sort things out in
the end." said Prohaska.
</P>
<P>
The match between Italy and Austria will see if the Austrians
can sort things out a third time at the World Cup.

CAIRO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin arrived here Monday from Sudan on route to the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Yassin will spend two days in Cairo for medical treatment
before returning to the Palestinian self-rule area. Egypt is the
only way overland for Yassin to enter Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Israel has reportedly threatened to bar Yassin's return but
changed mind after Hamas warned of "dangerous repercussions
in the Palestinian occupied territories" if Israel takes the step.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas founder went to Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, on
May 29 after a three-and-half-month fund-raising tour of the Arab
world and Iran.
</P>
<P>
He had planned to visit Malaysia and Pakistan, but his health
condition does not allow him.
</P>
<P>
Hamas is opposed to making peace between the Palestinians and
Israelis, insisting that peace can only be realized when Israel
returns all the occupied lands.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, Yassin has repeatedly issued statements
supporting armed struggle against Israel.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region announced Monday that it will
suspend all land sales by auction or public tender for the
remainder of the 1998-99 financial year.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the a special, four-part stimulus package
unveiled by Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa to relieve the current
hardship and revive Hong Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>
The package is designed to address the credit and liquidity
crunch, falling property prices, business and domestic costs and
declining public confidence.
</P>
<P>
The thrust of the measures is easing the credit and liquidity
crunch, stabilizing property prices, easing costs burdens on
families and business and freezing senior civil servants' pay
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
Specific measures of the package include:
</P>
<P>
-- Exempting interest income earned locally from profits tax
with immediate effect. This will provide additional liquidity and
improve the lending appetite of the banking system through the
repatriation of offshore deposits to Hong Kong. The government
hopes that this measure could bring in an estimated 200 billion HK
 dollars (25.6 billion U.S. dollars) to the Hong Kong banking
sector.
</P>
<P>
-- Setting up a new 2-billion-HK-dollar (256 million U.S.
dollar) scheme modeled on the pilot Credit Guarantee Scheme to
help non-export related small and medium enterprises to obtain
loans.
</P>
<P>
-- Suspending all land sales by auction or public tender for
the remainder of the 1998/99 financial year and freezing private
treaty grants for Sandwich Class Housing sites.

is seen as steps to unilaterally expand Jerusalem's borders.

<HEADLINE> Chile Desperately Need a Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NANTES, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Chile is in desperate need of a win
to qualify for the second round of the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
The match against Cameroon here on Tuesday will be their last
chance as they had squandered lead in both matches against Italy and
Austria.
</P>
<P>
But even they can beat Cameroon, their World Cup trip will most
likely come to a halt as they will meet Brazil in the round of 16.
</P>
<P>
What concerns Chilean coach Nelson Acosta more is the match
against Cameroon, not the possible clash with the title-holders.
</P>
<P>
Acosta needs to make sure his defence does not concede another
late goal as their attacking partnership of Marcelo Salas and Ivan
Zamorano has been proved very effective.
</P>
<P>
Center-back Javier Margas has a slight knee problem but Acosta
reckons he will be fit in time for the match.
</P>
<P>
Margas' Cameroon counterpart Claude Le Roy also has problems
with his team's line-up. Defender Raymond Kalla will miss the match
due to suspension.
</P>
<P>
But Le Roy looks set to put Joseph Desire and Marcel Mahouve to
the starting line-up.
</P>
<P>
Le Roy said he had ausolute confidence in the "Indomitable
Lions", "They've promised to pull out all the stops to qualify. The
Lions can roar, even when they are wounded."

<HEADLINE> HK Committee on Bilingual Legal System Holds Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Committee on
Bilingual Legal System, formed under the chairmanship of the
Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung, held its first meeting Monday
to review progress made in promoting bilingualism in the legal
system.
</P>
<P>
The committee was set up to advise the government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) on the long-term goal of
legal bilingualism and address the policy and practical measures
to facilitate the development and promotion of a bilingual legal
system, having regard to Hong Kong's status as a member of the
common law family and an international financial center.
</P>
<P>
Members of the committee include the chief judge of the High
Court, law scholars, an industrialist and representatives of the
public and various government departments.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the progress made so far in promoting bilingualism in
the legal system, the committee noted the contributions of a
number of committees, including the Steering Committee on the Use
of Chinese in Courts, the Legal Practitioners Liaison Meeting and
the Advisory Committee on Legal Education.
</P>
<P>
Looking to the way forward, the committee noted that the
Department of Justice has initiatives in four broad areas:
drafting of bilingual legislation, publication of legal
glossaries, preparation of bilingual legal documents and training
of government counsel in the use of Chinese in their work.
</P>
<P>
Proposals by the judiciary include facilitation of use of
Chinese in courts, such as organizing specially designed language
courses for bilingual judges and judicial officers; compilation of
a glossary of legal terms and phrases commonly used in courts; and
putting in place a translation program of judgments of the Court
of Final Appeal, the Court of Appeal and the High Court.
</P>
<P>
Members also discussed a number of issues to take forward
bilingualism in the legal system on a long-term basis.
</P>
<P>
These issues include accessibility and improvement of reference
materials and information for the promotion of bilingualism in
law; translation of important English judgments delivered in Hong
Kong and other common law jurisdictions; training of lawyers in
the use of Chinese in court proceedings; and training of law
students in the bilingual legal system and Chinese legal
vocabulary and Chinese language skills in law.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Economy Seen to Post Positive Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Despite the ongoing financial
crisis, the Philippine economy would register a positive growth at
the end of this year while the economy of neighboring countries
contract, the Philippines News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the optimistic forecast was made by the
Institute of International Finance (IIF) and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) in their latest studies.
</P>
<P>
IIF projected that the Indonesian economy may contract by as
much as 12.5 percent this year; Thailand, 7 percent; South Korea,
5 percent; and Malaysia, 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, on the contrary, is projected to post modest
but positive growth figures. It is forecast to register a gross
domestic product growth of 2 percent while its inflation rate is
expected to settle at 8 percent at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
In a recent economic briefing, Philippine Central Bank Governor
Gabriel Singson said the Philippines is likely to be the only
country among those ravaged by the Asian crisis that is able to
show positive growth this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite the crisis, the country's economy would be
driven by bullish exports. For the first four months this year,
the country's merchandise exports grew by 19.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
In its study report, IIF projected that Indonesia's exports
will likely shrink by 11.5 percent and Malaysia by 2.1 percent.
Thailand and South Korea are forecast to post modest exports
growth of 3.8 and 2.8 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' GDP grew by 1.7 percent in the first quarter
this year as a result of the financial crisis and the El Nino
phenomenon. The IMF agreed that the 2.4-3.5 percent GDP target is
attainable.
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, said the inflation rate in the Philippines
would rise to 10 percent at the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Israel Explores Possibility of Holding Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Requested by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, a special committee of the Israeli government
Monday convened its first meeting to discuss the possibility of
holding a referendum on the next troop redeployment in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, hosted by Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi, was
attended by Communications Minister Limor Livnat and
representatives of the Prime Minister's office.
</P>
<P>
During the session, the participants explored the legal basis
for holding a referendum, as well as the length of time it will
take.
</P>
<P>
They did not reach any conclusion on these matters and will
meet again to continue the discussion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai Monday told
reporters in Jerusalem that it is not necessary to hold such a
referendum.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government's efforts should be focused on
advancing the peace talks with the Palestinians, which have been
deadlocked for more than 15 months.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to revive the peace process, the United States has
presented a proposal to both sides, which reportedly calls on
Israel to hand over 13.1 percent of the West Bank in the second
troop redeployment, in exchange for the Palestinian tougher
actions against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has accepted the
initiative formally, while the right-wing in the Israeli
government rejected it, citing that any withdrawal of more than 9
percent would endanger the security of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure from the U.S., Netanyahu said that he is
considering taking the pullback issue to the public as a way to
solve the dispute in his government.
</P>
<P>
However, PNA officials argued that Netanyahu is only using the
consideration on a referendum as an excuse to continue stalling
the peace talks.

<P>
PYONGYANG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Outside pressure and
intervention give no help to ending the Kosovo crisis, the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
As the Kosovo crisis is Yugoslavia's internal affair, said a
spokesman with the DPRK's foreign affairs ministry, its peaceful
solution should be pursued through dialogues and consultations.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question raised by the official Korean Central News
Agency (KCNA), the spokesman noted that the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) has mounted military pressures onto Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
On June 15, NATO sent some 80 warplanes to areas around Kosovo,
a Yugoslav province, on an air strike exercise, so as to press
Belgrade for resuming talks with breakaway ethnic Albanians there.
</P>
<P>
"NATO's attempt at such armed intervention is exacerbating the
Kosovo crisis and gravely threatening the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia," said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopes IMF to Disburse loans to Indonesia Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government hopes that
international funding institutions including the IMF would
immediately disburse their financial aid to Indonesia, U.S. Deputy
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The financial assistance will become an important contribution
for Indonesia to pass this difficult period," Summers told
reporters after meeting with Indonesian President B. J. Habibie at
the Presidential Office Monday.
</P>
<P>
The release of loans by the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank could help Indonesia
out of its economic crisis, said Summers, who arrived here on
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Asked if his country has caused the delay in the release of the
IMF funds, Summers said the IMF made the decision by itself.
</P>
<P>
The IMF promised last October to provide 10 billion U.S.
dollars of the 43 billion dollar fund which the agency brokered to
bail out Indonesia's ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia received the first tranche of 3 billion dollars from
the IMF in November last year, but the second disbursement of 3
billion dollars scheduled for June was delayed due to riots in
Jakarta in May and the political crisis in the country which
forced former President Soeharto to step down.
</P>
<P>
The IMF executive board is expected to meet late this month to
discuss the timetable for the disbursement of loans to Indonesia.

Being "worried that not all are feeling the threat of extremism

National flags are flying at half-mast around Russia to
remember "those killed in the war, those tortured to death in
prison camps and those who died of hunger and deprivation."
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, extremism is surging in Russia and poisoning
youngsters, who are fascinated by military symbolism.
</P>
<P>
As Russia struggles to bring itself out of economic
difficulties and many people are left jobless, extremism is seen
rising in the country, with mounting reports of violence against
ethnic minorities and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Yeltsin laid a wreath at the Tomb of the
Unknown Soldier. And he urged his people not to "forget the bitter
lessons of history for which this nation has paid so dearly."
</P>
<P>
At least 26 million Russians were killed in the Second World
War. And some Western historians put the figure as high as 40
million.

<P>
Vedrine, over the private Radio-Television Luxembourg, was
refering to U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's remarks

The United States is drawing a conclusion about the situation

voters, youths and women through Khatami's election, he said.

"The whole world has been analyzing this phenomenon since and
wants to intelligently follow it up while remaining prudent, as
the hostile forces are still very great," said the French minister.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Biggest Party Insists on October 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's biggest party, the United
Nigeria Congress Party (UNCP), has said that the October 1 date
for the military to hand over to an elected civilian government
is still feasible and realizable.
</P>
<P>
The party also stressed its stand against the extension of the
transition program as suggested by the four other parties.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried on major national newspapers Monday,
the party said it strongly support the pronouncement by Nigeria's
new leader, General Abdulsalam Abubakar, to conclude the
transition program on October 1, 1998 as originally planned.
</P>
<P>
The party dissociated itself from the views credited to the
other four parties that the transition program be extended by
three-12 month.
</P>
<P>
It suggested that the governorship and presidential elections
be adjusted from August 1 to August 29, while governors and state
legislators be sworn in on September 21, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The party refused the demand of the four other parties that
results of the December 6, 1997 state assembly election and the
April 25, 1998 national assembly election be cancelled.
</P>
<P>
UNCP won by overwhelming majorities in both elections, but the
four other parties accused it of having government support and
complained of massive rigging.
</P>
<P>
The party described the demand as "the bad loser syndrome"
that "has plagued our attempts at democracy".
</P>
<P>
"Even the 1993 presidential election which was adjudged to be
'freest and fairest' during the regime of General Ibrahim
Babangida was attacked by losers as being fraught with massive
rigging, corruption, abuse of the office and several forms of
irregularities," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Reminding that the two elections have been passed as free and
fair by international observers, the party said the call for
their cancellation is "a ridiculous after-thought and an attempt
to draw the clock back in an otherwise successful implementation
of the Transition Program."
</P>
<P>
fter all, it said, before the death of late head of state,
General Sani Abacha on June 8, no parties have called for the
cancellation of the election.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's transition to civil rule program met a major setback
with the sudden death of Abacha, who until his death, was the
consensus presidential candidate of the five parties.
</P>
<P>
As part of his wide consultations on the way forward for the
transition program, the new leader Abubakar has summoned the
parties on June 13 for discussion.
</P>
<P>
When it was clear that the parties were divided on the way
forward, with UNCP on one side, and the four others on the other,
Abubakar ordered that the parties put heads together and come up
again with a common position.
</P>
<P>
But according to the UNCP's statement, the parties met for two
days on June 16 and 17 and failed to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The UNCP decided to discontinue further participation with
the four parties when it became evident that they were inexorable
in their call for the cancellation" of the elections, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the new leadership will make up its mind
on the transition program in early July, when June 9-July 7
national mourning for Abacha ends.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Cameroun to Meet World Court on Bakassi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and Cameroun will hold a
special meeting Wednesday with judges of the International Court
of Justice on the dispute between the two countries over the
Bakassi Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to enable the three parties to decide
on the next line of action to solve the dispute, the Nigerian
Tribune reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian delegation, which left Sunday for the meeting at
Hague, the Netherlands, has made preparations not only for the
meeting but also for the case proper, it said.
</P>
<P>
The world's top court had earlier ruled that it was competent
to rule in the dispute over the ownership of the peninsula. The
case was filed at the court by Cameroun four years ago.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the court which is empowered by the United
Nations Charter to adjudicate on differences among nations, is
definite, with no appeal.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, disagreements over Bakassi date
back to 1985 when the Western colonial powers met in Berlin,
Germany, to slice up the continent of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Nigeria and Cameroun have been involved in series
of disagreements which sometimes resulted in fierce fighting
between Nigerian soldiers and the gendarmes of Cameroun, leading
to casualties on both sides.

<P>
NAIROBI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenya and Tanzania are among 17
countries which have signed the Indian Ocean Memorandum of
Understandings on Port State Control in a bid to ban unseaworthy
ships from the region from January, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which will enforce port state control, is part
of efforts by Indian Ocean maritime countries to implement
International Maritime Organization (IMO) conventions seeking
cleaner and safer seas, a local press report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The IMO wants to establish regional cooperation in port state
control to prevent the sub-standard ships from sailing, harmonize
inspections and facilitate the exchange of information.
</P>
<P>
Once the agreement takes root, ships plying the region's
territorial waters will be inspected upon entry in any member
state port and issued with a certificate of seaworthiness valid
for six months, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Countries signing the agreement have also agreed to set up a
regional secretariat in Goa, India, and an information center at
Pretoria, South Africa for an interim period of two years from
January 1999.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Jerusalem Expansion Plan Draws Wide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Israel's newly adopted Jerusalem
expansion plan drew wide criticism inside and outside the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet Sunday approved a plan that would extend
Jerusalem municipal authority over eight settlements in the West
Bank, which is seen as steps to unilaterally expand Jerusalem's
borders.
</P>
<P>
In its Monday editorial, Israel's influential newspaper
Ha'aretz said that "the plan almost certainly is intented to
create territorial continuity between Jerusalem and the Jewish
cities and settlements -- such as Ma'aleh Adumim and Givat Ze'eve
-- that today are the very heart of Palestinian territory."
</P>
<P>
"When the government approved this development plan, it, in
effect, helped Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lay a land mine on
the road towards achieving regional peace," it said.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the scheme's transparency, the government has no
right to complain about the harsh criticism" by the U.S. and the
Palestinians, because they considered the plan as a violation of
the Oslo Accord, the editorial added.
</P>
<P>
The accord stipulates that the status of Jerusalem, holy to
Muslims, Christians and Jewishes, should be negotiated in the
final status. Before that, the two sides should refrain from any
unilateral actions to change the city's status, demographic
composition and other characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The PNA chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said Sunday night that the
plan "constitutes a declaration of war on the Palestinian presence
in Jerusalem," terming it a "racist, religious decision" which
seeks to "upset natural demographic development and Judaize
Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Sunday called the
plan a "provocative" step adopted at a sensitive time when efforts
are exerted to revive the long-stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The 22-member Arab League also blasted the plan, saying that
"such Israeli acts provoke both the Arab world and the
international community, raising concern over the future of the
Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have been deadlocked since March
last year when Israel started the construction of a settlement in
the Arab East Jerusalem. Israel's intransigence over its troops
redeployment in the West Bank has worsened the situation.

<HEADLINE> E. Africa Calls for Joint Campaign Against Weed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The East Africa Cooperation (EAC)
has asked its three member states of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda
to work out joint strategies to control the rampant water
hyacinth in Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
"Coordination of joint regional efforts remains the best
option in the control of water hyacinth menace," Magaga Alot, a
spokesman for the EAC, was quoted by Monday's East African
newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
EAC's first-ever ministerial meeting on the weed is expected
to be held this week following a two-day meeting of experts last
week in northern Tanzanian town Arusha, where the EAC secretariat
is based.
</P>
<P>
At the Arusha meeting, experts noted that measures at the
national level by the three countries so far have proved costly,
time-consuming and ineffective.
</P>
<P>
The measures include the introduction of beetles by Kenya and
Tanzania, a planned use of toxic chemical by Uganda, which is
opposed to by the other two states, the proposed use of weed
harvesting machines by Kenya and numerous research projects.
</P>
<P>
However, efforts to rid of the weed have "shown only limited
success," said Alot.
</P>
<P>
"Since the spread of the weed and its infestation process is
borderless, regional coordination in its control and monitoring
is necessary if maximum results are to be achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting recommended that a committee of experts, working
under the EAC, be formed to work out a common strategy to deal
with the water hyacinth menace.
</P>
<P>
Last year the World Bank agreed to allocate 77.6 million U.S.
Dollars to the three sister nations in a five-year project to
counter the weed which has choked the second largest fresh water
lake in the world.
</P>
<P>
Uganda, which is the most affected by the weed, has admitted
that all the methods it has applied -- a combination of manual,
mechanical and biological, -- have had limited success.
</P>
<P>
"Assessment by the government shows that the manual method has
had limited success hectare," said Dick Nyeko, coordinator of
water hyacinth control in Uganda's Ministry of Agriculture,
Animal Industry and Fisheries.
</P>
<P>
The aquatic plant exhibits prolific growth. In Uganda, an
annual average productivity of 1,700 to 3,500 tons of the wet
vegetation has been recorded.
</P>
<P>
However, the use of mechanical methods to combat the weed is
"even more expensive," said Nyeko.
</P>
<P>
"It involves the procurement of machinery, repairs and
maintenance as well as the removal of water hyacinth from the
surface and haulage to dump sites," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to sources in the Lake Victoria Environmental
Management Project, Uganda has at least 70 of its fish landing
sites blocked by the weed, devastating the economy of the
lakeside regions.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania have agreed that the biological
control method, though slow to show results, could be more
effective and less costly in the long run if compared with the
other two methods.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI), which is the
main government agency in charge of Kenya's water hyacinth
control, has applied both bio-agents and mechanical control
methods with limited success.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has given more emphasis to biological control through
the introduction of two weevil species in the genus of Neochetina
-- N.Bruchi and N.Eichhorniae and a moth -- which have been
identified as biological control agents.
</P>
<P>
The weevils were imported from west Africa in 1995 and bred at
Kibaha near Dar-es-Salaam. Some 22,700 weevils were released in
Mwanza and Mara bay in October last year and another 51,650 in
the following two months.
</P>
<P>
Sources said millions of weevils already bred along the coast
which will soon be released into Lake Victoria to feed on water
hyacinth weed.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Former President Calls for Oil Output Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran's former president Hashemi
Rafsanjani Monday called on all oil producers to slash their
output to revive the sluggish international oil markets.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani made the call in a meeting with the outgoing Qatari
ambassador to Tehran Ali Abdulaziz al-Kuwari.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani urged the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) to formulate practical measures in its coming
meeting to curb the sagging oil prices, the Iranian official news
agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami and Saudi Crown
Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz had a telephone conversation and
called for coordination among OPEC members to deal with the
current depressed oil market.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, Iran and Qatar, all in Gulf, are OPEC members.
</P>
<P>
The 11 members of the OPEC will convene Wednesday in Vienna to
explore ways to revive the sluggish oil market and further oil
production cuts are expected.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices tumbled to a nine-year low of below 12 U.S. dollars
per barrel in March, which forced OPEC and non-OPEC members to
slash their output by 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd).
</P>
<P>
The sagging prices have so far caused tens of billions of
U.S. dollars in losses for the oil producers.
</P>
<P>
Oil experts predicted that the OPEC members need to further cut
2.1 million bpd to revive the ailing oil market.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Calls for Holding Arab Summit on Israel's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Jawad
Anani on Monday called for holding an urgent Arab summit to find
ways of countering the Israeli plan to strengthen its hold on the
disputed holy city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by reporters from Israel Radio, Anani denounced the
Israeli Cabinet's decision Sunday to extend Jerusalem's municipal
boundaries as an "invalid political decision intended to annex
Palestinian territories by illegitimate and unacceptable ways."
</P>
<P>
The convening of an Arab summit is necessary and urgent,
because the Israeli plan to annex Jerusalem is detrimental to the
Arab people and will be categorically rejected by all countries in
the Arab and Muslim worlds, Anani said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the Israeli move would speed up
the holding of an Arab summit and this issue will top the summit's
agenda. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has been lobbying for
support for holding such a summit to confront the Israeli
intransigence in the peace process, but no agreement has been
reached due to differences among the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
"There is a consensus (in the Arab and Muslim worlds) that all
the red lines have been trespassed. The potentials of peace and
hopes of building a real and comprehensive peace that provides
security and good life for all the peoples in the Middle East are
gone, thanks to these invalid measures," he added.
</P>
<P>
Anani said the Israeli measures are considered invalid because
they unilaterally changed the borders of Jerusalem, whose status
should be settled through the Israeli-Palestinian permanent talks
under the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that "Jordan rejects categorically the Israeli
decision, and considers it invalid and literally non-existent."
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Anani issued an official statement to denounce the
the Israeli plan to extend Jerusalem's municipal authority over
surrounding towns and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized the Arab East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967
war and has declared the whole city as its eternal capital, but
the Palestinians hope to establish an independent state with East
Jerusalem as the capital.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, the second Arab country that signed a peace treaty with
Israel, has been consistent in supporting the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
The future of Jerusalem is one of the most sensitive disputes
that should be hammered out in the final-status talks between
Israel and the Palestinians. But the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process has been stalled since early 1997, when Israel began the
construction of a major settlement in East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Epidemic Worsens in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The cholera situation in the
Somali capital is deteriorating when all international aid
agencies have pulled out their international expatriates from
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The evacuation due security reasons followed the temporary
abduction of the ten workers of the International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) in Mogadishu in April this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued at Benadir Hospital in
Mogadishu which has the best quarantine facilities, the doctors
had complained about lack of medicines and rehydration supplies.
</P>
<P>
The doctors had threatened that they won't be able to continue
managing the cases of the suffering people whom they called
"neglected cholera patients."
</P>
<P>
The doctors also said that cholera and the other contagious
diseases such as the measles will remain hazardous and menacing
considering the very poor sanitation in the capital accompanied
by the non-chlorinated water supplies mainly from the shallow
wells.
</P>
<P>
Statistics issued by the hospital indicated more than 7,157
morbidity cases while the mortality had exceeded 275 since
January this year.
</P>
<P>
Forlanini Hospital, another one with quarantine facility in
Mogadishu, is also accommodating cholera patients at the rate of
ten per day.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Health Authority (JHA) of Mogadishu has opened a new
clinic in Forlanini Hospital to give free consultations to the
poor people.
</P>
<P>
At the moment people in the capital have started treating
their patients inside their houses in the residential areas since
the quarantines have nothing to offer them. They buy rehydration
solutions and other antibiotics from private chemists, thus
aggravating the spread of the disease since the public awareness
programs had also been stopped.
</P>
<P>
The JHA has appealed to the international community to come to
Mogadishu to assist the Somalis at this particular moment when
measles and cholera are victimizing the poor Somalis.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- German Football Federation said on
Monday they was shocked by the latest violence by German fans in Lens
and called on the authorities to take rigorous action against the
hooligans.
</P>
<P>
"It was with dismay and incredulity that (German Football
Federation President) Egidius Braun, the delegation and the entire
team of Germany learned late on Sunday evening of the serious
disturbances that had occured after the match between Germany and
Yugoslavia in Lens," said a statement issued by the federation.
</P>
<P>
The statement added, "The delegation of the German team, national
coach Berti Vogts and all players explicitly demand that state
authorities finally and at last take rigorous action against all those
who commit acts of violence and who abuse the popularity of football
for their senseless misdeeds."
</P>
<P>
It said the federation had tipped the French authority on arrival
of the country's soccer hooligans in France and asked them to take the
necessary preventative action.
</P>
<P>
However, the federation emphasized that these violent hooligans
should be told apart from the genuine fans who enjoy the sport.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, "These people are criminals who should not be
mentioned in the same breath as the millions of fans who love football
and who go to stadiums only for the enjoyment of the game."
</P>
<P>
It said the federation regret Sunday's incidents all the more
becase the German squad has been welcomed with hospitality in
France.
</P>
<P>
French gendarme Daniel Nivel, married with two children, were now
still in a deep coma after being attacked reportedly by German
hooligans.

<HEADLINE> German Leaders Outraged at Hooligan Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl Monday
expressed outrage at the violent riots of German hooligans in the
French city of Lens on Sunday which left a French policeman
fatally injured.
</P>
<P>
"It is really a shame for Germany," said Kohl, adding that
those responsible for the attacks should face trial as soon as
possible in either German or French courts.
</P>
<P>
According to French radio reports, the 44-year-old French
policeman was still in critical conditions on Monday after
suffering head injures during clashes with German hooligans after
Sunday's World Cup match between Germany and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel also sent a telegram to
his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine to condemn the attacks.
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked by the violent riots of German hooligans in Lens,"
Kinkel said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also expressed support for a swift crackdown on
the rioters, saying "we should not allow a handful of violent
criminals to torpedo the World Cup which is held in the spirits of
fairness and gentlemanship".
</P>
<P>
German head coach Berti Vogts was also quoted by German media
as saying: "I would rather Germany having been defeated by
Yugoslavia so that the French police official could still be
healthy."
</P>
<P>
Germany staged a dramatic comeback to snatch a 2-2 draw with
Yugoslavia on Sunday, earning a vital point to keep the leading
position in Group F.
</P>
<P>
Police said that some 20,000 fans arrived in Lens without
tickets on Sunday. Many of them went on rampage and clashed with
police before and after the match. About 96 people were detained,
some of them were believed to be neo-Nazis, German press reports

<HEADLINE> North China Province Investing in Major Infrastructure Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- North China's Liaoning Province
will invest more than 97.6 billion yuan on 23 major infrastructure
projects this year.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official said these infrastructure projects
include construction in such areas as transportation, water
conservation, power plants, and telecommunication networks.
</P>
<P>
With an investment of 9.24 billion yuan, the 360-kilometer
Shenyang-Shanhaiguan expressway is under construction. The
Shenyang-Siping expressway, 161 kilometers long with an investment
of 2.39 billion yuan, should begin operations in August.
</P>
<P>
As the country's key project during the 1996-2000 period,
electrification of the Harbin-Dalian railway will be completed
within two years. The 946-kilometer line is expected to cost 5.25
billion yuan. Construction on the line began in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Province also is expanding its telecommunication
networks. About 7.3 billion yuan will be used this year to ensure
an increase of 630,000 lines on the telephone switchboard within
the province.

<HEADLINE> Cars Powered by Natural Gas Debut in Chinese Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Natural-gas-powered cars are making
their debut in some Chinese cities as part of the nationwide
effort to fight a pollution problem in urban areas mainly caused
by vehicle fumes.
</P>
<P>
A taxi company in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan
Province, had 27 of its taxis equipped with natural-gas last year,
and a year's operation has shown that the new method reduces fuel
cost by one-half.
</P>
<P>
And, more importantly, the use of natural gas dramatically
reduced pollution caused by vehicle fumes. Many other taxi drivers
expect to have their cars transformed into using natural gas,
according to the taxi company's manager.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, worked
out a plan to expand the use of natural gas on vehicles for public
transportation in the next few years. Fifty buses are being
converted to natural gas, and will be put into operation in
August.
</P>
<P>
The new technology, the brainchild of a Xi'an-based gas
bottling company of the No.4 Research Institute under China
Aerospace Industrial Corp., has made it possible to process the
key equipment -- bottles made of synthetic materials for
compressed natural gas -- for natural-gas-driven vehicles, after
four years of research.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say that more than 60 percent of air
pollutants in urban areas are produced by vehicle fumes. So,
natural gas has become the favorite choice at a time when people
badly need a clean energy source to replace gasoline for vehicles.
</P>
<P>
China is also making efforts to find substitutes for natural
gas, and the Xi'an product is the latest effort. China has rich
resources of natural gas, and plans to pump 25-to-30 billion cubic
meters of onshore natural gas during the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
The Xi'an-based company will have been able to produce 100,000
gas bottles of the kind annually by the end of the century,
sources said.

<HEADLINE> Fuzhou to Maintain Unemployment Rate Below Two Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Fuzhou, capital of east China's
Fujian Province, plans to maintain its 1998 unemployment rate
below two percent.
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the city to provide jobs for 60 percent of the
projected 50,000 people facing lay-offs during the year.
</P>
<P>
The local government effort to reach the target includes a new
large-scale project to mobilize the general public to assist
unemployed workers.
</P>
<P>
Many firms have relaxed age and cultural level requirements for
job-seekers and placed priority on hiring unemployed people.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 17 job fairs held over the past two months
have helped over 10,000 find new employment. Some 20,000 laid-off
workers attended the various fairs and over 6,000 found new
employment.
</P>
<P>
The city has also attempted to ensure the basic living
standards of unemployed workers by adopting policies urging local
governments, firms and the general public to jointly cover the
basic living costs for those in need.
</P>
<P>
The city adopted 29 related support policies in 1997 and has
successfully maintained the local unemployment rate below 1.2
percent, a level much lower than the national average.

<HEADLINE> China to Export Technology Via Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) plans to link the nation's first
virtual technology export market to the Internet (MOFTEC) via the
"Made-in-China" commodity market net launched last month.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC has granted approval to over 2,000 businesses and
research institutes to display their technology on the online
"China Technology Fair" which will be introduced August 12 on the
ministry's official website, according to the China International
Electronic Commerce Center (CIECC), the server.
</P>
<P>
The organizer expects the site to offer some 3,000 technology
items.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that many Chinese companies and businesses have
the capability to export technology but are nonetheless often
perplexed by the lack of information, high costs, the lack of
sales channel and unclear market positioning.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC notes the vast potential to increase the export volume
for key technological products such as computers and
telecommunications, electronic and biological products which
currently account for a mere 5.3 percent of China's total exports.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the MOFTEC Science and Technology department,
host of the online fair, is placing great hope on the fact that
the electronic-business system will enhance the efficiency for
transmitting information and reduce the cost of data exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the "China Technology Fair", another
E-business project sponsored by MOFTEC, centers on reducing costs
while greatly expanding the market recognition of domestic
technology.
</P>
<P>
Foreign experts point out that E-business, a method of "deals
done via electronic mail", takes full advantage of a shorter trade
process and the prompt response from the market and customers.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Trade and Development Organization estimated
that the transaction volume for global E-business will hit 200
billion U.S. dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC has announced that all import and export businesses will
be required to apply to the CIECC for quota certificate by the
year 2000. The ministry completed extensive testing of an
application network in east China's Shandong province last
October, with assessment completed and the system accepted at the
end of May.
</P>
<P>
The CIECC, established in 1996, is China's sole nationwide
network for the E-business network for foreign trade linked to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
Various foreign companies have targeted the E-business market
in China. For example, IBM has focused its development strategy on
providing small- to medium-sized Chinese enterprises with
useful information technology.

<HEADLINE> China Set to Adopt Law on Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China plans to standardize medical
practices nationwide by adopting a law governing the
qualifications of medical workers and related professional ethics.
</P>
<P>
The draft law on doctors was submitted to the Standing
Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) today for
deliberation during its third meeting which is scheduled to last
five days.
</P>
<P>
The draft law stipulates that the nation will introduce a
system for registered doctors who have passed qualification exams
organized by the health departments above the county level,
according to Zhang Xuwu, vice-chairman of the NPC Law
Committee. Zhang made the comment in a report to the Standing
Committee on preliminary deliberation on the draft law.
</P>
<P>
The proposed law bans individuals without required certificates
from offering medical services, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
In addition, doctors must strictly abide by professional ethics
and specific operating procedures, improve their skills and
protect the privacy of patients.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the draft law, all medical workers are
prohibited from seeking personal benefits when performing their
specified duties.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that adoption of the law will strengthen the crack
down on medical charlatans across the country who frequently
overcharge patients for ineffective treatment.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that numerous unlicensed medical workers
provide services in rural areas. The country's mass media
frequently publicizes civilian cases involving medical malpractice.
</P>
<P>
The 47-article draft law has be deliberated on two previous
occassions and is expected to be passed this time around,
according to NPC sources.

<HEADLINE> HK Tourist Figures Remain Down, Forecast Revised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- With no respite from the
economic turmoil in the region, tourism continued to suffer in May
with arrivals for the month totaling 778,000, down 20.3 percent
from May 1997, the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA) said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Total arrivals for the first five months of 1998 were 3.77
million, down 23.4 percent on the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the HKTA has revised its forecast for 1998 to less
than 10 million visitors.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest figures, HKTA executive director Amy
Chan said: "We are facing a situation where the prolonged economic
downturn in the region is deterring outbound traffic, while the
depreciation of their currencies continues to erode the price
competitiveness of Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
She noted that the HKTA now expects tourist arrivals for the
entire year of 1998 to be about 6 percent down on the 10.4 million
recorded in 1997, "but much depends on how quickly regional
economies stabilize in the coming months."
</P>
<P>
Chan said that the current economic turmoil is making it
increasingly difficult to make accurate forecasts of visitor
arrivals. "We must continue to closely monitor the situation and
make adjustments according to the prevailing situation," she said.

<P>
LANZHOU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Optimistic signs for foreign
trade of Lanzhou, capital of northwest China's Gansu Province,
include a steady increase of exports, the development of
export-oriented enterprises and its export product structure.
</P>
<P>
An official from the economic and trade commission of Lanzhou
said that last year the city's exports totaled 350 million
U.S. dollars. Subordinate enterprises of the city reported 31.35
million U.S. dollars of imports and exports in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Preferential policies were given to foreign-invested,
export-oriented enterprises to encourage foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
With the increase of enterprises which have the right to import
and export, foreign-invested enterprises contributed more to
export trade in Lanzhou. In 1997, foreign-invested enterprises
reported 30.19 million U.S. dollars of exports, up 101.3 percent
compared to the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Besides a steady increase in traditional exports such as
industrial products, Lanzhou has become an exports base for beer,
calcium carbide and light-industry machinery.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the export of industrial and electro-mechanical
products in Lanzhou was 123 million U.S. dollars, accounting for
35 percent of the total exports in the city.

<HEADLINE> Romanian PM Calls for Better Ties With Poland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The relations between Romania
and Poland must be revived, Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile
said Monday on his departure for an three-day visit to Poland.
</P>
<P>
Poland is "the most important country" in Central and Eastern
Europe, Vasile said, in addition pointing to the fact that it was
accepted to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
However, the head of government said, Romania's foreign
policies in the past "have neglected relations with Poland, which
should be revived at both political and economic level."
</P>
<P>
For Romania, a Polish lobby would be "as efficient as any
Western lobby for being admitted to NATO," he said.
</P>
<P>
As about the Romanian-Polish trade ties, Vasile said they were
"below their real potential," and expressed the hope that his
visit to Poland would "consolidate the Warsaw-Bucharest axis."
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the volume of trade between the two
countries was about 200 million U.S. dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In Warsaw, Vasile is expected to meet his Polish counterpart
Jerzy Buzek, President Alexander Kwasniewski, the speakers of the
Polish Parliament and Deputy Prime Minister Leszek Balcerowicz.
</P>
<P>
In addition to his schedule for time together with members of
the Polish National Chamber of Commerce, his last day of visit is
dedicated to a business meeting in Cracow with local officials.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Arrives in Greece on Cyprus Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. presidential envoy Richard
Holbrooke arrived here Monday for talks with Greek officials on
resolving the country's disputes with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, assigned to serve good office on the Cyprus issue,
is expected to talk with senior Greek Foreign Ministry officials
and possibly with Prime Minister Costas Simitis.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have long been at odds, as both sides claim
sovereignty over the Mediterranean of island Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been partitioned since troops from Turkey, in
reaction to a Greek Cypriot coup in Nicosia engineered by the
junta then ruling Greece, invaded the north of the island in 1974.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots proclaimed their own state in 1983 but is
recognized only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
On his schedule for Friday, the U.S. envoy is to attend the
graduation ceremony of the American College of Greece in Piraeus,
about 15 kilometers southwest of Athens.
</P>
<P>
The post of Holbrooke, who has recently won the nomination of
Washington's ambassador to the United Nations, will be reportedly
transferred to another U.S. official.

</P>
<P>
The joyful people, particularly the young soccer fans, drove

<HEADLINE> Interview: U.S. Business Leader Upbeat About HK's Future (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Frank Martin, president of the
American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong (AmCham), said that Hong
Kong will be the first economy to recover from the current
economic crisis in Asia because it has many advantages over the
other economies in the region.
</P>
<P>
Martin, who was appointed president of the AmCham in December
1990, told Xinhua at his office that members of the AmCham have
full confidence in the competitiveness of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
The rule of law and the unrestricted flow of information, which
constitute the two most important factors for Hong Kong's
advantages over its competitors in the region, remained unchanged
after Hong Kong's return to China on July 1, 1997, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that prior to the handover there was much concern
about the fact that there would be changes in Hong Kong's legal
system. But nearly one year after the handover "the legal system
retains its function, just as it was prior to the handover,"
Martin said.
</P>
<P>
"We mentioned the legal system because this is the most
important factor why international business remains in Hong Kong,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
"I expressed overall satisfaction that Hong Kong's legal system
has been retained without any interference from China's Central
Government," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Martin said that there was also a great deal of worry about the
censorship of the media prior to the handover.

<HEADLINE> Museveni to Pay Education Fee for His Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
will start paying the education fees for his children in August
if the parliament approves a bill seeking to withdraw state
funding for the children of the president in July.
</P>
<P>
Hope Kivengere, the president's press secretary, was quoted by
East African weekly as saying that the bill will only apply to
the present head of state and is not binding for future ones.
</P>
<P>
She said the president had indicated on several occasions that
he could and would pay for his children's education.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1995 constitution, the state should provide fees for
four biological or legally adopted children of the president and
vice-president up to university level.
</P>
<P>
To cut down on public expenses and government spending,
Museveni announced on June 6 that he would reduce numbers of his
foreign trips and in his State of the House address he reiterated
his willingness to pay for his children's education.
</P>
<P>
Museveni, who came to power in 1986 and is now in his
mid-fifties, has four children.

<HEADLINE>    Martin stated that there is no change of the American presence in HK and it continues to be very strong. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Obviously the foreign businesses were affected by the economic
environment, but most of the American and the international
businesses will take a long-term view rather than a short term
one," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"So, we do not expect to see many companies leaving Hong Kong
and actually we have seen many new companies coming to Hong Kong,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
There are at least 20 new companies which have joined the
chamber this year, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
"We do see some companies downsize their business because of
the regional economic crisis, but they said they would not leave
Hong Kong and the contraction has nothing to do with the handover
but purely because of the regional economic crisis," Martin said.
</P>
<P>
Because most of the companies in Hong Kong are responsible for
the business in the whole region, many of the companies were
exporting to Southeast Asia and these exports have declined very
sharply, some companies have no choice but to reduce their staffs,
he explained.
</P>
<P>
This is a short term phenomenon, Martin said. In fact, many
companies are seeking business opportunities for investment in the
region, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's stability has much to do with its close
relationship with the Chinese mainland, the responsible behavior
of the Chinese leadership that promised the renminbi will not be
devalued at this time, and the strong economic growth of the
mainland.

<HEADLINE> Two South African Players Sent Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- With just two days before
South Africa's crucial World Cup game against Saudi Arabia, coach
Philippe Troussier on Sunday dismissed two players from the team
and also threatened to quit himself, South African media reported.
</P>
<P>
Midfielders Brendan Augustine and Aaron Mokoena were dropped
from the team Sunday after breaking a curfew for the second
time. The two stayed out late Saturday at a nightclub in Vichy,
France, where they were camping, in defiance of a curfew placed on
the players.
</P>
<P>
Ten players went out on a late night drinking spree last
Saturday, the day after they had been beaten 3-0 by France in
their opening match, and were reprimanded by Troussier.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the dismissal of the two, Troussier said the team
was not mature and there were only five players "who do what is
required of them and do prepare themselves for the game."
</P>
<P>
"The players have a responsibility to the team and the country
and they have to respect that. As a coach it must be my job to see
that we do well in this World Cup, and I can not accept that they
break the rules," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a visibly upset Troussier said he had "had enough"
and just wanted to finish his tenure as coach.
</P>
<P>
"I have received the message back from South Africa that they
don't want a foreigner as coach. Perhaps it is time for me to go
now. Maybe then they can open the champagne," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am too small for South Africa who need a big name and
stronger coach. This is not for me," Troussier said.
</P>
<P>
The South African squad need a big win in their last Group C
match against Saudi Arabia in Bordeaux Wednesday to secure their
place in the knock-out phase of the finals.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Denies Arms-for-Oil Deal With Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela's office has denied a report that his country had
concluded a secret 300-million-Pound (500-million-U.S. Dollar)
deal to supply Libya with weapons and spare parts in return for
cut-price oil.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph of Britain said the deal was approved by
Mandela, raising fears that Libya's Muammar Gadaffi might acquire
details of South African chemical and bacteriological weapons
built up during the apartheid era, Business Day daily reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I know nothing about it," said Parks Mankahlana, Mandela's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana said he believed South Africa imported no oil from
Libya and relied mainly on Iran and, more recently, Saudi Arabia,
for supplies.
</P>
<P>
Business Day did not say when Mankahlana made the remarks.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph said the arms-for-oil deal was negotiated
by South African secret service officials. It gave no date for
the deal.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, South Africa would supply spare parts for
Libya's aging Mirage jet fighters and attack helicopters,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
South Africa had also held out the possibility of supplying
Libya with its advanced Rooivalk attack helicopters, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Any such deal would violate United Nations sanctions, imposed
to put pressure on Libya to surrender two Libyan suspects in the
1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
which 270 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has long been defensive about ties with countries that
the West regards as sponsoring or encouraging terrorism. During
a visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton to South Africa in March,
Mandela said critics of his ties with Cuba and Libya should
"throw themselves in a pool."
</P>
<P>
Mandela visited Libya twice last October. He has vigorously
defended his loyalty to Gadaffi and urged an end to U.N.
sanctions against Libya.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks End Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- An influx of AMP shares Monday
sent turnover on the Australian Stock Exchange to a record high of
3.6 billion Australian dollars (2.2 billion U.S. dollars), as a
rally in BHP helped the market to a firmer close.
</P>
<P>
Defying a weaker ending on Wall Street Friday night, the all
ordinaries index lifted eight points to 2,596.8 after spending
some of the day in negative territory.
</P>
<P>
National turnover leapt to 3.6 billion Australian dollars from
its last record of 2.6 billion Australian dollars struck when BHP
sold its stake in Foster's Brewing company in June last year.
</P>
<P>
The flood of stock came from newly listed insurance giant AMP
Ltd., whose volume totaled 333.2 million, over half total national
turnover of 620.7 million.
</P>
<P>
Shares from AMP customers who did not take up the offer to
exchange policies for stock were offered to the market Monday.
</P>
<P>
But the share price of the giant insurance house closed down 68
cents at 20.02 Australian dollars, with one stockbroker noting
that institutional investors were standing on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the all resources index outperformed the bigger all
industrials index, with diversified miner BHP lifting nearly four
percent on continued takeover speculation and stable commodity
prices.
</P>
<P>
BHP closed 48 cents higher on turnover of 3.85 million shares.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index lifted 10.7 points, or 1.04 percent, to
1,041.9 points.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index lifted 6.2 points, or 0.14 percent,
to 4,529.4.
</P>
<P>
Both sectors were up despite Wall Street's performance. On
Friday the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped more than one
percent or 100.01 points to 8,712.87.
</P>
<P>
In other equity news, Coca Cola Amatil gained 27.2 cents to
10.52 Australian dollars after shareholders approved a plan to
spin off the company's European bottling operations and create a
separate London-based company.
</P>
<P>
Market leader News Corp. Ltd. lifted three cents to 11.33
Australian dollars and the preferred shares lifted two cents.
Publishing &AMP; Broadcasting Ltd. fell eight cents.
</P>
<P>
The banking index lifted 29.6 points, or 0.52 percent, to
5,705.4.
</P>
<P>
The gold index finished 15.4 points higher, or 1.43 percent, at
1,089.6.

further development of the close and long-standing relations
between Hong Kong and Australia," Kwong said.
</P>
<P>
The MOU focuses on areas of mutual interest for co-operation
which both sides have identified, including the delivery of
government services online, multimedia and software applications
and products, electronic commerce, broadband networks and
applications, and Internet applications, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Australia is advanced in IT development and applications. The
signing of the MOU will enable Hong Kong to benefit from the
experience and expertise of Australia. This will in turn help us
maintain our lead in IT and foster the growth of the local IT
industry," said the Hong Kong official.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the two sides had worked out preliminary plans
for cooperative activities under the MOU. The MOU will be for a
period of five years initially but can be extended by mutual
agreement.

<HEADLINE> 303 Children Rescued From Rebels' Hands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- As many as 303 Ugandan children
have been rescued from the hands of the rebels of Lord Resistance
Army (LRA) over the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Monday's New Vision daily said that 164 of the children were
handed over to the assistant district commissioner of Gulu
district in northern Uganda and the rest to the World Vision
trauma counsel center and the Gulu "save the children"
organization last week.
</P>
<P>
The handover of the children took place seven hours after the
rebels abducted 15 children from Layibi trading center, six
kilometers from Gulu town center, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said two rebels and a captive were killed when the
army ambushed the rebels who tried to sneak back into their
hideout.
</P>
<P>
Local residents saw some 130 rebels looted the trading center
of posho, soft drinks, chicken and clothes.
</P>
<P>
LRA rebels stepped up abductions as government army exerted
mounting pressure on them.
</P>
<P>
Many of the abductees are said to become rebels or rebels'
wives. Recently there are some reports of young rebels aged
between 10 to 18 attacking the vulnerable civilians in the north.
</P>
<P>
There has been a mounting demand from the society for
government to hold peace talks with the rebels due to the
increasingly rampant rebel activities, but the latter has not
shown any indication of change of attitude in that direction.

<HEADLINE> Macao Announces New Measures to Encourage Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Macao Government announced Monday to
reduce the fee for the identification of Macao-made goods to
encourage export.
</P>
<P>
The announcement, which was published on Monday's Government
Bulletin, said the identification fee for export-oriented goods
under the quota system will be cut from current 0.7 percent to 0.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The new measure is aimed at lessening the costs of export so as
to improve the competitiveness of Macao-made products, said the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a subsequent reform will be conducted on the
current foreign export procedures. The reform is also meant to
improve the competitiveness of Macao goods by introducing the
electronic data exchange system.
</P>
<P>
Macao's export value in the first four months of this year
declined by six percent from the same period last year, to have
reached 4.394 billion patacas (about 549.25 million US dollars) as
a result of the financial turmoil in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Garments and textiles made up 81 percent of all exports in
Macao, which were mainly shipped to the United States and European
Union.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Springs Slow Leak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar sprang a
slow leak Monday as it waited for further directional cues from
offshore, particularly Japan.
</P>
<P>
The local currency, which closed here at 60.86 U.S. cents from
61.27 last Friday, remained hostage to the U.S. dollar/Japanese
yen exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
"And the outlook is far from clear," Bankers Trust fixed
interest strategist Rory Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
Recent strength in the Australian dollar and the Japanese yen
is reliant on signs emerging in the coming days and weeks of
genuine reform of the Japanese banking system and economy.
</P>
<P>
Both currencies were buoyed by the combined U.S. Federal
Reserve and Bank of Japan support of the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
"The lack of any concrete news on a reform timetable over the
weekend has disappointed markets and has seen the yen heading back
up towards 140 against the U.S. dollar," Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
There is little news on the domestic front this week to offer
the local unit direction.
</P>
<P>
At the close in Sydney the Australian dollar was buying 84.07
Japanese yen from 83.47 yen last Friday and 1.0946 German marks
from 1.0981.

<HEADLINE> China Bank Increases Loans for Housing Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China, one of China's
big-four state-owned commercial banks, will increase its financial
support for the country's housing sector, according to an official
agreement signed today.
</P>
<P>
BOC will increase its proportion of loans for the real estate
sector by two percentage points each year, raising the rate to
eight percent from the current 3.7 percent, said the agreement
signed between the bank and the Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
The proportional increase means that BOC's outstanding loans
for the real estate sector will rise from 20 billion yuan to 56
billion yuan in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goals, BOC will expand its yuan lending for
ordinary residential housing construction and increase
policy-oriented financial support for the real estate sector. It
will also experiment with business in foreign exchange loans and
mortgage.
</P>
<P>
BOC, China's major foreign exchange bank, budgeted 11 billion
yuan in loans for housing construction and consumption this
year. The figure is 18 percent of the bank's increased loans in
1998, according to a bank official.
</P>
<P>
He said that lending priority will be given to ordinary
residential housing construction and to real estate projects now
under construction.
</P>
<P>
BOC is considering to increase its variety of real-estate loans
and launch combined loaning programs involving both the local
currency and foreign exchange, the official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China (BOC) today
signed an agreement with the Beijing Municipal Government to
provide three billion yuan in loans for the capital's
infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
The lending is part of the bank's financial support package for
Beijing's construction of infrastructure and basic projects.
According to a letter of intent the bank and the municipal government
signed today, the bank will extend a total of seven billion yuan
in loans for Beijing's major projects and enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
A bank official said today that BOC will also sign similar
lending programs with the provinces of Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Henan and
Fujian and Shanghai Municipality.
</P>
<P>
The planned lendings are intended to assist the restructuring
effort of the state-owned enterprises and help boost economic
growth in the respective areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Official data indicate that the BOC Beijing Branch now has 21
billion yuan and 1.55 billion US dollars of outstanding loans to

<HEADLINE> KEDO to Meet on DPRK Nuclear Reactors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Korean Peninsula Energy
Development (KEDO) will meet in Brussels next Monday to discuss
how to share the cost for building two nuclear reactors in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), a KEDO spokesman
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, the United States, Japan and the European Union,
which established the KPEDO in 1994 to help the DPRK develop
two light-water reactors in exchange for the nation's suspension
of suspected nuclear weapons program, will re-assess the
cost-sharing of building the two reactors, originally estimated at
a total of about 5.2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, South Korea pledged to share 3.5 billion of the total
while Japan agreed to pay one billion U.S. dollars and the United
States promised an annual provision of 500,000 tons of heavy oil
to the DPRK until the 1,000-megawatt reactors are completed.
</P>
<P>
After the nuclear test by India and Pakistan in May, South Korea
fears that the DPRK will restore its suspended nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, the DPRK said it would resume its suspended
nulcear program as the United States failed to keep its promise to
provide the nation with light-water reactors.
</P>
<P>
Due to strong challenges from the Republic-led Congress which
had been hesitant to secure the budget for the heavy oil, the
Clinton governemnt recently said it would like to supply safety
equipment for the DPRK's reactors if South Korea shared the cost
of heavy oil.
</P>
<P>
However, South Korea ruled out the possibility of sharing the
cost of heavy oil because of the current financial crisis caused
by corporate bankruptcies and non-performing loans of financial
institutions late last year.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Moves Higher Against Yen in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar moved higher against
the Japanese yen in Tokyo Monday as senior financial officials
from the 17 countries and regions failed to satisfy traders with
the outcome of their meeting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency was quoted at 138.53-56 yen at 5 p.m. (local
time), up from 138.18-20 yen at 9 a.m., and from 137.10-20 yen late
Friday in New York.
</P>
<P>
Market players were bearish for the yen because no concrete steps
for Japan to improve the health of its financial sector resulted from
Saturday's gathering in Tokyo of deputies of finance ministers and
central bankers from the Group of Seven (G-7) and Asian-Pacific
economies, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
Instability in the financial sector was highlighted by talk that
the ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan is in merger talks, which
sent its share price down to 62 yen during the day, shedding the
permissible 50 yen.
</P>
<P>
The yen garnered some cautious support during the day on news of
discussions being held about financial restructuring, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The dollar's upward momentum is somewhat limited due to caution
toward further yen-propping intervention, they said.

<P>
CHONGQING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, the largest
industrial center in southwest China, plans to invest 6 billion
yuan to build residential houses this year.
</P>
<P>
That figure is equivalent to the amount of investment for the
entire 1991-95 period, said Li Yingru, director of the municipal
Real Estate Administration.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has lagged behind other parts of China in residential
construction, Li said. In 1992, the per capita living space in
urban districts of Chongqing averaged 5.2 square meters, ranking
it last among 35 large cities in China.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has a population of more than 30 million.
</P>
<P>
Since the central government decided to abolish the decades-old
practice of welfare housing distribution, local government has
pooled funds of the state, enterprises and individuals to build
new houses.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, half of the urban residents in
Chongqing have bought their own houses. The amount of funds
collected from individuals totaled 5.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Steady growth in the property market has boosted the
development of the building materials sector. A group of cement
and porcelain plants and building materials markets also have
sprung up in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Orders Police to Preempt Leftist Plan to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
Monday ordered the Philippine National Police (PNP) to take action
to preempt leftist rebels New People's Army (NPA) from kidnapping
family members of the late president Ferdinand Marcos.
</P>
<P>
In a handwritten directive, Ramos ordered PNP Director General
Santiago Alino to provide security "to likely NPA targets as may
be warranted."
</P>
<P>
NPA spokesman Gregorio Rosal announced that several NPA teams
have been sent out to track down and "arrest" former first lady
Imelda Marcos, her son Ilocos Norte Governor-elect Ferdinand
"Bongbong" Marcos and other Marcos cronies, so they can be tried
by a "people's court" for alleged human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
The "arrest" order was made following a decision by
President-elect Joseph Estrada to bury the remains of the late
strongman at the heroes' cemetery.
</P>
<P>
According to Rosal, the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of the Philippines has ordered the formation of NPA special
units to carry out the operation against the Marcoses and their
cronies.
</P>
<P>
"This is to obligate them to answer for their responsibilities
to the thousands of victims of human rights abuses," Rosal said in
a statement sent to media outlets Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The NPA and other groups have opposed the burial of Ferdinand
Marcos at the cemetery reserved for heroes and soldiers who died
in line of duty.
</P>
<P>
Former president Corazon Aquino whose husband Benigno Aquino
Jr. was assassinated during the reign of Marcos, is spearheading a
multisectoral group opposing the burial of Marcos at the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
Ramos directed Alino to "ensure that all of this (threat) does
not disturb the inaugural on June 30".
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Alino told reporters that the PNP would beef
up the security of Imelda Marcos and her children if they would
request anew.
</P>
<P>
Alino said there was now a PNP security team protecting the
former first lady and her family as provided by law.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who has stood pat on his decision not to allow the
burial of Marcos at the cemetery, also ordered Philippine Army
chief Raul Urgello Monday to investigate the ongoing construction
of the burial site.
</P>
<P>
He said in a handwritten memorandum that he has not ordered the
construction of such a burial site at the cemetery.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Industrial Center Narrows Scope of State-Owned Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The government of Harbin, capital
of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, plans to reduce the
proportion of state-owned assets in its industrial sector from 70
percent to 50 percent by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
The move aims to invigorate the vitality of the state-owned
sector and cultivate a new aspect of economic growth, said Mayor
Cao Guangliang.
</P>
<P>
Because of its longtime heavy industrial base, Heilongjiang
Province has a higher proportion of state-owned industrial assets
compared with other Chinese provinces. A great number of
state-owned firms are bogged down in financial difficulty as a
result of poor management and unmarketable products.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises in the fields of basic industry, public utilities
and the lifeblood of the national economy will continue to be
funded exclusively or controlled by the state in the future, Cao
said.
</P>
<P>
The city will turn 100 key enterprises into companies and set
up five enterprise groups each with a sales value of 5 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The local government also will sell medium-sized and small
state-owned firms by stages. The first group of 123 state-owned
firms to be sold have been chosen.
</P>
<P>
While reducing the size of the state-owned sector, the city is
encouraging the development of the self-employed economy by
granting preferential treatment in terms of investment, taxation,
enrollment and land use. They are allowed to buy shares of, or
purchase, state-owned enterprises to expand their strength.

SINGAPORE, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Share prices tumbled Monday on
the Singapore market amid concerns about the ailing Japanese
economy as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index (STII)
shed 24.48 points to close at 1,098.45.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said blue chips suffered the heaviest losses in the
trading of the day.

The meeting of the G7 nations in Tokyo over the weekend had
been expected to lead to some concrete steps to support the yen,
but the meeting produced little in the way of action except for
platitudes that Tokyo must act swiftly and decisively to
revitalize its economy and restructure its financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Total market volume plunged to 92.55 million units, valued at
253.79 million Singapore dollars (153.8 million U.S. dollars).
There were 233 falls against 59 rises while 295 other counters
remained unchanged.

DBS Land continued to be the most actively traded stock as it
registered a turnover of 9.12 million units. SingTel was next with
8.83 million shares traded. Easyknit took the third place with

cents to finish at 4.62 dollars while ChemInd gained 10 cents to
end at 2.20 dollars.

<HEADLINE> EU Mideast Envoy to Visit Egypt Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) Special Envoy to
the Middle East Miguel Angel Moratinos will start a visit to Egypt
Thursday in new efforts to revive the stalled Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The visit comes out of the EU's keenness on activating the
peace process on the basis of the agreements signed between the
Palestinians and Israelis, the Madrid conference, and the Oslo
Agreement, Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted British
diplomats here as saying.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, Moratinos will hold talks with
Secretary General of the Arab League Esmat Abdel-Meguid, Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and senior Egyptian officials on the
long-running deadlock in the Mideast peace-making.
</P>
<P>
He will also brief Egyptian officials on the outcome of his
recent talks in Damascus, Tel Aviv and Beirut during his current
regional tour on reviving the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Israel on one side and Syria and
Lebanon on the other have been stalled for more than two years due
to Israel's hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu refused to hand back to Syria the strategic Golan
Heights which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East and proposed
to withdraw from the occupied south Lebanon on conditional basis.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Moratinos will present fresh ideas to
Lebanese leaders in a bid to revive the peace talks in the
Lebanese and Syrian tracks in the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Two South African Players Expelled from World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Two players from South African team
Brendan Augustine and Naughty Mokoena will be sent home on Monday
for staying out late at a Night club, the South African team
officials announced.
</P>
<P>
The two players visited a Vichy night club on Saturday night and
returned after curfew in the early hours of Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The South African Football Association (SAFA) announced that the
two players would be suspended for the rest of the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
"The players defied us by staying out until five o'clock in the
morning. One of our security officials tried to stop them but they
defied him." said SAFA president Molefi Oliphant.
</P>
<P>
SAFA chief executve officer Danny Jordaan said:"They said they
made a mistake but it was defiance. We are determined and serious
about our World Cup campaign. We have to ensure a platform from
which the players can perform."
</P>
<P>
It was the second time that South African players broke curfew
in a camp. Five players were caught at a Vichy night club ahead of
the team's first game against France last week and forced to
apologise to the coach.

<HEADLINE> Singaporeans Urged to Build Up Cash for Old Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPOE, June 22 (Xinhua)--Singapore's Central Provident Fund
(CPF) Board released a bulletin Monday which will enable its
members to build up cash for their old age and earn more higher
interest on their retirement savings within the CPF framework.
</P>
<P>
The Board said that from July 1, CPF members below age 55 are
allowed to transfer their CPF savings from the Ordinary Account to
the Special Account up to a cap of 40,000 Singapore dollars
(24,242 U.S. dollars) in their Special Account.
</P>
<P>
As in the current practice, CPF members who are of age 55 or
above can transfer their savings from the Ordinary Account to the
Retirement Account to receive higher interests and members do not
contribute to the Special Account once they reach age 55.
</P>
<P>
When the decision takes effect, Members' savings in the CPF
Special and Retirement Accounts will earn an interest of 1.5% per
annum more than their savings in the Ordinary and Medisave
Accounts, the board said. the interest rate for the CPF Special
and Retirement Accounts will be 5.9 percent for the period July 1
to December 31, 1998 as compared with the interest rate of 4.29
percent for the Ordinary and Medisave Accounts for the same
period.
</P>
<P>
The transfer of CPF savings from Ordinary Account to the
Special Account can be made at any time but will be subject to the
cap of 40,000 Singapore dollars in the Special Account, the Board
said.
</P>
<P>
The Board noted that CPF members' transfer of savings from the
Ordinary Account to the Special Account is not reversible. That
means a member cannot transfer his savings back from the Special
Account to the Ordinary Account subsequently when he needs it for
housing or investment.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's Central Provident Fund (CPF) was set up in 1955 to
provide financial security for workers upon retirement or when
they no longer work. Over the years, the CPF has evolved into a
comprehensive social security savings scheme that takes care of
members' retirement, healthcare, home ownership, family protection
and asset enhancement needs. Both the employer and employee
contribute to the fund. The monthly contribution rate for workers
aged 55 and below is 40 percent of the worker's salary, with equal
contributions of 20 percent from both employers and employee.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder for President Clinton's China Trip: U.S. Businesses Earliest and Biggest Foreign Investors in Xi'an </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- When the first jointly run
Sino-U.S. hotel, Golden Flower (now the Shangri-LA Golden Flower
Hotel), opened in this capital of northwest China's Shaanxi
province in the spring of 1985, it served as a window for locals
to have a view of the western life style. Today, U.S.-funded
businesses have become an important part of Shaanxi's economy.
</P>
<P>
American business people were among the first to invest in
Shaanxi, and the amount of their investment ranks only after that
of Hong Kong and Taiwan regions, leading all foreign investors,
according to the provincial foreign trade and economic department.
</P>
<P>
There are 277 projects with U.S. funding or participation in
the province, making up 10 percent of its Sino-overseas equity and
contractual joint venture projects. The total investment of the
277 projects reaches 456 million U.S. dollars, in which 112
million U.S. dollars are from U.S. partners.
</P>
<P>
The projects span machinery, electronics, medicine, chemical
industries and the entertainment business, and it is reported that
the rich mineral deposits in northern Shaanxi have become a new
point of interest for U.S. businesses.
</P>
<P>
Although Xi'an does not boast the same convenience in
transportation as China's coastal areas, its low labor cost and
good education system have been important factors behind the
success of Xi'an-Janssen Pharmaceutical Ltd., one of the best
Sino-foreign joint ventures in China, said Jerry Norskoj, former
Xi'an-Janssen general manager and now vice president for
development in China of the U.S.-based Johnson &AMP; Johnson.
</P>
<P>
Industrial experts point out that Shaanxi's geographical
location at the junction of central China and the vast western
region also helps attract overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Many investors agree that transportation and communications
facilities and policies for overseas investment in Shaanxi
Province have been substantially improved over the past two
decades since China first adopted the reform and opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
To support economic development in the relatively backward
central and western region, the Chinese government has formulated
a succession of preferential policies for the region in recent
years.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Universities Brace for Modernization Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Preparing for the knowledge
economy era, China is carrying on an ambitious plan to modernize
its outdated colleges and universities in a bid to meet the
challenge of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education announced here today that some 60
universities have been selected in a national program to upgrade
college facilities and improve teaching systems. The program is
being called the "211 Project."
</P>
<P>
The project is the only educational item on a list of state key
construction programs for 1998, which contains 117 items.
</P>
<P>
The plan was drawn up in the mid-1990s by the Chinese
government to build 100 mega-universities which can reach the
heights of universities in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials say that 350 key specialties in the 60
universities will receive funds for renovation, and an educational
computer network and document system will be established to link
universities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
On the list are prestigious institutions of higher learning
universities like Beijing and Qinghua universities, and a large
number of provincial universities.
</P>
<P>
The University of Science of Technology for National Defense
has also been included in the "211 Project."
</P>
<P>
Sources say that these universities have imported more
equipment from overseas and set up advanced laboratories. Some of
them have strengthened themselves through merging with other
universities.
</P>
<P>
China's modern universities appeared in the late 19th century
and adopted the former Soviet Union model in the 1950s. Most of
them are poorly operated and students have no information about
the scientific frontiers, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The country is expected to invest more than 13 billion yuan
(1.57 billion U.S. dollars) in the project during the Ninth
Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), which is the largest investment
in the educational sector since new China was founded in 1949.

<HEADLINE> APEC Trade Ministers Meeting Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUCHING, Malaysia, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The meeting of ministers
responsible for trade of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
opened here Monday afternoon with a call for APEC to support
initiatives to deal with the financial crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
Opening the two-day meeting, Malaysian International Trade and
Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz, chairperson of the meeting, said
the meeting is being held during a period of financial and
economic turmoil in East Asia, constituent of the APEC region, and
at a time when the individual economies of East Asia are
struggling to keep afloat and to bolster flagging currencies and
depressed financial and trade markets.
</P>
<P>
She said, "The turmoil has triggered off various degrees of
economic crisis, impacting upon a broad spectrum of economic
sectors, and thereby effectively curtailing capacity to generate
economic growth."
</P>
<P>
Regional and global economic interlinkages and interdependence
will directly or indirectly spread that so-called contagion effect
to other economies outside the region, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Individual APEC economies experiencing the economic turmoil
must necessarily undertake domestic policy initiatives to effect
economic recovery. But it is also important that in the spirit of
APEC, other APEC member economies understand the problems and,
where possible, assist in the process of economic recovery," she
said.
</P>
<P>
"In fact it is in their interest to do so in order to prevent
the crisis turning into a full-blown Asia-Pacific and global
economic recession," she added.
</P>
<P>
Therefore this meeting cannot ignore what's happening in the
region, Rafidah said, adding "Our deliberations must be in the
context of diminished economic capacities of the affected member
economies."
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the ministers will take stock of the
progress of work, including on Early Voluntary Sectoral
Liberalization (EVSL), Individual Action Plans (IAPs), Collective
Action Plans (CAPs), Electronic Commerce and impact of trade
liberalization according to the agenda of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
On the EVSL, the ministers will review progress of work in the
15 sectors identified under the EVSL initiative, which are divided
into two groups.
</P>
<P>
The first group of nine sectors -- chemicals, environmental
goods and services, energy, fish and fish products, forest
products, gems and jewelry, medical equipment and instruments,
toys and telecommunications, mutual recognition arrangement, in
which work is expected to be completed by this year.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will also examine progress in the remaining six
sectors -- automobiles, civil aircraft, food, natural and
synthetic rubber, fertilizers and oil seeds.
</P>
<P>
For the IAPs which are in implementation for the second year
this year, members will report to the ministers at the meeting on
preliminary plan for improvement/new commitments including the
steps undertaken to implement existing IAP commitments.
</P>
<P>
As for the CAPs which cover a wide area comprising 15 trade and
investment sectors such as tariffs, services, investment, customs
and standards, the ministers will review these actions and assess
the outcomes achieved in facilitating trade and investment in the
APEC region.
</P>
<P>
Electronic Commerce is another area of emphasis for APEC in
1998 and the initial phase of the work program, that is, the
educative process, was undertaken in the first half of this year.
The ministers will decide on the next course of action.
</P>
<P>
The minister will also review the progress on work to promote a
broad-based and balanced understanding of the impact of
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the ministers will have a dialogue with APEC Business
Advisory Council (ABAC) on the collective response of APEC to ABAC
recommendations which contain requests for measures to further
liberalize and facilitate trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will consider also how APEC could make further
contribution to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in light of the
outcome of the Second WTO ministerial conference.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of all the APEC members -- Australia, Brunei,
Canada, China, Chinese Taibei, Chile, Hong Kong of China,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and the
United States, are attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Three members-designate -- Peru, Russia and Vietnam as well as
observers from ASEAN, South Pacific Forum and the Pacific Economic
Cooperation Council are also present at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> NPC Standing Committee to Mull Drafts of Three Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature today
began deliberating drafts of three laws and other proposals and
reports, including the revised draft law on the village committee
organization, which will affect more than 900 million rural
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), presided over the third meeting
of the NPC Standing Committee, which opened today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xuwu and Zhou Keyu, both vice chairmen of the NPC Law
Committee, separately reported the previous deliberations on the
draft laws on doctors, exclusive economic zones and continental
shelves. The two draft laws might be approved by the Standing
Committee at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Li Boyong, vice chairman of the Law Committee, reported the
preliminary deliberation of the revised Law on the Use of
Land. The NPC Standing Committee issued the draft law to the
public in the previous month. Until June 15, the Commission of
Legislative Affairs of the NPC Standing Committee had received a
total of 611 letters from the people about the law.
</P>
<P>
Doje Cering, Minister of Civil Affairs, explained the draft
revision of the Village Committee Organization Law. The proposed
law stipulates that village committees make public a list of the
village's assets, income, expenditures, land leases and building
permits.
</P>
<P>
Yang Wenchang, vice-minister of Foreign Affairs, explained the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and
an extradition treaty between the People's Republic of China and
Mongolia.

<P>
He further noted that U.S. investment in China, technologically
advanced and open, pays much attention to quality, management and
personnel training, as well as better treatment for Chinese
employees.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade continued to grow since the beginning of this
year, said Sun, citing figures for the first four months to
illustrate the growth and say that China's exports to the United
States rose by 20 percent in the period and its import by 7.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
Besides the traditional imports of airplanes, wheat and
chemical fertilizers, Sun said, China has increased its imports of
technological products and infrastructure projects from the United
States, including power stations and airport terminals.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that there are broad prospects for
Sino-U.S. cooperation both in general trade and services, and
high-tech and information industry.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the implementation of the Sino-U.S. nuclear
cooperation agreement, Sun said that it will open broad prospects
for bilateral nuclear cooperation, and that many U.S. companies
such as Westinghouse are keeping close contact with their Chinese
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, bilateral nuclear negotiations will not
yield any substantial results within the short term since the
implementation of the agreement has just started, and nuclear
projects are usually large ones demanding a tremendous sum of
money.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's successful visit
to the United States last year has laid a firm foundation and
opened a broad prospect for bilateral economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During Jiang's visit, the two sides signed contracts totaling
4.2 billion U.S. dollars, which greatly helped business people
from the two sides to further bilateral economic and trade
cooperation, and enhanced mutual understanding and confidence, Sun
said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Question Kenya's Cigarette Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's recent imposition of duty
on cigarettes from member states of the Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) has drawn protests from Tanzanian
cigarettes producers.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania Cigarettes Company (TCC) makers of Aspen and Club,
had expressed concern over the move, saying it had only two
percent of Kenya's market share, the East African weekly reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan cigarette market, long dominated by BAT Kenya Ltd.,
has just seen the entry of TCC and Philip Morris. But TCC is
"the only major exporter of cigarettes to Kenya among the COMESA
states," said TCC spokesman Bernard Palela.
</P>
<P>
He said the company's only option, if it wanted to continue
selling its products in Kenya, was to raise prices, in some cases
doubling them.
</P>
<P>
In an amendment of the Kenya Customs and Excise Order, which
came into force on April 1, 1998, a five percent duty available
in the COMESA area is imposed by Kenya on unprocessed tobacco and
tobacco refuse.
</P>
<P>
Manufactured cigarettes entering Kenya would be taxed at 300
Kenya Shillings (five U.S. Dollars) or seven percent per
kilogram, up from 30 Kenya Shillings (50 U.S. cents).
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan move is reminiscent of an incident last year when
Tanzania imposed heavy taxes on beer from COMESA countries, whose
largest brewery is in Kenya, while making it easier for
non-COMESA members to export beer to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
TCC's major exports to Kenya were Club and Aspen, which was
launched in Nairobi in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
Kenya does not export cigarettes to Tanzania because the
existing trade mark arrangements forbid such trade, according to
the East African report.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Kenya raised import duty on cigarettes from 30
percent to 35 percent and reduced VAT to 14 percent, only to
increase it to 17 percent shortly thereafter, with a COMESA duty
of 30 Shillings (50 cents) and excise duty of 135 percent.
</P>
<P>
Kenya and Tanzania are among the 24 members of COMESA which
succeeded the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) from eastern and
southern Africa and the Indian Ocean Islands of the Comoros,
Madagascar and Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
Under the COMESA Treaty, member states agreed to reduce tariff
rates on all products which qualify under the rules of origin to
zero by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Saudi Arabia Calls For Bolstering Oil Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Saudi Arabia have called
for more coordination among world oil-producing countries to
prevent further decline in oil prices, the Tehran Times reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-Saudi call was issued by Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz during a
telephone conversation Sunday, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders focused their discussion on the coordination
among members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) in a bid to bolster the sagging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Khatami voiced concern over the oil slump, saying an
appropriate step must be taken at the next OPEC session due to be
held in Vienna, Austria, on Wednesday. Prince Abdullah also
underlined the need for more coordination among the OPEC members
at the session, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
At the Vienna meeting, oil ministers of the 11 OPEC countries
are expected to explore ways to reduce their oil output as part of
the ongoing efforts to save oil prices from further fall.
</P>
<P>
Despite the intensive high-level contacts and pledges of the
OPEC members to further cut oil production, the oil prices
remained low.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the price for Iranian light crude plunged
below 10 U.S. dollars per barrel and the International Benchmark
Brent stood at about 12 dollars per barrel last week.
</P>
<P>
During the past weeks, Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi and
Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh made whirlwind trips to the
Persian Gulf Arab states, lobbying for their support for further
production cuts.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Saudi Arabia, the two oil giants in the Gulf region,
have announced their readiness to cut production. They expected
that the Vienna meeting could reach a coordinated decision on
bolstering the oil prices.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Families Hiring Lawyers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Lu Huaiyang, an elderly man in
Nanjing was annoyed by his sons and daughters who were arguing
over his property.
</P>
<P>
To settle the dispute, Lu hired a private lawyer to serve as
his family adviser. Through a legal procedure, Lu prepared a will
to cover the disposition of his assets and end his children's
bickering.
</P>
<P>
Lu is just one of more than 200 families in Nanjing, capital of
east China's Jiangsu Province, who have invited lawyers to be
their legal advisers. In Nanjing, a city that took the lead in
restoring a system of lawyers, more and more families are now
consulting attorneys when they have troubles.
</P>
<P>
Duan Zhengkun, director of the Department of Lawyers of the
Ministry of Justice, said that the Chinese people are now fond of
legal procedures to handle their problems. Lawyers are becoming
popular not only among businessmen, but also among ordinary
citizens.
</P>
<P>
More than 11,000 families or citizens in the country have hired
lawyers in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
In China, it takes about 500-to-1,000 yuan per year for a
citizen to hire a lawyer to be a private legal adviser. For many
Chinese citizens whose annual income is 5,000 yuan (about 630 US
dollars), the expenditure is not high.
</P>
<P>
Most of the people hired lawyers not only for lawsuits, but
also for their knowledge of the law as it relates to domestic
affairs involving a division of assets, divorce agreements, house
sales and loan applications.

Beijing Weiheng Lawyers Office started its service in the real

5,000 clients.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaowei, head of the office, said that in recent years
there has been more and more disputes between citizens and housing
project developers.
</P>
<P>
"To get their desired apartments in time, many of our clients
are turning to our office to seek legal aid so as to avoid some
unexpected troubles in their house dealings," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Nanjing, 62 lawyers' offices have opened private legal
services for citizens.
</P>
<P>
When Jinling Lawyers Office started its business for local
families this year, lawyers in the office were invited to serve 58
families within 20 days.
</P>
<P>
In the cities of Shenzhen, Shanghai and Guangzhou, more than
1,000 families and more than 50 percent of self-employed
households have hired lawyers.
</P>
<P>
In the rural areas in central China's Hunan and Hubei
provinces, some farmers hired lawyers as their legal advisers to
help them resolve their business disputes.
</P>
<P>
Duan Zhengkun said that with the perfection of the legal system
in China, the tendency to hire private lawyers is becoming
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, when China resumed the system, lawyers' offices in
the country now number 8,300 with 100,900 lawyers.

<HEADLINE> Kampala Mayor Likely to Face Imprisonment in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The mayor of Uganda's capital
Kampala, who was detained in the United States for false
statements to Customs officers and illicit financial
transactions, is likely to face a prison term in the foreign
country.
</P>
<P>
Nasser Sebaggala was arrested by Customs agents at John F.
Kennedy Airport on June 13 as he prepared to board a Sabena
Airways flight from New York to Brussels en route to Kampala.
</P>
<P>
He had been attending an international conference on garbage
collection in Chicago with his newly-wed wife Sarah Sebaggala.
</P>
<P>
He will appear in a U.S. court on Tuesday this week for making
false statements to Customs officers and being involved in check
fraud, the latest East African weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
The mayor reportedly ticked "NO" box in reply to a question
which required him to declare cash exceeding 10,000 U.S. Dollars
although he carried much more money than that.
</P>
<P>
He was also said to be involved in six counts of check fraud
totaling 191,000 Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Paul Reichler, the hired lawyer for embattled Sebaggala, said
his client would face a 35-year prison term and a fine of more
than one million Dollars if he was to be convicted on all the
charges.
</P>
<P>
While the lawyer demanded the mayor to be allowed to go back
to Kampala, Amy Rindskopf, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's
office in Boston, said she strongly doubted that possibility
before his trial.
</P>
<P>
Ugandans' response to the mayor's arrest has been clearly
reflected in the behaviors of his rivals and supporters.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the U.S., there is a resurfacing of a
strong demand for his stepping down because he was not
academically qualified to host the top post in the capital.
</P>
<P>
He is said not to have the required Advanced Level certificate
or its equivalent. Meanwhile, his supporters have tried to raise
money for his bail.

</P>
<P>
"Coming down the stretch I was watching the clock. I saw 46

</P>
<P>
"If the world record doesn't come this year, I've still had a

following her 200m triumph:"My legs were tired. I was feeling
exhausted from three days in the heat, but to come out here and
survive and stay healthy was good enough for me."
</P>
<P>
Setting the year's best marks today were Kim Batten, who
clocked 53.61 seconds in the women's 400-meter hurdles, Jerome
Young, who hit the tape 44.09 in the men's 400 meters and Reggie
Torian, who edged Mark Crear with a 13.03 to win the men's 110m
hurdles.
</P>
<P>
Olympic and two-time world champion Allen Johnson didn't
compete in the hurdles, instead, he ran the 200 meters and
finished 20.54 to winner Gentry Bradley's 20.47.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hartwig, who set the U.S. pole vault record with a 6-meter
leap, won the event at 5.85m, and Olympic high jump champion
Charles Austin cleared 2.30 meters to win the title.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Currency Won't Be Devalued, MOFTEC Officials Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese officials
reiterated here today that the Renminbi (RMB), the Chinese
currency, will not be devalued.
</P>
<P>
Despite the huge pressure exerted by the drastic fall of the
Japanese yen on China's exports, the exchange rate of the RMB will
remain unchanged, said Sun Zhenyu, vice minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), at a press conference
organized by the Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC Minister Shi Guangsheng added immediately that the RMB
will not be devalued.
</P>
<P>
"Once again, on behalf of the Chinese government, I assure you
we are not going to devalue the RMB," he stated.
</P>
<P>
The stability of the RMB is the requirement for China's stability
and development, as well as for the prosperity and stability in
Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
"China is capable of maintaining the stability of the RMB," he
said, adding that China has maintained a foreign exchange reserve
of about 140 billion U.S. dollars since the end of last year and
has a gross trade surplus of 30 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
China gained a trade surplus of 17 billion US dollars from
January to May this year, and its economic growth rate reached 7.2
percent in the first quarter, when the Asian economy met with
difficulties. "This has given us confidence that we are able to
maintain the RMB exchange rate without devaluation," he said.
</P>
<P>
China is a big country, and it is determined to play a
responsible role at a time when the Asian economy has
difficulties, even if it has to pay a price for not devaluing its
currency, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We believe it is very important for China to maintain a
responsible attitude and to play a role in stabilizing the Asian
economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that Japan, an economic
power in the world and an important country in Asia, will also
play a responsible role in the current difficult period.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen should also play a role in stabilizing the
Asian economy rather than playing a destabilizing role, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to see the governments of Japan and the United
States take resolute action to intervene in the situation and to
stop the further falling of the Japanese yen, Shi said, and serve
as a stabilizing force in the Asian economy.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Restrict Work Permits to Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has warned
that it will not issue work permits to foreign companies and
organizations that prefer employing expatriates in positions
which can be competently handled by indigenous Zambians.
</P>
<P>
State-owned Times of Zambia Monday quoted Deputy Minister of
Labor Syacheye Madyenkuku as saying here at the weekend that the
Zambian government will not entertain situations where companies
and organizations deliberately bring in expatriates to take up
jobs which are not highly technical and exceptional in nature.
</P>
<P>
Except for highly skilled and technical areas such as medical,
financia and technological fields, no permits will be issued to
any company or organization applying for other jobs.
</P>
<P>
Madyenkuku emphasized that there are enough qualified Zambians
to take up jobs and therefore he did not understand why some
organizations insisted on bringing in their own people from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister disclosed that Zambia has a long-term
program to ensure that as many jobs as possible are manned by the
Zambians and the country will on "the basis of individual merits
be able to allow the employment of expatriates for short periods
of about three years."
</P>
<P>
In cases where work permits are issued, the company involved
is required to have a deliberate human resource development and a
study program to facilitate take-over by the Zambians, said the
deputy minister.

<HEADLINE> Most Australian Firms' Asia Plan Not Affected by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Asia's financial crisis was
having a limited effect on Australian companies, with only a
minority changing their business operations or their long-term
investment plans for the region, a new research report released
Monday showed.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 70 percent of the 40 major listed Australian
companies had either increased their business activities in Asia
or kept the status quo, a Macquarie Equities research report said.
</P>
<P>
Macquarie Equities interviewed senior management from the 40
companies, taking in the sectors of alcohol and tobacco, building
materials, developers and contractors, mining contractors,
finance, food, diversified industrials, media, paper and
packaging, healthcare and biotechnology, transport, tourism and
leisure, and resources.
</P>
<P>
While some sectors such as tourism had been severely impacted
by the financial and economic upheaval in Asia, others like
insurance had increased their activities and investments in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"Since the crisis began, only five percent of companies have
substantially scaled back their operations and investments in Asia
(by way of subsidiaries, joint ventures and representative
offices)," said David Rickards, author of the report.
</P>
<P>
"A further 25 percent have scaled back operations only
slightly, leaving 70 percent having unchanged or increased
operations," he said.
</P>
<P>
A similar story emerges for long-term investment plans.
</P>
<P>
"Only around 10 percent of companies have substantially revised
their plans for the Asia region, with the remainder having
unchanged or only slightly different plans," Rickards said.
</P>
<P>
"While 70 percent of companies have reported a fall in sales
to Asia over the past year, only a quarter reported that sales
have fallen by more than 25 percent," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, companies are confident that the long-run effect
on sales will be minimal; 75 percent believe that within two years
sales will equal or exceed the level prevailing before the crisis
(with 50 percent expecting higher sales); and less than three
percent anticipating much lower long-term sales," it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said companies therefore had not felt the need to
push aggressively into other markets, with only a quarter seeking
greater sales from the U.S., Europe and other Asian countries.

domestic consumption from 250,000 barrels per day to 300,000 in a
bid to raise the supply of petroleum products nationwide to solve

</P>

The Guardian:

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Increases Domestic Oil Allocation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has ordered
an upward review of the domestic crude oil allocation from
250,000 barrels per day to 300,000.
</P>
<P>
This is in a bid to increase the petroleum product supply
nationwide and arrest the hydra-headed oil crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The order came just as Petroleum Minister Chief Dan Etete had
banned all refinery chiefs from travelling out of their stations
but to gear their efforts toward speedy repair of their plants.
</P>
<P>
The government also approved four multi-national oil companies
to engage in direct importation of fuel for current consumption
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Import of petroleum products is being done solely by the
governme-owned Pipelines and Products Marketing Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
No fewer than 52 cargoes of 30,000 tons or 39.75 million
liters each, have been imported by the company within the past 12
months to satisfy a national daily demand of 18 million liters.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the ministry Sunday did not specify the
companies involved.
</P>
<P>
There are now seven such companies operating in Nigeria on
behalf of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. They are
Shell, Mobil, Chevron, Agip, Elf, Texaco and Pan Ocean Oil.
</P>
<P>
In order to reduce direct import of the products, the
government is to undertake a long-term arrangement for offshore
processing of about 50,000 barrels per day of Nigerian crude oil
whereby deficit products would be brought back to augment direct
importation and local production.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has to import petroleum products because all its four
refineries are undertaking turn around maintenance and
rehabilitation.

<HEADLINE> Xi'an through the Eyes of Foreigners (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite obvious cultural differences, Linda S. Pickle, Coggin's
colleague, said she still feels at home here.
</P>
<P>
Before she came, she had read some books about China. And Xi'an
meant to her an old and underdeveloped city. After arrival, she
found that, in addition to the ancient architecture and ruins,
there are lots of beautiful shopping centers and up-to-date urban
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
It's a city of prosperity and vigor, representing the harmony
between tradition and modern development, Pickle said.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Bennett was motivated by his intense love of the Chinese
culture to come to Xi'an. The Stanford professor has spent two
years here. He speaks only a little Chinese, but knows a lot about
many ancient Chinese classics, including the "Art of War" by Sunzi
and the "Book on Changes." His favorite poets, Li Bai and Du Fu in
the Tang Dynasty, also lived in Xi'an, he said.
</P>
<P>
Many of his friends have come to Xi'an and were deeply
impressed, he said.
</P>
<P>
He knows Xi'an people through his students. They are not that
sensitive to the fashionable, not that romantic, but
down-to-earth, diligent and talented, he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained a personal episode. At the beginning of 1996 when
he traveled with his wife and daughter from Xi'an to Chengdu by
train, he could only get two tickets because of the unusually
heavy spring traffic.
</P>
<P>
They were stopped by a non-English speaking railway attendant
and none of them could explain to him in Chinese. He was worried,
he said, but a middle-aged couple came up and helped them.
</P>
<P>
More dramatically, that couple did not speak English either but
could find ways to help, Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it is unnecessary to use language in communication,
but the bridge between hearts is more important, he said.

<HEADLINE> 26 Kenyan Banks Face Merging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Faced with a Central Bank of
Kenya (CBK) deadline within which to improve their capitalization
base or face de-registration, 26 commercial banks and 14
non-banking financial bodies in Kenya are expected to consider
merging.
</P>
<P>
The need to merge was more urgent for the non-banking
financial institutions as none of them presently meets the new
statutory minimum requirement by CBK, experts were quoted by the
Monday's East African weekly as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the June issue of the CBK's Monthly Economic
Review, all commercial banks are required to raise about four
billion Shillings (65 million U.S. Dollars) over the next 18
months. The new rule takes effect toward the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
At the core of the CBK directive is the large amounts of
non-performing loans granted to customers and institutions.
</P>
<P>
Records indicate that of the total loans amounting to 208.5
billion Shillings (3.5 billion Dollars) advanced to customers, is
a staggering 43.78 billion Shillings (728 million Dollars) up
from 37.9 billion Shillings (627 million Shillings) a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The CBK says currently 15 commercial banks and financial
institutions fail to meet its new minimum capital base
requirements of 200-million-Shilling (3.3 million Dollars) and
150 million Shillings (2.5 million Dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's local banking industry has recently witnessed a number
of mergers as the move toward universal banking gained currency.
</P>
<P>
The 550-million-Shilling (9.3 million Dollars) merger between
National Industrial Credit and African Mercantile Bank or Ambank
is still considered the most notable one yet.
</P>
<P>
Trust Finance Ltd. has merged with Trust Bank Ltd. while
Stanbic Finance has merged with Stanbic Bank Ltd, its parent
company.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Trust Bank Ltd. recorded a decline in profits
before tax of 56 percent from 129 Shillings (2.2 million Dollars)
in 1996 to 57 million Shillings (966,101 Dollars), and a negative
five percent erosion in total assets.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that although profitability is still high in
Kenya's banking sector, only 13 commercial banks have achieved
above the industrial average.

XI'AN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- "To see the recent 10 years of
China, go to Shenzhen; to see the past 100 years of China, go to
Shanghai; to see the past 500 years of China, go to Beijing;
and if you want to see the past 2,000 years of this country, you
have to go to Xi'an," said a Norwegian painter when he visited the
city.
</P>
<P>
This ancient city, seat of 12 dynasties in Chinese history and
home to the terra cotta warriors and horses, called by some "the
eighth wonder of the world," is an international tourist
attraction bringing in more than 100,000 visitors every year.
</P>
<P>
As to those foreigners who once lived or worked here, this
northwestern city means much more.
</P>
<P>
Betty F. Coggin, an American professor working with the Xi'an
Institute of Foreign Languages, said her whole family is deeply
connected with this city.
</P>
<P>
Her husband is a college professor in the United States, whose
employer is a sister college of the Xi'an Institute of Foreign
Languages. After a lecture tour here, her husband was so
fascinated by the city that he convinced her to give up her job as
a lawyer to stay with him, too.
</P>
<P>
Coggin said that her son will come to visit her this
summer. And because of his interest in the history and culture of
this city, he will come to Xi'an to teach after his graduation
this year.
</P>
<P>
After one year here, Coggin said she fell in love with the
"night markets" in the city, a Chinatown style bazaar selling
various midnight snacks and refreshments.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an folks are hospitable, she said. She was invited to her
students' homes, attended "funny" marriage ceremonies where brides
and bridegrooms wear western-style dress but do not go to church.
</P>
<P>
In addition, she learned how to cook Chinese food and to make
dumplings.

rates could rise again this week if the volatility in financial
markets, which has caused the Rand to plunge, continues, market
watchers have warned.
</P>
<P>
All big-five banks raised their lending rates by two
percentage points earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Standard Bank, the country's second largest bank, further
increased its prime lending rate by one percentage point to 21.25
percent on Friday and could raise it again this week, depending
on what happened in the markets, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Other banks would not linger on for long before following
suit.
</P>
<P>
Standard Bank's move came after the Reserve Bank increased its
repo rate, the Reserve Bank's lending rate to commercial banks,
by three percentage points to 20.37 percent on Friday. The
Reserve Bank's penalty rate, the marginal lending rate, is now
five percentage points higher at 40.377 percent.
</P>
<P>
The market read the bank's move as a signal that it planned to
make greater use of interest rates and less of the country's
reserves to stabilize the Rand.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Rand lost 10 cents to the Dollar to a record
low of 5.515 and crashed 22 cents against the Pound to 9.2263,
also a record level.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said although the Rand's depreciation would bolster
the price competitiveness of South African exports, it would hit
the information technology sector which relied heavily on
imports.
</P>
<P>
Apart from trimming growth forecasts, the increased interest
rates, with prime at its highest level in 13 years, also meant
delayed investment decisions in the medium term.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Sunday warned of a
harsh reaction to a plan approved by Israeli cabinet to expand
Jerusalem municipal authority over eight Jewish settlements in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The PNA officials described the plan as a declaration of war
against Palestinian residents of Jerusalem, saying they would
recruit international pressure to annul the program.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- At Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's request, Justice
Minister Tzahi Hanegbi will host an initial meeting Monday on the
possibility of a referendum on Israeli troop's second redeployment
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
A senior official in the Prime Minister's Office said Sunday
night that Netanyahu has not yet decided whether to hold a
referendum on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- President Ezer Weizman Sunday boycotted a major economic
forum, at which he had been scheduled to deliver the opening
speech, to show his dissatisfaction with the current status in
peace process, which was deeply stranded due to Israel's
intransigence over troop redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Political sources said the president had been led to believe,
when he met with Netanyahu on June 5, that the redeployment
agreement would be signed within two weeks at the most.

<HEADLINE> China Calls on U.S. to Lift Sanctions, MOFTEC Official Says  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese foreign trade
official expressed the hope that the United States would lift its
sanctions on China and ease or remove its restrictions on
high-tech exports to the country.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference sponsored by the Information Office of the
State Council, Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Sun Zhenyu said there are still some restrictions on
U.S. high-tech exports to China and, if this problem can be
resolved, bilateral high-tech cooperation is expected to expand.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on U.S. President Bill Clinton's
statement Sunday in an interview with journalists that the
U.S. export restrictions will be considered on a case-by-case
basis under the legal framework, Shi Guangsheng, minister of
foreign trade and economic cooperation, who also attended the
press conference, said that China welcomes any measures taken by
the United States to ease its export restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sun said, President Clinton's visit to China will
create favorable conditions for the development of bilateral
economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the two sides will discuss major economic and
trade issues such as China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO), he said. Companies from the two countries
negotiating projects such as airplanes and power stations also are
expected to sign cooperative contracts.
</P>
<P>
Sun spoke highly of U.S. direct investment in China, and said
that the actual U.S.investment in China has exceeded 18 billion
U.S. dollars and opened more than 24,000 joint ventures in China
so far.

<HEADLINE> China Confident of Economic Growth Target, Top Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China has full confidence in
attaining its economic growth target of 8 percent this year,
Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
(MOFTEC) Shi Guangsheng said here today.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came when answering a question at a news
conference sponsored by the Information Office of the State
Council of China.
</P>
<P>
He said that the first quarter of this year reflected sound
economic development in China with an increase of 7.2 percent in
its gross national product (GNP), a decrease of 1.5 percent in its
price index and an increase of 13.2 percent in its exports.
</P>
<P>
The achievements were made despite the difficulties brought
about by the Asian financial crisis, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the year, he said, China clearly
acknowledged the negative influence the Asian financial crisis
would have on China's economic development, especially on exports
and foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, China decided to take measures to ensure
the growth rate in its GNP, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
The measures included that China would increase domestic
input and expand domestic demand, he said. This year, China will
further increase its investment in the fields of agriculture,
environmental protection, energy, infrastructure and housing, Shi
said.
</P>
<P>
China will also tap the potential of rural markets by
encouraging the consumption of China's 800 million farmers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
China will also develop its foreign trade by expanding exports
and imports, as well as positively absorbing foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
He said that, although it is difficult for China to expand
exports while maintaining the value of its currency, China will
achieve stable growth in foreign trade by reducing cost,
optimizing the structure of exports and improving the investment
environment.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that the measures will soon prove productive and
effective.
</P>
<P>
He said China achieved an economic growth rate of 7.2 percent
in the first quarter of this year, when the measures had not been
put into effect. With these measures, he added, China will be sure
to achieve its GNP growth target.

<HEADLINE> Tibet's Mountainous Villages Accumulating Wealth Through Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Toinzhub, who used to make money
feeding pigs and cows with fruit, has increased her income by
expanding the area of cash trees and by planting hot pepper.
</P>
<P>
Last year, her family made an income of more than 8,000 yuan
(about 960 U.S. dollars) from selling pigs and cows.
</P>
<P>
"Markets have provided us who live in mountainous areas with
broader ways to make money," Toinzhub said.
</P>
<P>
Nang County, where Toinzhub lives, is located on the northern
foot of the Himalayas, more than 3,000 meters above sea level. The
county has quality timber, medicinal herbs such as Chinese
caterpillar fungus, musk and the bulb of fritillary, and many
kinds of fruit such as peaches and apples as well as peppers.
</P>
<P>
Many of these economic resources became rotten or useless in
the past because local farmers and herdsmen had no sense of
turning them into money.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation changed fundamentally in 1994 when the
county established an economic development company, which acted as
agent for local people to sell their produce.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many local farmers and herdsmen started to sell their
goods at markets in nearby towns and in Lhasa, capital of the Tibet
Autonomous Region, southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Nang County government registered trademarks for its native
produce at the State Administration for Industry and Commerce to
promote sales.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local people have realized the importance of
building roads in a developing market economy. Last year, the
county built 126 kilometers of roads which have connected 85
percent of its villages.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers and herdsmen have also learned to readjust their
farming structure in accordance with changes in the markets.
</P>
<P>
Development of a commodity economy has greatly improved local
people's lives. Statistics show that in 1997 the county's total
industrial and agricultural output value was 41.38 million yuan
(about 4.98 million U.S. dollars), the per capita income of
farmers and herdsmen reached 1,680 yuan (about 202 U.S. dollars),
and the county's revenue amounted to 1.79 million yuan (over
215,670 US dollars) from 220,000 yuan (about 26,506 US dollars) in
1994.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Russian Trade Structure Undergoing Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The structure of cross-border trade
between China and Russia has shifted from a unilateral form of
bartering to a multilateral development, a senior Chinese official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
At present, Sino-Russian trade covers a variety of forms
including cash transactions, services, and the import and export
of technology and processing, said Hu Chusheng, director of the
European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, during a trade fair held in this capital of northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the ratio of barter between the
two countries has dropped to 20 percent now from 70 percent in the
early 1990s. The amount of cash transactions now makes up half of
the total trade volume.
</P>
<P>
The changes were led by a series of measures taken by the two
governments, said Peng Ruiling, a professor at the Harbin
Polytechnical University.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has turned into a new aspect of Sino-Russian trade in
recent years. Russia has become China's second largest source of
visitors after Japan with the number of visitors to China in 1997
topping 800,000, up 59 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The growth in the number of visitors to China has boosted
China's development in the hotel, restaurant and service
industries.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral import-export structure has also been altered. In
the first five months of this year, China's export of primary
products to Russia decreased sharply while the export of
manufactured goods including hi-tech products increased.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials of the two countries have expressed on many
occasions that they would give priority to the development of
energy, machine-building, space, agriculture, hi-tech and
communications in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Industry Develops Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China had 25 insurance companies
in operation by the end of 1997, including 13 domestic and seven
overseas operations.
</P>
<P>
The companies employed a total of 350,000 people, including
over 140,000 people working for 7,460 branches of Chinese
insurance firms.
</P>
<P>
A total of 106 overseas insurers from 15 foreign countries and
regions had opened 189 representative offices in China by the end
of last year.
</P>
<P>
The figures were announced at the ongoing industry symposium --
China's Insurance Industry: Comparison and Choices -- in
Shanghai. Experts from China and the United States are attending
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Official figures for 1997 show that China's insurance premiums
totaled 108.74 billion yuan, with domestic insurance companies
recording a 39.19 percentage points increase in earnings to 1,081
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank estimates that total premiums for the country's
insurance industry will hit 250 billion yuan by the end of the
century.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt Wastes 1.7 Billion Dollars: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A report issued by a Nairobi
think-tank estimates wasteful spending by the Kenyan government
in the 1995/96 financial year at 107.5 billion Shillings (1.7
billion U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The figure represents 17 percent of the east African country's
gross domestic product (GDP) estimated at 652 billion Shillings
(10.5 billion Dollars), according to the summary of past
Controller and Auditor-General's reports.
</P>
<P>
The summary highlights massive financial mismanagement which
in one year alone deprived the country of enough funds to provide
a 3,500 Shillings (60 Dollars) handout to every Kenyan.
</P>
<P>
Its publishing is expected to complicate Finance Minister
Simeon Nyachae's efforts to renegotiate teachers salaries and
freeze civil service wages to balance the country's budget, the
East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although cases of abuse of public funds are detailed every
year in the Auditor-General's reports, the analysis provides a
dramatic picture of losses arising from weak financial controls
in 1995/96, and gives comparison with adjacent years and
classifies avenues of waste.
</P>
<P>
The analysis, released last week by the Center for Governance
and Democracy (CDG), an independent non-governmental body, is
likely to embolden opponents of the austerity measures outlined
in this year's budget, among them teachers and bank workers, both
of whom have threatened strike action.
</P>
<P>
The CDG report said public funds were mainly lost through
stalled projects, over-invoicing, revenues not surrendered,
wasteful expenditure, outstanding debts, goods and services paid
for but not delivered, diverted funds and goods released from
bonded warehouses to the local market.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that:
</P>
<P>
-- Governmental financial discipline has declined 300-fold
since the 1993/94 financial year when the auditor-general
questioned wasteful spending of 34.7 billion Shillings.
</P>
<P>
-- Mismanagement has worsened the budget deficit. At the end
of 1992 the government had a small surplus of 1.05 billion
Shillings, which fell to a deficit of 52 billion Shillings in
1993/94 and 56 billion Shillings in 1995/96.
</P>
<P>
-- The 107.5 billion Shillings lost in 1995/96 through waste
is more than half of the entire budget for the current financial
year read two weeks ago. More than half of it is irrecoverable.
</P>
<P>
To balance its 1998/99 budget, the government is seeking to
negotiate a salary increase of up to 200 percent granted to the
teachers last year, which is expected to absorb some 37 percent
of government revenue if fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's budget deficit accounted for 2.7 percent of GDP in the
1997/98 fincial year, according to Nyachae's budget speech
issued on June 11.

<HEADLINE> Hanzheng Street: Showcase of China's Private Sector (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China's first private business to be
listed on the stock exchange will probably be selected from those
companies on Hanzheng Street in Wuhan, capital of central China's
Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
One candidate is the Wuhan Huayi Group, which recently bought
more than 11 million shares of the state-owned Wuhan Electronic
Industry Group Co., Ltd., and succeeded in having Hanzheng Street
International Co., Ltd. registered in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The group's 36-year-old chairman, Sun Bing, said, "It's high
time for private enterprises to enjoy greater development, and
what I'm most concerned about is how to seize the opportunity."
</P>
<P>
The Huayi Group is only one of 12,743 household-run private
firms along the 500-year-old street, a showcase of the country's
private sector. The street has developed into a modern commercial
and trade center with an area of five square kilometers with
60,000 types of merchandise and a daily flow of 160,000 customers.
</P>
<P>
However, private entrepreneurs on the street are no longer
content with small businesses. Instead, they are turning to real
estate, financial services, infrastructure, and even participation
in reforming the state-owned sector. Now, most of them have come
to realize the limitations of family-based management, and are
trying to transform their businesses into stock or limited
companies.
</P>
<P>
"We should adopt the modern enterprise system in a bid to seek
more rapid development, because the family-centered operation
produces strong human touches, but lacks of science in
decision-making," said Wang Wangsheng, a peddler-turned manager,
who has recruited professionals to his newly established clothing
company.
</P>
<P>
Hanzheng Street has been a living testimonial to the
vicissitudes of China's private business sector, which was
completely wiped out during the Cultural Revolution
(1966-1976). It was not until the late 1970s that the private
sector began to recover.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Becomes Leading Foreign Investor in China: Vice-trade Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States has now become
one of the largest sources of direct overseas investment in China,
said Sun Zhengyu, vice-minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, here this morning.
</P>
<P>
To the end of last May, actual U.S. investment in China had
exceeded 18 billion U.S. dollars, with a total of 24,000
enterprises registered here since the country's reform and
opening-up first introduced two decades ago, Sun said at a press
conference sponsored the Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. companies here are comparatively more advanced in
technologies and have better management, with higher-quality
products, and thus they are widely welcome by the Chinese side,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister predicts that U.S. President Bill Clinton's
visit to China later this week will create favorable conditions
for the growth of Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, according to Sun, such important topics as China's
entry into WTO will be discussed and agreements concerning some
important cooperative projects, like those on aeroplanes and power
stations, will be signed during his visit. He also expressed the
hope that U.S. government will abandon some economic sanctions
against China through President Clinton's visit.

<HEADLINE> More Zimbabweans Apply Food Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Nearly two million of Zimbabwe's
12.5 million people need food aid, The Herald daily reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government has set aside 300 million Zimbabwean Dollars
(15 million U.S. Dollars) for the provision of food aid to people
whose crops failed during the last season because of erratic
rains.
</P>
<P>
Judith Madzorera, acting secretary for public service, labour
and social welfare, told The Herald Sunday that 416,658 people
were currently benefiting from the government's free food
program.
</P>
<P>
This program helps the elderly, the chronically ill and the
disabled, and others who proved to be unable to help themselves,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Those who are able to work to support themselves, but have
been hit by crop failure and who cannot find work, have been
helped under the grain-loan scheme where they borrow grain and
repay after their next harvest.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the grain marketing board urgently needs to import
over 200,000 tons of maize to replenish its strategic grain
reserve stocks by the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
The reserve, which should always have at least 500,000 tons of
maize, currently holds about 270,000 tons and this will have to
be topped up with imported maize since local supplies are
inadequate to cope with normal demand and all reserve needs.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Sunday, Chairman of the Grain Marketing
Board Kumbirai Katsande said, "We would prefer that the imports
be effected soonest rather than later. As of now the grain
marketing board has no maize of its own."
</P>
<P>
However, the chairman said he was pleased that funds for the
reserve were being made available.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Refuses to Coach Chicago Bulls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Phil Jackson has refused an
offer to coach the Chicago Bulls for another year, his attorney
confirmed on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf offered him a
chance, Jackson won't return to the Bulls, but he has no future
plans, according to Todd Musberger.
</P>
<P>
"I said no, it's time for me to step away and enjoy some
different things," Jackson told Newsweek magazine in an interview
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Jackson's relations this season with Bulls General Manager
Jerry Krause were strained. The coach billed Chicago's sixth
championship run the "Last Dance," and said his public goodbye at
the Bulls' citywide celebration last week.
</P>
<P>
"For me, it's the perfect conclusion to a wonderful team,"
Jackson said. "There's nothing we can do to top this anymore. Now
it's time to step back from the game for a while."
</P>
<P>
Jackson's departure may effect Michael Jordan's decision.
Jordan has said he won't play for anyone else.
</P>
<P>
Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman also are free agents, as are
six other of the 12 players on the Bulls roster. Pippen said he
would be open-minded to an offer from the Bulls if the other key
members remain.
</P>
<P>
Jackson became Bulls head coach on July 10, 1989. He spent 11
of his 13 NBA seasons as a player with the Knicks and was a member
of their 1973 championship team.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebel Group Orders Arrest of Marcoses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The leftist rebels New Peoples Army
(NPA) confirmed Monday that it had ordered the arrest of the kin
of the late president Ferdinand Marcos to protest the plan by
President-elect Joseph Estrada to bury Marcos at the heroes'
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
The main targets of the arrest are Imelda Marcos, widow of the
late president, and her son Ferdinand "Bonbong" Marcos Jr.,
newly-elected governor of Ilocos Norte, the Philippine News Agency
Monday quoted NPA spokesman Gregorio Rosal as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rosal said in a broadcast interview that the arrest order was
passed by the NPA's political wing, the Communist Party of the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the Marcoses, he said the cronies of the deposed
president will also be arrested.
</P>
<P>
He said administrations after the 1986 overthrow of Marcos,
headed by Corazon Aquino and incumbent President Fidel Ramos, had
"abandoned the quest for justice for thousands of victims of human
rights abuses under Marcos."
</P>
<P>
"But it appears the incoming Estrada regime will do worse than
the criminal negligence of the past two administrations," he said.
Estrada will take office on June 30 and he had decided to allow
the burial of Marcos' remains at the heroes' cemetery on July 11.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Fortunato Abat, also in a broadcast
interview, belittled the threat and said the Marcoses can ask for
protection from the authorities.

<HEADLINE> EU Suspension of E. African Fish to Be Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A suspension on fresh fish
imports imposed by the European Union (EU) on Kenya, Uganda,
Tanzania and Mozambique is likely to be extended beyond the June
30 deadline because of failure to meet EU hygiene requirements.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources say the EU has already decided to extend the
deadline to January next year, though this extension has not been
formally communicated to local fish exporters, the East African
weekly newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The suspension imposed in January this year was to be reviewed
at the end of June if the affected countries invited an EU
inspection team, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is not that bleak. What this means is that
these countries have been given more time to put their house in
order," an official close to EU was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The move will continue to hurt local fishermen, who rely on
the EU to absorb 56 percent of their fish produce. But in the
view of the EU the move is a reprieve for the industry, giving it
more time to meet EU health standards to escape a total ban.
</P>
<P>
The suspension was imposed following EU concern about the
conditions of beaches on Lake Victoria where the fish crop is
collected and also over hygiene standards at processing factories
around the lake.
</P>
<P>
Frozen fish products were later exempted from the ban on
condition they underwent stringent microbiological tests.
</P>
<P>
EU also demanded east African health officials to regularly
inspect the fishing and processing facilities and issue health
compliance certificates.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the local fish industry explain that what has
really been in force, contrary to most press reports, is not a
full-fledged ban, but a tightening of EU health regulations
regarding imports of fresh fish from the region.
</P>
<P>
A key EU demand is that once the fish is pulled out of the
water, it should be put immediately into a clean cold storage.
But most local boats are small and unrefrigerated. Meeting such
criteria would be an expense local fishermen may not easily
afford.
</P>
<P>
The problem started last year when a bacterium called
salmonella was detected in some imported Lake Victoria Nile Perch
in Spain and Italy. EU checks on imported fish from this region
were then tightened.
</P>
<P>
Subsequent reports of cholera in the Lake region only served
to strengthen the EU's demand on local authorities to enforce its
health requirements.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Railways on Brink of Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Railways is on the brink of
collapse because of the dilapidated state the firm is in and it
requires 63 million U.S. Dollars to rehabilitate its
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Monday quoted Lars Jannesson, deputy
managing director of Zambia Railways, as saying at the weekend in
Kitwe, 400 kilometers north of Lusaka, that the state of the
railways' infrastructure is in bad shape due to lack of
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
This is worse especially taking into account the wagons many
of which have been piled without any rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
"The wagons are in very bad shape due to lack of
rehabilitation. This bad state means that you can not run the
rail business anymore," Jannesson said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that his company needs about 63 million
Dollars to rehabilitate the infrastructure such as the tracks and
the wagons. Out of the company's 6,000 fleet of wagons, half of
them are not operational.
</P>
<P>
Jannesson added that the floated staff is another problem in
the running of the company. There are 5,200 permanent workers
and 600 casual employees, but the company intends to reduce its
labour force by 260.
</P>
<P>
According to a 1997 economic report, Zambia Railways' real
output in 1997 amounted to 10 billion Kwacha (seven million
Dollars) as against the output of 12.3 billion Kwacha (8.5
million Dollars) attained in 1996, which was a decline of 18.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth year of persistent decline in output in
the rail transport sub-sector, which indicated serious
operational problems.
</P>
<P>
During the period under review by the report, the company
continued to hold a total stock of 66 locomotive engines out of
which 44 were active, while 22 were not serviceable. The company
also had a total of 75 passenger wagons whose life should be 20
years, but for some reason, they could last only two years.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the company's goods traffic declined by 17.5
percent in 1997 to 1.4 million tons while passenger movement also
declined by 11 percent to 1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
Apart from increased competition from the road transporters,
the poor state of the rail infrastructure and equipment such as
over-aged signaling and telecommunications system and rail track
are the factors for the poor performance of the company, said the
paper.

<HEADLINE> Investors Attracted to Buddhist Site at Dunhuang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Dunhuang city, known for its
Buddhist statues, frescoes and valuable manuscripts, has aroused
attention from investors both in China and overseas.
</P>
<P>
Located in northwest China's Gansu Province, the city has long
been sought as a tourism destination. But now, it is becoming a
favorite for domestic and overseas businesses.
</P>
<P>
The Dunhuang Mountain Villa, for example, is the largest joint
venture between a Hong Kong investment company and the Lanzhou
Guangda Industrial Co. Ltd., involving 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
A Republic of Korea business and a local enterprise spent 30
million on a packaging assembly line, which is now
operational. The Dunhuang Silk Road Hotel, an 80-million-yuan
cooperative project between a Canadian investment group and the
province's Tourism Bureau, is under construction.
</P>
<P>
The city has approved eight overseas-funded enterprises, with
foreign investment amounting to 180 million yuan, which focus on
tourism-related developments.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it has established twin-city relationship with 14
counties and cities in China and abroad, and opened 24 economic
cooperative projects worth more than 400 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
A local official attributed the change to improved
infrastructure, adding that the city has maintained an average
increase of more than 20 percent in its gross domestic product and
revenue in the last five years.

<HEADLINE> Central China Province Searching for Flying Tiger Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province is
expected to start another round of work shortly to unearth one of
the Flying Tiger Air Squadron planes which is believed to have
crashed into a lake 54 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The search will be carred out in the Xiafeng Lake in Luojia
Village of Jianli County.
</P>
<P>
The Flying Tigers, led by U.S. Gen. Claire Lee Chennault,
supported the Chinese army and people against the intrusion of the
Japanese troops during World War II.
</P>
<P>
One of the witnesses to the crash, Luo Benhou, now in his 80s,
recalled that on the morning of May 6, 1944, a burning fighter
plane dropped into Xiafeng Lake near his village. He was working
on his paddy fields at the time.
</P>
<P>
He also saw a pilot, who was later saved by a local farmer,
jumping out of the plane.
</P>
<P>
The fighter plane, with the code number 736849, crashed into
the lake after being attacked by Japanese planes.
</P>
<P>
Some reports at that time said the fighter plane exploded
completely.
</P>
<P>
Jianli County has tried several times to excavate the fighter
plane, with a petrol drum, machine gun and bullets already
retrieved.
</P>
<P>
Since there were usually two pilots for each fighter plane, one
pilot is believed missing, according to an analysis by a retired
army commander.

<P>
CANBERRA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Australian and Hong Kong
officials signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on
Information Technology here Monday in a bid to boost exchange and
cooperation in the rapidly developing information economy.
</P>
<P>
The document was signed by Glenys Roper, chief executive of
Australia's Office of Government Information Technology, and K. C.
Kwong, secretary of Hong Kong's Information Technology and
Broadcasting Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The MOU between Australia and the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) was agreed upon last week following
talks between HKSAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa and Australian
Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister Tim Fischer in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
The MOU identifies areas of common interest of cooperation
including delivery of government services online, electronic
commerce and Internet applications.
</P>
<P>
Industry investment and technology partnerships, as well as
commercial and industrial exchanges, are also highlighted in the
document.
</P>
<P>
Kwong said many government services were delivered online in
Australia and Hong Kong was considering introducing the electronic
delivery.
</P>
<P>
Asked what the immediate exchange between Hong Kong and
Australia will be in information technology, Kwong said Hong Kong
would encourage business and industrial groups to participate in a
multimedia exhibition in October in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Roper said, "There's a large number of government services
delivered online" in Australia.
</P>
<P>
"For instance, social welfare benefits and information is
delivered online. Tax agents are able to lodge tax returns on
behalf of individuals online, and individuals and companies are
able to apply for information on customs requirements online," she
said.

<HEADLINE> Hanzheng Street: Showcase of China's Private Sector (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China's first private business to be
listed on the stock exchange will probably be selected from those
companies on Hanzheng Street Wuhan, capital of central China's
Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
One candidate is the Wuhan Huayi Group, which recently bought
more than 11 million shares of the state-owned Wuhan Electronic
Industry Group Co., Ltd., and succeeded in having Hanzheng Street
International Co., Ltd. registered in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The group's 36-year-old chairman, Sun Bing, said, "It's high
time for private enterprises to enjoy greater development, and
what I'm most concerned about is how to seize the opportunity."
</P>
<P>
The Huayi Group is only one of 12,743 household-run private
firms along the 500-year-old street, a showcase of the country's
private sector. The street has developed into a modern commercial
and trade center with an area of five square kilometers with
60,000 types of merchandise and a daily flow of 160,000 customers.
</P>
<P>
However, private entrepreneurs on the street are no longer
content with small businesses. Instead, they are turning to real
estate, financial services, infrastructure, and even participation
in reforming the state-owned sector. Now, most of them have come
to realize the limitations of family-based management, and are
trying to transform their businesses into stock or limited
companies.
</P>
<P>
"We should adopt the modern enterprise system in a bid to seek
more rapid development, because the family-centered operation
produces strong human touches, but lacks of science in
decision-making," said Wang Wangsheng, a peddler-turned manager,
who has recruited professionals to his newly established clothing
company.
</P>
<P>
Hanzheng Street has been a living testimonial to the
vicissitudes of China's private business sector, which was
completely wiped out during the Cultural Revolution
(1966-1976). It was not until the late 1970s that the private
sector began to recover.

<TEXT>
<P>
Local government adopted tax-free and fee-free policies to
encourage jobless people to start small commodity businesses on
the then 1,600-meter street. Long-buried creativity among ordinary
people has since begun to show, as old taboos have been lifted one
after another.
</P>
<P>
The street is best known for its role as the country's first of
its kind to introduce the wholesale system, market-oriented
pricing system, long-distance cargo transportation, and to run a
business in the form of contracts, leasing and mergers.
</P>
<P>
Stalls and dilapidated houses have given way to modern business
buildings, equipped with computerized information centers
providing cargo demand and supply tips and prices. And, at a
nearby cargo service center, a heavy-laden truck leaves for other
parts of China every three minutes.
</P>
<P>
During the past two decades, the sales volume on the street has
been on the rise despite market changes. Last year, its business
volume amounted to 15 billion yuan, more than the total of the
city's top 10 state-owned department stores combined.
</P>
<P>
"The market is fair to every enterprise no matter whether you
are state-owned, collective, or private. We can learn from each
other, and our aim is to seek for common prosperity," said
a senior executive from the street.
</P>
<P>
Private businesses on the street entered a new round of growth
in September when the 15th Party Congress defined clearly that
non-government economies are important components of China's
socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
"Hanzheng Street's history over the past half century has
reflected the process of cognition for the development of China's
private sector," said Professor Wu Xinmu, an economist at Wuhan
University.
</P>
<P>
Now, private businesses are mushrooming across the country. And
every locality is taking measures to boost the sector. Statistics
show that, by the end of last year, China had nearly 30 million
privately run household businesses and larger firms, involving
some 68 million people and 847 billion yuan in annual output
value.

<HEADLINE> Petrochemical Base Emerging in East China (2) </HEADLINE>

<P>
The building of this new base will improve the distribution of
the industry, said Yan, since most of China's petrochemical bases
are currently located in the northern or central part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
With rapid economic development, China may need to import oil
from the Middle East and Indonesia to make up its oil
shortages. "With convenient sea transport facilities, Fujian will
surely take the responsibility," Yan said.
</P>
<P>
With the building of this new base, investment from Taiwan and
Southeast Asia is expected to flow in, said Cai Deqi, director of
the Fujian provincial economic development research center.
</P>
<P>
Cai said the development of the petrochemical industry is
expected to boost the growth of chemical fibers, textiles,
plastics and other sectors.

<HEADLINE> Petrochemical Base Emerging in East China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A polypropylene project has
recently been put into production at the Fujian Oil Refinery
Corp. (FORC) in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
It is a step for building Fujian into a new petrochemical base,
insiders said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the polypropylene project, which produces 70,000
tons a year, the firm is planing an ethylene project with an
annual output of 600,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The firm, put into operation in 1993, now has an annual oil
refining capacity of four million tons. That figure is expected to
grow to 12 million tons by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"By then, the province will witness the emergence of the
country's sixth largest petrochemical base, following Qilu, Yanshan,
Shanghai, Yangzi and Jinling," predicted Yan Zheng, president of
the provincial Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
According to a plan, the new base under construction will
extend 200 kilometers along the coastline from the Xiaocuo
Economic Development Zone near Meizhou Bay to the Haicang
Investment Zone in Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
Xiaocuo, with FORC as its backbone firm, will be built into a
base for upstream products of the sector. By 2005, the total
investment in this zone is expected to surpass 100 billion yuan,
generating annual industrial output of 100 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Haichang Investment Zone will make the production of
downstream products a priority, such as the organic chemical raw
materials and fine chemical industry.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Avon Products (Guangzhou) Ltd.,
a direct-sales company with financial backing from investors in
the United States, has announced plans to start a chain store and
retail business.
</P>
<P>
C. William Pryor, chairman of the board and president of Avon
Products (Guangzhou) Ltd., said last week that his company had
received permission from Guangzhou city's Administration for
Industry and Commerce to carry out the new operation plan.
</P>
<P>
As a supporting step, Avon products -- mainly cosmetics and

shops owned by Avon will be used for wholesale or retail sales.
</P>
<P>
While extending a warm welcome to its former business agents,
the Avon Products (Guangzhou) Ltd. leader also pledged to increase
investment for advertising.
</P>
<P>
Avon, which set up its first direct-sales subsidiaries in China
in 1990, currently has 75 subsidiaries in the country. It also has
established two manufacturing plants in Guangzhou City and Conghua
County, both in Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
China has banned all direct sales, citing them as a negative
element disturbing the economic order and affecting social
stability.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct-sales enterprises were urged to engage in chain
store and retail businesses with proper approval, while domestic
ones should change to normal store management. Work on this aspect

LANZHOU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Financial assistance provided by
the World Bank has enalbed people living on the Loess Plateau in
the northern and northwestern China score remarkable achievements
in curbing heavy erosion.
</P>

World Bank loans of 150 million U.S. dollars, to carry out
anti-erosion programs on 15,000 sq.km., including 13,000
sq.km. subject to heavy erosion.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the anti-erosion project funded by the bank
was completed by the end of 1997 with erosion on some 250,000
ha. effectively brought under control.
</P>
<P>
The total area of controllable land had jumped to 57.8 percent,
up dramatically from the previous 19.3 percent. In addition, the
annual per capita grain output has soared from 381 kg to 543 kg
and farmers' per capita income has jumped from 348 yuan to 756
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The second phase project is expected to use additional World
Bank loans totalling 150 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Stresses Voluntarism, Flexibility in APEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUCHING (Malaysia), June 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Monday said
the principles of voluntarism and flexibility should be maintained
in implementing trade liberalization among Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) members.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization should be based on the capacity of different
members, especially related to the nine fast-track sectors --
chemicals, environmental goods and services, energy, fish and fish
products, forest products, gems and jewelry, medical equipment and
instruments, toys and telecommunications mutual recognition
arrangement, Malaysian International Trade and Industry Minister
Rafidah Aziz told a news conference here Monday before the opening
of the APEC Trade Ministers Meeting.
</P>
<P>
She said Malaysia, the host of the forthcoming annual Informal
Meeting of APEC Leadership in November this year, subscribed to
"progressive liberalization." "We should not be too ambitious,"
she stressed.
</P>
<P>
The nine sectors were identified under the Early Voluntary
Sectoral Liberalization (EVSL) initiative.
</P>
<P>
She said the two-day trade ministers meeting which opens later
Monday will take stock of the progress of work including on EVSL,
Individual/Collective Action Plans, Electronic Commerce and impact
of trade liberalization as well as provide directions for future
work on the issues.
</P>
<P>
Besides the nine sectors which were set on fast-track, she said
the ministers will also examine progress in the other six sectors
-- automobiles, civil aircraft, food, natural and synthetic
rubber, fertilizers and oilseeds for liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will also have a dialogue with APEC Business
Advisory Council (ABAC) on the collective response of APEC to ABAC
recommendations which contain requests for measures to further
liberalize and facilitate trade and investment, Rafidah said.
</P>
<P>
She said the ministers will consider also how APEC could make
further contribution to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in
light of the outcome of the Second WTO ministerial conference.

<HEADLINE> hke062219 -Bangladesh Economy Recovers from Stagnation: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's economy has
successfully recovered from a stagnation despite of low
investments, imports and external reserves and a high level of
inflation, The Daily Star said Monday quoting a leading economist.
</P>
<P>
"The economy has made a recovery from a two-year stagnation,"
President of the Bangladesh Economic Association, Professor
Wahiduddin Mahmud, told a meeting of the Foreign Investors Chamber
of Commerce and Industries held in Dhaka recently.
</P>
<P>
A sustained agricultural growth, higher exports and industrial
growth helped the economy come out of the stagnation that had kept
a growth rate of 4 percent in the previous years, said Mahmud who
served as a finance and planning adviser to the 1996 caretaker
government.
</P>
<P>
The current over 5 percent GDP (gross domestic product) growth
corresponded to the growth rate in the early 1990s, though it was
far below "our economic potentials", he noted.
</P>
<P>
He endorsed the move to broaden the VAT (value added tax) net
and increase supplementary duty on various products.
</P>
<P>
"Bangladesh's tax-GDP ratio is one of the lowest among the
developing countries," he said, adding that the ratio should be
increased to a standard level of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
"If we want to consolidate our economic strength, there is no
way but to raise the tax-GDP ratio that has stagnated at 12-13
percent since 1992-93," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also strongly criticized some businessmen's tendency to
evade taxes, pointing out that tax evasion "has become a pervasive
practice" in the country.
</P>
<P>
On protection of local industry and a 25 percent cash incentive
for exportable textiles, the professor said there should be a time
limit for such protective measures and incentives so that foreign
investors could make their investment decisions.

<HEADLINE> India, Russia Sign Deal on Nuclear Power Reactors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Ignoring international pressure,
Russia signed an accord with India on Sunday for construction of
two 1,000 mw light water nuclear power reactors in Tamil Nadu, the
southern state of India.
</P>
<P>
The Times of India reported Monday that the accord, which is
supplement to a decade-old agreement with the former Soviet Union,
was signed by visiting Russian Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeni
Adamov and Chairman of Indian Atomic Energy Commission R.
Chidamabaram.
</P>
<P>
The agreement for building two civilian nuclear power plants at
a cost of 2.6 billion U.S. dollars was reached in 1988 between
former Soviet Union President Mikhail Gorbachev and the then
Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
The Times of India said that the accord assumes significance as
it came on the heel of India's nuclear tests last month and showed
that Moscow is willing to cooperate with New Delhi to set up
nuclear power reactors.
</P>
<P>
Adamov arrived here on Sunday via Mumbai and is scheduled to
meet Chidambaram again Monday to give final touches to the
construction of the power plant.
</P>
<P>
Adamov made it clear that Moscow opposed the sanction imposed
by the United States and others following India's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Ignoring international condemnations for India's nuclear tests
and the sanctions that followed, Russia appeared to find a chance
to strengthen its defense and nuclear cooperations with India, its
traditional ally.
</P>
<P>
Russia agreed last week to sell six advanced 9K81 S300V mobile
air defense systems to India at a cost of billions of U.S. dollars
for deployment at front and army level.
</P>
<P>
An Indian delegation led by Defense secretary Ajit Kumar paid a
six-day visit to Russia last week and as a result, three
Russian-built 1135-6 Krivak class modern frigates ordered last
year by India will be fitted with Indian missile systems.
</P>
<P>
A regular meeting of the joint working group on
military-technical cooperation held in Moscow earlier this month
almost finalized a 10-year defense cooperation program between the
two countries, which will be signed during a scheduled visit by
Russian President Boris Yeltsin to New Delhi in December.

<HEADLINE> Laos Also Being Hit By Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Laos, one of the least developed
countries, is feeling the sting of globalization as the Asian
economic crisis is spilling over the borders of the landlocked
country.
</P>
<P>
Efforts by the Lao authorities to stabilize the kip, Laos'
currency, were failing and the country had little hope of emerging
unscathed from the crisis, according to press reports here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dwindling overseas investment, low foreign reserves, a sharp
decline in border trade with Thailand and a heavy reliance on
loans and aid meant that Laos could not isolate itself from
regional woes, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts and observers have been warning that a second wave of
regional economic and financial turmoil is sweeping across Asia,
causing currencies and stock markets to plunge to new lows.
</P>
<P>
The Lao currency has been trading at record lows of about 3,400
units to the U.S. dollar, down nearly 75 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the kip's fall, the Lao government has
introduced a range of measures to stabilize the unit, including
halting the sale of foreign currencies by banks and black-market
dealers.
</P>
<P>
In early June, the authorities announced that foreign
currencies could only be purchased by businesses registered in
Laos, in an effort to curb speculation and control currency flows.
</P>
<P>
The move followed a ban on the use of foreign currencies in
trade last June, but the use of the Thai baht and the dollar in
everyday business transactions remained widespread.
</P>
<P>
Both measures backfired by effectively bringing an end to the
local foreign exchange market, stimulating the re-emergence of a
thriving black market of currencies.
</P>
<P>
As nearly 50 percent of Laos' imports come from Thailand, the
recent volatility in the baht-kip exchange rate has made Lao
importers wary of being unable to sell out their fresh products,
leading to shortages in Vientiane.
</P>
<P>
Laos has ordered restrictions on some imports, such as
motorcycles, in a bid to reduce the demand for foreign currencies
and the outflow of capital from the economy.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Tries to Reverse Tourists Decline from Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Tourism Authority of Thailand
(TAT) is planning to stage an aggressive campaign from now through
September in a bid to reverse the decline in visits from the key
Japanese market, the Bangkok Post said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Advertisements will appear in Japan's nationwide newspapers,
while campaigns will be launched to attract specific target groups
including senior citizens, expatriates, honeymooners, incentive
groups, youngsters, farmers and golfers.
</P>
<P>
The TAT will organize familiarization trips for Japanese
journalists, as well as staging Thai food and culture fairs.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the authority also plans direct contact with
incentive groups, tour operators and other organizations in order
to provide information about the advantages of traveling to
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Special offers will be made through airlines, tour operators,
restaurants and department stores to stimulate demand.
</P>
<P>
Since late last year, economic problems in Japan have slowed
the growth of outbound travel.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Japanese outbound market grew by just 2 percent,
and in January this year, it recorded a decline of 11.3 percent
compared to the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Japanese arrivals in Thailand in the first four months this
year fell by 9.81 percent.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Reduces Bus Services in Rainy Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is reducing its bus
services during the rainy season as the state-run Transport Co.
believes the rainy weather will dampen people's enthusiasm for
travel, the Bangkok Post said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the firm will cut the number of
inter-province buses during June and September by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The company said in the recent two months it suffered a drop in
income of some 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The company was confronted with severe competition from private
buses in its inter-province routes.
</P>
<P>
The Thailand Development and Research Institute has suggested
that Transport Co. be split in two, with one running
inter-province buses, and the other an independent body
supervising service standards for the buses.

BANGKOK, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from the public
and private sectors met here Monday to form a debt restructuring
committee which will be responsible for improving liquidity and
preventing business collapses.
</P>
<P>
The committee will also try to help settle the debt problems
between creditors and borrowers.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda told reporters that the
committee will consist of members from the Federation of Thai
Industries, the Board of Trade of Thailand and the Thai Bankers
Association.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin and leaders of the three organizations brought up the
idea of setting up the committee at an earlier discussion.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said the committee, to be chaired by Central Bank
Governor Chatumongol Sonakul, will bring together local creditors
and foreign commercial banks, finance companies and financial
institutions to solve the problems of liquidity and debt.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the public-private sectors will review a tax
incentive to be submitted by the Revenue Department, Tarrin said,
adding that the tax measures will be temporary. But he did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
He said all measures, if agreed upon by the committee, will be
sent to the cabinet for approval next week.
</P>
<P>
The debt restructuring should enable banks to begin extending
loans to the manufacturing sector again and stop non-performing
loans from growing, Tarrin said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that the move will help restore foreign
investor confidence.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Universities Brace for Modernization Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Preparing for the knowledge
economy era, China is carrying on an ambitious plan to modernize
its outdated colleges and universities in a bid to meet the
challenge of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education announced here today that some 60
universities have been selected in a national program to upgrade
college facilities and improve teaching systems. The program is
being called the "211 Project."
</P>
<P>
The project is the only educational item on a list of state key
construction programs for 1998, which contains 117 items.
</P>
<P>
The plan was drawn up in the mid-1990s by the Chinese
government to build 100 mega-universities which can reach the
heights of universities in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials say that 350 key specialties in the 60
universities will receive funds for renovation, and an educational
computer network and document system will be established to link
universities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
On the list are prestigious institutions of higher learning
universities like Beijing and Qinghua universities, and a large
number of provincial universities.
</P>
<P>
The University of Science of Technology for National Defense
has also been included in the "211 Project."
</P>
<P>
Sources say that these universities have imported more
equipment from overseas and set up advanced laboratories. Some of
them have strengthened themselves through merging with other
universities.
</P>
<P>
China's modern universities appeared in the late 19th century
and adopted the former Soviet Union model in the 1950s. Most of
them are poorly operated and students have no information about
the scientific frontiers, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The country has invested more than 1.3 million yuan (157,000
U.S. dollars) in the project, which is the largest investment in
the educational sector since new China was founded in 1949.

opportunities for furthering the bilateral cooperation. "Both
countries can explore the possibilities in such fields as
enterprise managerial mechanism, infrastructure, housing, social
security and financial supervision system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shi told the press that China in the future plans to put
investment priorities in such sectors as agriculture, forestry,
water conservation, energy, transportation, telecommunications,
environmental protection, high- and new-tech industries and other
infrastructural facilities.
</P>
<P>
China's investment in infrastructure in the next three years
is expected to total 1,100 billion U.S. dollars and the value of
imported goods in the period will reach 600 billions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. firms, based on their advantages and through fair
competition, can work with Chinese businesses for a brilliant
future of the Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"So long as China and the United States bear long-term
benefit in mind and properly handle differences from a strategic
perspective in a constructive manner, the business communities of
both countries will be able to carry out various forms of
cooperation in a stable and relaxed environment," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Shi and Sun Zhenyu, vice trade minister, are scheduled to
answer questions at the press conference.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Gives U.S. one Month to Settle Textile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is giving the
United States up to early next month to settle its garment trade
row, otherwise the case would be submitted again to the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government's negotiating panel led by the
Garments Textile Exports Board has notified the Philippine party
in Geneva led by Permanent Representative to WTO Ambassador Lilia
Bautista of the position, Manila Bulletin reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva party was also advised to look into the grounds
where the Philippines could file a case against the U.S. by
reviving the unfair trade practice violations of its rules of
origin regulation which took effect in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
Donald Dee, president of the Confederation of Garment Exporters
of the Philippines, said the negotiation bogged down after the
U.S. rejected the proposal of the Philippines to settle for a 10
percent compensation or 50 million U.S. dollar worth of additional
quota.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the U.S. insisted only on a 5 percent
additional quota this year.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the U.S. regulation on Rules of Origin
was the root cause of the garment row between the U.S. and the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Such ruling provides that exports of garments made out of
imported textiles and yarns will only be credited to the quota of
the items' actual country of origin whether or not sufficient
transformation occurred.
</P>
<P>
This rule effectively replaced the previous rule which allowed
mere cutting or lacing of edges of an imported textile already
constituted substantial transformation.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, a major importer of textile for its growing
garment industry of which over 60 percent goes to the U.S. market,
was adversely affected as it now loses some of its valuable
garment quotas.

<HEADLINE> Presale Checks Block Handgun Sales in U.S. Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department
estimated on Sunday that under the presale checks of the Brady law
some 69,000 handgun sales were blocked in 1997.
</P>
<P>
More than three out of five sales were turned down because the
buyer had a felony conviction or was under felony indictment, the
department's Bureau of Justice Statistics said.
</P>
<P>
The rejections constituted just 2.7 percent of the some 2.6 million
applications nationwide for handgun sales during the year, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Since the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act took effect in
February 1994, through the end of last year, there have been
242,000 purchases stopped because of the checks, out of a total of
10-plus million purchase applications, the bureau estimated.
</P>
<P>
Felony convictions or indictments for the would-be handgun
buyer accounted for 61.7 percent of the turndowns.
</P>
<P>
The second most frequent reason for denial was domestic
violence, which was responsible for 11.2 percent, including 9.1
percent who had misdemeanor domestic violence convictions and 2.1
percent who were under court orders restraining them from harming
or stalking an intimate partner or child.
</P>
<P>
Another 5.9 percent of the denials were for buyers who turned
out to be fugitives from justice.
</P>
<P>
State law prohibitions blocked sales to 6.1 percent of the
rejectees; drug addiction accounted for 1.6 percent of the
denials; mental illness for 0.9 percent; local law prohibitions
for another 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 11.7 percent of the denials came from all others
barred from handgun purchases under the Federal Gun Control Act of
1968, including illegal aliens, juveniles, dishonorably discharged
servicemen, and people who have renounced U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
The estimates were based on a sampling of the chief law
enforcement officers whose agencies conduct the background checks.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in November of this year, presale checks will be
required for all firearms, not just handguns, purchased from
federally licensed dealers. The dealers will make the checks
through an automated system that Justice Department officials have
said will be operable by that time.

<HEADLINE> Garzelli Wins Swiss Tour Stage and Overall Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Stefano Garzelli claimed
his second consecutive stage win and kept the overall lead in the
Tour of Switzerland around Lenzerheide of Switzerland on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Garzelli, made his first professional victory on Saturday,
surged ahead from a three-man sprint finish to the 156 km fifth
stage, crossing in front of compatriots Daniele De Paoli and
Leonardo Piepoli.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Davide Rebellin, who began the day clinging to a 10
seconds overall lead, watched his advantage eroded as Garzelli led
a three-man break on the final climb.
</P>
<P>
Garzelli gained a one minute 19 seconds lead over Piepoli and
Switzerland's Beat Zberg.
</P>
<P>
Most of Sunday's stage had been dominated by a brave solo break
by De Paoli, who went away after just 22 kms at the foot of the
first of four climbs.
</P>
<P>
The Italian held on grimly until five kms from the finish when
he was overtaken by Garzelli and Piepoli.

<HEADLINE> China Plays Important Role in Asia: Italian Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton is going
to China because China and its leaders are playing an increasingly
important role in Asia, a commentary in the Italian newspaper La
Republica said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The commentary, entitled "Aim of Clinton's China Visit", said
the U.S. president's visit is due more to China's growing
prominence in Asia's political and economic prospects than to the
attraction offered by China's great market potentials.
</P>
<P>
China has exerted its utmost efforts to keep Asia's economic
stability during the financial crisis in the region and China's
currency RMB is playing a more and more important part as the
crisis persists, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
It also noted the important position occupied by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji in Asia's political
scene, especially their key role amid the growing concerns over a
possible nuclear arms race after nuclear tests by India and
Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai State Firms Woo Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- An agency was set up recently in
east China's Shanghai municipality to help foreign investors
choose state firms.
</P>
<P>
This indicates local government's encouragement to foreign
investors to cooperate with state firms, economists agreed.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has readjusted its policies on foreign investment,
according to the local government.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policies, foreigners are allowed to purchase,
merge, rent or contract small state businesses. The municipality
also has asked its large state companies to improve cooperation
with their foreign counterparts to speed up technical upgrades and
expand exports.
</P>
<P>
The municipality plans to sell some large state firms to
foreigners, with a total investment of nearly 100 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has provided a list of 100 small and medium-sized
businesses for foreign investors to consider. The firms' total
assets are 744 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Though suffering from poor management and inefficiency, these
state firms have advantages such as intact infrastructures and
skilled workers.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Seek Overseas Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The debt-ridden and strike-bound
Philippine Airlines (PAL) will file petitions overseas to seek
protection from foreign creditors, the newspaper Business World
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
PAL officials were quoted as saying earlier that they are
considering the move after a team from Airbus Industry came here
to negotiate terms and possible penalties for the early
termination of aircraft leases and the deferment of purchases.
</P>
<P>
The airline filed last week a massive downsizing program to the
Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission. PAL said its
financial situation was aggravated by the ongoing pilots' strike
which made it unable to pay debts totaling 2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The company's 620-member pilots' union went on strike two weeks
ago, demanding revision of its collective bargaining agreement
with the management. The indefinite strike has cost the company
more than 2 billion pesos (50 million dollars) in revenue loss,
PAL said.
</P>
<P>
Under its downsizing plan, PAL plans to reduce its
13,200-strong workforce by nearly 40 percent, dispose 40 of its 54
airplanes, suspends more than two-thirds of its routes and sell
some of its subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
But the Securities and Exchange Commission said over the
weekend that it will not hesitate to order the dissolution of the
airlines if it determines that recovery will take longer than five
years.
</P>
<P>
PAl has given its creditors assurance that it will continue to
pay interest on its loans to commercial banks even during the
course of its rehabilitation program.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Justifies China Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- With only days away from his
trip to China, President Bill Clinton has raised voice to defend
his policy of engagement, warning that isolating that country
would be a disaster for the United States.
</P>
<P>
"In isolating China, we would only encourage China to turn
inward and to act in opposition to our interests and values,"
Clinton wrote in an article published Sunday by Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
The president leaves for China Wednesday for a nine-day visit
which will take him to Xi'an, Beijing, Shanghai, Guilin and Hong
Kong. He will be the first American president to visit China in
almost ten years.
</P>
<P>
He decided to go ahead with the trip despite pressures put on
him by Republicans in Congress to call it off. His critics
criticized the Administration's China policy of engagement as a
policy of appeasement.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told reporters Saturday in the White House that the
substantive changes in China have justified the kind of "measured,
principled engagement strategy we've followed."
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the roles China played in trying to ease the
tension triggered off by nuclear tests by India and Pakistan and
in stablizing the financial situation in Asia, believing that it
is ever more important to cooperate with China under such
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"The reason I'm going to China now is that I think there have
been a lot of positive changes in the past six years," he said in
interviews with The Los Angeles Times and other news
organizations.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday the president suggested that permanent most-favored
nation trading status be accorded to China because the annual
battle over the issue on Capitol Hill is counterproductive. "I
don't think this debate every year serves a particularly useful
purpose," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he talked with congressional leaders last year about
ending the annual debate over China's MFN, but no agreement was
reached at that time.
</P>
<P>
Under a 1974 law, renewal of normal trade status with communist
states must be re-approved annually. China has had MFN status
since 1980, and President Clinton extended that again this year
early this month. Congress has 90 days to debate.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Secretary William Daley said on "Fox News Sunday" that
"it's important that we get beyond this year-to-year review by
Congress, and we get into some multiyear, if not permanent" trade
relationship.
</P>
<P>
He said that the "hysteria" it generated was not good for
long-term engagement with a country with a huge market.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton also said that he is disenchanted with the
U.S. sanctions policy, saying in an interview released Saturday
that Washington has become "sanction-happy."
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives passed legislation in May imposing
economic penalties on countries that conduct religious
persecution.
</P>
<P>
The president argued that sanctions can be useful, particularly
when applied by the international community as a whole, but he
said the United States has become too reliant on them as a tool of
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
"The way these sanctions laws are written, they really deprive
the president, any president, of the necessary flexibility in the
country's foreign policy," he told CBS News and the Cox and
McClatchy newspaper chains.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. lawmakers and powerful business lobbies have called
on Congress and the White House to curtail the use of unilateral
sanctions as an instrument of foreign policy. It was reported that
Senate Republican leader Trent Lott and Democratic leader Tom
Daschle plan to appoint a special task force to review the
sanction policy.

<HEADLINE> More Than 30,000 Hectares Burned in Florida Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 30,000 hectares have
been burned in wildfires in drought-stricken counties of north and
central Florida since the beginning of June.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters had contained 70 percent of 5,280 hectares of
blazes in North Florida. But dry weather drives more new fires to
start each day. Local officials said 80 to 90 new fires were
expected daily unless Florida received some rainfall.
</P>
<P>
The fires this month have burned 30,870 hectares in 39
counties, damaging 72 homes and 41 other structures in Florida.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has declared the entire state a
fire disaster area.

<P>
LYON, France, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran became the first Asian
nation to win a game here after beating the United States 2-1 in group
F here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The United States campaign in these finals was finished after the
loss as they have been denied any chance for reaching the second stage
here.
</P>
<P>
Hamid Estili put Iran on the scoreboard in the 40th minute, when he
headed the ball home past keeper Kasey Keller on a pass from defender
Javad Zarincheh.
</P>
<P>
Iran was 2-0 ahead 36 minutes into the second half, when midfielder
Mehdi Mahdavikia made a lone run down the center and netted calmly in
the box.
</P>
<P>
The United States reduced the margin in the 87th minute on a header
from forward Brian McBride, who plays in the MLS league side Columbus
Crew.
</P>
<P>
Germany and Yugoslavia now tied at four points to lead the group
standings, followed by Iran at three. The United States were winless.

<HEADLINE> Jamaican Pleased with Team Performance Despite Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Jamaican coach Rene Simoes said he
was pleased with his team's play despite the 5-0 defeat to the
Argentine team here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased with my team and their play, if anyone can avoid
letting in fewer than four goals against a giant like Argentina,
they should consider themselves lucky." Simoes said.
</P>
<P>
"I decided to use a zonal defence instead of individual marking
because of the 'red card fever' prevalent over the last fre
matches," said Simoes, "But on the whole I am satisfied with the
refereeing."
</P>
<P>
One Jamaican player was sent off in the second half of the match.
</P>
<P>
Argentine midfielder Juan Veron said:"We played a very good
match againsta tough and physical side. I'd like to wish our coach
DAniel Alberto Passarella a happy fathers' Day. He is an essential
element in our victory."
</P>
<P>
Forward Claudio Lopez said:"We played a superb match, much
better than against Japan. We were able to move the ball forward
and take advantage of having lots of attacks."
</P>
<P>
Argentina now lead Group H with better goal difference than
Croatia, which have also collected 6 points from two wins. The two
teams will play their last group match to decide the group winners.
