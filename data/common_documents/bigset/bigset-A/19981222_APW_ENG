Mabry, Mouton, Bragg become free agents; Hamilton gets dlrs 17
</HEADLINE>
million deal &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Outfielders John Mabry, James Mouton and Darren
Bragg were among 39 players who became free agents Monday when
their teams failed to offer them 1999 contracts by the tender
deadline.
	   All players on 40-man rosters must be offered contracts by the
Dec. 20 deadline or they immediately go free.
	   Meanwhile, as the baseball's focus began to shift from free
agents to salary arbitration, the Toronto Blue Jays agreed to a
dlrs 17 million, three-year contract with Joey Hamilton, obtained
from the San Diego Padres during the winter meetings.
	   ``I tried over the last couple of years to get something done
with San Diego and they weren't very receptive,'' Hamilton said.
``It's like a big burden lifted off my back. I think being able to
come here and get a fresh start is going to be really good for
me.''
	   Texas outfielder Tom Goodwin agreed to a dlrs 3.25 million,
one-year contract and Mike Simms, another Rangers outfielder,
agreed to a two-year deal worth dlrs 1,725,000.
	   Left-hander Buddy Groom agreed to an dlrs 850,000, one-year deal
with Oakland and right-hander Gil Heredia agreed to a one-year
contract with the Athletics.
	   Among free agents, Baltimore signed utility player Rich Amaral
to a two-year contract and right-hander Ricky Bones to a one-year
contract, and San Diego signed 36-year-old third baseman Dave
Magadan to a one-year contract.
	   The Dec. 20 deadline to tender contracts to players on 40-man
rosters has become increasingly important in recent years, with
some teams reluctant to offer contracts to players with borderline
statistics, many of them eligible for salary arbitration.
	   Not offering a contract _ which removes a player from the 40-man
roster _ often is a way of getting around the 20 percent maximum
cut rule in the collective bargaining agreement. Teams may then
re-sign players as free agents for any amount.
	   Philadelphia did that to right-hander Ken Ryan, who made dlrs
990,000 last season. The Phillies let him go, then re-signed him
for dlrs 600,000, a 29 percent cut.
	   Left-hander Alvin Morman, cut loose by San Francisco, agreed
within hour to a one-year contract with Kansas City.
	   The New York Yankees failed to offer a contract to outfielder
Darryl Strawberry for a different reason. Strawberry is recovering
from colon cancer surgery and may not be ready by opening day in
April. New York intends to re-sign Strawberry to a minor-league
contract _ that way, if he starts the season on the disabled list,
his salary is not subject to the luxury tax.
	   Among others let loose were Anaheim left-hander Allen Watson,
Oakland pitchers Mike Mohler and Mike Oquist, Seattle outfielder
Rob Ducey and Arizona right-hander Willie Banks.
	   Also, there were no new developments in the Roger Clemens trade
talks, agent Randy Hendricks said Monday. The five-time Cy Young
Award winner wants the Toronto Blue Jays to trade him to a
contender or closer to his Houston home.

Activists want probe into official who approved Hollywood film
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A total of 38 Thai environmental and
democracy groups have called for a government investigation of the
forestry chief who is allowing a Hollywood film to be made in a
conservation area, a government official said Tuesday.
	   The groups filed a petition with the Counter Corruption
Commission, saying the forestry chief had violated national law in
granting permission to 20th Century Fox to shoot the Leonardo
DiCaprio film ``The Beach'' in a national park conservation area.
	   ``We will look into the details of the petition and see if it is
in our area of responsibility to investigate it,'' a commission
official said on condition of anonymity.
	   More than two dozen activists had staged a sit-in protest for
two weeks at Maya Beach on Phi Phi Island, the site of the filming.
The island, part of Krabi province, 550 kilometers (340 miles)
southwest of Bangkok, is in the Andaman Sea.
	   The activists opposed plans by the film crew to remove the
natural vegetation in the beach area and plant 92 palm trees,
saying that would severely degrade the beach's ecosystem.
	   They have also alleged that film crews have damaged fragile
coral reefs.
	   Last week the protesters were forced to end their sit-in when
they were surrounded by a group of over 100 thugs led by the deputy
governor of Krabi and a local headman.
	   Reporters were warned to keep away and the activists said they
were threatened with bodily harm if they did not end their protest.
	   They said the pro-film group leaders were ``influential
people,'' a code phrase in Thailand for politicians or businessmen
with dual identities as crime bosses.
	   In a roundtable on implications of shooting the film on Maya
Beach held by The Nation newspaper, many island residents and hotel
owners voiced strong opposition to the project.
	   Dr. Panom Ieamprayoon, Dean of the Law Faculty at Thammasat
University, said Forestry Chief Plodprasop Suraswadi had violated
the 1961 National Park Act by approving the film shoot.
	   He said the law only allowed alterations to the environment to
facilitate research and conservation of tourism.
	   The Counter Corruption Commission official said it usually takes
several weeks for the agency to determine whether to accept or
reject a complaint.
	   ``We will investigate the request only when it concerns
corruption, bribery among civil servants, or abuse of authority
that involves some monetary or other interest,'' he said.

Dolphins 31, Broncos 21
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVEN WINE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ The Miami Dolphins are in the U.S. National
Football League playoffs, and the Denver Broncos are in a slump.
	   Dan Marino dominated in his first matchup against John Elway
since 1985, throwing for 355 yards and four touchdowns to lead
Miami past Denver 31-21 Monday night.
	   Miami (10-5) clinched the final AFC playoff berth as a wild-card
entry, giving the AFC East four teams in postseason. The Broncos
(13-2), who were unbeaten and looked unbeatable two weeks ago, lost
their second game in a row.
	   ``When you play a team like Denver, you've got to score every
opportunity you get because they have a lot of firepower,'' Marino
said. ``We knew everybody had to play well for us to win because
they're the best team in the league.''
	   The Broncos had little incentive because they had already
clinched the home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.
Their loss to the New York Giants last week dashed the tantalizing
prospect of an unbeaten Denver team playing in Miami, where the
1972 Dolphins are revered for achieving the NFL's only perfect
season.
	   Miami fell behind 10-0 before Marino threw scoring passes of 9,
56 and 17 yards to Lamar Thomas, who came into the game with just
seven touchdowns in a six-year career. Marino then hit Oronde
Gadsden with an 8-yard scoring pass for a 28-13 lead.
	   The Dolphins' defense did the rest. Elway, playing in Miami for
the first time in his 16-year career, completed only 13 of 36
passes for 151 yards and was intercepted twice in the fourth
quarter.
	   Marino went 23-for-38 and surpassed 3,000 yards passing for the
13th season, an NFL record.
	   Denver's Terrell Davis managed just 29 yards in 16 carries,
leaving him 170 yards shy of 2,000.
	   The Broncos scored on a kickoff return for the first time since
1972 on Vaughn Hebron's 95-yard runback with eight minutes left,
and Bubby Brister's two-point conversion pass to Ed McCaffrey made
the score 28-21.
	   But a 42-yard field goal by the Dolphins' Olindo Mare with 1:10
left clinched the win.
	   Denver's Jason Elam kicked field goals of 52 and 44 yards but
missed a 43-yarder.

Report: Protesters charged with ``causing peace''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A mistake in a court summons against arrested
pro-democracy activists said that rather than disturbing society,
they were likely to improve it, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The summons, written in Chinese, said the four activists, who
were charged with behaving in a disorderly manner at a July
protest, ``would probably cause society peace,'' the South China
Morning Post reported.
	   The English version, however, stated that ``a breach of the
peace was likely to be caused,'' the report said.
	   ``I was very happy when I received the summons. I thought the
(Hong Kong) government recognized that what we are doing will cause
society peace,'' defendant Tsang Kin-shing, a veteran activist and
a former legislator, told a district court Monday, according to the
Post.
	   ``I would plead guilty to the original summons.''
	   The court amended the Chinese document to conform with the
English version on Monday, and the four defendants pleaded not
guilty, the report said.
	   Tsang, Leung Kwok-hung, Lau Shan-ching and Koo Sze-yiu were
arrested on July 1 at a protest to mark the first anniversary of
the transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty to Chinese rule.
	   The court adjourned their case until February.

Defense alleges main prosecution witness a spurned lover
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Lawyers defending Anwar Ibrahim on
Tuesday accused a main prosecution witness of acting in a jealous
rage because the former deputy prime minister spurned her
overtures.
	   ``I put it to you that you had confessed to a number of people
that you were crazy about Dato Seri Anwar Ibrahim,'' Christopher
Fernando, the lawyer, asked of Ummi Hafilda Ali.
	   The 31-year-old advertising executive, who claims Anwar had
sexual relations with her brother's wife, glowered as Fernando
persisted in this line of cross examination.
	   ``Did you write a few love letters to Dato Seri Anwar Ibrahim?''
he asked.
	   ``I think I can sue you for making such an allegation,'' Ummi
retorted, before denying the claim.
	   Ummi, a Malay woman who often poses for photographers outside
the courthouse in Western-style suits and designer handbags, sent a
letter to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad last year that set off an
avalanche of events leading to Anwar's firing and arrest in
September.
	   Ummi alleged that Anwar, 51, was sleeping with the wife of her
brother, the then-deputy prime minister's former private secretary.
	   She also helped Azizan Ali Bakar, a driver in the Anwar
household, to come forward with allegations that he had been
repeatedly sodomized by the politician.
	   When the cross-examination delved further into Ummi's alleged
passion for Anwar, there were snickers and giggles from the public
gallery.
	   Trial judge Augustine Paul was not amused.
	   ``I think this line of questioning should be properly backed up,
otherwise it is highly scandalous,'' Paul said.
	   Fernando assured him there were solid grounds.
	   He then dove further by asking if she kept a picture of Anwar on
her pillow.
	   ``Have you been to my room?'' she snapped back from the witness
stand.
	   Fernando: ``Answer the question. I don't want to come to your
room.''
	   She denied having a photo of Anwar in her room.
	   During questioning, the defense also asked if Ummi's advertising
company, Karisma, was winning huge government contracts. She
admitted to getting large contracts and said she was negotiating
for the advertising account of the company that manages the Kuala
Lumpur International Airport.
	   Ummi had retracted all the allegations she made against Anwar
last year. But prosecutors say she was coerced to do so by police,
acting at the behest of the then-deputy prime minister.
	   On Monday, Ummi testified that her original allegations made in
the letter to Mahathir were true and that police had threatened to
send her to jail for two years if she didn't retract her claims
against Anwar.
	   Anwar has denied all the accusations against him, saying they
were cooked up to eliminate his challenge to Mahathir's
17-year-rule. The ousted politician, whose wife has formed a
political reform party on his behalf, claims a high-level
government conspiracy is out to ruin his career.
	   Anwar is now being tried on four counts of abuse of power.
Separate trials will be held for another count of corruption and
five of illegal sex.

Samsung sells part of non-memory chip operation to Fairchild
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Samsung Electronics Co., the world's
largest memory chip maker, said Tuesday it has sold one-third of
its non-memory chip operations to a U.S. firm for dlrs 455 million.
	   The deal calls for Fairchild Semiconductor Co. to take over one
of Samsung's two non-memory chip plants in South Korea and its
1,500 workers as of Jan. 1, 1999. Located in Puchon west of Seoul,
the plant produces power devices, transistors and linear integrated
circuits.
	   The Puchon plant recorded net profit of 19.6 billion won (dlrs
15.3 million) on 420 billion won (dlrs 350 million) in total sales
in 1997.
	   Before the sale, non-memory chips accounted for 30 percent of
Samsung's total semiconductor operations.
	   Samsung said the deal is part of its restructuring efforts to
concentrate on more advanced chips for use in communications or
digital televisions.
	   Samsung Electronics, the flagship unit of the Samsung group,
South Korea's second largest conglomerate, produces semiconductors,
telecommunications products, home appliances and computer products.
	   A number of local companies have been selling off their assets
and units to foreign investors in a bid to streamline their
businesses and improve their financial positions.
	   Based in South Portland, Maine, Fairchild specializes in
non-memory chip production.

British embassy says balloon team told by Chinese to head south

says balloonists will not be asked to leave airspace immediately

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Three men hoping to be the first to circle the
world by balloon may still get their chance despite crossing into
Chinese air space without permission, prompting fears that their
adventure would be forced to come to an early end.
	   The British Embassy in Beijing said the Chinese are not
demanding the balloonists leave Chinese airspace immediately, but
want the crew ``to continue their efforts to reach the area south
of latitude 26,'' the official said, speaking with customary
anonymity.
	   The Chinese will only grant official flight permission as soon
as the balloon gets into the originally agreed upon flight corridor
_ below 26 degrees north latitude, the embassy official said.
	   Contacted separately, the Chinese Foreign Ministry, the
government information office and official sports associations
refused to comment. The balloon's support team in London said the
Chinese were ''being reasonable'' and every effort was being made
to comply with their demands.
	   Piloted by British tycoon Richard Branson, American Steve
Fossett and Sweden's Per Linstrand, the balloon crossed from Nepal
into Chinese-ruled Tibet late Monday.
	   China had given permission for the ICO Global balloon to travel
in its airspace south of 26 degrees north latitude. But because of
diversions around Mediterranean storms and Iraq, the balloon
crossed the Himalayas further north than planned and entered China
250 miles north of the agreed airspace corridor.
	   Project director Mike Kendrick said Chinese air traffic
controllers were informed the moment the balloon passed over the
border, with an apology added to the communication. The balloon
team continued to contact them every 15 minutes to keep the Chinese
informed about their position.
	   ''A balloon goes wherever the wind takes it,'' project manager
David Partridge said Tuesday. ''Unfortunately, it took us where we
weren't supposed to go. But we are basically using our best
endeavors to get further south.''
	   The British Embassy official said the Chinese recognize that the
balloon can't be turned around quickly.
	   In February, China withheld permission for a European balloon
team to fly through its airspace, ending their around-the-world
bid.
	   As it became apparent early Monday that the balloon would
inevitably cross into unauthorized Chinese territory, frantic
diplomatic negotiations were launched by the British government.
Prime Minister Tony Blair sent a message to Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji asking for China's help, the British embassy official said.
	   The ICO Global balloon had already run into trouble on its trip.
Libya unexpectedly revoked permission to enter its airspace, but
the situation was resolved shortly before the three-man crew flew
over the country on Saturday.
	   Then, in conditions marred by thunderstorms, the crew had to
maneuver the 270-foot (82-meter) craft through narrow gaps between
no-fly territories, including war-torn Iraq.
	   On Monday night, the crew were flying through pitch darkness
over some of the world's highest peaks, where landing _ if China
demands it _ would be dangerous and difficult. Landing also would
mean an end to their bid.
	   The crew members estimate the trip could last from eight days to
nearly three weeks. They hope to touch down somewhere in western
Europe at the end of a 24,000-mile (38,000 kms) flight, which will
take them over India, the South China sea, the Pacific and the
United States.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.

Hasek, Sabres down Hurricanes 4-1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Dallas record in Canadiens-Stars &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GREENSBORO, North Carolina (AP) _ Jason Woolley had a goal and
two assists and Dominik Hasek made 19 saves to lead the Buffalo
Sabres to a 4-1 win over the Carolina Hurricanes on Monday night.
	   Miroslav Satan and Michael Peca also scored for the Sabres, who
won for the eighth time in their last 10 games.
	   Robert Kron scored for Carolina, which lost for only the second
time in its last eight home games. Trevor Kidd made 29 saves after
making 38 in the Hurricanes' 3-2 win at Buffalo on Saturday.
	   Buffalo improved to 14-0-0 when leading after two periods as
Hasek earned his league-best 17th win.
 &UR; Canadiens 2, Stars 2
	   In Montreal, Darryl Sydor's goal at 13:54 of the third period
lifted the Dallas Stars into a tie with Montreal as the Canadiens
equalled a 50-year-old team winless mark.
	   The Canadiens remained winless in December at 0-5-5 _ equalling
the club's 10-game winless streak from the 1947-48 season. The team
record is 12 games without a win set in 1926 and equalled in 1935.
	   Sydor beat Jeff Hackett for his ninth goal as the Stars _ first
overall in the NHL with a 19-5-6 record _ kept alive a nine-game
unbeaten streak.
	   Benoit Brunet and Patrick Poulin scored in the second for
Montreal (8-17-7) before Sergei Zubov responded with only 30
seconds left in the period.
 &UR; Bruins 3, Lightning 2
	   In Boston, Kyle McLaren scored twice and Hal Gill had the
tie-breaking goal with 8:31 left in the third period as the Boston
Bruins beat the Tampa Bay Lightning.
	   Boston improved to 8-1-2 at home against Tampa Bay.
	   Craig Janney and Vincent Lecavalier scored for the Lightning,
who have the league's worst record (8-21-3) and dropped their 15th
game in their last 18.
	   Rob Tallas, making his first start since Nov. 24 and only his
sixth this season for Boston, stopped 24 shots. Bill Ranford made
31 saves in the Tampa Bay net.
 &UR; Maple Leafs 7, Penguins 1
	   In Toronto, Mats Sundin scored two goals and Alyn McCauley had a
goal and two assists as the Toronto Maple Leafs beat the Pittsburgh
Penguins.
	   The Maple Leafs, who lead the NHL with 105 goals, have scored 14
in the last two games with McCauley collecting seven points during
that span.
	   Toronto goaltender Curtis Joseph made 30 saves as the Maple
Leafs were outshot 31-27.
	   Jason Smith, Derek King, Sergei Berezin and Mike Johnson also
scored for the Maple Leafs, who have won 10 of their last 11 home
games. Jan Hrdina scored for Pittsburgh.

Congress proposes amendment to patents law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The main opposition Congress party
proposed an amendment Tuesday to a controversial patent bill,
striking a populist chord by suggesting an exemption for products
drawn from India's traditional system of medicine.
	   The proposal came at the orders of Congress leader Sonia Gandhi
during a meeting of the party's parliamentary members, United News
of India said. The amendment would ban exclusive sales or
distribution rights to any company marketing products ``based on
(the) Indian system of medicine already in the public domain.''
	   The Indian government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party
introduced the bill last week intended to provide exclusive
marketing rights to foreign agrochemical and pharmaceutical
companies selling their products here.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the BJP would accept
Congress' proposal. The governing party needs Congress support to
push through the bill.
	   Leftist parties vehemently opposed the bill, introduced by
Industry Minister Sikander Bakht, arguing working people will be
hurt because foreigners will destroy indigenous business.
Reformists say patent protections will make India a more attractive
place to do business for foreigners.
	   No date has been set for a debate or vote on the bill.
	   The bill proposes that India start giving patents in 2005, but
the World Trade Organization has asked New Delhi to provide a
mechanism to receive applications beginning next April.
	   The existing 1970 law catered for process patent, but did not
provide for product patent.

At least 34 die in clashes in northeastern Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ At least 34 people were killed in
clashes between government troops and guerrillas in northeastern
Sri Lanka in the heaviest fighting in three months, military
officials said Tuesday.
	   Troops killed at least 30 insurgents in an ambush near the
northern town of Oddusuddan on Monday, said military officials who
asked not to be named.
	   Oddusuddan, 270 kilometers (165 miles) north of the capital,
Colombo, was captured by government troops earlier this month.
	   Two other guerrillas were killed in a clash a few kilometers
(miles) to the west near the town of Kanakarayankulam on Monday,
the officials said.
	   One soldier was killed and eight wounded the same day when
rebels attacked a military convoy near Eravur town in eastern
Batticaloa district, the officials said.
	   A civilian died in another grenade attack Monday, this one on a
shop in the eastern Valaichchenai town.
	   It was the fiercest fighting since several big battles in
September killed more than 1,000 on both sides.
	   The guerrillas are fighting for a homeland in the northeast for
the country's minority ethnic Tamils, who say they are
discriminated by the majority Sinhalese who control the government
and military. More than 56,000 people have been killed in the war.

Reports: Indonesia postpones plans for civilian militia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: One name correct for Muladi, Suharto &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - The government has decided to postpone
a controversial plan to form a civilian militia to boost security
in Indonesia, newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   Military chief Gen. Wiranto had suggested the idea because the
armed forces has been overstretched by near-daily student
demonstrations in Jakarta and other cities over the past several
months.
	   Student activists who have been pressing for swifter democratic
change had promised to call off rallies during the Islamic holy
month of Ramadan, which began Sunday.
	   But protesters and human rights activists were outraged by the
proposal to establish a militia, arguing that the deployment of
thousands of young men in the streets would only exacerbate unrest.
	   Justice Minister Muladi said Monday that the new plan for
civilian militias had been delayed while the government drafted a
law that would allow their formation, The Jakarta Post reported.
	   The law will be submitted to Parliament next month, Muladi said.
	   The government of President B.J. Habibie had earlier considered
taking a legal shortcut by issuing a decree.
	   Last month, military-backed civilian guards armed with bamboo
staves brawled with students and neighborhood youths during a
government assembly on political reform. The guards were withdrawn
after a public outcry.
	   Indonesia has been plagued by political uncertainty since
Habibie took office after riots and protests helped oust
authoritarian President Suharto after 32 years in power.
	   Habibie is implementing political reforms, but students say he
is not moving fast enough. Activists have often clashed with
security forces during rallies to demand that Suharto be put on
trial for alleged corruption and that the military abandon its
political role.
	   There are fears of more unrest as newly formed political parties
jostle for influence ahead of general elections scheduled for June.

Report: Indonesian mobs attack soldier in provincial town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Soldiers fired warning shots to
disperse a crowd that attacked an army officer in a northern
provincial town, a newspaper reported Tuesday. Six people,
including two soldiers, were injured.
	   The violence erupted Monday on the outskirts of Lhokseumawe in
Aceh province, where the military has been accused of human rights
abuses during a campaign against separatist rebels.
	   The armed forces recently ended the campaign and apologized for
any wrongdoing, but resentment among Acehnese toward Indonesia's
security forces still runs deep.
	   The daily Kompas newspaper said mobs tried to seize an army
sergeant suspected of harassing a woman who was heading to a mosque
on Monday for evening prayers.
	   Mobs also smashed an army vehicle and injured the driver, an
army major, as well as his wife and son.
	   Lhokseumawe is an oil and gas center that lies 2,100 kilometers
(1,300 miles) northwest of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital. The
city was hit by riots in August that were triggered by resentment
toward the military.

economy

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's top economic official said Tuesday his
country would no longer rely on exports to pull itself out of
recession and was moving quickly with internal reforms, such as
cutting taxes and red tape.
	   Speaking along with Japan's prime minister before a group of
business leaders, Taiichi Sakaiya, said Japan must follow the
example of the robust U.S. economy, which he said is reaping the
benefits from a shrinking of government in the 1980s.
	   ``In that same America where they used to have such big
deficits, they're now debating what to do with their (budget)
surpluses,'' he said. Sakaiya heads the Economic Planning Agency.
	   A necessary step is curtailing government involvement in the
economy, which Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said would lead to
opportunities for creating new industries.
	   ``Entrepreneurship is the basis of economic growth,'' Obuchi
said.
	   Sakaiya said that since taking power in August, Obuchi had also
taken a page from former President Ronald Reagan's economic
policies and sliced the top income bracket to 50 from 65 percent.
He also cut corporate taxes to levels similar to the United States.
	   Combined with massive spending on public works, Sakaiya
predicted the changes would be enough to restore Japan's gross
domestic product to a growth rate of about 0.5 percent next year,
up from this year's contraction of 2.2 percent.
	   ``I have a lot of confidence that growth will become positive,''
he said.

	   At Anaheim, California, Milan Hejduk scored the go-ahead goal
for Colorado and goaltender Craig Billington got the win despite
playing less than two minutes and not facing a shot.
	   Billington replaced Patrick Roy in the nets for a span of 1:52

a power play with Kevin Haller serving a tripping penalty.
	   Roy returned with 20 seconds left in the period. He stopped 27

game as the Avalanche won for the first time in five games and
ended the Mighty Ducks' six-game unbeaten streak.

Dollar higher against yen, Japanese stocks fall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, mid-afternoon currency and bond
prices; ADDS analyst comment in 5th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar surged against the yen Tuesday as
President Bill Clinton appeared able to survive moves to impeach
him. Japanese stocks fell amid concern about the effect of tumbling
bond prices on bank earnings.
	   The dollar bought 117.08 yen in mid-afternoon trading in Tokyo,
up 2.18 yen from late Monday here and above its late New York level
of 116.21 yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average plunged 373.50
points, or 2.64 percent, to close at 13,779.45. On Monday, the
average closed down 41.34 points, or 0.29 percent.
	   Price movements in all markets were exaggerated by the
relatively small number of participants during the holiday season,
forcing sellers to slash prices just to find buyers.
	   ``Amid a thin trade the market is very volatile,'' said Yasuo
Ueki, a general manager at Nikko Securities Co.
	   The dollar recovered recent losses against the yen as Clinton's
continued high popularity ratings helped markets there shrug off
concern about Congress' impeachment proceedings. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average jumped 85.22 points to 8,988.85.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index
of all issues listed on the first section lost 16.66 points, or
1.52 percent, to 1,082.46. The TOPIX closed up 2.58 points, or 0.23
percent, on Monday.
	   Share prices fell as declines in the bond market were seen
hurting one of the few profitable operations at Japan's ailing
banks: their bond trading desks.
	   A prolonged downturn in particular would spell real trouble for
Japanese lenders, said Yushiro Ikuyo, bank analyst at Commerz
Securities in Tokyo.
	   Prices of the most widely watched bond in Japan, the No. 203
10-year Japanese government bond, tumbled to 99.19 yen from
Monday's close of 102.44. That drove up the yield _ which moves in
the opposite direction of the price _ to 1.900 percent from 1.505
percent.
	   Yields are up from historical lows of 0.695 percent just two
months ago.
	   Investors are worried that new bond issues by the Japanese
government to pay for fiscal stimulus spending will cause a glut in
the market, traders said.
	   Making matters worse, investors have been spooked by reports one
of the market's biggest participants, the Ministry of Finance's
trust bureau, may curtail purchases.

Two stray missiles from attack on Iraq landed in Iran, paper says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Two stray missiles from the U.S.-British
attack on Iraq earlier this week fell on the city of Khorramshahr
in southern Iran, the Tehran Times reported Tuesday.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency had previously
reported that only one missile had hit Khorramshahr, about 40
kilometers (25 kilometers) east of Basra in Iraq. The first missile
struck the port city with major oil facilities on Thursday.
	   The paper did not say when the second missile was supposed to
have struck the city.
	   The first missile landed in the city center and damaged several
houses but did not cause any casualties, the paper said.
	   The second missile landed on a highway leading out of the city
and left a two-meter-long (six foot) hole, said the paper.
	   The United States apologized for the incident, said the paper,
which is close to the Foreign Ministry.

Beijing man sentenced to death for meteor shower rape, murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Beijing court has given a death sentence to a
man convicted of raping and murdering a 14-year-old girl who had
stayed out during the pre-dawn hours of Nov. 18 to watch the
Leonids meteor storm, official reports said Tuesday.
	   Pang Delu, a road worker who had served a previous prison
sentence for theft, was found guilty of tricking the girl into
following him into a deserted area and raping her. When she
resisted, he strangled her to death, the Beijing Morning Post and
other local newspapers reported.
	   The Beijing No. 2 Intermediate Court handed down the sentence on
Monday, citing public anger over the crime. Pang also was ordered
to pay the girl's parents 30,000 yuan (dlrs 3,632) in compensation,
the reports said.

Cabinet approves plans to launch spy satellites
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Cabinet officially approved a plan Tuesday
to launch four surveillance satellites by 2002 in an apparent move
to monitor North Korea's weapons program.
	   Proposals for Japan to build a multipurpose spy satellite have
gained momentum since the firing in August of a North Korean
rocket.
	   Defense Agency chief Hosei Norota told a Cabinet meeting Tuesday
that the introduction of a surveillance satellite would be ``very
significant'' by giving Japan its own information-gathering
capability, according to news media.
	   Japan relied on information from the U.S. military to monitor
the Aug. 31 firing of the rocket, which flew over Japan before
landing in the Pacific Ocean.
	   Last week, a Russian news report cited Russian Defense Ministry
officials as saying that North Korea is planning another test.
	   The United States says North Korea has also begun construction
of a suspected underground nuclear-related facility at Keumjang-ri,
40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of the North's main nuclear
complex of Yongbyon.
	   The reclusive communist states says the new facility is for
civilian use and refuses a U.S. demand that it allow unconditional
inspection there.
	   On Monday, the Finance Ministry approved a total of 8.2 billion
yen (dlrs 74.14 million) in research spending on the surveillance
satellite project for next fiscal year, which begins April 1.
	   The sum will include 6.8 billion yen (dlrs 58.6 million) for
technology studies by the Science and Technology Agency, said
agency official Masaaki Nishijo.

Indonesia investigates whether Suharto relative sought Jordanian
</HEADLINE>
citizenship

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - The government said Tuesday it was
investigating a report that a son-in-law of former President
Suharto had sought citizenship in Jordan.
	   Several months ago, military investigators said they might
court-martial former Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto for his alleged role
in the abduction of nine political activists.
	   Prabowo was commander of Indonesia's special forces when the
pro-democracy activists were kidnapped and tortured earlier this
year. He lost his job after the ouster in May of his authoritarian
father-in-law, who was dislodged by riots and protests.
	   Justice Minister Muladi said the government was checking whether
Jordan had offered citizenship to Prabowo, who is viewed as a
villain by many Indonesians.
	   The daily newspaper Kompas reported Tuesday that Jordan had
granted citizenship to Prabowo, a onetime rising star in the
Indonesian military whose career plummeted when Suharto's fortunes
turned.
	   ``The government will have to prevent him from going abroad
because he still has a case to be resolved,'' Muladi said.
	   However, he could not confirm that Prabowo was in Indonesia.
	   An employee at the Jordanian embassy in Jakarta said no one was
available to comment.
	   Suharto's successor and former protege, President B.J. Habibie,
is implementing political reforms and the military has pledged to
clean up its human rights record. Student protesters say the
government is not moving fast enough on democratic change.
	   A military court was scheduled on Wednesday to begin the trial
of 11 members of the special forces who have been accused in the
kidnappings of the activists.

	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ Greg Blewett and Corey Richards smashed
the Australian XI to a nine-wicket victory over England at
Bellerive Oval on Tuesday.
	   Blewett hit 213 and Richards 138 as the Australians made light
of a 376-run target from 78 overs.
	   The pair, who shared an unbroken 345-run stand, reached their
target in the 56th over.
	   England set the target when it declared its second innings on
Tuesday morning at 199-3 just after Mark Butcher completed his
century.
	   In the course of his innings Blewett joined two elite groups of
Australian cricketers.
	   He became only the sixth to pass 1,000 runs before the New Year,
then he became the sixth to score centuries in four successive
first-class innings. (djp)

Company paid millions to move from Olympic site
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A private company was paid 37.9 million
Australian dollars (23 million US dlrs) of taxpayers' money to
relocate from the Olympics site at Homebush Bay, a report said
Tuesday
	   The New South Wales state Auditor-General's annual report said
that the payout came after Ian Armstrong, then state agriculture
minister and now the opposition Olympics spokesman in the
government, extended the company's lease against legal advice in
1989.
	   Auditor-General Tony Harris said Armstrong had approved the
extension by 21 years of a 10-year lease for food processing
company P and S Smallgoods. The lease had originally been due to
expire in September 1995.
	   He said Homebush Bay had been recommended to the government as
the site for the mooted bid for the 1996 Olympic Games in June
1989, the month before Armstrong approved the lease extension on
July 28. Sydney won the right to host the 2000 Games in 1993.
	   Four months before the compensation was agreed to, the Olympic
Coordination Authority (OCA) had four options for dealing with the
site, including building around the site at a cost of up to 10
million Australian dollars (6.2 million US dlrs) and with
substantial disruption to construction and the operation of the
Olympics. (djp)

Police: Fog causes truck to ram house, four killed

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Dense fog caused a truck to run into a
house near the Indian capital of New Delhi, killing two children
and injuring a third child and an adult as they slept, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   Police believe the truck driver, who fled after Monday's
accident in the New Delhi suburb of Faridabad, probably could not
see where he was going, according to The Indian Express.
	   The fog, common across northern India in December, has been
particularly heavy this year, disrupting flight schedules and
slowing rail and road traffic. Conditions have been most dangerous
at night and in the early mornings.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Two stray missiles from the recent
U.S.-British attack on Iraq fell on the city of Khorramshahr in
southern Iran, the Tehran Times reported Tuesday.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency previously reported
that one missile hit Khorramshahr, about 40 kilometers (25
kilometers) east of Basra in Iraq. The first missile struck the
port city with major oil facilities on Thursday.
	   The newspaper did not say when the second missile was supposed
to have struck the city.
	   The first missile landed in the city center and damaged several
houses but did not cause any casualties, the newspaper said.
	   The second missile landed on a highway leading out of the city
and left a 2-meter-long (6- foot) hole, said the paper.
	   The United States apologized for the incident, said the
newspaper, which is close to the Foreign Ministry.

Army no match for Melbourne thieves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Members of the Barmy Army, the
raucous fans who follow the English cricket team around the world,
have lost documentary film footage after a theft at their Melbourne
hostel.
	   The footage and camera equipment worth an estimated 1,550 US
dlrs were in a knapsack stolen from a backpackers hotel in
Melbourne's south.
	   Paul Burnham, 34, of Twickenham, London, said Tuesday the video
cassettes contained footage of test matches and the army's party at
the old jail in Adelaide, held to raise funds for charity.
	   ``We want it to make a movie, documentary type thing,'' he said.
	   ``We are asking if anyone has got it, if it can be left
somewhere because it is no use to them but we can't go back and
play the tests again.''
	   Burnham, who works for a company which bets on sporting events,
said fellow army member Andrew Evans had taken time off his job as
an engineer and was living on his savings while they worked on the
documentary.
	   He said about 50 members of the ``army'' had made the
backpackers hotel their headquarters during their stay in Melbourne
for the Dec. 26 test, the fourth in the Ashes series. (djp)

Evacuated U.N. humanitarian workers head back to Baghdad

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ About 120 U.N. humanitarian workers,
evacuated from Iraq last week during U.S.-British air attacks, left
Amman on Monday to return to the Iraqi capital Baghdad.
	   Before departing, many in the group were smiling and taking
photos of each other in front of the buses that will take them on
the more than 12-hour journey across the desert.
	   ``We are very happy to be going back to take up our work in
Iraq,'' Darleen Biseau said as she boarded one of the three buses
making the journey, along with eight four-wheel-drive cars.
	   The U.N. workers had left the Iraqi capital on the second day of
the airstrikes on Iraq.
	   Biseau, who works on the U.N.-approved oil for food program in
Baghdad, had described her trip to Amman on arrival Saturday as a
journey the U.N. workers made with tears for the people they left
behind. She said the bombardment would add to the suffering of
Iraqis.
	   She said she was ``hoping for the best'' in returning.
	   Abdullah Odeh, resident representative in Amman for the U.N.
Development Program, said all the agency personnel who left Baghdad
except those on holiday leaves were returning to ``pick up the
pieces'' of their work.
	   ``They will continue the mission they are there for, which is
the full humanitarian mission,'' he added.
	   The oil-for-food program is an exception to punishing trade
sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait. It allows Iraq to sell limited quantities of
oil to buy needed food and medicine for its 22 million people.
	   Most of the U.N. workers departing Amman refused to talk to
reporters.
	   The workers were evacuated after spending the first night of the
airstrikes last Thursday huddled in their headquarters on the
outskirts of Baghdad.
	   Those who had remained in Baghdad were special U.N. envoy
Prakash Shah, U.N. humanitarian coordinator Hans von Sponeck, and
26 other U.N. workers.

65 hospital workers in Russian Far East start hunger strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than 60 workers at a hospital in Russia's Far
East went on a hunger strike Tuesday to demand months of back pay,
a news report said.
	   The 64 hospital employees in the remote village of Plastun have
not been paid in nine months, but will continue to treat patients
under their care, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The report gave no other details about the strike.
	   Plastun is located about 6,600 kilometers (4,100 miles) east of
Moscow on Russia's Pacific coastline.
	   Millions of workers receive their salaries months late in
Russia, part of a cycle of non-payments that plagues the Russian
economy.
	   But the situation is particularly bad in the country's far flung
regions, where impoverished local governments are much more
dependent on dwindling federal subsidies.

Police: Holy retreat turned into pornography production house
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAIDEEP MAZUMDAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Twelve people have been arrested for
turning what began as a spiritual retreat in one of northern
India's holiest cities into a pornography production house, police
said Tuesday.
	   Residents of Mathura staged a protest as the 12 were brought to
court Tuesday, two days after their arrest. The suspects, accused
of duping and blackmailing women into acting in pornographic films
as well as distributing the materials, were ordered held pending
completion of the police investigation. They face up to 10 years
imprisonment.
	   The faithful believe the Hindu god Krishna was born in Mathura,
140 kilometers (87 miles) southeast of New Delhi.
	   Police say disciples of a holy man known as Baba Krishna Das
have been producing pornographic photographs and videos for the
past two years in what was originally an ashram, or spiritual
retreat, established in Mathura three years ago. Das escaped arrest
but was being pursued.
	   ``The ashram inmates have confessed to filming scores of such
blue films and supplying hundreds of photographs to buyers,'' said
Deputy Superintendent of Police R.K. Shastri. ``They have also
admitted that Baba Krishna Das was the mastermind behind the whole
racket.''
	   Shastri said women would be lured to the ashram, where they
would be drugged, stripped and photographed. The nude photos would
be used to blackmail the women into posing for more photos or
performing sexual acts with ashram members before video camers.
	   After a series of raids on video cassette libraries in recent
months, police traced pornographic materials to Mathura. A police
officer posing as a pornographic movie distributor approached Das'
head disciple, known only as Devdas, and struck a deal.
	   Devdas was arrested Sunday when he handed over two cassettes and
several photographs. Eleven others were arrested in a subsequent
raid.
	   ``Since Baba Krishna Das was away on his morning walk at that
time, we could not arrest him,'' Shastri said.

Defense alleges star prosecution witness a spurned lover
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with prosecution accusing witness of taking bribes
from politicians to smear Anwar; ADDS photo numbers.

 &UR; By R. MAGESWARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Lawyers defending Anwar Ibrahim on
Tuesday accused the prosecution's star witness of taking bribes and
acting in a jealous rage because the former deputy prime minister
spurned her overtures.
	   ``I put it to you that you had confessed to a number of people
that you were crazy about Dato Seri Anwar Ibrahim,'' Christopher
Fernando, the lawyer, asked of Ummi Hafilda Ali.
	   The 31-year-old advertising executive, who claims Anwar had
sexual relations with her brother's wife, glowered as Fernando
persisted in this line of cross examination.
	   ``Did you write a few love letters to Dato Seri Anwar Ibrahim?''
he asked.
	   ``I think I can sue you for making such an allegation,'' Ummi
retorted, before denying the claim.
	   Ummi sent a letter to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad last year
that set off an avalanche of events leading to Anwar's firing and
arrest in September.
	   Ummi alleged that Anwar, 51, was sleeping with her
sister-in-law. Anwar's lawyer alleged Ummi was just jealous.
	   She also helped a driver in the Anwar household, to come forward
with allegations that he had been repeatedly sodomized by the
politician.
	   Fernando accused her of taking money from politicians opposed to
Anwar in return for making false allegations.
	   ``I put it to you that you were the one who cheated the nation
for money,'' Fernando told Ummi. ``You have sold your soul.''
	   She denied the allegation, but admitted to giving copies of her
letter to Mahathir to two senior Cabinet ministers.
	   The defense also asked if Ummi's advertising company, Karisma,
was winning huge government contracts. She admitted to getting
large contracts and said she was negotiating for the advertising
account of the company that manages the Kuala Lumpur International
Airport.
	   Anwar has said he was a victim of a political conspiracy. He is
now being tried for four counts of corruption and a separate trial
for another corruption charge and five illegal sex acts charges
will follow.
	   When the cross-examination delved further into Ummi's alleged
passion for Anwar, there were snickers and giggles from the public
gallery, though trial judge Augustine Paul was not amused.
	   ``I think this line of questioning should be properly backed up,
otherwise it is highly scandalous,'' Paul said.
	   But when the chief prosecutor later objected, the judge allowed
Fernando's questions.
	   Fernando dove further by asking if she kept a picture of Anwar
on her pillow.
	   She denied having a photo of Anwar in her room but admitted to
carrying a picture of Anwar, herself and her sister-in-law in her
purse.
	   Ummi had retracted all the allegations she made against Anwar
last year.
	   But on Monday, she testified that her original allegations were
true and that police had threatened to send her to jail for two
years if she didn't retract them. Prosecutors say the police had
acted at the behest of Anwar.
	   Her cross-examination resumes Wednesday.

	   Navy Lt. Kendra Williams, 26, flew her FA-18 fighter-bomber as
part of the attack force launched from the aircraft carrier USS
Enterprise in the Gulf.
	   Williams, who was raised in Anchorage, Alaska, was among the
first group of women allowed to train for fighter duty, military
officials said Tuesday. She graduated from jet training at the
Naval Air Station in Kingsville, Texas, in 1997.
	   ``Women have only been in combat aviation a few years,'' she
said last year. ``It's going to take time for people to adjust.''
	   Women have been flying U.S. military helicopters since 1973. But
they are still excluded from ground combat units.
	   In Israel, six women completed training last month to become the
country's first front-line female combat soldiers.

Evacuated U.N. humanitarian workers head back to Baghdad

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ About 120 U.N. humanitarian workers,
evacuated from Iraq last week during U.S.-British air attacks, left
Amman on Tuesday to return to Baghdad.
	   Before departing for the Iraqi capital, many in the group were
smiling and taking photos of one another in front of the buses that
will take them on the more than 12-hour journey across the desert.
	   ``We are very happy to be going back to take up our work in
Iraq,'' Darleen Biseau said as she boarded one of the three buses
that will make the trip along with eight four-wheel-drive cars.
	   The U.N. workers left Baghdad on the second day of airstrikes
against Iraq.
	   Biseau, who works on the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program in
Baghdad, had described her evacuation to Amman as a journey that
U.N. workers made with tears for the people they left behind. She
said the bombardment would add to the suffering of Iraqis.
	   She said she was ``hoping for the best'' in returning.
	   Abdullah Odeh, resident representative in Amman for the U.N.
Development Program, said all the agency personnel who left Baghdad
except those on holiday leaves were returning to ``pick up the
pieces'' of their work.
	   ``They will continue the mission they are there for, which is
the full humanitarian mission,'' he added.
	   The oil-for-food program is an exception to punishing trade
sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait. It allows Iraq to sell limited quantities of
oil to buy needed food and medicine for its 22 million people.
	   Most of the U.N. workers departing Amman refused to talk to
reporters.
	   The workers were evacuated after spending the first night of the
airstrikes last Thursday huddled in their headquarters on the
outskirts of Baghdad.
	   Those who had remained in Baghdad were special U.N. envoy
Prakash Shah, U.N. humanitarian coordinator Hans von Sponeck, and
26 other U.N. workers.

China tells balloon team to head south

	   LONDON (AP) _ Three men hoping to be the first to circle the
world by balloon were still aloft Tuesday despite crossing into
Chinese air space without permission, which initially prompted
fears that their adventure would be forced to come to an early end.
	   The Chinese Foreign Ministry expressed regret that the
balloonists did not abide by an earlier agreement to fly over
southernmost China below 26 degrees north latitude. But while
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said Tuesday that China
could not agree to the balloon's current course, he did not call on
the three-man crew to withdraw immediately or land.
	   ''China is very regretful,'' Zhu said at a routine media
briefing. ''China will not take responsibility for the
consequences.''
	   The balloon's support team in London said they were making every
effort to comply with China's demands and fly south, but were being
hampered by slow winds.
	   Piloted by British tycoon Richard Branson, American Steve
Fossett and Sweden's Per Linstrand, the balloon crossed from Nepal
into Chinese-ruled Tibet late Monday.
	   Beijing had given permission for the ICO Global balloon to
travel only over southernmost China. It would have effectively kept
the balloonists away from the isolated Tibetan plateau, where
rescue would be difficult, and out of busy air traffic corridors
monitored by a spotty air traffic control system.
	   But because of diversions around Mediterranean storms and Iraq,
the balloon crossed the Himalayas further north than planned and
entered China 250 miles (400 kms) north of the agreed airspace
corridor.
	   Project director Mike Kendrick said Chinese air traffic
controllers were informed the moment the balloon passed over the
border, with an apology added to the communication. The balloon
team continued to contact them every 15 minutes to keep the Chinese
informed about their position.
	   ``A balloon goes wherever the wind takes it,'' project manager
David Partridge said Tuesday. ``Unfortunately, it took us where we
weren't supposed to go. But we are basically using our best
endeavors to get further south.''
	   An official at the British Embassy, speaking with customary
anonymity, said the Chinese recognize that the balloon can't be
turned around quickly.
	   In February, China withheld permission for a European balloon
team to fly through its airspace, forcing them to land and end
their around-the-world bid.
	   As it became apparent early Monday that the balloon would
inevitably cross into unauthorized Chinese territory, frantic
diplomatic negotiations were launched by the British government.
Prime Minister Tony Blair sent a message to Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji asking for China's help, the British embassy official said.
	   The ICO Global balloon had already run into trouble on its trip.
Libya unexpectedly revoked permission to enter its airspace, but
the situation was resolved shortly before the three-man crew flew
over the country on Saturday.
	   Then, in conditions marred by thunderstorms, the crew had to
maneuver the 270-foot (82-meter) craft through narrow gaps between
no-fly territories, including war-torn Iraq.
	   On Monday night, the crew were flying through some of the
world's highest peaks, where landing _ if China demands it _ would
be dangerous and difficult. Landing also would mean an end to their
bid.
	   The crew members estimate the trip could last from eight days to
nearly three weeks. They hope to touch down somewhere in western
Europe at the end of a 24,000-mile (38,000 kms) flight, which will
take them over India, the South China sea, the Pacific and the
United States.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.

China sentences third leader of would-be democracy party

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Shouting contempt for his summary trial, a
Chinese dissident was sentenced to 12 years in prison Tuesday,
becoming the third organizer of a would-be opposition party
convicted in two days.
	   The heavy sentence given to Qin Yongmin fell predictably in line
with the severe verdicts issued Monday to fellow China Democracy
Party leaders: 13 years for Xu Wenli and 11 for Wang Youcai.
	   Tried in different cities, the three were accused of the same
crime, the subversion of China's Communist Party-led system, for
the same act, trying to set up the China Democracy Party.
	   Their quick trials and harsh punishments showed how firmly the
Communist Party draws the line at open opposition. Their treatment
also undermined China's attempts to burnish its international
reputation by signing U.N. rights treaties and nudging its legal
system closer to international standards.
	   ``This is a travesty of justice. Xu Wenli, Wang Youcai, Qin
Yongmin and others are not attempting to subvert the Chinese
government. They are simply trying to hold the government
accountable to its people,'' said Xiao Qiang of New York-based
Human Rights in China.
	   The Intermediate People's Court in the central city of Wuhan
took 40 minutes to sentence Qin, five days after his 2 1/2-hour
trial, his brother Qin Xiaoguang and fellow dissidents said.
	   In a near repeat of the verdicts issued against Xu and Wang,
judges ruled that Qin planned to ``overthrow the socialist system''
by organizing the China Democracy Party, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported.
	   Denied entry to the courtroom because he was five minutes late,
Qin's brother yelled to Qin as guards led him down the hallway
afterwards: ```Qin Yongmin, what was the crime? What was the
sentence?' He shouted back `twelve years.'''
	   ```I'm not going to appeal. I have contempt for this court,'''
Qin Yongmin said as he was being led away, the brother recounted.
	   Qin's defiance echoed Xu's at his half-day trial in Beijing
Monday.
	   Xu told the court, ```I'm willing to use the sacrifice of myself
to promote democracy in China. I'm not one who encourages a
struggle and then just lets others shed their blood,''' his wife,
He Xintong, said late Monday.
	   China defended the convictions, saying the dissidents broke the
laws on subversion and infringed upon the rights of the state and
other citizens.
	   ``Xu was punished not for his political ideas, but for his
subversive crimes,'' Xinhua said in a commentary Tuesday. ``Those
who ignore his crimes but accuse the Chinese judiciary of
`suppressing the dissidents' are misleading the international
community and deliberately throwing mud at China.''
	   With Qin, Xu and Wang _ the most influential members of the
China Democracy Party _ heading to prison, Chinese authorities
appear to be focusing their crackdown, now in its fourth week, on
the group's second-tier leaders.
	   Police in Hangzhou city in eastern China took away party member
Wu Yilong on Monday night, a Hong Kong-based rights group reported.
	   In the Hangzhou court's verdict against Wang on Monday, judges
identified Wu and Zhu Zhengming, who was detained a week ago, as
important party members, the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China reported.
	   Police in Wuhan also detained at least two colleagues of Qin's
Monday night to prevent them from demonstrating outside the
courthouse Tuesday, one of the pair, Chen Zhonghe said.
	   Wang Youcai, 32, was a student leader in the 1989 Tiananmen
Square demonstrations who declared the formation of the opposition
group in June.
	   Qin, 45 and a Democracy Wall veteran, has spent about a decade
in prison. He tried to set up an independent human rights
monitoring group in addition to organizing the China Democracy
Party.
	   Xu, 55, was known as an effective organizer and a moderating
voice. He earlier served 12 years in prison _ much of it in
solitary confinement _ for his involvement in the Democracy Wall
movement of the late 1970s.
	   Their efforts drew enough support that in six months activists
tried to set up branches of the China Democracy Party in 14
provinces and cities.
	   In Washington, the State Department called on Chinese
authorities to release the men immediately.
	   ``This form of peaceful political expression deserves the
protection of all governments,'' said Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott. ``We not only deplore that they were detained and
tried for such actions but are deeply disturbed by the long
sentences imposed and the lack of due process.''

U.N. diplomat meets Indonesian president on East Timor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie on Tuesday
thanked a United Nations envoy for his efforts to end the bitter
conflict in Indonesian-controlled East Timor.
	   U.N. diplomat Jamsheed Marker spent more than an hour with
Habibie, who has adopted a more conciliatory approach on East Timor
than his authoritarian predecessor, Suharto.
	   Peace talks on the former Portuguese colony have gained momentum
since Suharto quit in May amid riots and protests against his
32-year rule. In 1975, Suharto ordered an invasion of East Timor
and annexed the territory a year later.
	   Habibie has offered autonomy in exchange for international
recognition of Indonesian sovereignty, but East Timorese
separatists say an autonomy deal should be transitional prior to a
vote on independence.
	   A new round of U.N.-sponsored talks between Indonesia and
Portugal is scheduled next month in New York. The United Nations
considers Portugal to be the administering power in East Timor.
	   ``President Habibie expressed his gratitude to the efforts made
by the United Nations to resolve the East Timorese problem,''
Marker said after the meeting.
	   ``I have been certainly encouraged by his understanding of the
problems and the difficulties,'' said Marker, who met pro- and
anti-independence leaders in East Timor this past weekend.
	   ``We are progressing although it is not an easy matter,'' said
Marker. He was scheduled to leave Indonesia on Wednesday.
	   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas met separately with Marker and then
accompanied him to the meeting with Habibie at the state palace. He
said Indonesia would push for a negotiated solution.
	   ``Indonesia will continue as it is committed to proceed with the
process of negotiations under the auspices of the U.N.
Secretary-General,'' Alatas said.
	   After several months of relative calm, sporadic fighting between
separatist guerrillas has resumed and recent separatist rallies
have raised fears of confrontations with Indonesian soldiers.
	   On Sunday, protesters tore down a fence at the commercial
airport in the East Timorese capital of Dili and pushed past
soldiers as they tried in vain to speak to Marker as he left.

Chief of European Central Bank taking tips from Greenspan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Wim Duisenberg understands the
power of words. One offhand remark can send stocks soaring or make
financial markets tremble.
	   So when the new president of the European Central Bank was
looking for tips of the trade, he went straight to the man who
knows it best: Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
	   ``I have to be extremely careful and guarded in my use of
language,'' Duisenberg said in a recent interview. ``Greenspan
understands that like nobody else. I can learn a lot from him. I've
already spoken to him about it.''
	   The Dutch call him ``Wim II,'' Prime Minister Wim Kok being Wim
I. But Duisenberg has a new nickname these days _ ``Europe's
Greenspan.''
	   On Jan. 1, with the historic launch of the European Union's
common currency, the lanky Dutchman with the shock of white hair
arguably will become the world's second most powerful central
banker after Greenspan himself.
	   Although the euro debuts on paper at the first of the year, euro
coins and notes won't go into circulation in the 11 participating
nations until Jan. 1, 2002. As chief of the powerful European
Central Bank, it is Duisenberg's job to preside over the
transition.
	   Despite the comparison with Greenspan, analysts say only time
will tell whether Duisenberg _ a former Dutch finance minister and
ex-head of the Netherlands' central bank _ will have the same power
and influence to move global financial markets.
	   ``We base our U.S. interest rate predictions totally on
Greenspan's words,'' Ellen van der Gullik of the merchant bank J.P.
Morgan told the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant. ``But for the euro
zone we don't listen exclusively to Duisenberg.''
	   Although Duisenberg is the European Central Bank's president, he
has only one vote on its board of 17, which is made up of
representatives of the 11 nations taking part in the monetary union
and six directors.
	   But the chain-smoking golf lover with the decidedly low profile
remains a potent figurehead, bearing overall responsibility for
price stability in the vast euro zone and overseeing monetary
policy.
	   His bank flexed its muscle for the first time Dec. 3, when all
11 euro countries except Italy cut their base interest rates to 3
percent in a move that took financial markets by surprise.
	   Duisenberg, in a carefully chosen reaction that Greenspan would
have been proud of, described the rate cut as ``rather
sensational.''
	   A member of the center-left Dutch Labor Party, Duisenberg rose
to prominence first as finance minister in the 1970s and later as
president of the Dutch Central Bank. His 16-year reign there is
widely credited with helping turn the Dutch guilder into one of
Europe's strongest currencies, ushering in a period of price
stability and pushing down interest rates.
	   Despite his impressive track record and the backing of most EU
leaders, Duisenberg's path to the 35th floor of the European
Central Bank headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany, was far from
untroubled.
	   After serving as president of the bank's forerunner, the
European Monetary Institute, he was widely expected to become the
ECB's first leader. Then France proposed a rival candidate: its
central banker, Jean-Claude Trichet, ironically a good friend of
Duisenberg's.
	   Although Duisenberg, 63, eventually was elected for a full
eight-year term, the quarrel marred a moment of European history.
	   Immediately after his appointment, it was announced that
Duisenberg would step down after four years under a ``gentleman's
agreement'' brokered to end the rancorous row over who should get
the job.
	   Duisenberg since has stated that no such agreement exists. And
he is adamant that a four-year appointment violates the Maastricht
Treaty, the 1992 blueprint for monetary union that calls for an
independent central bank.
	   Controversy aside, he'll always have Paris _ in September,
France inducted him into the coveted Legion of Honor, its highest
tribute.

Europe's new central bank meant creation of new institutions

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The launch of the European Union's
single currency has required new institutions to manage the
historic project.
	   The European Central Bank will set monetary policy for the 11
nations taking part in the euro starting Jan. 1. It is housed in a
silver skyscraper in the heart of Frankfurt, Germany's traditional
banking capital.
	   The bank's key aim is to maintain price stability, a mandate
written into the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which provided the
blueprint for the single currency.
	   The treaty also guaranteed the ECB independence, and it is
widely expected to guard it fiercely. The bank, with a staff of
520, will work to support the economic policies of EU nations but
not at the expense of price stability.
	   The European Central Bank is the core of a group of European
central banks behind the economic and monetary union, called the
European System of Central Banks.
	   Central banks of all 15 EU members are in the system, including
the four initially not participating in the euro launch: Britain,
Denmark, Greece and Sweden.
	   Chiefs of the national banks from each of the 11 euro countries
will travel to Frankfurt twice a month to debate and decide common
policies. National central banks will not be scrapped _ they simply
lose independent policy-making power.
	   The European Central Bank has a 17-member governing council,
composed of the 11 national banks' chiefs plus a six-member
executive board. Wim Duisenberg, a former Dutch central banker, is
president of both; his deputy is Christian Noyer of France.
	   Duisenberg, Noyer and four other banking or finance
professionals nominated by their governments sit on the executive
board, which carries out day-to-day management.
	   The ECB will set interest rates in the euro zone, define and
implement monetary policy, conduct foreign exchange operations and
manage the official foreign reserves of member nations.
	   The national central banks will transfer part of their reserves
to the ECB on Jan. 1. The ECB's total reserves will amount to 50
billion euros, or close to dlrs 60 billion. Although the euro rate
will not be set until Dec. 31, one euro is expected to be about
dlrs 1.17.
	   The ECB also has a general council, which will allow the four
central bankers from the EU countries not joining the euro to
discuss decisions that will affect their economies. It will be
dissolved once all EU nations join the euro.

Japanese stocks plunge, driving up dollar against yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with closing bond, late afternoon currency
prices; ADDS analyst comment in 8th graf
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks plunged Tuesday amid concern about
damage to bank earnings from tumbling bond prices. The rout spilled
over into the currency market, driving the yen lower against the
U.S. dollar.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 373.50
points, or 2.64 percent, to close at 13,779.45 _ its lowest close
since Oct. 30. On Monday, the average closed down 41.34 points, or
0.29 percent.
	   The dollar bought 117.08 yen in late afternoon trading in Tokyo,
up 2.18 yen from late Monday here and above its late New York level
of 116.21 yen.
	   Price movements in all markets were exaggerated by the
relatively small number of participants during the holiday season,
forcing sellers to slash prices to find buyers.
	   ``Amid a thin trade the market is very volatile,'' said Yasuo
Ueki, a general manager at Nikko Securities Co.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, volume was a moderate 362 million
shares, up from 246 million Monday. Declining shares outnumbered
risers almost three to one.
	   Share prices fell as declines in the bond market were seen
hurting one of the few profitable operations at Japan's ailing
banks: their bond trading business.
	   ``The bond market's sharp fall was the major negative factor in
the stock market,'' said Keiko Kondo, an analyst at Merrill Lynch
Japan.
	   That drove the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues
listed on the first section down 16.66 points, or 1.52 percent, to
1,082.46. The TOPIX closed up 2.58 points, or 0.23 percent, on
Monday.
	   The price of the most widely watched bond in Japan, the No. 203
10-year Japanese government bond, tumbled to 99.19 yen from
Monday's close of 102.44. That drove up the yield _ which moves in
the opposite direction of the price _ to 1.900 percent from 1.505
percent.
	   Yields are up from historical lows of 0.695 percent just two
months ago.
	   Investors are worried that new bond issues by the Japanese
government to pay for fiscal stimulus spending will cause a glut in
the market, traders said.
	   Prices also took a tumble after Japan's finance minister said
the ministry's trust bureau, one of the biggest market
participants, will cease its monthly purchases in January.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar recovered recent losses against the yen as
currency market participants followed the stock and bond markets'
lead in selling Japanese assets.
	   The dollar started trading as low as 115.67 yen but skyrocketed
to a high for the day of 117.45 yen as falling stock prices spooked
traders into dumping yen.
	   The triple decline by stocks, bonds and the yen ``shows the
worst tendency of Japanese investors,'' said Ryohei Muramatsu,
chief foreign exchange manager at Commerzbank in Tokyo.
	   ``When they buy, they all buy together, and when they sell, they
all sell together. That's all there is to it,'' he said.

New York museum to return Buddha statue missing from India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A 600-year-old Buddha statue that
disappeared 10 years ago from an Indian religious retreat will be
returned by a New York museum that bought the antique, a domestic
news agency reported Tuesday.
	   Authorities at the Metropolitan Museum of Art agreed to return
the statue, which they bought for dlrs 50,000 eight years ago,
Press Trust of India news agency reported quoting R.V.V. Ayyar, the
top official of the Indian government's Culture Ministry.
	   Ayyar met with the museum officials recently following a tip
that the statue from a retreat in Bodhgaya had ended up in New
York. Bodhgaya, where the faithful believe Buddha achieved
enlightenment, is a major Buddhist pilgrimage town 900 kilometers
(560 miles) southeast of New Delhi.
	   The museum agreed to hand over the statue for free to Indian
embassy officials, Ayyar said.
	   The statue will be kept at the National Museum in New Delhi
until police solve the case, he said. Ayyar said it was unclear how
the statue disappeared from the retreat.

Netanyahu ridicules rivals, demands Palestinian guarantees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with fresh Netanyahu, Palestinian
comment, reorganizes and TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opened his
re-election campaign Tuesday by deriding the ``fantasies and
ambitions'' of his political rivals and insisting that the public
will back his tough stance toward the Palestinians.
	   ``We will go to the people and the people will give us the
support to achieve peace with security,'' the prime minister told
Israel radio a day after Israel's parliament voted overwhelmingly
for early elections and rejected Netanyahu's policies toward the
Palestinians.
	   The collapse of the prime minister's governing coalition and the
outset of what is likely to be a nearly 4-month-long election
campaign appeared to put the already ailing Mideast peace process
on hold.
	   That is drawing bitter protest from the Palestinians, who call
the political turmoil an internal Israeli affair and insist Israel
is still bound to the Wye River accord, just as it is to other
pre-existing international agreements.
	   ``It's really unfortunate that the only thing that Mr. Netanyahu
has decided to stop is the peace process with us,'' said chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told the AP on Tuesday. ``I
think this is a very grave development.''
	   The elections are likely to take place by the end of April. In
addition to Netanyahu and Labor Party leader Ehud Barak, a
half-dozen other figures have indicated they will jump into what is
shaping as a wild political free-for-all.
	   Netanyahu brushed aside polls suggesting he would lose by a slim
margin to Barak and by a considerably wider margin to former army
chief of staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, who has indicated his intention
to form a centrist party.
	   ``The fantasies and ambitions of all those who want to be prime
minister _ please. We will allow the voters to decide who needs to
lead the state,'' Netanyahu said in the radio interview. He
predicted he would draw ``utmost, massive'' support from voters
affiliated with his conservative Likud party.
	   Others likely to declare their candidacy include hard-liners
such as Benjamin Begin, the son of the late Prime Minister Menachem
Begin, and Limor Livnat, Netanyahu's communications minister.
Livnat's rumored candidacy has troubled ultra-Orthodox legislators
who question a woman's fitness for leadership.
	   The early elections bill given preliminary approval by lawmakers
on Monday must pass two more parliamentary readings, but Netanyahu
has said he will not try to block its final passage.
	   The unraveling of Netanyahu's coalition began with the signing
of the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace accord two months ago. The
pact's land-for-security provisions infuriated hard-liners who made
up a small but powerful faction in Netanyahu's government.
	   The opposition Labor party promised Netanyahu support as long as
he stuck to the agreement, but that fell apart when he scrapped a
scheduled troop withdrawal from 5 percent of the West Bank after a
wave of anti-Israel violence last month.
	   Netanyahu's conditions to the Palestinians for resuming Israeli
compliance with the Wye accord, presented to lawmakers on Monday,
included: a renunciation of claims to statehood and Jerusalem; a
confiscation of arms; an end to violence and incitement to
violence; and a renunciation of claims that Netanyahu had agreed to
release Palestinians jailed for killings.
	   The prime minister, who remains in his job until the new voting,
repeated accusations Tuesday that the Palestinians are violating
the accord.
	   ``We won't give territory to the Palestinians when they say they
will simply take that territory and will continue the violations
and will decide unilaterally on our future,'' he told Israel radio.
	   Palestinian leaders called on the Israeli public and the Clinton
administration to reject Netanyahu's latest demands and pressure
him to move ahead with the promised handover of West Bank
territory.

Moody's may downgrade carmaker Mazda's credit rating
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moody's Investors Services on Tuesday said it is
reviewing its rating of Japanese automaker Mazda Motor Corp.'s
creditworthiness for a possible downgrade.
	   The New York-based credit rating agency cited the ``the weakened
auto market and the banking system in Japan'' as its reason for
reviewing Mazda's Baa3 senior unsecured long-term debt rating. A
cut would put Mazda's debt in so-called junk bond category.
	   Moody's said it will investigate Mazda's ability to shore up its
finances amid slumping domestic auto demand and heightened
competition among rivals to launch new products.
	   The agency also said it will consider the effectiveness of
Mazda's current restructuring drive and its efforts to improve its
overseas operations and financial performance.
	   Moody's announcement sent Mazda shares 1.4 percent lower to 424
yen (dlrs 3.60) on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
	   Hiroshima-based Mazda is 33.4 percent-owned by America's Ford
Motor Co.

Government upbeat about 1999 economic prospects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines' chief economic
planner on Tuesday expressed optimism the country will post higher
economic growth in 1999 after suffering a slowdown caused by the
Asian financial crisis and a severe drought this year.
	   Next year will be a ``period of further consolidation and
recovery,'' Socio-Economic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla told
reporters at a year-end briefing.
	   The government projects the gross national product to grow
between 0.5 percent and 1.0 percent and gross domestic product to
grow 1.0 percent in 1998, Medalla said.
	   GNP measures a country's total output while GDP excludes the net
factor income from abroad.
	   For 1999, the government targets a GNP growth of 3.0 percent to
3.5 percent while GDP is projected to grow by 2.6 percent to 3.1
percent, Medalla said.
	   Medalla said a resilient service sector and continued consumer
market demand allowed the Philippines to escape a recession in 1998
and elude the various economic problems suffered by its neighbors
due to the regional financial crisis.
	   The probability of recovery in 1999 will be stronger as the
government generates additional foreign financing, including money
from Japan's ``Miyazawa Fund,'' for its deficit of 68.4 billion
pesos (dlrs 1.72 billion), Medalla said.
	   Medalla noted that escaping a recession and implementing crucial
structural reforms will allow the country to speed economic growth.
	   Inflation is expected to ease to between 8 percent and 9 percent
as agricultural production improves and the exchange rate becomes
more stable, he added.
	   Medalla said the government has allotted about 21.4 billion
pesos (dlrs 538.4 million) in new spending to stimulate economic
growth.
	   New revenue measures are expected to help finance the
government's budget next year. These include a road user's tax, a
land user's tax and a motor vehicle's tax.
	   Medalla said the labor front remained ``relatively calm''
throughout 1998 despite a rise in unemployment, while other
countries like Indonesia and South Korea grappled with unrest.
	   The unemployment rate rose to 9.6 percent in October 1998
compared with 7.9 percent for the same month last year.

Netanyahu ridicules rivals, demands Palestinian guarantees

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh Netanyahu, Palestinian comment,
reorganizes. TRIMS. Changes slug to conform with digest &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opened his
re-election campaign Tuesday by deriding the ``fantasies and
ambitions'' of his political rivals and insisting that the public
will back his tough stance toward the Palestinians.
	   ``We will go to the people, and the people will give us the
support to achieve peace with security,'' he told Israel radio a
day after Israel's parliament voted overwhelmingly for early
elections and rejected his policies toward the Palestinians.
	   The collapse of his governing coalition and the outset of what
is likely to be a nearly 4-month-long election campaign appeared to
put the already ailing Mideast peace process on hold.
	   That is drawing bitter protest from the Palestinians, who call
the political turmoil an internal Israeli affair and insist Israel
is still bound to the Wye River accord and any other pre-existing
international agreements.
	   ``It's really unfortunate that the only thing that Mr. Netanyahu
has decided to stop is the peace process with us,'' chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told the AP on Tuesday. ``I
think this is a very grave development.''
	   The elections are likely to take place by the end of April. In
addition to Netanyahu and Labor Party leader Ehud Barak, a
half-dozen other figures have indicated they will jump into what is
shaping as a wild political free-for-all.
	   Meantime, Netanyahu brushed aside polls suggesting he would lose
by a slim margin to Barak and by a considerably wider margin to
former army chief of staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, who has indicated
his intention to form a centrist party.
	   ``The fantasies and ambitions of all those who want to be prime
minister _ please. We will allow the voters to decide who needs to
lead the state,'' Netanyahu said in the radio interview. He
predicted he would draw ``utmost, massive'' support from voters
affiliated with his conservative Likud party.
	   Others likely to declare their candidacy include hard-liners
such as Benjamin Begin, the son of the late Prime Minister Menachem
Begin, and Limor Livnat, Netanyahu's communications minister.
Livnat's rumored candidacy has troubled ultra-Orthodox legislators
who question a woman's fitness for leadership.
	   The early elections bill given preliminary approval by lawmakers
on Monday must pass two more parliamentary readings, but Netanyahu
has said he will not try to block its final passage.
	   The unraveling of Netanyahu's coalition began with the signing
of the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace accord two months ago. The
land-for-security provisions infuriated hard-liners who made up a
small but powerful faction in Netanyahu's government.
	   The opposition Labor party promised Netanyahu support as long as
he stuck to the agreement, but that fell apart when he scrapped a
scheduled troop withdrawal from 5 percent of the West Bank after a
wave of anti-Israel violence last month.
	   Netanyahu's conditions to the Palestinians for resuming Israeli
compliance with the Wye accord, presented to lawmakers on Monday,
included a renunciation of claims to statehood and Jerusalem and
claims that Netanyahu agreed to release Palestinians jailed for
killings; a confiscation of arms; and an end to violence and
incitement to violence.
	   Netanyahu, who remains in his job until the new voting, repeated
accusations Tuesday that the Palestinians are violating the accord.
	   ``We won't give territory to the Palestinians when they say they
will simply take that territory and will continue the violations
and will decide unilaterally on our future,'' he told Israel radio.
	   Palestinian leaders called on the Israeli public and the Clinton
administration to reject Netanyahu's latest demands and pressure
him to move ahead with the promised handover of West Bank
territory.

Israeli warplanes raid suspected guerrilla bases in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) - Israeli warplanes fired rockets on
suspected guerrillas bases facing Israel's occupation zone in south
Lebanon on Tuesday, Lebanese security officials said.
	   The attack targeted the wooded hills near Maidoun in the western
Bekaa Valley, three kilometers (two miles) northeast of the
occupied enclave, the officials said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Two Israeli jets fired four rockets at 9:30 a.m. (0730gmt) on
the area where guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah
guerrillas are active, they said.
	   The air attack came after the guerrillas exchanged fire with
Israeli troops and their allies of the South Lebanon Army militia,
the officials added.
	   An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem said the Israeli pilots
scored direct hit and returned safely to their base.
	   No casualties or damage were reported from the air attack or the
ground fighting.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is trying to oust Israeli troops
and their militia allies from the so-called security zone that
Israel established in 1985 to protect its northern towns against
guerrilla attacks.

SAfrica: Teachers, pupils with HIV must be allowed in school
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Students and teachers infected
with the AIDS virus must be allowed to attend school and keep their
jobs, an education department spokesman said on Tuesday.
	   Though South Africa's constitution already defends such rights,
the government has recently drawn up policy protecting the 3
million South Africans with the HIV virus or AIDS from being
discriminated against in education.
	   ``This is a national policy to protect the rights of individuals
with AIDS,'' Bheki Khumalo said.
	   South Africa's AIDS epidemic is one of the fastest growing in
Africa, and every day 1,500 South Africans are infected. Sufferers
often become outcasts in society and lose their jobs.
	   The policy document concludes there is an ``insignificant risk''
of spreading the disease in schools and universities. It also
prohibits mandatory testing for pupils and teachers and AIDS
sufferers cannot be forced to disclose they have the virus.
	   ``Learners and students with HIV/AIDS should lead as full a life
as possible and should not be denied the opportunity to receive an
education,'' it said.
	   Where students are too ill to travel to classes, they should be
allowed to study at home, the document recommends.

Athens' street children avoid lights at Christmas

 &UR; With Greece-Kids-Help &QL;

 &UR; By DEREK GATOPOULOS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The area around Iasonos Street draws its
name from the factories that once produced fashionable silk, or
``metaxi.''
	   After the silk factories closed decades ago, brothels and
tumble-down rooming houses took over the street.
	   Now, money is being made another way in the Metaxourgio.
	   ``Traffic light kids'' skip school to support their families by
selling paper handkerchiefs, bread rings or flowers. Others clean
windshields for spare change.
	   The window-high faces pleading for money are no longer a
surprise in Athens, a city now struggling with the problems of
immigration and entrenched poverty that befell other European
cities years ago.
	   But Greek officials have taken unusual _ and some say improper _
measures to clear the children from the streets.
	   Police have begun discreetly ``gathering'' the kids in a
government operation aimed at cracking down on child exploitation
and stopping the proliferation of young beggars.
	   Authorities claim the sweep is intended to protect the estimated
2,000 traffic light kids in Athens. But critics, including some
newspapers, fear the roundup tramples civil rights and could wrench
apart the families of illegal immigrants.
	   The first 29 children, mostly Albanians, were picked up Dec. 10
and placed in one of two shelters. Three parents were arrested.
	   ``This phenomenon of children begging at traffic lights has
taken on worrying dimensions,'' Public Order Minister Philipos
Petsalnikos told reporters.
	   Under the new government program, begging children will be
picked up and taken to the shelters. Police will attempt to trace
their families. If they are not found or their parents are
determined to be unfit, the children will be transferred to the
Greek welfare system, which could include being placed in
orphanages or foster families.
	   Doubts have emerged over motives of the measures.
	   ``If our problem is simply one of appearance _ that deep down we
want to clear the streets of the ugliness of poverty _ then ... the
problem will not be solved,'' wrote columnist Pantelis Boukalas in
the respected daily Kathimerini.
	   Petsalnikos denied charges that the government was more
interested in buffing the city's image than helping the children.
``This is not a pogrom,'' he argued.
	   The government was prompted to take action by the fate of two
Albanian children in November.
	   Clodiana Gili, 12, was killed by a cement truck on her first day
selling at a traffic light, where she had gone to join her brothers
and sisters.
	   The next day, an 8-year-old boy, Sait, was sent back to the
Albanian capital Tirana to be reunited with his mother. He claimed
that he had been snatched in Albania by a gang that exploits young
children.
	   Theodoros Kotsonis, the deputy welfare minister, blamed the
surge in begging on Greece's massive illegal migration. Hundreds of
thousands of people attempt to sneak into Greece each year across
its northern borders or reach the Aegean islands from Turkey.
	   Officials say most of the Greek street beggars are gypsies or
members of the 120,000-strong Muslim minority in northern Greece.
Their families moved to cities when factory and farm jobs dried up
or as part of periodic government efforts to ``integrate'' them in
society.
	   The wave of illegal immigration following the collapse of the
Soviet bloc brought a new underclass to Greek streets.
	   According to conservative estimates, more than 500,000 illegal
migrants live in this country of 10.2 million people.
	   ``Begging had dropped to a minimum in Greece by the end of the
1980s. This problem is largely imported,'' said Kotsonis.
	   He ruled out direct financial support to the families of traffic
light kids.
	   ``If we do this, all of Russia, Ukraine, all of the Balkans,
Africa and Asia will gather here,'' he said. ``All the desperate
millions of the world,'' But he insisted the street kid shelter
program could expand if needed.
	   Some activists have raised alarms about the growing use of
children as low-cost labor or sympathy-arousing beggars in some
corners of Europe.
	   ``Children are taken from their families to work in Greece,
Italy and southern France, where they are controlled by adults,''
said Nick Senton of Child Hope UK, a London-based organization
helping street kids in Albania and eastern Europe.
	   He said desperate families have sold their children to rings for
up to dlrs 1,000 _ higher than the average annual income. ``To send
them back would be dangerous,'' Senton said. ``Unless the families
are financially supported, they are going to recycle the kids
again.''
	   Social Worker Myrto Lemou contends that rounding up the traffic
light kids is not the answer.
	   ``They are going to collect the children off the streets. But
what will they do if they have no other way of living?'' she says.
``Will they steal? Will they peddle drugs? They have to do
something. No one cares about them.''
	   Ms. Lemou argues that street kids and the families they support
are caught in a poverty trap: Children grow up with no skills,
marry in their teens, have too many children and stay poor. The
fact that younger kids draw greater sympathy and make more money,
compounds the problem.
	   Young girls can make up to dlrs 100 a day selling roses,
activists say. Boys typically make less.
	   ``It is not such a bad thing to sell flowers. What is tragic is
that they miss school. They cannot read,'' said Ms. Lemou. ``They
are lost. They have no skills. They pick a pencil and they can't
form a letter. Many of them just want to learn how to write their
name.''

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Nikos sits in a corner, learning to keep a
steady hand while forming letters of the Greek alphabet.
	   The 9-year-old boy has a short attention span, struggling with
skills that he should have learned in school. He soon moves off to
play.
	   Nikos is one of dozens of ``traffic light kids'' the teaching
center is trying to help. The volunteers running the center are
trying to reach out, gently, to children targeted in an official
roundup that might separate them forcibly from their families.
	   Police are gathering street children in an effort to curb child
exploitation and begging. Critics fear the operation could tear
apart families of illegal immigrants by placing some children in
orphanages or with foster parents.
	   Inside the learning center, children speak a jumble of
languages: Greek, Turkish and Albanian and Gypsy dialects. They
talk about everything except what they do for a living: begging or
selling trinkets at traffic lights.
	   It all goes on in one small room, two flights up from a
garbage-strewn street surrounded by brothels. Domestic quarrels can
frequently be heard from nearby apartments.
	   ``I like it here. That's why I come,'' says Dimluko, a
16-year-old boy with intense eyes and greasy hair parted down the
middle.
	   Children like Dimluko and Nikos visit the center between morning
and night ``shifts'' of work to help their families.
	   The center opens at 11 a.m. It's busiest on rainy days when the
trade at traffic lights is slow.
	   The center has enrolled 87 children in elementary schools this
year and helps families qualify for government benefits instead of
sending their children out to work on the streets.
	   ``We try to teach them the basics of reading and writing and
some arithmetic, so they can read a street sign or understand
something written,'' says Evanthia Constanopoulou, a volunteer at
the center.
	   ``But they are still kids,'' she said. ``We try and help them
find their identity as children _ to draw, to write to play _ to
feel like kids.''

China tells balloon team to head south
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for PMs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ China urged a round-the-world balloon expedition
to get back on its permitted course Tuesday, but took no action to
force three apologetic adventurers to land.
	   The Chinese Foreign Ministry said it regretted that British
tycoon Richard Branson, American millionaire Steve Fossett and Per
Lindstrand of Sweden to not abide by an earlier agreement to fly
over southernmost China below 26 degrees north latitude.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said Tuesday that China
could not agree to the balloon's current northerly course, but he
did not call on the crew to withdraw immediately or land.
	   Organizers of the expedition apologized, said they were trying
to head south as quickly as wind and weather permitted _ which is
about 50 mph (80 kmh). They said the balloon was forced off course
by storms, the U.S.-British military campaign in Iraq and the
refusal of two other countries to permit their flight.
	   ``China is very regretful,'' Zhu said at a routine media
briefing. ``China will not take responsibility for the
consequences.''
	   ``We don't want to be there either,'' project director Mike
Kendrick said in London, ``but the winds have taken us there, and
there isn't much we can do. We don't have permission, and they're
entitled to tell us to get out.''
	   Beijing had given permission for the ICO Global balloon to
travel only over southernmost China. It would have effectively kept
the balloonists away from the isolated Tibetan plateau, where
rescue would be difficult, and out of busy air traffic corridors
monitored by a spotty air traffic control system.
	   But because of diversions around Mediterranean storms and Iraq,
and the refusal of Russia and Iran to open their airspace, the
balloon crossed the Himalayas further north than planned and
entered China 250 miles (400 kms) north of the agreed airspace
corridor early Tuesday morning, Chinese time.
	   Kendrick said Chinese air traffic controllers were informed the
moment the balloon passed over the border, with an apology added to
the communication. The balloon team continued to contact them every
15 minutes to keep the Chinese informed about their position.
	   In February, China withheld permission for a European balloon
team to fly through its airspace, forcing them to land and end
their around-the-world bid.
	   As it became apparent early Monday that the balloon would
inevitably cross into unauthorized Chinese territory, Prime
Minister Tony Blair sent a message to Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
asking for China's help.
	   The ICO Global balloon had already run into trouble on its trip.
Libya unexpectedly revoked permission to enter its airspace, but
the situation was resolved shortly before the three-man crew flew
over the country on Saturday.
	   Then, after steering around thunderstorms near Cyprus, the crew
had to maneuver the 270-foot (82-meter) craft through narrow gaps
between no-fly territories, including Iraq.
	   The crew members estimate the trip could last from eight days to
nearly three weeks. They hope to touch down somewhere in western
Europe at the end of a 24,000-mile (38,000 kms) flight, which will
take them over India, the South China sea, the Pacific and the
United States.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's top economic official said Tuesday his
country would no longer rely on exports to pull itself out of
recession and was moving quickly with internal reforms, such as
cutting taxes and red tape.
	   Speaking along with Japan's prime minister before a group of
business leaders, Taiichi Sakaiya, said Japan must follow the
example of the robust U.S. economy, which he said is reaping the
benefits from a shrinking of government in the 1980s.
	   ``In that same America where they used to have such big
deficits, they're now debating what to do with their (budget)
surpluses,'' he said. Sakaiya heads the Economic Planning Agency.
	   A necessary step is curtailing government involvement in the
economy, which Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said would lead to
opportunities for creating new industries.
	   ``Entrepreneurship is the basis of economic growth,'' Obuchi
said.
	   Sakaiya said that since taking power in August, Obuchi had also
taken a page from former President Ronald Reagan's economic
policies and sliced the top income bracket to 50 from 65 percent.
He also cut corporate taxes to levels similar to the United States.
	   Combined with massive spending on public works, Sakaiya
predicted the changes would be enough to restore Japan's gross
domestic product to a growth rate of about 0.5 percent next year,
up from this year's contraction of 2.2 percent.
	   ``I have a lot of confidence that growth will become positive,''
he said.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Top real estate companies have pleaded with the
government to boost the sagging property market through a curb on
land sales and new housing loan regulations, a newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   The five largest real estate firms _ CB Richard Ellis, Colliers
Jardine, Edmund Tie and Co., Jones Lang Wootton and Knight Frank _
recently presented a joint report on Singapore's ailing property
sector to the National Development minister, The Business Times
reported.
	   The companies argued that property prices, which have tumbled by
as much as 40 percent since peaking in 1996, might fall further
unless the government acts to limit the supply of land for new
residential development, according to the report.
	   The companies' key proposal was for the ministry to extend the
current freeze on government land sales to 2002, until the
estimated 30,000 existing private residential units _ comprising
unsold homes and units in imminent projects _ is depleted.
	   The property companies predict sluggish sales of about 6,000
units per year in the medium term, meaning the current supply will
not be fully absorbed until 2003.
	   They recommended annual reviews of land sales after 2002 based
on consultations between industry participants and the government,
and urged the authorities to buy back some previously-sold sites at
current market prices, the daily reported.
	   The real estate firms also requested the government lower the
minimum 20 percent down payment required of home buyers, allow
banks greater flexibility in granting housing loans, and reduce
stamp duties.
	   The newspaper did not say whether or how the government
responded to the various proposals.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Samsung Electronics Co., the world's
largest memory chip maker, said Tuesday it has sold one-third of
its non-memory chip operations to a U.S. firm for dlrs 455 million.
	   The deal calls for Fairchild Semiconductor Co. to take over one
of Samsung's two non-memory chip plants in South Korea and its
1,500 workers as of Jan. 1, 1999. Located in Puchon west of Seoul,
the plant produces power devices, transistors and linear integrated
circuits.
	   The Puchon plant recorded net profit of 19.6 billion won (dlrs
15.3 million) on 420 billion won (dlrs 350 million) in total sales
in 1997.
	   Before the sale, non-memory chips accounted for 30 percent of
Samsung's total semiconductor operations.
	   Samsung said the deal is part of its restructuring efforts to
concentrate on more advanced chips for use in communications or
digital televisions.
	   Samsung Electronics, the flagship unit of the Samsung group,
South Korea's second largest conglomerate, produces semiconductors,
telecommunications products, home appliances and computer products.
	   A number of local companies have been selling off their assets
and units to foreign investors in a bid to streamline their
businesses and improve their financial positions.
	   Based in South Portland, Maine, Fairchild specializes in
non-memory chip production.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moody's Investors Services on Tuesday said it is
reviewing its rating of Japanese automaker Mazda Motor Corp.'s
creditworthiness for a possible downgrade.
	   The New York-based credit rating agency cited the ``the weakened
auto market and the banking system in Japan'' as its reason for
reviewing Mazda's Baa3 senior unsecured long-term debt rating. A
cut would put Mazda's debt in so-called junk bond category.
	   Moody's said it will investigate Mazda's ability to shore up its
finances amid slumping domestic auto demand and heightened
competition among rivals to launch new products.
	   The agency also said it will consider the effectiveness of
Mazda's current restructuring drive and its efforts to improve its
overseas operations and financial performance.
	   Moody's announcement sent Mazda shares 1.4 percent lower to 424
yen (dlrs 3.60) on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
	   Hiroshima-based Mazda is 33.4 percent-owned by America's Ford
Motor Co.

planner on Tuesday expressed optimism the country will post higher
economic growth in 1999 after suffering a slowdown caused by the
Asian financial crisis and a severe drought this year.
	   Next year will be a ``period of further consolidation and
recovery,'' Socio-Economic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla told
reporters at a year-end briefing.
	   The government projects the gross national product to grow
between 0.5 percent and 1.0 percent and gross domestic product to
grow 1.0 percent in 1998, Medalla said.
	   GNP measures a country's total output while GDP excludes the net
factor income from abroad.
	   For 1999, the government targets a GNP growth of 3.0 percent to
3.5 percent while GDP is projected to grow by 2.6 percent to 3.1
percent, Medalla said.
	   Medalla said a resilient service sector and continued consumer
market demand allowed the Philippines to escape a recession in 1998
and elude the various economic problems suffered by its neighbors
due to the regional financial crisis.
	   The probability of recovery in 1999 will be stronger as the
government generates additional foreign financing, including money
from Japan's ``Miyazawa Fund,'' for its deficit of 68.4 billion
pesos (dlrs 1.72 billion), Medalla said.
	   Medalla noted that escaping a recession and implementing crucial
structural reforms will allow the country to speed economic growth.
	   Inflation is expected to ease to between 8 percent and 9 percent
as agricultural production improves and the exchange rate becomes
more stable, he added.
	   Medalla said the government has allotted about 21.4 billion
pesos (dlrs 538.4 million) in new spending to stimulate economic
growth.
	   New revenue measures are expected to help finance the
government's budget next year. These include a road user's tax, a
land user's tax and a motor vehicle's tax.
	   Medalla said the labor front remained ``relatively calm''
throughout 1998 despite a rise in unemployment, while other
countries like Indonesia and South Korea grappled with unrest.
	   The unemployment rate rose to 9.6 percent in October 1998
compared with 7.9 percent for the same month last year.

Spain awaits winning numbers in world's richest lottery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ People throughout Spain waited anxiously to
see whether their Christmas festivities would get off to a jingling
start Tuesday with a win in a lottery billed as the richest in the
world.
	   As of 9 a.m. (0800 gmt), ticket holders were glued to the TV and
radio sets as children from a school in Madrid picked out numbered
balls from drums and sang out the winning numbers in a ceremony
that lasts some four hours.
	   This year the grand prize of the lottery, which is dubbed ``El
Gordo'' (The Fat One), was for 300 million pesetas (dlrs 2.1
million).
	   The lottery was to dish out a total of 194 billion pesetas (dlrs
1.4 billion) in winnings to tens of thousands of ticket holders
throughout Spain.
	   The lottery, which began in 1818, comprises 140 number series
with each series divided into 66,000 tickets valued at 30,000
pesetas (dlrs 2,100) each. The tickets are subsequently divided
into 10 `decimo' shares worth 3,000 pesetas (dlrs 21) each.
	   Most Spaniards share tickets or `decimos' with family, friends
and coworkers, so lottery windfalls ripple through whole
communities.
	   Income from ticket sales was 250 billion pesetas (dlrs 1.8
billion) this year, 8.9 percent up on last year, according to the
State Lottery Department.
	   The Spanish Treasury hives off 30 percent of the total raised
before the draw takes place to keep the winnings tax free.

Residents flee toxic waste; soldiers standby to clean it up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS FONTAINE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia (AP) _ Trucks brought soldiers to this
seaport town Tuesday to clean up an illegal shipment of toxic waste
as hundreds of residents frightened of health hazards left for
safer areas.
	   Police confirmed that four people were killed in road accidents
Monday when more than 1,000 people fled Sihanoukville, bringing
total confirmed deaths in connection to the waste shipment to five.
	   A dock worker died mysteriously a day after cleaning the hold of
the ship that brought the 3,000 tons of waste, believed to be
compressed industrial ash, from Taiwan to Sihanoukville about two
weeks ago.
	   Analysis by a Hong Kong laboratory has shown the waste contains
traces of mercury, a poisonous metal. It was illegally dumped at a
site about 10 kilometers (six miles) north of Sihanoukville.
	   In Taiwan, the Environmental Protection Bureau said the waste
had been properly treated and should not cause hazards to human
beings. It said it was willing to send a team to Cambodia to
investigate.
	   If the investigation shows the hazards were caused by the
Taiwanese waste, the bureau said it would ask the company that
produced it, Formosa Plastic Corp., to take it back.
	   Bulldozers and other heavy equipment moved earth to form a dike
around the waste Tuesday. Soldiers covered it with plastic tarps to
prevent any of the fine dust from blowing away.
	   Imported protective clothing meanwhile arrived at Koh Kong, a
nearby province, and was to be flown in by helicopter for soldiers
about to get a crash course in removing hazardous materials.
	   Eight truckloads of oil barrels and three shipping containers
have been brought to the dump site. The soldiers will begin packing
the waste Tuesday or Wednesday, officials said.
	   Sihanoukville was rocked by two days of violent protests over
the weekend by residents outraged by alleged corruption among
customs and government officials who let the waste into the
country.
	   One protester who fell out of the window of a hotel that was
ransacked was badly injured, though there has been no confirmation
he was killed.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, president of the National Assembly,
said that he had been informed by Prime Minister Hun Sen that dlrs
3 million had been paid in bribes to corrupt officials to get the
waste into the country. The government has vowed to find and
prosecute them.
	   About half a dozen soldiers stood guard Tuesday outside the
house of deputy governor Khim Bo, which was ransacked by mobs over
the weekend.
	   Chief Prosecutor Mam Muth said 12 demonstrators have been
arrested and are being detained at the local prison. Nine have been
charged with looting.
	   The other three are human-rights workers from Licadho, a local
organization. Mam Muth said that they had been identified as
ringleaders of the riot.
	   The 200 seats on all buses leaving for the capital, Phnom Penh,
185 kilometers (115 miles) to the north, were fully booked, agents
said. Passenger levels were four times higher than usual.
	   In Phnom Penh, a tourism official said that the presence of the
waste and the riots was hurting Sihanoukville's economy. The town
is a popular holiday spot.
	   ``Guest houses have no visitors and many bookings have been
canceled,'' said Thong Khon, secretary of state at the Tourism
Ministry. ``It is regrettable. This problem should not have been
allowed to happen.'' s regrettable.

Primakov urges increase in trade with India
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo DEL101-102 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Calling for a doubling of India-Russia
trade by 2000 and increased Indian investment, Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov sought to reassure Indian business
leaders Tuesday that his country remains a safe place for
investment.
	   Primakov, speaking at the end of his two-day state visit to New
Delhi, tried to set at rest concerns about Russia's economic
problems, including the collapse of its banking system. He said
Russia was committed to its international financial obligations, an
open economy and noninterference with dollar exchange rates.
	   Russia has been one of India's largest trade partners, but
Russia's economic crisis has hit bilateral trade that has been
dwindling since the breakup of the former Soviet Union. Trade
between the two countries has fallen from a high of dlrs 5.5
billion in 1990 to dlrs 1.5 billion in 1998.
	   ``This we cannot accept,'' said Primakov calling for twofold
increase in trade by 2000 and a fourfold increase by 2005.
	   Russia was also proposing lowering taxes for foreign investors
and would consider repaying Indian businessmen who lost money
deposited in banks backed by the government in the recent banking
crisis.
	   In his meeting Monday with his Indian counterpart Atal Bihari
Vajpayee, Primakov said they pledged to personally oversee removal
of obstacles to better trade.
	   Primakov also urged more cooperation in electronics, thermal
power, the transfer of science and technology, coal mining and oil
refining.
	   Earlier Tuesday, he met India's leading opposition politicians.
	   The calls on former Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral and
Congress Party leader Sonia Gandhi are a matter of courtesy for
foreign dignitaries, and an important precaution given India's
volatile politics.
	   India has had five governments in the last seven years, and the
current coalition led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata
Party has had a shaky nine months in power.
	   On Monday, Russian and Indian officials also signed seven
agreements, including a crucial document extending current military
and technical cooperation through 2010 and economic deals.
	   Primakov said President Boris Yeltsin will visit India next year
to sign a strategic partnership agreement defining long-term
relationships in political and other fields. Yeltsin, who was to
visit India this month, put off his visit after his health
deteriorated.
	   Primakov left India on Tuesday for the former Soviet republic of
Kazakhstan on his way back to Moscow. He is to sign an agreement on
the exchange of information and on checkpoints on the border
between Russia and Kazakhstan.

Tourism to selected Pacific destinations healthy despite Asian

crisis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ The three main South Pacific Island tourist
destinations _ Fiji, Tahiti and New Caledonia _ are expecting a
record number of tourists in 1999 despite the collapse of Asian
outbound tourism, the Fiji Visitors Bureau said Tuesday.
	   Twelve other Pacific destinations, including Australia, New
Zealand and Hawaii, were reporting tourist downturns caused by
slumping Asian visitor arrival figures, said Sitiveni Yaqona, chief
executive of the bureau.
	   But tourist numbers to Fiji are growing and the 1998 count is
expected to break the 1997 record of 359,441 visitors, he told an
industry meeting.
	   Tahiti, which had 163,774 visitors in 1997, and New Caledonia,
which had 91,121 visitors in 1997 were reporting similar trends.
	   Yaqona said the bureau was confident of 8.5 percent growth in
1999, taking visitors to Fiji to about 400,000 visitors.
	   The bureau expects the number of Australian visitors to grow by
11.6 percent to 111,800; U.S. tourists to increase by 13.2 percent
to 55,800; Canadian visitors to grow by 20.3 percent to 16,000;
British visitors to grow by 8.5 percent to 43,000; and European
business to grow by 3.7 percent to 30,000 visitors.
	   Japanese tourists were expected to decline by 5 percent to
33,700, Yaqona said.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opened his
re-election campaign Tuesday by deriding the ``fantasies and
ambitions'' of his political rivals and insisting that the public
will back his tough stance toward the Palestinians.
	   ``We will go to the people and the people will give us the
support to achieve peace with security,'' the prime minister told
Israel radio a day after Israel's parliament voted overwhelmingly
for early elections and rejected Netanyahu's peace policies.
	   The collapse of the prime minister's governing coalition and the
outset of what is likely to be a nearly 4-month-long election
campaign appeared to put the already ailing Mideast peace process
on hold.
	   That is drawing bitter protest from the Palestinians, who call
the political turmoil an internal Israeli affair and insist Israel
is still bound to the Wye River accord, just as it is to other
pre-existing international agreements.
	   ``It's really unfortunate that the only thing that Mr. Netanyahu
has decided to stop is the peace process with us,'' chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told the AP on Tuesday. ``I
think this is a very grave development.''
	   The elections are likely to take place by the end of April. In
addition to Netanyahu and Labor Party leader Ehud Barak, a
half-dozen other figures have indicated they will jump into what is
shaping as a wild political free-for-all.
	   Netanyahu brushed aside polls suggesting he would lose by a slim
margin to Barak and by a considerably wider margin to popular
former army chief of staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, who has indicated
his intention to form a centrist party.
	   ``The fantasies and ambitions of all those who want to be prime
minister _ please. We will allow the voters to decide who needs to
lead the state,'' Netanyahu said in the radio interview. He
predicted he would draw ``utmost, massive'' support from voters
affiliated with his conservative Likud party.
	   Likud, though, was already weathering a storm of defections. Dan
Meridor, Netanyahu's former finance minister, said Tuesday he was
quitting the party and jumping into the race for prime minister
himself.
	   Others likely to declare their candidacy include hard-liners
such as Benjamin Begin, the son of the late Prime Minister Menachem
Begin, and Limor Livnat, Netanyahu's communications minister.
Livnat's rumored candidacy has troubled ultra-Orthodox legislators
who question a woman's fitness for leadership.
	   The early elections bill given preliminary approval by lawmakers
on Monday must pass two more parliamentary readings, but Netanyahu
has said he will not try to block its final passage.
	   The unraveling of Netanyahu's coalition began with the signing
of the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace accord two months ago. The
pact's land-for-security provisions infuriated hard-liners who made
up a small but powerful faction in Netanyahu's government.
	   The opposition Labor party promised Netanyahu support as long as
he stuck to the agreement, but that fell apart when he scrapped a
scheduled troop withdrawal from 5 percent of the West Bank after a
wave of anti-Israel violence last month.
	   Netanyahu's conditions to the Palestinians for resuming Israeli
compliance with the Wye accord, presented to lawmakers on Monday,
included: a renunciation of claims to statehood and Jerusalem; a
confiscation of arms; an end to violence and incitement to
violence; and a renunciation of claims that Netanyahu had agreed to
release Palestinians jailed for killings.
	   The prime minister, who remains in his job until the new voting,
repeated accusations Tuesday that the Palestinians are violating
the accord.
	   ``We won't give territory to the Palestinians when they say they
will simply take that territory and will continue the violations
and will decide unilaterally on our future,'' he told Israel radio.
	   Palestinian leaders called on the Israeli public and the Clinton
administration to reject Netanyahu's latest demands and pressure
him to move ahead with the promised handover of West Bank
territory.
	   In Washington on Monday, State Department spokesman James Foley
credited the Palestinians with working hard to implement many of
their commitments under the Wye River accord and suggested that
Israel do the same.
	   Asked specifically whether Israel should go ahead with the troop
withdrawal that Netanyahu called off earlier this month, Foley
said: ``That has been our position all along.''

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Shouting contempt for his summary trial, a
Chinese dissident was sentenced to 12 years in prison Tuesday,
becoming the third organizer of a would-be opposition party
convicted in two days.
	   The heavy sentence given to Qin Yongmin fell predictably in line
with the severe verdicts issued Monday to fellow China Democracy
Party leaders: 13 years for Xu Wenli and 11 for Wang Youcai.
	   Tried in different cities, the three were accused of the same
crime, the subversion of China's Communist Party-led system, for
the same act, trying to set up the China Democracy Party.
	   Their quick trials and harsh punishments showed how firmly the
Communist Party draws the line at open opposition. Their treatment
also undermined China's attempts to burnish its international
reputation by signing U.N. rights treaties and nudging its legal
system closer to international standards.
	   ``This is a travesty of justice. Xu Wenli, Wang Youcai, Qin
Yongmin and others are not attempting to subvert the Chinese
government. They are simply trying to hold the government
accountable to its people,'' said Xiao Qiang of New York-based
Human Rights in China.
	   The Intermediate People's Court in the central city of Wuhan
took 40 minutes to sentence Qin, five days after his 2 1/2-hour
trial, his brother Qin Xiaoguang and fellow dissidents said.
	   In a near repeat of the verdicts issued against Xu and Wang,
judges ruled that Qin planned to ``overthrow the socialist system''
by organizing the China Democracy Party, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported.
	   Denied entry to the courtroom because he was five minutes late,
Qin's brother yelled to Qin as guards led him down the hallway
afterwards: ```Qin Yongmin, what was the crime? What was the
sentence?' He shouted back `twelve years.'''
	   ```I'm not going to appeal. I have contempt for this court,'''
Qin Yongmin said as he was being led away, the brother recounted.
	   Qin's defiance echoed Xu's at his half-day trial in Beijing
Monday.
	   Xu told the court, ```I'm willing to use the sacrifice of myself
to promote democracy in China. I'm not one who encourages a
struggle and then just lets others shed their blood,''' his wife,
He Xintong, said late Monday.
	   China defended the convictions, saying the dissidents broke the
laws on subversion and infringed upon the rights of the state and
other citizens.
	   ``If the security of a country and the dignity and order of the
law cannot be preserved, the human rights of the people cannot be
guaranteed,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said at a
briefing.
	   Zhu argued that China was meeting its obligations under the
U.N.'s International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights because
the treaty recognizes the importance of protecting national
security.
	   Responding to international criticism, Zhu said other countries
should ``refrain from making irresponsible remarks about China's
judicial system.''
	   With Qin, Xu and Wang _ the most influential members of the
China Democracy Party _ heading to prison, Chinese authorities
appear to be focusing their crackdown, now in its fourth week, on
the group's second-tier leaders.
	   Police in Hangzhou city in eastern China took away party member
Wu Yilong on Monday night, a Hong Kong-based rights group reported.
	   In the Hangzhou court's verdict against Wang on Monday, judges
identified Wu and Zhu Zhengming, who was detained a week ago, as
important party members, the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China reported.
	   Police in Wuhan also detained at least two colleagues of Qin's
Monday night to prevent them from demonstrating outside the
courthouse Tuesday, one of the pair, Chen Zhonghe said.
	   Wang Youcai, 32, was a student leader in the 1989 Tiananmen
Square demonstrations who declared the formation of the opposition
group in June.
	   Qin, 45 and a Democracy Wall veteran, has spent about a decade
in prison. He tried to set up an independent human rights
monitoring group in addition to organizing the China Democracy
Party.
	   Xu, 55, was known as an effective organizer and a moderating
voice. He earlier served 12 years in prison _ much of it in
solitary confinement _ for his involvement in the Democracy Wall
movement of the late 1970s.
	   Their efforts drew enough support that in six months activists
tried to set up branches of the China Democracy Party in 14
provinces and cities.
	   In Washington, the State Department called on Chinese
authorities to release the men immediately.
	   ``This form of peaceful political expression deserves the
protection of all governments,'' said Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott. ``We not only deplore that they were detained and
tried for such actions but are deeply disturbed by the long
sentences imposed and the lack of due process.''

Ariane rocket launches American satellite 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ An Ariane rocket placed an U.S. telecommunications
satellite into orbit overnight, completing the European Space
Agency's 1998 commercial launch program, the agency said Tuesday.
	   The launch from Guiana Space Center in French Guiana, on the
northern edge of South America, took place at 10:08 p.m. Monday
(0108 GMT) Tuesday, officials said.
	   It was the 115th launch of an Ariane 4 and the 11th of the year.
	   An Ariane 4 rocket equipped with two liquid-fuel engines was
used to place the 3.6 ton PAS-6B satellite in orbit.
	   It was the 7th satellite for the American Panamsat company that
Arianspace, the commercial arm of the European Space Agency, has
launched since June 1998.
	   Built by Hugues Space and Communications, the satellite should
be able to transmit television programs to Latin America for the
next 15 years from its orbital position over Brazil.
	   Next year is an important one for Ariane because for the first
time the new, more powerful Ariane 5 will be used for commercial
launches following a successful takeoff in October.
	   Ariane 5 is twice as powerful as Ariane 4, which it will
gradually replace. Two test launches prior to October had failed.

Fuji Heavy Industries chairman resigns over bribery scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. chairman Isamu Kawai,
who was arrested this month for allegedly bribing a lawmaker, has
resigned to take responsibility for the scandal, the company said
Tuesday.
	   Kawai, 76, is suspected of giving 5 million yen (dlrs 43,000) in
kickbacks to ruling Liberal Democratic Party legislator Yojiro
Nakajima in exchange for help in securing a government defense
contract.
	   Yasuyuki Kogure, 64, a former Fuji Heavy executive director, has
also been arrested on suspicion of bribing Nakajima.
	   A Fuji Heavy spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that the chairman post will remain vacant for now.
	   Nakajima, 39, a Liberal Democratic Party member of Parliament,
was arrested last month on charges of ordering false receipts made
to account for missing party money. The arrest was unrelated to the
Fuji Heavy Industries case.
	   Fuji Heavy Industries is the maker of Subaru automobiles.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with No. 21856 winning top prize; EDITS to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Christmas festivities got off to a whopping
start Tuesday in several towns across Spain which shared a prize of
300 million pesetas (dlrs 2.1 million), the top award in a lottery
billed as the world's richest.
	   The annual lottery, known as ``El Gordo'' (The Fat One), was to
dish out a total of 194 billion pesetas (dlrs 1.4 billion) in
winnings this year to thousands of ticket holders throughout Spain.
	   Each year, millions of television viewers watch as children from
a school in Madrid pick out numbered balls from drums and sing out
the winning number in a ceremony that lasts some four to five
hours.
	   The winning ticket bearing the number 21856 was picked at 10.30
a.m. (0930 gmt).
	   The second prize of 144 million pesetas (dlrs 102 million) was
for number 07308.
	   The lottery, which began in 1818, comprises 140 number series
with each series divided into 66,000 tickets valued at 30,000
pesetas (dlrs 2,100) each. The tickets are subsequently divided
into 10 shares worth 3,000 pesetas (dlrs 21) each.
	   Most Spaniards share tickets with family, friends and
co-workers, so lottery windfalls ripple through whole communities.
	   Income from ticket sales was 250 billion pesetas (dlrs 1.8
billion) this year, 8.9 perecent up on last year, according to the
State Lottery Department.
	   The Spanish Treasury hives off 30 percent of the total raised
before the draw takes place to keep the winnings tax free.

Hong Kong share prices close generally lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong closed generally
lower Tuesday as investors took profits following three consecutive
sessions of gains.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 73.45 points, or 0.7 percent,
closing at 10,322.56. On Monday, the index had gained 169.78
points.
	   Turnover fell to 2.452 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 314
million), down from Monday's 4.171 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 534 million).
	   Brokers said share prices fell as investors took profits after
recent sharp gains.
	   They said investors were also concerned over the sharp decline
on the Japanese stock exchange, where the key Nikkei index fell 2.6
percent after the Finance Ministry's trust fund bureau said it
would stop buying government bonds in 1999.
	   The report raised fears that interest rates would rise in Japan,
driving up corporate borrowing costs.
	   Among losers, China Telecom fell 70 Hong Kong cents to 14.15,
Cathay Pacific fell 20 cents to 7.85, Bank of East Asia fell 15
cents to 13.85, and Swire Pacific ``A'' fell 10 cents to 35.90.
	   Remaining unchanged were HSBC Holdings at 198.50, and Sun Hung
Kai Properties at 57.25.
	   Going against the trend was Hang Seng Bank, which rose 75 cents
to 72.75.

Wage debt to Russian workers at 84.9 billion rubles (dlrs 4

billion) &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian workers are owed 84.9 billion rubles (dlrs
4 billion) in back wages, and most of the debt belongs to private
firms, not the government, an official said Tuesday.
	   Millions of Russians receive their wages and pensions months
late, but employers have been unable to break the cycle of debts
that continues to hobble the country's economy.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Valentina Matvienko said the government
owed 18 billion rubles (dlrs 850 million) of the overdue wages,
while private companies owed about 67 billion rubles (dlrs 3.2
billion), the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Russia's latest economic crisis, which hit in August, has only
made the problem worse. Many workers have lost their jobs and the
government continues to struggle to collect taxes and pay its
bills.
	   The government's debt to pensioners now stands at 30 billion
rubles (dlrs 1.4 billion) and overdue subsidies to families with
children is currently at 24 billion rubles (dlrs 1.1 billion).
	   ``We should do all we can not to allow children to go hungry,''
Matvienko said. ``In each such case, the local authorities should
take urgent measures.''
	   Russia is to receive food aid from the United States and Europe
this winter to guard against potential food shortages. So far, no
serious food problems have been reported.

October retail sales plunge 20 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong retail sales plunged 20 percent in
October from the same month last year, the government announced
Tuesday.
	   Consumer concerns about the uncertain economic outlook and
rising unemployment _ at a 17-year high _ have made them more
cautious about spending, Hong Kong's Census and Statistics
Department said.
	   Retail sales fell to an estimated 15.8 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 2.0 billion) in October. The volume of goods sold fell
by 19 percent compared with October 1997.
	   Sales of motor vehicles posted the biggest fall, dropping 49
percent in value and 43 percent in volume compared to a year
earlier. Sales of clothing and footwear sank 31 percent in value
and 28 percent in volume.
	   For the first ten months of 1998, retail sales declined by 16
percent in value and 17 percent in volume.
	   Retailers have been closing branches, laying off staff, and
slashing wages to survive as the territory struggles through an
economic recession brought on by Asia's economic crisis.
	   Hong Kong's economy contracted 7 percent in the third quarter
and is expected to shrink by 5 percent this year, compared with 5.3
percent growth in 1997.

Frosty relations between Greece, Macedonia appear ready to thaw
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ In an indication of improved ties
between two Balkan neighbors, Greece's foreign minister arrived in
Macedonia on Tuesday for a series of meetings with government
officials.
	   Theodoros Pangalos' one-day trip is the first official visit by
a European Union minister since the new Macedonian government was
sworn in after October's general elections.
	   Pangalos was met at the airport by his Macedonian counterpart,
Aleksandar Dimitrov.
	   For almost a decade, Greece and Macedonia have squabbled over
what name the former Yugoslav republic could use. Greece claims the
use of the name ``Macedonia'' masks expansionist aims by its
northern neighbor, and insists the northern Greek province of
Macedonia is the only region which is entitled to use the name.
	   Talks held under United Nations auspices in New York to resolve
the dispute have made little headway, with 19 rounds of
negotiations already completed.
	   The dispute led to a crippling embargo imposed by Greece on
Macedonia in 1994. Although the embargo was lifted in 1995
following an interim agreement, relations remained frosty.
	   Greece recognizes Macedonia under the name ``Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia,'' and will deal with the country only when
it uses that. The name ``Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia'' is
the one officially used by the U.N. General Assembly.
	   But Pangalos is expected to avoid raising the issue of the name
during his talks here, preferring to concentrate on now burgeoning
economic ties between the two countries.
	   The new Macedonian prime minister, Ljubco Georgijevski, appears
ready to help, diplomatic sources said on condition of anonymity.
	   Despite entering Macedonia's first parliament with the
center-right VMRO-DPMNE which championed nationalist values,
Georgijevski has softened his stance, and Greece is eager to take
advantage of a possible compromise.
	   Neither country wants the name dispute to stand in the way of
lucrative commercial ties. Although Macedonia is one of the poorest
Balkan nations, it provides an opportunity for Greece to expand
further into Balkan markets, as it has begun to do in Bulgaria and
Albania.
	   But Pangalos' visit has already raised objections at home, where
any hint that Greece's neighbor may eventually be allowed to use
the name ``Macedonia'' has the potential for whipping up
nationalistic fervor.
	   On Monday, former conservative Foreign Minister Andonis Samaras
complained Pangalos would be offering ``Christmas presents'' during
his visit by backing down on the name issue.
	   It was during Samaras' tenure as a foreign minister for the
conservative party that the problem first appeared, just after
Macedonia seceeded from Yugoslavia in 1991 - the only former
Yugoslav republic to do so without bloodshed.
	   Macedonia, which borders ethnically tense Kosovo province, is
particularly interested in reducing friction with its neighbors.
The new government's hopes to eventually join international
organizations such as NATO and the European Union add impetus to
the drive for improving relations with EU member Greece.
	   One of the new government's first decisions was to allow the
deployment on Macedonian soil of a 1,800-strong NATO rapid reaction
force, designed to provide assistance to 2,000 international
verifiers monitoring the situation in neighboring Kosovo.
	   Macedonia joined NATO's Partnership for Peace Program in 1995.

After four-day bombardment of Iraq, both side claim victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ While the United States boasted of the
success of the U.S.-British bombardment of Iraq, the country's
state-run newspapers claimed victory, too, on the basis that
President Saddam Hussein remains in power.
	   ``The enemies made a bid that a riot would take place in the
country, but they were wrong because Iraqis are closer to their
leader now than ever,'' the weekly Al-Ittihad said in an editorial
Tuesday.
	   The view was echoed in other government newspapers, which also
claimed the four-day attack had built sympathy for Iraq among the
world's Muslims.
	   About 120 U.N. humanitarian workers evacuated during last week's
airstrikes headed back to Baghdad from neighboring Jordan on
Tuesday morning, and a U.N. official said they would be back at
work Wednesday.
	   Khalid al-Izzi, an aide to U.N. humanitarian coordinator Hans
von Sponeck, said the first job would be to assess damage from the
airstrikes.
	   On Monday night, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz gave the first
official casualty figures for soldiers in the bombardment, saying
62 were killed and 180 wounded. He repeated assertions that many
more civilians were killed, but refused to give figures.
	   Iraqi authorities have not taken foreign journalists to sites
where they reported heavy civilian casualties as they have in the
past _ an indication the casualties either were not high or were
scattered.
	   The attacks targeted key military bases, government buildings,
communication centers and military factories.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the airstrikes after chief
U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler accused Iraq of failing to
fully cooperate with his inspectors.
	   The weapons inspectors must certify that Iraq is free of weapons
of mass destruction before the U.N. Security Council will lift
economic sanctions imposed on Baghdad for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   Aziz and other officials said the attacks disrupted telephone
communications to Iraq's south and heavily damaged factories that
could be used to manufacture long-range missiles prohibited under
the U.N. resolutions.
	   In Washington, U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Anthony Zinni said the
strikes hit 85 percent of their targets, 74 percent of them
successfully. He said a full damage assessment of damage would
probably take a few more days.
	   Zinni, head of Central Command which oversees U.S. military
operations in the Middle East, showed pictures of damage to Iraq's
Defense Ministry in Baghdad and the headquarter of the ruling Baath
Party.
	   ``I guarantee you, nobody's working in the Baath Party
headquarters,'' he joked, pointing to the scarred building.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, who was with Zinni as he
briefed reporters, termed Operation Desert Fox ``highly
successful.''
	   In London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the airstrikes
have set back parts of Iraq's ``military infrastructure several
years.''
	   Aziz maintained, however, that most of the strikes hit empty
barracks, adding that ``these barracks could be and will be
rebuilt.''
	   A U.S. intelligence report revealed by ABC News said that most
critical equipment from inside the missile plants had been moved
and Iraqi technicians responsible for building missiles were at
home in bed _ and not at the plants _ during the attacks.
	   Iraq said that in addition to hitting missile factories, the
bombardments struck colleges, post offices, dormitories, a museum
and an oil refinery.
	   ``They want to ... strip Iraq of any serious industrial
capabilities,'' Aziz told a news conference in Baghdad. ``This is a
policy of hatred.''
	   But he contended that the United States and Britain failed to
seriously harm the Iraqi government or military. ``They boasted of
great success. ... They lied,'' he said.
	   Iraq's state-run newspapers also hit on that theme in editorials
Tuesday.
	   ``We came out victorious over the gang of the devil Butler, the
clown Blair and the adulterer Clinton,'' said the daily Al-Iraq.
	   The daily Al-Jumhuriya carried a headline saying ``Arab and
international anger continues against the American-British crime,''
and the weekly Al-Ittihad said the anger was greatest among
Muslims.
	   Aziz reiterated Monday that Baghdad will not allow U.N. arms
monitors to return, but chief weapons inspector Butler said it was
up to the Security Council to decide the future of the inspectors.
	   ``It's not for Baghdad alone to make that declaration,'' Butler
told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio on Tuesday.

Netanyahu ridicules rivals, demands Palestinian guarantees

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opened his
re-election campaign Tuesday by deriding the ``fantasies and
ambitions'' of his political rivals and insisting that the public
will back his tough stance toward the Palestinians.
	   ``We will go to the people, and the people will give us the
support to achieve peace with security,'' he told Israel radio a
day after Israel's parliament voted overwhelmingly for early
elections and rejected his policies toward the Palestinians.
	   The collapse of his governing coalition and the outset of what
is likely to be a nearly 4-month-long election campaign appeared to
put the already ailing Mideast peace process on hold.
	   That is drawing bitter protest from the Palestinians, who call
the political turmoil an internal Israeli affair and insist Israel
is still bound to the Wye River accord and any other pre-existing
international agreements.
	   ``It's really unfortunate that the only thing that Mr. Netanyahu
has decided to stop is the peace process with us,'' chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told the AP on Tuesday. ``I
think this is a very grave development.''
	   The elections are likely to take place by the end of April. In
addition to Netanyahu and Labor Party leader Ehud Barak, a
half-dozen other figures have indicated they will jump into what is
shaping as a wild political free-for-all.
	   Meantime, Netanyahu brushed aside polls suggesting he would lose
by a slim margin to Barak and by a considerably wider margin to
former army chief of staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, who has indicated
his intention to form a centrist party.
	   ``The fantasies and ambitions of all those who want to be prime
minister _ please. We will allow the voters to decide who needs to
lead the state,'' Netanyahu said in the radio interview. He
predicted he would draw ``utmost, massive'' support from voters
affiliated with his conservative Likud party.
	   Likud, though, was already weathering a storm of defections. Dan
Meridor, Netanyahu's former finance minister, said Tuesday he was
quitting the party and jumping into the race for prime minister
himself.
	   Others likely to declare their candidacy include hard-liners
such as Benjamin Begin, the son of the late Prime Minister Menachem
Begin, and Limor Livnat, Netanyahu's communications minister.
Livnat's rumored candidacy has troubled ultra-Orthodox legislators
who question a woman's fitness for leadership.
	   The early elections bill given preliminary approval by lawmakers
on Monday must pass two more parliamentary readings, but Netanyahu
has said he will not try to block its final passage.
	   The unraveling of Netanyahu's coalition began with the signing
of the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace accord two months ago. The
land-for-security provisions infuriated hard-liners who made up a
small but powerful faction in Netanyahu's government.
	   The opposition Labor party promised Netanyahu support as long as
he stuck to the agreement, but that fell apart when he scrapped a
scheduled troop withdrawal from 5 percent of the West Bank after a
wave of anti-Israel violence last month.
	   Netanyahu's conditions to the Palestinians for resuming Israeli
compliance with the Wye accord, presented to lawmakers on Monday,
included a renunciation of claims to statehood and Jerusalem and
claims that Netanyahu agreed to release Palestinians jailed for
killings; a confiscation of arms; and an end to violence and
incitement to violence.
	   Netanyahu, who remains in his job until the new voting, repeated
accusations Tuesday that the Palestinians are violating the accord.
	   ``We won't give territory to the Palestinians when they say they
will simply take that territory and will continue the violations
and will decide unilaterally on our future,'' he told Israel radio.
	   Palestinian leaders called on the Israeli public and the Clinton
administration to reject Netanyahu's latest demands and pressure
him to move ahead with the promised handover of West Bank
territory.
	   In Washington on Monday, State Department spokesman James Foley
credited the Palestinians with working hard to implement many of
their commitments under the Wye River accord and suggested that
Israel do the same.
	   Asked specifically whether Israel should go ahead with the troop
withdrawal that Netanyahu called off earlier this month, Foley
said: ``That has been our position all along.''

Yeltsin berates interior minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin gave a tongue lashing to
Russia's top policeman Tuesday, saying he had failed to stop the
falsification of crime statistics, a new report said.
	   Some police figures indicate that Russia's high crime rate has
gone down a bit in the last few years, but Yeltsin said his data
showed the opposite.
	   ``And you tell me everything is fine,'' Yeltsin told Interior
Minister Sergei Stepashin at the Kremlin meeting, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   ``I treat you with trust and respect,'' Yeltsin said. ``I judge
your work by its results. But God forbid that you should
overestimate yourself a little bit or relax.''
	   Stepashin, who is responsible for the police force, has
acknowledged that police falsified crime figures to earn perks and
make themselves look good. But he promised Yeltsin that statistics
would no longer get any ``window-dressing.''
	   Yeltsin has been sidelined by a string of illnesses, but said
stopping crime remained one of his top priorities.
	   Yeltsin was recently hospitalized for two weeks to recover from
pneumonia. He was released about two weeks ago, and has been
holding regular meetings since then.

Agriculture minister: Increasing rice imports wouldn't fix trade
</HEADLINE>
imbalance

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Increasing American rice imports to Japan would do
little to correct the country's trade imbalance with the United
States, Japan's agriculture minister said Tuesday.
	   Shoichi Nakagawa's remarks came amid recent U.S. criticism of
Japan for deciding to heavily tax imported rice despite a
ballooning trade surplus with the rest of the world.
	   ``Every time this discussion (of the trade imbalance) springs
up, agricultural products and rice are singled out,'' Nakagawa told
reporters.
	   Instead, the U.S. should find other ways to boost imports to
Japan, since ``rice alone cannot resolve this issue,'' the minister
said.
	   Japan's trade surplus with the United States stood at dlrs 5.95
billion in October, 31.9 percent higher than the year before.
	   Last week, Japan's Cabinet officially endorsed a plan to impose
a flat tariff of 351.17 yen (dlrs 3.05) per kilogram on foreign
rice from April 1, 1999 despite opposition from major trading
partners.
	   Before the decision was made official, U.S. Ambassador Thomas
Foley warned that such high tariffs would ``cripple'' U.S. rice
imports to Japan and lead to a serious trade disagreement.
	   Imposing the tariff is widely seen as a move to protect Japanese
farmers, who are accustomed to some of the highest rice prices in
the world, from cheap imports.
	   Nakagawa, however, insisted that the decision to limit rice
imports reflects the demands of consumers, who tend to buy Japanese
rice over imported rice.
	   ``The majority of rice imported into this country has not met
the needs of the Japanese public palate,'' the minister said.
	   Japanese government representatives were in the Washington on
Monday for talks with U.S. officials about the issue following
Tokyo's official announcement of the tariff plan to the World Trade
Organization.
	   In his speech, Nakagawa said the tariffs are fully in line with
WTO regulations.
	   Japan pledged to open its rice market to imports in a landmark
1993 trade agreement which committed it to set minimum access
levels. The so-called Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade obliged Japan to import four percent of its rice
in 1995 and to gradually increase that amount to about eight
percent by 2000.

Zimbabwe denies sending troops to Angola
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The Defense Ministry in Harare denied
claims Zimbabwe sent troops to back government forces fighting
rebels in Angola, the state-controlled Herald newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   Officials dismissed allegations that some Zimbabwean soldiers
serving in the Congo were redeployed to fight UNITA rebels, who
have mounted a renewed onslaught against the government of Angolan
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, the newspaper said.
	   The allegations were made by Jonas Savimbi, leader of UNITA, the
Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola. Savimbi said Zimbabwean forces entered
Angola on Friday and were threatening an escalation of fighting.
	   Angolan troops are in a southern African alliance with Zimbabwe
and Namibia supporting embattled President Laurent Kabila in the
Congo.
	   The Herald, seen as a government mouthpiece, said Zimbabwe
President Robert Mugabe last week described Savimbi as a war
criminal who must be sought out and defeated.
	   ``This may have been misconstrued to mean that Zimbabwe will
hunt down Dr. Savimbi,'' the newspaper said, quoting unidentified
defense officials.
	   No further information was available from the defense ministry
on Tuesday, a public holiday in Zimbabwe.
	   Zimbabwe has 8,000 troops backed by warplanes and armor in the
Congo.
	   Angola and UNITA signed a U.N.-brokered peace agreement in 1994
after two decades of civil war but the pact has crumbled with
fierce fighting again erupting within the past month.

Gang members sentenced for extorting money in fake accidents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Beijing court has sentenced a gang of 17 people
to prison terms of up to 20 years for extorting money from drivers
after staging fake traffic accidents, the newspaper China Economic
Times reported Tuesday.
	   One member of the gang would intentionally run into a car on his
bicycle and then pretend to have been injured, while others would
emerge to force the driver into handing over cash as compensation,
the report said.
	   The group extorted more than 22,000 yuan (dlrs 2,660) from one
driver, it added. The court issued the sentences last Friday.
	   Meanwhile, two brothers in the southern province of Jiangxi were
sentenced to one and three years imprisonment each for using the
corpse of a third brother, who had died in a traffic accident, to
try to get money for his burial, the newspaper China Daily
reported.
	   The brothers used the corpse to block the road and also lay down
on the road themselves, blocking traffic, in their effort to raise
cash. The report said the pair were convicted of ``disturbing
traffic order.''

Railwaymen walk off work for higher wages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Workers of the Hungarian State Railways
staged a two-hour warning strike Tuesday morning to back their
demands for higher pay, the state-run news agency MTI reported.
	   The strike that took place between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m. (0400 to
0600 GMT), affected over 500 passenger trains.
	   The workers are demanding a 21 percent pay raise, while
management is offering only a 13 percent hike.
	   On Monday, railway engineers held a similar warning strike for
similar demands.
	   Representatives of the employers and the employees are get down
to the negotiating table later in the day to try to avoid a general
rail strike planned for January.
	   If no agreement is reached before the end of the year, the
engineers will walk off work between Jan. 4 and 7, and the other
rail workers from Jan. 7 for an indefinite time.
	   The average gross wages of the engineers is 96,000 forints (dlrs
465), while that of the state railways is 54,000 forints (dlrs
280).

	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ A 21-year-old woman was attacked by a
shark Tuesday while surfing at one of South Australia state's most
popular surf beaches.
	   The woman suffered deep wounds to one of her legs, but was in
satisfactory condition in the South Coast District Hospital,
ambulance spokesman Brenton Scroop said.
	   The afternoon attack occurred as the woman was about to catch a
wave back to shore at Middleton beach, about 50 miles (80 kms)
south of the capital, Adelaide.
	   ``She was chest deep in water and she was about to mount her
board again and come back into the shore when she felt something
knock her leg,'' Scroop said.
	   ``She subsequently felt a bite and something thrashing about
near her leg.''
	   A paramedic crew from Victor Harbor treated the woman on the way
to the hospital.

Islamic Group denies it threatened U.S., Kuwaiti interests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A militant Islamic group has denied reports
that it threatened to bomb U.S. and Kuwaiti interests to avenge the
American and British airstrikes on Iraq, a leading Arab newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   The London-based Al-Hayat quoted sources close to al-Gamaa
al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, as denying that its members
contacted news organizations to threaten attacks.
	   It was not immediately clear if the denial reflected a split in
the leadership of the Islamic Group. In recent months, Egyptian
leaders of the group have called for an end to violent activities
here, but militants abroad have said the struggle should continue
against the Egyptian government.
	   Al-Hayat reported Monday that it had received a statement and a
phone call from people claiming to represent the Islamic Group.
They urged a ``holy war'' against the United States and threatened
to blow up Kuwaiti embassies.
	   In the denial published Tuesday, the paper quoted an Islamic
Group source as saying: ``The group does not announce in advance
the operations it plans to carry out, in order to protect its
credibility and members.''
	   The source was not identified, but the article carried a Cairo
dateline.
	   The United States and Britain last week carried out four days of
punishing airstrikes against Iraq after the chief U.N. weapons
inspector, Richard Butler, said the Baghdad regime was not
cooperating in the inspectors' search for weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The attack lead to widespread protests around the Arab world.
	   The Islamic Group carried out a six-year campaign of violence
aimed at toppling Egypt's secular government that led to more than
1,250 deaths. The group wants to install an Islamic regime.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ While the United States boasted of the
success of the U.S.-British bombardment of Iraq, the country's
state-run newspapers also claimed victory Tuesday on the basis that
President Saddam Hussein remains in power.
	   ``The enemies made a bid that a riot would take place in the
country, but they were wrong because Iraqis are closer to their
leader now than ever,'' the weekly Al-Ittihad said in an editorial
Tuesday.
	   The view was echoed in other government newspapers, which also
claimed the four-day attack last week built sympathy for Iraq among
the world's Muslims.
	   Also Tuesday, about 120 U.N. humanitarian workers evacuated
during the airstrikes headed back to Baghdad from neighboring
Jordan. A U.N. official said they would be back at work Wednesday.
	   Khalid al-Izzi, an aide to U.N. humanitarian coordinator Hans
von Sponeck, said the first job would be to assess damage from the
airstrikes.
	   On Monday night, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz gave the first
official casualty figures for soldiers in the bombardment, saying
62 were killed and 180 wounded. He repeated assertions that many
more civilians were killed, but refused to give figures.
	   Iraqi authorities have not taken foreign journalists to sites
where they reported heavy civilian casualties as they have in the
past _ an indication the casualties either were not high or were
scattered.
	   The attacks targeted key military bases, government buildings,
communication centers and military factories.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the airstrikes after chief
U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler accused Iraq of failing to
fully cooperate with his inspectors.
	   The weapons inspectors must certify that Iraq is free of weapons
of mass destruction before the U.N. Security Council will lift
economic sanctions imposed on Baghdad for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   Aziz and other officials said the attacks disrupted telephone
communications to Iraq's south and heavily damaged factories that
could be used to manufacture long-range missiles prohibited under
the U.N. resolutions.
	   In Washington, U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Anthony Zinni said the
strikes hit 85 percent of their targets, 74 percent of them
successfully. He said a full damage assessment of damage would
probably take a few more days.
	   Zinni, head of Central Command which oversees U.S. military
operations in the Middle East, showed pictures of damage to Iraq's
Defense Ministry in Baghdad and the headquarter of the ruling Baath
Party.
	   ``I guarantee you, nobody's working in the Baath Party
headquarters,'' he joked, pointing to the scarred building.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, who was with Zinni as he
briefed reporters, termed Operation Desert Fox ``highly
successful.''
	   In London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the airstrikes
have set back parts of Iraq's ``military infrastructure several
years.''
	   Aziz maintained, however, that most of the strikes hit empty
barracks, adding that ``these barracks could be and will be
rebuilt.''
	   A U.S. intelligence report revealed by ABC News said most
critical equipment from inside the missile plants had been moved
and Iraqi technicians responsible for building missiles were at
home in bed _ and not at the plants _ during the attacks.
	   Iraq said that in addition to hitting missile factories, the
bombardments struck colleges, post offices, dormitories, a museum
and an oil refinery.
	   ``They want to ... strip Iraq of any serious industrial
capabilities,'' Aziz told a news conference in Baghdad. ``This is a
policy of hatred.''
	   But he contended that the United States and Britain failed to
seriously harm the Iraqi government or military. ``They boasted of
great success. ... They lied,'' he said.
	   Iraq's state-run newspapers also hit on that theme in editorials
Tuesday.
	   ``We came out victorious over the gang of the devil Butler, the
clown Blair and the adulterer Clinton,'' said the daily Al-Iraq.
	   The daily Al-Jumhuriya carried a headline saying ``Arab and
international anger continues against the American-British crime,''
and the weekly Al-Ittihad said the anger was greatest among
Muslims.
	   Aziz reiterated Monday that Baghdad will not allow U.N. arms
monitors to return, but chief weapons inspector Butler said it was
up to the Security Council to decide the future of the inspectors.
	   ``It's not for Baghdad alone to make that declaration,'' Butler
told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio on Tuesday.

South Korea to hold open bidding to buy submarines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's navy will hold an open
bidding next year to buy several 1,500-ton submarines worth 2
trillion won (dlrs 1.7 billion), Defense Ministry officials said
Tuesday.
	   Until now, the nation's Daewoo Heavy Industries Ltd. has been
the sole provider of submarines for the navy. Since 1986, it has
built the navy seven 1,200-ton submarines designed by Germany's
Howaldatswerke Deutsche Werft AG. and is manufacturing two more for
delivery by 2001.
	   That prompted rival shipbuilder Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. to
complain about what it called unfair competition. In June, the
government's audit agency backed Hyundai's complaint.
	   ``We decided to hold an open bidding because competition will
lead to technological development and more domestic production of
submarine components,'' said Col. Chang Hyun-sup, a ministry
spokesman.
	   Chang said South Korea will first select a foreign submarine
designer through the open bidding and then choose between Daewoo
and Hyundai to build new submarines in a technological tie-up with
that foreign company.
	   He gave no further details. But the national Yonhap News Agency,
quoting unidentified military sources, reported that five submarine
manufacturers from Germany, Sweden, France and Russia have shown
interest in the bidding.
	   No South Korean company possesses the technology to build
submarines on its own.
	   South Korea's navy began buying submarines in 1986 to strengthen
its military capabilities against communist North Korea. The two
Koreas are technically in a state of war as their 1950-53 war ended
with an armistice, not a peace treaty.
	   North Korea has 35 Soviet-designed submarines, according to
South Korean officials.

Top mainland dissident praises Taiwan's democracy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Chinese government's comments in 6-7th grafs

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Exiled Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng on
Tuesday praised Taiwanese lawmakers for contributing to the
island's democracy by replacing once-notorious brawls with serious
debate.
	   Visiting the Legislature on the second day of his first trip to
Taiwan, Wei said mainland authorities had cited pandemonium at the
island's parliament as proof that democracy could not take hold in
a Chinese society.
	   But Wei noted Taiwan's democracy has since matured and ``even
brawls are much better than a closed society where you could not
express your views.''
	   ``More mainlanders now realize the unanimous votes being taken
at our National Peoples' Congress are false,'' he said.
	   Wei was released from a Chinese prison last year after spending
much of the last 18 years in a cell for championing democracy in
China.
	   In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said Wei is a
``criminal on medical parole'' who should not be used for political
purposes.
	   ``China cannot adopt completely direct elections because it is
so large, has large regional and cultural differences,'' Zhu said
at a briefing. ``So for the mainland to adopt a Taiwan-style
democracy is not practical.''
	   Wei won the support of many Taiwanese after appearing at a news
conference Monday to call on Chinese authorities to respect the
right of Taiwan to choose formal independence.
	   Wei, however, also exhibited his pragmatism by urging Taiwanese
to ``exercise their right not to declare independence'' as long as
China threatens to invade.
	   Taipei and Beijing were split politically amid civil war in
1949.
	   Taiwan's ruling Nationalists say the island's peaceful
transition to democracy over the last decade should be a model for
China, but they have generally distanced themselves from exiled
Chinese dissidents, many of whom uphold China's nationalism and its
claim to Taiwan.
	   The United Daily News, a major Taiwanese newspaper, said Wei's
visit could be an important step in fostering dialog between the
people of Taiwan and China.
	   ``Democracy can become a topic of such dialogue,'' the newspaper
said in an editorial.
	   ``Taiwan should play a more positive role in helping mainlanders
to strive for their political freedom ... and thus help itself in
reaching a new relationship'' with China, it said.

Close associate of Blair under fire for home loan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson said Tuesday that
he had done nothing wrong in accepting a large loan from colleague
who is now under investigation by Mandelson's department.
	   The Guardian newspaper said in Tuesday's editions that
Mandelson, a close associate of Prime Minister Tony Blair, received
a loan of 373,000 pounds (dlrs 627,000) in 1996 from fellow
legislator Geoffrey Robinson, who is now the paymaster general.
	   Some of Robinson's business interests are the subject of two
Department of Trade and Industry investigations.
	   Conservative Party spokesmen quickly attacked Mandelson, but he
said: ``I am absolutely sure I have done nothing wrong.''
	   Mandelson, 45, was considered the main strategist for the Labor
Party's landslide victory in the 1997 general election.
	   Robinson, 50, has been a generous backer of the Labor Party, and
1996 he bought New Statesman, a weekly political journal which
supports Labor. He had to apologize to the House of Commons for
failing to declare some of his business interests, and has been
criticized by opposition lawmakers for sheltering some of his
assets in offshore trusts which are not subject to British
taxation.
	   Mandelson did not disclose the loan when he was appointed trade
secretary earlier this year, and informed Blair of the loan last
week, The Guardian said.
	   ``We need to know what strings are attached. We need to know if
Mr. Robinson has bankrolled other senior members of the
government,'' Conservative lawmaker John Redwood said.
	   Conservative Peter Lilley, a former trade secretary, said the
loan should have been disclosed as soon as Mandelson assumed his
present post.
	   ``The first thing that happens when you are appointed is the
permanent secretary, the head civil servant, asks you to know all
your interests, all your assets and liabilities. Peter Mandelson,
it appears, did not tell him the truth,'' Lilley said.
	   Blair's office said he was confident that Mandelson had been
``properly insulated'' from any decision by department officials
related to Robinson's business interests.
	   In an interview on British Broadcasting Corp. radio Tuesday,
Mandelson said the loan was a ``personal arrangement made by two
friends and colleagues.''
	   ``When you come into government you don't automatically lose
your previous friendships or associations or arrangements.
	   ``The key thing though is that when you do bring previous
arrangements and associations into government you make sure there
is no potential conflict of interest arising and that's exactly
what I did.''

Russian parliament puts START II treaty on hold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament has put off debate on the
START II treaty until next spring at the earliest, dashing hopes
that it might act soon on the arms control agreement with the
United States, reports said Tuesday.
	   After refusing to act on the treaty for several years,
parliament was showing signs that it was ready to move. A visiting
U.S. delegation said earlier this month that it thought Russia's
parliament might ratify the treaty before the end of this year.
	   But the recent U.S. bombing campaign against Iraq has stirred up
anti-American sentiment in Russia.
	   Vladimir Ryzhkov, the deputy speaker of parliament's lower
house, said the treaty was put on the agenda for the spring session
of the State Duma.
	   ``This, of course, does not guarantee either the ratification of
the START II treaty, or even that it will be considered by the
State Duma,'' he told Russian news agencies. ``It simply shows that
the State Duma intends to continue work in this direction.''
	   Ryzhkov is a moderate who supports the treaty. But he said
Russian lawmakers still had a ``sharply negative attitude'' toward
last week's U.S. and British air strikes against Iraq. The two
countries bombed Iraq for refusing to cooperate with United Nations
weapons inspectors.
	   Russia and the United States signed the START II treaty in 1993,
and the U.S. Senate ratified it in 1996. Communists and other
hard-liners in Russia's parliament have opposed the treaty on the
grounds it could weaken Russia's security and would be too
expensive to implement.
	   The treaty calls for both countries to cut their nuclear
arsenals in half to about 3,000 to 3,500 warheads each.
	   Russian military officials say many of the country's nuclear
weapons are nearing the end of their service life and will have to
be dismantled regardless of whether the parliament ratifies the
treaty.

	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police carried out a sweep of a
Kosovo Albanian stronghold in retaliation for the killing of one of
their officers in escalating violence that has increased fear of a
return to all-out war in the troubled province.
	   The events occurred as Sadako Ogata, the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees, toured the province Monday to get a firsthand look at
the people on both sides of the ethnic conflict who have been
displaced in past fighting.
	   Ogata then headed for Belgrade for a possible meeting Tuesday
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosovic.
	   In Belgrade on Monday, heads of Yugoslavia's Serb-led army met
with NATO's top commander in Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, who
repeated warnings that the alliance might intervene if fighting
between Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian rebels continues,
sources close to the talks said on condition of anonymity.
	   Milosevic averted threatened NATO airstrikes when he signed a
U.S.-sponsored deal last October, promising an end to the military
campaign against separatists in the overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian
province of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   According to a spokesman for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, Monday's sweep began after the slaying of
Serb policeman Milic Jovic.
	   The spokesman, Jorgen Grunnet, said a column of Yugoslav army
vehicles, including seven T-55 tanks, left a military barracks just
south of Podujevo.
	   Afterward, OSCE staff heard tank and heavy machine gun fire from
the direction of the village of Dobrotin but there have been no
reports of casualties.
	   The vehicles rebased shortly after noon Monday and were fired
upon while passing through the village of Perane, also near
Podujevo.
	   ``We have no reports of any direct fight,'' Grunnet said but
added that the army ``returned fire when heading back to the
barracks.''
	   But Hysen Fazliu, a spokesman for the main ethnic Albanian party
in Podujevo, claimed Serb forces clashed with the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army and that an unspecified number of ethnic Albanians
had been arrested.
	   The KLA spokesman in the Podujevo region, Luizim Oraca, said the
clash lasted two hours and that the ``enemy was forced to withdraw,
and one of their tanks was destroyed.''
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   Podujevo, 40 kilometers (25 miles) north Pristina, is an
overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian town near central Serbia. Tensions
there have risen in past weeks as local Serbs complained of a
growing guerrilla presence and demanded the government protect
them.
	   Jovic's killing is the latest in a series of setbacks for
Kosovo's fragile truce. It is certain to enrage the Serbs, already
furious over last week's killings of six Serb youths in a Kosovo
bar and of a prominent Serb official.
	   The attack on Jovic also heightens fears that violence in Kosovo
is moving from the rugged countryside to the towns.
	   Ogata, accompanied by the William Walker, the American head of
peace monitors in Kosovo, visited a part of the ethnic Albanian
majority Serbian province where both Serbs and ethnic Albanians
have been displaced.
	   Part of her trip Monday took her to recent refugees' dwellings
without electricity, running water or other basics.
	   In the central Kosovo town of Malisevo, a former KLA stronghold
retaken by Serb police and largely deserted by its ethnic Albanian
population, Ogata was told by ethnic Albanians that they would not
return to their homes as long as police were present.
	   Later, Ogata heard Serb demands to help in the search for over a
hundred Serb civilians missing in rebel territory since July.
	   ``All I have to say is that a political agreement and peace can
solve your problems,'' Ogata said. ``Then you will be able to
return to your homes and live together.''

Netanyahu ridicules rivals, demands Palestinian guarantees

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu saying election schedule not causing
Wye freeze; moves up reference to U.S. urging withdrawal and
background on Netanyahu's demands to Palestinians &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opened what
promises to be a bare-knuckles re-election campaign Tuesday by
deriding the ``fantasies and ambitions'' of his political rivals
and insisting the public will back his tough stance toward the
Palestinians.
	   ``We will go to the people and the people will give us the
support to achieve peace with security,'' the prime minister told
Israel radio a day after Israel's parliament voted overwhelmingly
for early elections and rejected Netanyahu's peace policies.
	   The collapse of the prime minister's hard-line governing
coalition and the start of what is expected to be a 4-month-long
contest for the prime minister's job appeared to put the already
ailing Mideast peace process on hold.
	   That is drawing bitter protests from the Palestinians, who
insist Israel is bound to honor the Wye River accord despite the
political turmoil, just as it remains committed to other
pre-existing international agreements.
	   ``It's really unfortunate that the only thing that Mr. Netanyahu
has decided to stop is the peace process with us,'' chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told the AP on Tuesday.
	   Erekat called on the Clinton administration to press Netanyahu
to move ahead with the promised handover of West Bank territory. In
Washington, the State Department said Monday that Israel should go
ahead with the pullback, as stipulated by the accord.
	   Netanyahu refused anew Tuesday to do so, but said the election
upheaval did not play a part in the continued freeze on Israeli
compliance.
	   If the Palestinians meet demands laid down over the weekend by
the Cabinet, ``Israel will carry out its part in the agreement,
without any relation to the election schedule,'' the prime
minister's office said in a statement.
	   Netanyahu's latest conditions to the Palestinians, which they
have rejected, include a renunciation of claims to statehood rights
and Jerusalem; a confiscation of arms; an end to violence and
incitement to violence; and a renunciation of claims that Netanyahu
had agreed to release Palestinians jailed for killings.
	   The prime minister, who remains in his job until the election,
referred indirectly but pointedly to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's oft-made assertion that the Palestinians have a right to
declare a state in May 1999.
	   ``We won't give territory to the Palestinians when they say they
will simply take that territory and will continue the violations
and will decide unilaterally on our future,'' he told Israel radio.
	   The elections are likely to take place by the end of April. In
addition to Netanyahu and Labor Party leader Ehud Barak, a
half-dozen other figures have indicated they will jump into what is
shaping as a wild political free-for-all.
	   Netanyahu brushed aside polls suggesting he would lose by a slim
margin to Barak and by a considerably wider margin to popular
former army chief of staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, who has indicated
his intention to form a centrist party.
	   ``The fantasies and ambitions of all those who want to be prime
minister _ please. We will allow the voters to decide who needs to
lead the state,'' he said in the radio interview. He predicted he
would draw ``utmost, massive'' support from voters affiliated with
his conservative Likud party.
	   Likud, though, was already weathering a storm of defections. Dan
Meridor, Netanyahu's former finance minister, said Tuesday he was
quitting the party and entering the race for prime minister
himself.
	   Others likely to declare their candidacy include hard-liners
such as Benjamin Begin, the son of the late Prime Minister Menachem
Begin, and Limor Livnat, Netanyahu's communications minister.
Livnat's rumored candidacy has troubled ultra-Orthodox legislators
who question a woman's fitness for leadership.
	   The early elections bill given preliminary approval by lawmakers
on Monday must pass two more parliamentary readings, but Netanyahu
has said he will not try to block its final passage.
	   The unraveling of Netanyahu's coalition began with the signing
of the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace accord two months ago. The
pact's land-for-security provisions infuriated far-right lawmakers
_ a small but powerful faction in Netanyahu's government _ who
insist on Israel's biblical claim to all the West Bank.
	   The dovish opposition Labor party promised Netanyahu support as
long as he stuck to the agreement, but that fell apart earlier this
month when the prime minister scrapped a scheduled troop withdrawal
from 5 percent of the West Bank after a wave of anti-Israel
violence.

UN gives dlrs 900,000 for Laos opium crop substitution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The United Nations Drug Control Program
has granted the government of Laos dlrs 900,000 for a program aimed
at eradicating opium growing and consumption, Laos government radio
said on Tuesday.
	   Parts of Laos are in the Golden Triangle, the jungle region
where the borders of Laos, Myanmar and Thailand converge and which
is a prime source of the world's supply of opium, the raw material
for heroin.
	   The report said the program will focus on Oudomsay province, the
second largest opium producing province in the country, and will
include aspects of community development, crop substitution, income
generation, environmental management, health and education.
	   It will also include treatment programs for addicts.
	   The grant will be distributed over a three-year period.

Death row convict weds girlfriend in prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines' first death row
convict to be scheduled for execution in 22 years married his
girlfriend in ceremonies inside his cell Tuesday, radio reports
said.
	   Leo Echegaray has been sentenced to die by lethal injection
between Jan. 4 and 8 at the suburban National Penitentiary for
raping the daughter of another girlfriend.
	   Echegaray and Zenaida Javier were married by the prison chaplain
Roberto Olaguer after the Department of Justice gave approval
Tuesday afternoon.
	   No reporters were allowed to cover the ceremonies, the reports
said.
	   ``The couple were happy because they were finally married,''
media reports quoted one woman, who witnessed the wedding, as
saying.
	   Prison officials were unavailable for comment.
	   Echegaray is the first among 844 death-row inmates to be
scheduled for execution. The planned execution has triggered a
debate among Filipinos over capital punishment.
	   Several countries, including the European Union, the Vatican and
Canada, have appealed to President Joseph Estrada to cancel
Echegaray's execution and repeal the death penalty.
	   Estrada has refused to pardon Echegaray, saying his execution
will deter similar crimes.
	   In 1987, a new constitution abolished the death penalty but gave
Congress the option to restore it for ``heinous'' crimes such as
murder, ransom kidnapping, rape and drug trafficking.
	   Legislators, alarmed by a rise in crime, took that option,
bringing back the death penalty in 1994.
	   Many Filipinos believe that the death penalty will deter crime,
and that crime remains rampant because no one has been executed.
	   Roman Catholic bishops and other civic groups opposed to the
death penalty say there is no proof of that, and that poor people
are more likely to be sentenced to death because they cannot afford
good lawyers.

Christmas lottery distributes winnings in Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Christmas festivities started Tuesday in
Spanish towns whose residents split the 300 million pesetas (dlrs
2.1-million) top prize in Spain's lottery _ billed as the world's
richest.
	   The lottery, known as ``El Gordo'' (The Fat One), sells 66,000
tickets valued at 30,000 pesetas (dlrs 2,100) for each of 140
numbered series. The tickets are subsequently divided into 10
shares worth 3,000 pesetas (dlrs 21) each.
	   Most Spaniards share tickets with family, friends and
co-workers, so lottery windfalls ripple through whole communities.
	   Millions of television viewers watched Madrid schoolchildren
pick out numbered balls from drums and sing out the winning number
_ 21856 _ on Tuesday morning.
	   The second prize of 144 million pesetas (dlrs 1 million) was for
number 07308.
	   The annual lottery, which began in 1818, was dishing out
194-billion pesetas (dlrs 1.4-billion) this year to thousands of
winners throughout Spain.
	   Income from ticket sales was 250 billion pesetas (dlrs 1.8
billion) this year, 8.9 percent higher than last year, according to
the State Lottery Department.
	   The Spanish Treasury takes 30 percent of the prize money before
the draw takes place to keep the winnings tax-free.

Asian stock markets close generally mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally mixed
Tuesday, with the key index tumbling in Tokyo but surging in
Taipei.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 373.50
points, or 2.64 percent, to close at 13,779.45 _ its lowest close
since Oct. 30. On Monday, the average closed down 41.34 points, or
0.29 percent.
	   Share prices fell as declines in the bond market were seen
hurting one of the few profitable operations at Japan's ailing
banks: their bond trading business.
	   Investors are worried that new bond issues by the Japanese
government to pay for fiscal stimulus spending will cause a glut in
the market, traders said.
	   Stock prices also took a tumble after Japan's finance minister
said the ministry's trust bureau, one of the biggest market
participants, will cease its monthly purchases in January.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 117.08 yen in late
afternoon trading in Tokyo, up 2.18 yen from late Monday here and
above its late New York level of 116.21 yen.
	   Share prices in Taiwan closed sharply higher, boosted by a
market stablization fund set up by the government to prop up the
flagging bourse.
	   Traders said retail investors took their lead from the
stabilization fund and moved into market in search of blue-chip
stocks.
	   The Taiwan market's key Weighted Stock Price Index surged 224.40
points, or 3.4 percent, to 6,782.68.
	   Elsewhere:
	   HONG KONG: Share prices closed generally lower Tuesday as
investors took profits following three consecutive sessions of
gains. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 73.45 points, or 0.7
percent, closing at 10,322.56.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher for the sixth
straight session. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 23.39
points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,085.39.
	   MANILA: Philippine share prices closed mixed, with Wall Street's
overnight gain reviving interest in blue chips, though not enough
to boost demand for second-liners. The 30-share Philippine Stock
Exchange Index rose 20.51 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,893.66.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher, pushed up by
local corporate news. The All Ordinaries Index rose 21.8 points, or
0.8 percent, to 2,759.8 points.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed sharply lower as investors took
profits following Monday's surge when the index gained 7.7 percent.
The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 17.52 points, or 3.1
percent, to 547.75.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Share prices closed sharply lower as investors
continued to take profits from last week's gains. The benchmark
Composite Index fell 13.62, or 2.5 percent, to 537.22.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed mixed in quiet trading. The
Composite Index rose 1.962 points, or 0.4 percent, to 406.465.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mixed as a sharp rise in bank
shares pushed up the benchmark index, while electronics stocks
opted out of the rally. The Straits Times Index rose 14.67 points,
or 1.1 percent, to 1,412.40.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed higher, pushed up by retail
buying in financial stocks whose prices have fallen recently,
dealers said. The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index rose 6.17
points, or 1.8 percent, to 343.34.

Evacuated U.N. humanitarian workers head back to Baghdad

entering Iraq, oil leaving. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ About 120 U.N. humanitarian workers,
evacuated from Iraq last week during U.S.-British air attacks, left
Amman on Tuesday to return to the Iraqi capital Baghdad.
	   Before departing, many in the group were smiling and taking
photos of each other in front of the buses that will take them on
the more than 12-hour journey across the desert.
	   ``We are very happy to be going back to take up our work in
Iraq,'' Darleen Biseau said as she boarded one of the three buses
making the journey, along with eight four-wheel-drive cars.
	   The U.N. workers had left the Iraqi capital on the second day of
the airstrikes on Iraq.
	   Biseau, who works on the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program in
Baghdad, had described her trip to Amman on arrival Saturday as a
journey the U.N. workers made with tears for the people they left
behind. She said the bombardment would add to the suffering of
Iraqis.
	   She said she was ``hoping for the best'' in returning.
	   Abdullah Odeh, resident representative in Amman for the U.N.
Development Program, said all the agency personnel who left Baghdad
except those on holiday leaves were returning to ``pick up the
pieces'' of their work.
	   ``They will continue the mission they are there for, which is
the full humanitarian mission,'' he added.
	   The oil-for-food program is an exception to punishing trade
sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait. It allows Iraq to sell limited quantities of
oil to buy needed food and medicine for its 22 million people.
	   Most of the U.N. workers departing Amman refused to talk to
reporters.
	   The workers were evacuated after spending the first night of the
airstrikes last Thursday huddled in their headquarters on the
outskirts of Baghdad.
	   Those who had remained in Baghdad were special U.N. envoy
Prakash Shah, U.N. humanitarian coordinator Hans von Sponeck, and
26 other U.N. workers.
	   Meanwhile, a statement issued by the U.N. humanitarian spokesman
in New York, John Mills, said that the flow of food and medicine
into Iraq resumed Monday via Umm Qasr in southern Iraq and were to
restart at the Jordanian and Syrian borders on Tuesday.
	   Through the airstrikes, the border crossings between Turkey and
Kurdish areas in northern Iraq remained open, the statement said.
	   It also confirmed earlier reports that oil exports had continued
normally via the southern Iraqi port of Al-Bakr and the Turkish
port of Ceyhan. It said the value of oil exported since the
beginning of fifth phase of the oil-for-food program on Nov. 26 was
about dlrs 172 million.
	   The program allows Iraq to sell dlrs 5.2 billion dollars worth
of oil in a six-month period to buy needed food and medicine for
its 22 million people.
	   But the government has said that low world oil prices and
problems stepping up production at its badly maintained oil
facilities won't allow it to meet the sales target.

China offers to work with US to solve Iraq crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Although strongly opposed to the U.S.-led bombing
of Iraq, China offered Tuesday to work with the United States to
resolve the crisis over U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said China and the United
States should work together in the U.N. Security Council.
	   ``This is not only good for the restoration of world peace and
security but also for the healthy and stable development of
China-U.S. relations,'' Zhu said.
	   The U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq last week left the
Security Council sharply divided, especially over the future of the
inspections. Under the Gulf War cease-fire, the inspectors need to
certify Iraq has dismantled its missiles and nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons before sanctions can be lifted.
	   Russia and China want the sanctions removed and have demanded
the ouster of the chief weapons inspector, Richard Butler, who
heads the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM.
	   Zhu did not offer any new suggestions for resolving the crisis,
except to say that China was considering whether UNSCOM's
``approach and composition'' should be changed.
	   The United States and Britain want UNSCOM to continue its job
and support Butler.
	   Butler's report last week concluding Iraq failed to cooperate
fully with U.N. weapons inspectors triggered four days of air
strikes.

Pigeon feeding outlawed in Amsterdam neighborhood
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Peace on earth, good will toward
men. But not toward pigeons, say officials in an Amsterdam
neighborhood that has declared war on the ``flying rats.''
	   In a bid to rid itself of a plague of pooping pigeons, the Bos
en Lommer municipality has outlawed feeding the birds and will fine
anyone caught breaking the new edict.
	   The inner-city municipality will slap a 150-guilder (dlrs 83)
fine on anyone caught feeding the birds and a 250-guilder (dlrs
139) fine on serial cereal distributors _ those caught more than
once.
	   The measure is the latest in a series of measures aimed at
tackling the plague of pigeons in the Dutch capital. Earlier
anti-pigeon plans have included poisoning their food and sowing it
with anti-conception drugs. Neither has had a noticeable effect.
	   ``We are getting more and more reports'' of pigeon problems, a
city official told the Dutch daily De Volkskrant for Tuesday's
edition.
	   The official, identified only as G. Otten, calls the pigeons
``flying rats.''
	   ``Rats carry annoying diseases and that is sometimes the case
with pigeons too.''

Philippine shares mixed, peso down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing exchange rate

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine shares ended mixed Tuesday
with Wall Street's overnight gains reviving interest in blue-chips,
but failing to boost demand for second-liners, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index closed 20.51
points, or 1.1 percent, higher at 1,893.66, following its
13.21-point, or 0.7 percent, drop Monday to 1,873.15.
	   Decliners, however, edged out gainers 45 to 43, while 45 issues
were unchanged, based on preliminary results.
	   Shares of San Miguel Corp. dominated trading on the back of
persistent, though unconfirmed, reports that Filipino-Chinese
tycoon Lucio Tan wants to revive his bid to take over the country's
largest food and beverage conglomerate.
	   Shares of Centennial City, a real estate holding company, rose
8.7 percent after President Joseph Estrada announced the government
may sign a contract in January that would enable the firm to pursue
its 750-hectare (1,853-acre) reclamation project along Manila Bay.
	   The project was halted last year following allegations of
bribery. Proponents of the project had to restart talks with the
government on the terms of the joint venture. An endorsement by
Estrada is seen advancing the multi-billion peso (multi-million
dollar) project.
	   Ian Kane, trader for Anscor-Hagedorn Securities Inc., said the
Dow Jones Industrial Average's 85.22-point rise Monday to 8,988.85,
gave investors reason to resume accumulating oversold
index-heavyweight stocks.
	   ``But people are still cautious,'' he said. ``They want to wait
and see if the index run-up was just a reaction to Wall Street. If
it turns out that way, the market may resume its downturn in the
next sessions since there's no fundamental reason for the market to
go up.''
	   The Philippine peso closed lower against the dollar in light
trading Tuesday, weighed by the weaker regional currencies in
reaction to dollar buying following Wall Street's gains, traders
said.
	   At the close, the dollar averaged 39.084 pesos on the Philippine
Dealing System, up from Monday's average of 38.985 pesos.
	   The dollar traded at a thin rage of 39.040 pesos to 39.130
pesos. It was last traded at 39.090 pesos.
	   Volume totaled dlrs 61.2 million compared with dlrs 81.6 million
Monday.
	   ``The peso merely took its cue from regional trading,'' a trader
with a foreign bank said, noting actual dollar demand was scarce.

Schroeder cautious on German nuclear shutdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder denied reports
that he has agreed to give German utilities at least 20 years to
scrap nuclear power, but he made it clear the shutdown won't be
quick.
	   Schroeder's center-left government took power after September
elections pledging to shut down Germany's 19 nuclear plants.
	   But in an interview published Tuesday, Schroeder rejected
pressure for a fast timetable from the environmentalist Greens, his
junior government partner, and others.
	   ``Some people's ideas of making it by 2004 are mistaken,'' he
told the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper. ``This will
take significantly longer.''
	   He said he remains committed to seeking a shutdown strategy in
talks with power companies starting next month.
	   German media have reported that the two sides reached an
understanding on a timetable in preliminary talks last week.
	   Schroeder has said he could support 20 years, but one report
said he had agreed to give power companies a longer grace period so
they will renounce damage claims for lost earnings.
	   Schroeder insisted there was no accord yet.
	   ``I don't want to pin myself down on the time period,'' he told
the newspaper.

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ After carving up Bosnia's
territory, the rival ethnic groups are now fighting over one of the
country's cultural treasures _ a 600-year-old Jewish holy book.
	   The Sarajevo Haggadah, handwritten on bleached calf-skin, dates
back to the once-thriving Jewish community in Spain. A Haggadah
tells the story of the exodus of the Jews from ancient Egypt, and
Jews recite from the book during the Passover holiday.
	   The 109-page Sarajevo Haggadah was carried to Italy in 1492
after King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain expelled the
country's Jews. It was brought to Bosnia by a rabbi and handed down
through his family until a descendant, Joseph Kohen, sold it to the
National Museum in 1894.
	   As such, the priceless manuscript belongs to the government of
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
	   The 1995 Dayton peace agreement, however, effectively
partitioned the country along ethnic lines _ Serb, Muslim and
Croat.
	   Now the Bosnian Serbs are demanding one-third ownership of the
Sarajevo Haggadah and are insisting that it be exhibited in Banja
Luka, capital of their mini-state, every third year.
	   In principle, the manuscript would also be exhibited every third
year in Mostar, the unofficial Bosnian Croat capital. The Muslims
would prefer the Haggadah be kept in what had been its traditional
home _ the National Museum in Sarajevo.
	   But the National Museum was heavily damaged during the wartime
siege of Sarajevo, and the bullet-scarred Austro-Hungarian era
structure has not been rebuilt. For now, the manuscript is kept in
the vault of the National Bank.
	   Jakob Finci, the head of Sarajevo's Jewish Community, wants the
manuscript to remain in the national capital. Finci says Bosnian
Serb and Bosnian Croat nationalists have a record of destroying
cultural and religious monuments of rival groups during the
1992-1995 Bosnian war.
	   ``They (the Serbs) blew up the Ferhadija, the others (the
Croats) blew up the Old Bridge,'' Finci said, referring to an
ancient mosque in Banja Luka and the world-renowned Ottoman bridge
in Mostar, which were both more than 400 years old.
	   ``Bosnia's body is, 11th graf pvs.

Report: South Korean dissident defects to North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean dissident has defected
to North Korea, the communist country's state-run news agency
reported Tuesday.
	   Yoon Sung-shik, 60, said he defected to the North because
``justice, progress, democracy and reunification of Koreas cannot
be realized'' under the South Korean government, the North's
official Korean Central News Agency said.
	   About 200 North Koreans have escaped to South Korea in the past
three years, reporting widespread hunger in the isolated country.
But it is rare for a South Korean to defect to the North.
	   The agency gave no details about Yoon's escape route.
	   Seoul's government spy agency _ the Agency for National Security
Planning _ said Yoon disappeared while visiting an unidentified
third country to seek treatment for a heart ailment. The agency
didn't elaborate.
	   North Korea described Yoon as an active dissident leader,
involved in four dissident groups.
	   But the groups were considered minor in the South's dissident
movement. Two of them confirmed that Yoon was a member but said
they have little personal data on the man.
	   The Korean Peninsula was divided into the communist North and
capitalist South in 1945. The Koreas are technically still at war
because their 1950-53 war ended with an armistice, not a peace
treaty.

China tells balloon to land, but organizers say that's unsafe

	   LONDON (AP) _ China ordered a round-the-world balloon expedition
to land Tuesday but organizers of the expedition said they didn't
dare because of the rugged terrain.
	   ``Impossible _ landing in that area is life-threatening,'' said
project director Mike Kendrick in London, after the balloon team
disclosed the Chinese decision.
	   Earlier, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it regretted that
British tycoon Richard Branson, American millionaire Steve Fossett
and Per Lindstrand of Sweden did not abide by an earlier agreement
to fly over southernmost China below 26 degrees north latitude.

	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao ha said China could not

	   Organizers of the expedition apologized, said they were trying
to head south as quickly as wind and weather permitted _ which is
about 50 mph (80 kmh). They said the balloon was forced off course
by storms, the U.S.-British military campaign in Iraq and the
refusal of two other countries to permit their flight.

briefing. ``China will not take responsibility for the

Prosecutor requests new arrest warrant for Kurdish rebel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A Rome prosecutor has asked that Abdullah Ocalan be
put back in jail, saying the Kurdish rebel leader must be kept
under surveillance in case an appeals court rules in favor of his
extradition to Turkey.
	   Italy has so far refused to extradite Ocalan, citing laws that
forbid it from extraditing suspects to countries where they face
the death penalty. But the Rome prosecutor in charge of the case,
Giovanni Malerba, on Monday indicated that Ocalan could be
extradited for crimes that are not punishable with the death
penalty.
	   Turkey considers Ocalan a terrorist and is the country's No. 1
fugitive.
	   Ocalan, who heads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, was
arrested Nov. 12 when he flew into Rome from Moscow. He was freed a
week later but ordered not to leave Rome.
	   Last week, Rome's appeals court lifted all restrictions on the
Kurdish rebel after Germany withdrew an international arrest
warrant it had issued against him for its own terrorism charges.
	   Italy's justice minister must now decide whether to take up
Malerba's request for a new arrest warrant.
	   Ocalan has requested political asylum in Italy, but Premier
Massimo D'Alema's center-left government is split over what to do.
	   The possibilities mentioned include sending Ocalan to a
third-country. South Africa, Libya, Pakistan or North Korea have
been mentioned as possibilities.
	   Close to 37,000 people have been killed since Ocalan's rebel
group began fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey in 1984.

Netanyahu ridicules rivals, demands Palestinian guarantees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Netanyahu saying election schedule not
causing Wye freeze; moves up reference to U.S. urging withdrawal
and background on Netanyahu's demands to Palestinians. No Pickup. &QL;

 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opened what
promises to be a bare-knuckles re-election campaign Tuesday by
deriding the ``fantasies and ambitions'' of his political rivals
and insisting the public will back his tough stance toward the
Palestinians.
	   ``We will go to the people and the people will give us the
support to achieve peace with security,'' the prime minister told
Israel radio a day after Israel's parliament voted overwhelmingly
for early elections and rejected Netanyahu's peace policies.
	   The collapse of the prime minister's hard-line governing
coalition and the start of what is expected to be a four-month
contest for the prime minister's job appeared to put the already
ailing Mideast peace process on hold.
	   That is drawing bitter protests from the Palestinians, who
insist Israel is bound to honor the Wye River accord despite the
political turmoil, just as it remains committed to other
international agreements.
	   ``It's really unfortunate that the only thing that Mr. Netanyahu
has decided to stop is the peace process with us,'' chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told The Associated Press on
Tuesday.
	   Erekat urged the Clinton administration to press Netanyahu to
move ahead with the promised handover of West Bank territory. In
Washington, the U.S. State Department said Monday that Israel
should go ahead with the pullback, as stipulated by the accord.
	   Netanyahu refused anew Tuesday to do so, but said the election
upheaval did not play a part in the continued freeze on Israeli
compliance.
	   If the Palestinians meet demands laid down over the weekend by
the Cabinet, ``Israel will carry out its part in the agreement,
without any relation to the election schedule,'' the prime
minister's office said in a statement.
	   Netanyahu's latest conditions to the Palestinians, which they
have rejected, include: renouncing claims to statehood rights and
Jerusalem; confiscating arms; ending violence and incitement to
violence; and renouncing claims that Netanyahu had agreed to
release Palestinians jailed for killings.
	   The prime minister, who remains in his job until the election,
referred indirectly but pointedly to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's oft-made assertion that the Palestinians have a right to
declare a state in May 1999.
	   ``We won't give territory to the Palestinians when they say they
will simply take that territory and will continue the violations
and will decide unilaterally on our future,'' he told Israel radio.
	   The elections are likely to take place by the end of April. In
addition to Netanyahu and Labor Party leader Ehud Barak, a
half-dozen other figures have indicated they will jump into what is
shaping as a wild political free-for-all.
	   Netanyahu brushed aside polls suggesting he would lose by a slim
margin to Barak and by a considerably wider margin to popular
former army chief of staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, who has indicated
his intention to form a centrist party.
	   ``The fantasies and ambitions of all those who want to be prime
minister _ please. We will allow the voters to decide who needs to
lead the state,'' he said in the radio interview. He predicted he
would draw ``utmost, massive'' support from voters affiliated with
his conservative Likud party.
	   Likud, though, was already weathering a storm of defections. Dan
Meridor, Netanyahu's former finance minister, said Tuesday he was
quitting the party and entering the race for prime minister
himself.
	   Others likely to declare their candidacy include hard-liners
such as Benjamin Begin, the son of the late Prime Minister Menachem
Begin, and Limor Livnat, Netanyahu's communications minister.
Livnat's rumored candidacy has troubled ultra-Orthodox legislators
who question a woman's fitness for leadership.
	   The early elections bill given preliminary approval by lawmakers
on Monday must pass two more parliamentary readings, but Netanyahu
has said he will not try to block its final passage.
	   The unraveling of Netanyahu's coalition began with the signing
of the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace accord two months ago. The
pact's land-for-security provisions infuriated far-right lawmakers
_ a small but powerful faction in Netanyahu's government _ who
insist on Israel's biblical claim to all the West Bank.
	   The dovish opposition Labor party promised Netanyahu support as
long as he stuck to the agreement, but that fell apart earlier this
month when the prime minister scrapped a scheduled troop withdrawal
from 5 percent of the West Bank after a wave of anti-Israel
violence.

LONDON: the consequences.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Beijing had given permission for the ICO Global balloon to
travel only over southernmost China. It would have effectively kept
the balloonists away from the isolated Tibetan plateau, where
rescue would be difficult, and out of busy air traffic corridors
monitored by a spotty air traffic control system.
	   But because of diversions around Mediterranean storms and Iraq,
and the refusal of Russia and Iran to open their airspace, the
balloon crossed the Himalayas further north than planned and
entered China 250 miles (400 kms) north of the agreed airspace
corridor early Tuesday morning, Chinese time.
	   Kendrick said Chinese air traffic controllers were informed the
moment the balloon passed over the border, with an apology added to
the communication. The balloon team continued to contact them every
15 minutes to keep the Chinese informed about their position.
	   In February, China withheld permission for a European balloon
team to fly through its airspace, forcing them to land and end
their around-the-world bid.
	   As it became apparent early Monday that the balloon would
inevitably cross into unauthorized Chinese territory, Prime
Minister Tony Blair sent a message to Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
asking for China's help.
	   The ICO Global balloon had already run into trouble on its trip.
Libya unexpectedly revoked permission to enter its airspace, but
the situation was resolved shortly before the three-man crew flew
over the country on Saturday.
	   Then, after steering around thunderstorms near Cyprus, the crew
had to maneuver the 270-foot (82-meter) craft through narrow gaps
between no-fly territories, including Iraq.
	   The crew members estimate the trip could last from eight days to
nearly three weeks. They hope to touch down somewhere in western
Europe at the end of a 24,000-mile (38,000 kms) flight, which will
take them over India, the South China sea, the Pacific and the
United States.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.

Death convict weds girlfriend in prison
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from new bride, other details

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines' first death row
convict to be scheduled for execution in 22 years married his
girlfriend in ceremonies inside his cell at the suburban National
Penitentiary Tuesday, reports said.
	   Leo Echegaray has been sentenced to die by lethal injection
between Jan. 4 and 8 at the suburban National Penitentiary for
raping the daughter of another girlfriend.
	   Echegaray and Zenaida Javier were married by the prison chaplain
Roberto Olaguer after the Department of Justice gave approval
Tuesday afternoon.
	   ``We are happy. Although we know he is about to be executed, we
are not losing hope,'' Ms. Javier said in a television interview
outside the prison building.
	   No reporters were allowed to cover the ceremonies but several
relatives and friends were allowed to witness the wedding, the
reports said.
	   ``The couple were happy because they were finally married. We
who also witnessed the wedding were also happy,'' said one woman
who said she was a neighbor of the Echegaray family.
	   ``Leo could not speak because he was on the verge of tears, and
all he could say was `Thank you,''' she added.
	   Prison officials were unavailable for comment.
	   Echegaray is the first among 844 death-row inmates to be
scheduled for execution. The planned execution has triggered a
debate among Filipinos over capital punishment.
	   The European Union, the Vatican, Canada, and others have
appealed to President Joseph Estrada to cancel Echegaray's
execution and repeal the death penalty.
	   Estrada has refused to pardon Echegaray, saying his execution
will deter similar crimes.
	   In 1987, a new constitution abolished the death penalty but gave
Congress the option to restore it for ``heinous'' crimes such as
murder, ransom kidnapping, rape and drug trafficking.
	   Legislators, alarmed by a rise in crime, took that option,
bringing back the death penalty in 1994.
	   Many Filipinos believe that the death penalty will deter crime,
and that crime remains rampant because no one has been executed.
	   Roman Catholic bishops and other civic groups opposed to the
death penalty say there is no proof of that, and that poor people
are more likely to be sentenced to death because they cannot afford
good lawyers.

Islamic Group denies it threatened U.S., Kuwaiti interests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A militant Islamic group has denied reports
that it threatened to bomb U.S. and Kuwaiti interests to avenge the
American and British airstrikes on Iraq, a leading Arab newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   The London-based Al-Hayat quoted sources close to al-Gamaa
al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, as denying that its members
contacted news organizations to threaten attacks.
	   It was not immediately clear if the denial reflected a split in
the leadership of the Islamic Group. In recent months, Egyptian
leaders of the group have urged an end to violent activities here,
but militants abroad have said the struggle should continue against
the Egyptian government.
	   Al-Hayat reported Monday that it had received a statement and a
phone call from people claiming to represent the Islamic Group.
They urged a ``holy war'' against the United States and threatened
to blow up Kuwaiti embassies.
	   In the denial published Tuesday, the paper quoted an Islamic
Group source as saying: ``The group does not announce in advance
the operations it plans to carry out, in order to protect its
credibility and members.''
	   The source was not identified, but the article carried a Cairo
dateline.
	   The United States and Britain last week carried out four days of
punishing airstrikes against Iraq after the chief U.N. weapons
inspector, Richard Butler, said the Baghdad regime was not
cooperating in the inspectors' search for weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The attack lead to widespread protests around the Arab world.
	   The Islamic Group carried out a six-year campaign of violence
aimed at toppling Egypt's secular government that led to more than
1,250 deaths. The group wants to install an Islamic regime.

Signs of emerging deal to end Polish miners' protest

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said Tuesday
the government didn't intend to deprive miners and others working
in dangerous conditions of early retirement privileges.
	   Responding to a strike threat from miners protesting proposed
changes in their pension rules, Buzek said he believed the labor
dispute could be solved within the next 24 hours.
	   Government officials and leaders of the Solidarity union were to
meet Tuesday to discuss early retirement schemes for miners, while
more than 400 workers in 52 mines continued an underground sit-in.
	   Alarmed by the government pension reform that sets the
retirement age at 65 for men and 60 for women, Solidarity miners
began the sit-in Dec. 10 to demand keeping the present system,
which allows them to retire after 25 years of work, no matter their
age. They also oppose a mining restructuring plan that would cut
jobs and production.
	   Workers at coal mines in Silesia, as well as copper, zinc and
lead ore mines, staged a warning strike Monday and voted
overwhelmingly to hold a general strike on an undetermined date.
	   Solidarity's Mining Section said Tuesday that 98 percent of
miners supported the strike.
	   Buzek, attempting to calm the atmosphere, said his
Solidarity-led government never proposed that ``people working in
such difficult conditions like miners had to work until they are
65.''
	   He said the government was negotiating final details of
so-called ``bridge pensions'' for miners retiring after 25 years of
work, covering them until they become eligible to regular pensions
at 65.
	   Buzek's Cabinet, which took over the office in October 1997 from
a leftist government, has been working on widespread social and
economic reforms expected to complete Poland's transition from
communism to a market economy.
	   The reforms include restructuring ailing industries such as
mining and steel. Coal mining restructuring calls for reducing
production from 137 million tons last year to 110 million tons in
2002, as well as cutting jobs by more than 40 percent _ from
245,000 now to 138,000 in three years.
	   Coal mining, once the country's leading hard-currency earner
during communist times, is still heavily subsidized under Poland's
market reforms that began in 1989.

Evacuated U.N. humanitarian workers head back to Baghdad

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ About 120 U.N. humanitarian workers,
evacuated from Iraq last week during U.S.-British air attacks, left
Amman on Tuesday to return to Baghdad.
	   Before departing, many in the group were smiling and taking
photos of each other in front of the buses that will take them on
the more than 12-hour journey across the desert.
	   ``We are very happy to be going back to take up our work in
Iraq,'' Darleen Biseau said as she boarded one of the three buses
making the journey.
	   The U.N. workers left the Iraqi capital on the second day of the
airstrikes on Iraq.
	   Biseau, who works on the U.N.-approved oil-for-food program in
Baghdad, on Saturday described her trip to Amman as a journey the
U.N. workers made with tears for the people they left behind. She
said the bombardment would add to the suffering of Iraqis.
	   She said she was ``hoping for the best'' in returning.
	   Abdullah Odeh, resident representative in Amman for the U.N.
Development Program, said agency personnel who left Baghdad were
returning to ``pick up the pieces'' of their work.
	   ``They will continue the mission they are there for, which is
the full humanitarian mission,'' he added.
	   The oil-for-food program is an exception to punishing trade
sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait. It allows Iraq to sell limited quantities of
oil to buy needed food and medicine for its 22 million people.
	   Most of the U.N. workers departing Amman refused to talk to
reporters.
	   The workers were evacuated after spending the first night of the
airstrikes last Thursday huddled in their headquarters on the
outskirts of Baghdad.
	   Those who had remained in Baghdad were special U.N. envoy
Prakash Shah, U.N. humanitarian coordinator Hans von Sponeck, and
26 other U.N. workers.
	   Meanwhile, a statement issued by the U.N. humanitarian spokesman
in New York, John Mills, said that the flow of food and medicine
into Iraq resumed Monday via Umm Qasr in southern Iraq and were to
restart Tuesday at the Jordanian and Syrian borders.
	   Through the airstrikes, the border crossings between Turkey and
Kurdish areas in northern Iraq remained open, the statement said.
	   It also confirmed earlier reports that oil exports had continued
normally via the southern Iraqi port of Al-Bakr and the Turkish
port of Ceyhan. It said the value of oil exported since the
beginning of fifth phase of the oil-for-food program on Nov. 26 was
about dlrs 172 million.
	   The program allows Iraq to sell dlrs 5.2 billion dollars worth
of oil in a six-month period to buy needed food and medicine for
its 22 million people.
	   But the government has said that low world oil prices and
problems stepping up production at its badly maintained oil
facilities won't let it meet the sales target.

Moroccan star signs contract with Southampton

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHAMPTON, England (AP) _ Moroccan international striker
Hassan Kachloul, who scored in the 3-1 victory that lifted
Southampton off the foot of the Premier League on Saturday, has
signed a 2 1/2 year contract by the club.
	   Hired from French runner up Metz on a three-month deal, Kachloul
has impressed Saints manager Dave Jones who has now signed the
27-year-old forward until June 2001.
	   ``Someone recommended him to me, and the next thing I know he
turned up on our doorstep with two suitcases,'' Jones said on
Tuesday.
	   ``But he's really impressed me with his attitude and skill. I'm
delighted to have signed him on a long-term deal, and we are now
working on improving his stamina levels to ensure he can last the
full 90 minutes.''

Newspaper says George Mitchell will head USOC probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ US West, a major sponsor of Salt Lake's
2002 Winter Olympics, has written the head of the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee a strong letter protesting the ``unsavory
allegations'' surrounding the bid for the games.
	   There are three official inquiries into the scholarships the
Salt Lake bid committee gave to six relatives of International
Olympic Committee members. There also have been allegations
regarding medical care and expensive gifts, including shotguns and
skis, given to some IOC members.
	   IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch scheduled a special meeting
of his executive board Jan. 22-23 to deal with a report on the IOC
investigation into the Salt Lake City allegations.
	   SLOC's ethics committee also is investigating, and the U.S.
Olympic Committee is launching its own probe under the guidance of
former Sen. George Mitchell.
	   US West has asked SLOC President Frank Joklik to ``clarify what
has transpired and what actions the Olympic movement is taking to
address these issues.''
	   Mark Roellig, US West's general counsel, said in a Dec. 18
letter obtained by The Salt Lake Tribune and KTVX that ``the ideals
and spirit of the Olympic Games and the values and high standards
of the athletes draw companies like ours to sponsor the process and
to use these powerful symbols of commitment, determination and fair
play in our marketing, management and community affairs efforts.
	   ``The very core of these ideals and the spirit of the Games are
now under scrutiny and perhaps tainted. This is an extremely
serious issue for all of us,'' wrote Roellig.
	   He asked what is being done to ``restore the integrity of the
Olympic brand'' and ``Are there going to be any more `surprises'
that you are aware of?''
	   Relations with corporate sponsors concern the USOC, which is the
lead entity in a joint marketing agreement with SLOC.
	   Any scandal that undermines that effort is a concern to the
USOC, which called an 1500 GMT teleconference with the press to
announce its own investigation.
	   Mitchell, the former Senate Democratic leader from Maine, is
chairman of the USOC's Ethics Oversight Committee, and will head
the investigation. Now a Washington lawyer, Mitchell also was
President Bill Clinton's negotiator of this spring's peace accord
between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland.
	   The New York Times reported Tuesday that Kenneth Duberstein, a
White House chief of staff under President Ronald Reagan, will be
the co-chairman of the panel that also will include Donald Fehr,
executive director of the baseball players union; Roberta Cooper
Ramo, a New Mexico attorney who was the first female president of
the American Bar Association; and Jeff Benz, a member of the USOC's
athletes advisory council.

Anti-Euro demonstrators target central bank's party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UTRECHT, Netherlands (AP) _ A group of squatters protesting the
introduction of the single European currency attacked a concert
hall where the staff of the Dutch central bank were holding their
Christmas party, pelting the building with eggs and smashing
windows.
	   About 50 squatters attacked the Vredenburg hall in Utrecht 50
kilometers (31 miles) east of Amsterdam where 350 staff members
from the Netherlands Bank were partying on Monday night.
	   Police called to break up the protest arrested five
demonstrators, Dutch television news reported Tuesday.
	   The single European currency, the euro, will debut on paper on
Jan. 1. Euro coins and notes come into circulation in the 11
participating nations between Jan. 1 and June 30, 2002.

China tells balloon to land, but organizers say that's unsafe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: COMBINES urgent serves, updates with balloon's position &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ China ordered a round-the-world balloon expedition
to land Tuesday, expedition organizers said, but they protested
that they didn't dare because of the rugged terrain.
	   ``Impossible _ landing in that area is life-threatening,'' said
project director Mike Kendrick in London, after the balloon team
disclosed the Chinese decision.
	   The ballon was over Tibet, 50 miles (80 kms) north of Bhutan at
about 1100 GMT, according to Press Association, the British news
agency.
	   Earlier, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it regretted that
British tycoon Richard Branson, American millionaire Steve Fossett
and Per Lindstrand of Sweden did not abide by an earlier agreement
to fly over southernmost China below 26 degrees north latitude.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao had said China could not
agree to the balloon's northerly course, but he did not call on the
crew to withdraw immediately or land.
	   Organizers of the expedition apologized, said they were trying
to head south as quickly as wind and weather permitted _ which is
about 50 mph (80 kmh). They said the balloon was forced off course
by storms, the U.S.-British military campaign in Iraq and the
refusal of two other countries to permit their flight.
	   ``China is very regretful,'' Zhu said at a routine media
briefing. ``China will not take responsibility for the
consequences.''
	   Beijing had given permission for the ICO Global balloon to
travel only over southernmost China. It would have effectively kept
the balloonists away from the isolated Tibetan plateau, where
rescue would be difficult, and out of busy air traffic corridors
monitored by a spotty air traffic control system.
	   But because of diversions around Mediterranean storms and Iraq,
and the refusal of Russia and Iran to open their airspace, the
balloon crossed the Himalayas further north than planned and
entered China 250 miles (400 kms) north of the agreed airspace
corridor early Tuesday morning, Chinese time.
	   Kendrick said Chinese air traffic controllers were informed the
moment the balloon passed over the border, with an apology added to
the communication. The balloon team continued to contact them every
15 minutes to keep the Chinese informed about their position.
	   In February, China withheld permission for a European balloon
team to fly through its airspace, forcing them to land and end
their around-the-world bid.
	   As it became apparent early Monday that the balloon would
inevitably cross into unauthorized Chinese territory, Prime
Minister Tony Blair sent a message to Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
asking for China's help.
	   The ICO Global balloon had already run into trouble on its trip.
Libya unexpectedly revoked permission to enter its airspace, but
the situation was resolved shortly before the three-man crew flew
over the country on Saturday.
	   Then, after steering around thunderstorms near Cyprus, the crew
had to maneuver the 270-foot (82-meter) craft through narrow gaps
between no-fly territories, including Iraq.
	   The crew members estimate the trip could last from eight days to
nearly three weeks. They hope to touch down somewhere in western
Europe at the end of a 24,000-mile (38,000 kms) flight, which will
take them over India, the South China sea, the Pacific and the
United States.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.

Japan raising a ``bamboo curtain'' against trade: Fischer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Japan's massive new rice tariff
represented a ``bamboo curtain'' which could prolong the Asian
financial crisis and result in retaliatory action by its trading
partners, Australia's Deputy Prime Minister said Tuesday.
	   Tim Fischer conceded the new Japanese tariff was not illegal,
and would not stop the existing Australian dollars 72
million-a-year (U.S. dlrs 44.6 million) worth of rice exported to
Japan.
	   Japan owed its postwar prosperity to the opening up of world
trade in the wake of World War II, but the country had apparently
failed to heed the message of the Great Depression, which was
prolonged by nations erecting trade barriers, he said.
	   ``Fortress Japan, or for that matter, Fortress Australia, would
be absolutely the wrong way to go,'' he said.
	   ``This represents a bamboo curtain, with some pretty spikey
bamboos, but we'll be doing all we can to wedge open that curtain,
and reduce its size, in the next round of negotiations.''
	   Fischer said Japan's new tariff was 15 times Australia's highest
tariff. While he ruled out raising Australian tariffs, he said he
would look into other action that could be taken against Japan.

Official: Ethiopian troops in Djibouti to outflank Eritreans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JULIA STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Ethiopia has moved troops into
neighboring Djibouti to outflank Ertirea in the seven-month border
dispute between the two Horn of Africa neighbors, a senior Eritrean
official has said.
	   Speaking to reporters late Monday, Foreign Minister Haile
Weldensae said both Djibouti and Sudan were supporting Ethiopia's
war effort against Eritrea.
	   ``It is dangerous for Djibouti,'' Waldensae said, adding that
Eritrea would defend itself whenever necessary.
	   The official also charged that landlocked Ethiopia _ which used
to use the Eritrean ports of Assab and Massawa _ is using Port
Sudan on Sudan's Red Sea coast for logistical support.
	   Djibouti now serves as Ethiopia's main entry for imports and
exports.
	   It was not immediately possible to obtain comment from
authorities in Djibouti because of the Muslim Ramandan holiday when
most government offices only work half days.
	   Ethiopia and Eritrea clashed in May and June over undemarcated
colonial boundaries, and several hundred people were killed.
	   Thousands of troops from both sides are hunkered down along both
sides of their common 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) border. Periodic
shelling at hot spots and large-scale build up of weapons has
sustained tensions.
	   Djibouti severed diplomatic ties with Eritrea Nov. 18, following
Eritrean allegations that the tiny port state in the crook of the
Horn of Africa was aiding the Ethiopian war effort.
	   Ertirea and Sudan broke relations in 1994 amid accusations that
each suppported the other's rebel movements.
	   The foreign ministers of Sudan and Eritrea met in Qatar on Nov.
10 and agreed to hold periodic talks.
	   Weldensae said Eritrea will continue to meet Sudanese officials,
but no normalization of relations cna take place as long as
Khartoum's National Islamic Front government continues its policy
of regional destabilization.
	   Although Sudanese rebels and opposition have their headquarters
in Asmara, Weldensae denied that the Sudan People's Liberation Army
carries out any military activity or training exercises on Eritrean
soil.
	   But witnesses have seen SPLA camps inside Eritrea.

Lithuania abolishes death penalty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ The Lithuanian parliament has
abolished the death penalty, a move that legislators hope will help
speed the country's entry into the European Union.
	   The vote Monday night in the Seimas parliament was 76-3, the
Baltic News Service reported.
	   The last execution in Lithuania was in 1995, when organized
crime boss Boris Dekanidze was killed with a single shot to the
head for ordering the assassination of a journalist.
	   Capital punishment has wide support among the public, with a
recent poll showing more than 80 percent of the respondents
favoring capital punishment.
	   But the EU, which Lithuania ardently wants to join, had said
that retaining capital punishment would be an obstacle to
membership.
	   This month, Lithuania's highest court put pressure on parliament
to change the law when it declared the death penalty
unconstitutional, saying it violated provisions against cruelty and
torture.

Belgian soccer federation awards dlrs 463,900 in damages to Bosman
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Belgium's Soccer Federation said
Tuesday it will award 16 million Belgian francs (dlrs 463,900) in
damages to Jean-Marc Bosman, ending an eight-year legal battle for
the former player whose fight for justice led to a ruling that
revolutionized soccer in Europe.
	   ``With this agreement, the various parties wished to end
elegantly this affair ... in order to focus in a positive manner on
the new football challenges at the eve of the year 2000,'' the
Federation's secretary-general, Jan Peeters said in a statement.
	   Bosman, who told the Associated Press earlier this month he
hoped for an out-of-court settlement by the end of the year, is
immensely relieved, his lawyer said.
	   ``Even if this is not a huge amount, it is very important
because it allows him to stop being the Bosman affair and to return
to being Jean-Marc Bosman,'' Bosman's lawyer Jean-Louis Dupont
quoted his client as saying.
	   Dupont said the agreement was made possible by a change of
leadership at the head of FIFA, soccer's world governing body.
``Two years ago such a transaction would not have been possible,''
he said.
	   ``Tuesday's agreement shows the soccer world is seeking a new
spirit of cooperation and of mutual respect in its relations with
the public authorities, and particularly with the European Union,''
Dupont said.
	   Bosman gained fame as the man who challenged Europe's soccer
authorities before the courts when his transfer from Belgium's FC
Liege to France's Dunkirk was blocked.
	   On Dec. 15, 1995, Bosman won his case when the European Court of
Justice ruled that the system of transfer fees after contracts had
expired was illegal. So were the limits on European Union
foreigners.
	   The Bosman ruling set a precedent, releasing players from the
control of clubs with the end of a contract and effectively
creating free agency, while allowing clubs to field as many EU
players as they liked.
	   But the case didn't end there for Bosman. The ruling went back
to the appeals court in Belgium, where Bosman's case became
logjammed. Bosman has been out of work for the past three years,
having quit competitive soccer because he could not live off his
salary.
	   Dupont said Bosman's last wish before turning the page now is
that players around the world will respond to a ``Thank You
Jean-Marc Bosman'' operation launched earlier this month by a local
sports and union rights organization.
	   The organization called on all first-division players in the 15
EU nations to donate the bonus of one game to Bosman in a show of
solidarity. So far not one cent has been given, Dupont said.
	   Bosman hopes there will be a response. He wants to use most of
the funds to set up a foundation for young players who don't make
it into the professional world and have no one to turn to.
	   ``Nine out of ten young players from Africa or South America who
get tried out when they're 14 or 15 years old don't make it into
the football world, and often they end up on the streets,'' Dupont
said.

Press at 1200 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally mixed
Tuesday, with the key index tumbling in Japan but surging in
Taiwan. Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped
373.50 points, or 2.64 percent, to close at 13,779.45 _ its lowest
close since Oct. 30. Share prices fell on fears that declines in
the bond market would further hurt Japan's ailing banks. Share
prices in Taiwan closed sharply higher, boosted by a market
stablization fund set up by the government to prop up the flagging
bourse. Taipei's Weighted Stock Price Index surged 224.40 points,
or 3.4 percent, to 6,782.68. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted
at 117.08 yen in late afternoon trading in Tokyo, up 2.18 yen from
late Monday here and above its late New York level of 116.21 yen.
(ASIAN MARKETS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ After helping to stabilize world financial
markets with three interest-rate reductions this fall, Federal
Reserve officers meeting Tuesday little reason to cut again right
now, economist believe. Stock prices, which plunged in the United
States and elsewhere after the August devaluation of the Russian
ruble, have recovered. After more recent jitters over the
impeachment of President Bill Clinton, the Dow Jones average of
industrial stocks gained 85 points Monday, closing at 8,989. And
business credit, which contracted sharply for all but low-risk
borrowers this fall, has loosened up. Not only that, the U.S.
economy just keeps barreling along, showing little sign outside of
manufacturing and farming that it has slowed in response to the
world's economic problems. (US-ECONOMY-INTEREST RATES)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Interest rate cuts in the United States and
other industrial countries have eased the threat that the Asian
financial crisis will trigger a global recession, the International
Monetary Fund said in an updated economic outlook. But the
182-nation lending agency still found plenty of things that could
go wrong in the new year, ranging from a sudden plunge in U.S.
stock prices or the value of the dollar to the failure of Japanese
authorities to aggressively battle their country's worst recession
in 50 years. Accordingly, the IMF trimmed its forecast for world
growth in 1999 to just 2.2 percent, down by 0.3 percentage point
from a report issued just two months ago. The crisis that began in
Thailand in 1997 has spread to a number of other Asian countries,
pushing them into deep recessions and in August leveled the Russian
economy. (WORLD OUTLOOK)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's Foreign Trade
Commissioner says the EU will push for a World Trade Organization
solution to its banana dispute with the United States after
Washington unveiled a list of EU goods subject to stiff trade
sanctions. Leon Brittan said in a statement Monday ``It is time to
take action against the pernicious and unlawful effect of this
wholly unilateral legislation.'' On Monday, the United States
published a list of EU products ranging from sheep's milk cheese to
cashmere sweaters that will be slapped with 100 percent import
tariffs. U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said in
Washington the United States is exercising its rights under the WTO
to impose penalties on the EU for, in the U.S. view, unfairly
blocking U.S. companies from selling bananas from Latin America to
Europe. But Brittan lashed out at the sanctions, saying, ``It is
difficult to think of a more obvious breach of the multilateral
trade system than to take the law into your own hands in defiance
of the rules.'' (US-EU-BANANA WAR)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian workers are owed 84.9 billion rubles (dlrs
4 billion) in back wages, and most of the debt belongs to private
firms, not the government, an official said Tuesday. Millions of
Russians receive their wages and pensions months late, but
employers have been unable to break the cycle of debts that
continues to hobble the country's economy. Deputy Prime Minister
Valentina Matvienko said the government owed 18 billion rubles
(dlrs 850 million) of the overdue wages, while private companies
owed about 67 billion rubles (dlrs 3.2 billion), the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported. Russia's latest economic crisis, which hit in
August, has only made the problem worse. Many workers have lost
their jobs and the government continues to struggle to collect
taxes and pay its bills. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opened what
promises to be a bare-knuckles re-election campaign Tuesday by
deriding the ``fantasies and ambitions'' of his political rivals
and insisting the public will back his tough stance toward the
Palestinians. ``We will go to the people and the people will give
us the support to achieve peace with security,'' the prime minister
told Israel radio a day after Israel's parliament voted
overwhelmingly for early elections and rejected Netanyahu's peace
policies. The collapse of the prime minister's hard-line governing
coalition and the start of what is expected to be a four-month
contest for the prime minister's job appeared to put the already
ailing Mideast peace process on hold. That is drawing bitter
protests from the Palestinians, who insist Israel is bound to honor
the Wye River accord despite the political turmoil, just as it
remains committed to other international agreements.
(ISRAEL-POLITICS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ As President Bill Clinton faces a Senate trial
that could remove him from office, four House Republicans who voted
to impeach him are urging the Senate to consider censure rather
than removal from office. And the Senate's senior Democrat, Robert
Byrd of West Virginia, who is an expert on Senate procedures, spoke
of compromise Monday while hinting that a censure could replace a
trial. But he said only senators must decide. ``Whether there is a
trial or whether there is some other solution, that decision must
be made by senators, and it must be bipartisan or it will have
absolutely no credibility with the public,'' Byrd said in a
statement. ``There must be no deal involving the White House or any
entity beyond the ... U.S. Senate.'' (US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ While the United States boasted of the
success of the U.S.-British bombardment of Iraq, Iraqi state-run
newspapers also claimed victory Tuesday since President Saddam
Hussein remains in power. ``The enemies made a bid that a riot
would take place in the country, but they were wrong because Iraqis
are closer to their leader now than ever,'' the weekly Al-Ittihad
said in an editorial Tuesday. The view was echoed in other
government newspapers, which also claimed the four-day attack last
week built sympathy for Iraq among the world's Muslims. Also
Tuesday, about 120 U.N. humanitarian workers evacuated during the
airstrikes headed back to Baghdad from neighboring Jordan. A U.N.
official said they would be back at work Wednesday. (IRAQ)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Shouting contempt for his summary trial, a
Chinese dissident was sentenced Tuesday to 12 years in prison,
becoming the third organizer of a would-be opposition party
convicted in two days. The heavy sentence given to Qin Yongmin fell
predictably in line with the severe verdicts issued Monday to
fellow China Democracy Party leaders: 13 years for Xu Wenli and 11
for Wang Youcai. Tried in different cities, the three were accused
of the same crime, the subversion of China's Communist Party-led
system, for the same act, trying to set up the China Democracy
Party. Their quick trials and harsh punishments showed how firmly
the Communist Party draws the line at open opposition.

	   SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia (AP) _ Trucks brought soldiers to a
Cambodian seaport town Tuesday to clean up an illegal shipment of
toxic waste as hundreds of frightened residents left for safer
areas. Police confirmed that four people were killed in road
accidents Monday when more than 1,000 people fled Sihanoukville,
bringing total confirmed deaths in connection to the waste shipment
to five. A dock worker died mysteriously a day after cleaning the
hold of the ship that brought the 3,000 tons of waste, believed to
be compressed industrial ash, from Taiwan to Sihanoukville about
two weeks ago. Analysis by a Hong Kong laboratory has shown the
waste contains traces of mercury, a poisonous metal. It was
illegally dumped at a site about 10 kilometers (six miles) north of
Sihanoukville. (CAMBODIA-GARBAGE RIOT)

Chechen officials delay release of slain foreigners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen officials on Tuesday delayed the return of
the remains of four Westerners killed earlier this month in the
breakaway Russian republic, news reports said.
	   Chechen leaders had said the severed heads would be delivered to
the British and New Zealand embassies in Moscow on Tuesday.
	   But the Chechens put off the action, saying there was a
``well-justified hope that the victims' bodies could be recovered
within the next few days,'' the Interfax news agency reported,
citing Chechen Prosecutor General Mansur Tagirov.
	   Tagirov said that the people with the corpses had been
contacted, but were demanding the release of one of their jailed
comrades before they give up the remains.
	   The victims _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi
of Britain and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were abducted Oct. 3 in
the Chechen capital of Grozny, where they were installing a
cellular phone system.
	   Their heads were found by a roadside Dec. 8. Police say they
were killed after a rescue attempt went wrong.
	   Chechen officials have blamed the killings on a regional warlord
who has been accused of numerous kidnappings. But the warlord, Arbi
Barayev, has denied any involvement.
	   Chechnya has been plagued by violence and kidnappings for ransom
since its 1994-96 independence war against Russia. Abductions have
become a major business _ more than 100 people are thought to be in
captivity there, and ransom demands often run into the millions of
dollars.
	   Meanwhile, a 19-year old Russian soldier, kidnapped earlier this
month in neighboring Ingushetia, was freed by a Chechen anti-crime
squad, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Tuesday.

Russian Communists plan to give quick approval to budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: LEADS with Communist leader saying 1999 budget likely to win
swift approval. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said Tuesday he
wasn't entirely pleased with next year's budget, but his party
would probably support quick passage because of the country's
financial turmoil.
	   ``We have a difficult choice between bad and very bad because
the present government has inherited from its predecessors only
debts and troubles, but no resources,'' Zyuganov told Russian news
agencies.
	   An austere, realistic budget is seen as essential for
stabilizing Russia's economy. The lower house of parliament, the
State Duma, is to begin discussing the draft budget Thursday, and
passage has required months of rancorous debate in recent years.
	   But the Communists, the largest faction in parliament, have been
generally supportive of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's
government, raising hopes that the budget will win swift approval.
	   ``The budget, it appears, should be passed on the first
reading,'' Zyuganov said.
	   The Duma must approve the budget in four readings. The document
will then go before the upper house, which usually passes it with
little delay.
	   The Communists have regularly called for more state spending to
help impoverished individuals and ailing industries. But in the
current economic crisis there's widespread agreement that the
government simply doesn't have much money to spend.
	   Russia's overall economy is expected to shrink about 5 percent
this year and could be even worse next year. The International
Monetary Fund has forecast a decline of 8.3 percent next year for
Russia, which has seen its economy contract most of this decade.
	   Meanwhile, wage debts to Russian workers stand at 84.9 billion
rubles (dlrs 4 billion), a senior government official said Tuesday.
	   Millions of Russians receive their wages and pensions months
late, but employers have been unable to break the cycle of debts
that continues to hobble the economy.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Valentina Matvienko said the government
owed 18 billion rubles (dlrs 850 million) of the overdue wages,
while private companies owed about 67 billion rubles (dlrs 3.2
billion), the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Russia's latest economic crisis, which hit in August, has only
made the problem worse. Many workers have lost their jobs and the
government continues to struggle to collect taxes and pay its
bills.
	   The government's debt to pensioners now stands at 30 billion
rubles (dlrs 1.4 billion) and overdue subsidies to families with
children is currently at 24 billion rubles (dlrs 1.1 billion).
	   ``We should do all we can not to allow children to go hungry,''
Matvienko said. ``In each such case, the local authorities should
take urgent measures.''
	   Russia is to receive food aid from the United States and Europe
this winter to guard against potential food shortages. So far, no
serious food problems have been reported.
	   The government will sell some of the food aid on the Russian
market, and the money will be used to pay pension arrears, Deputy
Prime Minister Gennady Kulik told a news conference Tuesday.

Police arrest drug traffickers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian police arrested two suspected drug
traffickers carrying 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of marijuana
through central Russia, a news agency reported on Tuesday.
	   The suspects, from the former Soviet republic of Kazakstan, were
detained at a railway station in the Chelyabinsk region, 1,500
kilometers (950 miles) east of Moscow, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   The report didn't say when the arrests took place.
	   Criminal proceedings have been launched against the suspects,
ITAR-Tass said, citing local police.
	   Russian has evolved into a major drug market since the 1991
Soviet collapse, with smugglers taking advantage of its economic
turmoil, widespread corruption and porous borders.

South Korea to pay dlrs 333 million for U.S. troops next year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: CORRECTs the 1999 figure was up from 1998, other details in
3-4 grafs

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea will pay dlrs 333 million
for keeping U.S. troops on its soil next year, American and South
Korean military officials said Tuesday.
	   Though Seoul has signed a long-term agreement to gradually
increase its share of the cost of keeping U.S. troops here, a
prolonged economic crisis has seriously curtailed the government's
financial capabilities.
	   The 1999 figure is six percent up from dlrs 314 million this
year, but is sharply down from the dlrs 440 million the country had
initially promised to pay next year.
	   This year, South Korea had initially promised to pay dlrs 399
million but ended up paying just dlrs 314 million after Washington
allowed Seoul figure a large portion of the costs at a pre-crisis
exchange rate of about 900 won to the dollar.
	   The won traded at 1208.5 to the dollar Tuesday.
	   Some 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea.
	   The United States fought on South Korea's side against North
Korea in the 1950-53 Korean War. The conflict ended without a peace
treaty, leaving the two rival Koreas in a technical state of war.

Lithuania abolishes death penalty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ The Lithuanian parliament has
abolished the death penalty, a move that legislators hope will help
speed the country's entry into the European Union.
	   The vote Monday night in the Seimas parliament was 76-3, the
Baltic News Service reported.
	   The last execution in Lithuania was in 1995, when organized
crime boss Boris Dekanidze was killed with a single shot to the
head for ordering the assassination of a journalist.
	   Capital punishment has wide support among the public, with a
recent poll showing more than 80 percent of the respondents
favoring capital punishment.
	   But the EU, which Lithuania ardently wants to join, had said
that retaining capital punishment would be an obstacle to
membership.
	   This month, Lithuania's highest court put pressure on parliament
to change the law when it declared the death penalty
unconstitutional, saying it violated provisions against cruelty and
torture.
	   President Valdas Adamkus has also lobbied for the death penalty
to be scrapped.
	   Life imprisonment will be the maximum sentence a Lithuania court
can hand down.

Pigeon feeding outlawed in Amsterdam neighborhood
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Peace on earth, good will toward
men. But not toward pigeons, say officials in an Amsterdam
neighborhood that has declared war on the ``flying rats.''
	   In a bid to rid itself of a plague of pooping pigeons, the Bos
en Lommer municipality has outlawed feeding the birds and will fine
anyone caught breaking the new edict.
	   The inner-city municipality will slap a 150-guilder (dlrs 83)
fine on anyone caught feeding the birds and a 250-guilder (dlrs
139) fine on serial cereal distributors _ those caught more than
once.
	   The measure is the latest in a series of measures aimed at
tackling the plague of pigeons in the Dutch capital. Earlier
anti-pigeon plans have included poisoning their food and sowing it
with anti-conception drugs. Neither has had a noticeable effect.
	   ``We are getting more and more reports'' of pigeon problems, a
city official told the Dutch daily De Volkskrant for Tuesday's
edition.
	   The official, identified only as G. Otten, calls the pigeons
``flying rats.''
	   ``Rats carry annoying diseases and that is sometimes the case
with pigeons too.''

First Palestinian airline arrives in Egypt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The first commercial Palestinian flight to
Egypt landed in Cairo's International Airport Tuesday, inaugurating
an air route between the autonomous Gaza Strip and Egypt, the
Middle East News Agency reported.
	   The Palestinian Airlines flight, which transported 14
passengers, was met by Egyptian Transportation Minister Suleiman
Metwally.
	   The inauguration of the route between Gaza and Cairo is a
``confirmation of Palestinian sovereignty over Palestinian lands,''
ports and airports, Metwally was quoted as saying by the Egyptian
news agency.
	   The Gaza airport was inaugurated in late November under the
U.S.-brokered Wye River accord which envisages Israel ceding more
lands to the Palestinians in return for security guarantees.
	   The Palestinian airlines already has a route from Gaza to the
Jordanian capital, Amman.
	   Last Friday, Egypt's national carrier, EgyptAir, inaugurated its
route to Gaza, the news agency said.

Protective clothing arrives for massive waste cleanup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with Thais testing waste,
provide clothing, cleanup to take 10 days.
 &UR; By CHRIS FONTAINE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia (AP) _ Toxic waste experts from the Thai
army arrived in this seaport town Tuesday to help some 400
Cambodian troops clean up an illegal waste shipment from Taiwan.
	   A steady, two-hour rain dampened the 3,000 tons of waste,
believed to be compressed industrial ash, raising fear among
Environment Ministry officials that dangerous chemicals could seep
into ground water.
	   Plastic tarps that were supposed to have been stretched over the
waste to prevent such problems were not in place in time.
	   The experts from neighboring Thailand, including chemists and
nuclear technicians, passed Geiger counters over the waste, dumped
about 10 kilometers (six miles) north of Sihanoukville two weeks
ago, and determined it was not radioactive.
	   ``We have simply been requested to take samples and determine if
there is a health hazard,'' said Col. Chalermsuk Yugala. ``So far,
we have determined it is not radioactive. It could be toxic; it
could be nontoxic.''
	   Analysis by a Hong Kong laboratory has already shown the waste
contains mercury, a highly poisonous metal.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Sar Kheng said that he believed the hazard
from the waste was limited. Several officials involved in the
shipment have been suspended, he said. A cleanup involving hundreds
of soldiers and expected to last 10 days was to start Wednesday.
	   ``We will try to ship it out as soon as possible,'' Sar Kheng
said. ``We cannot let one or two people destroy the people's
health.''
	   Hundreds of residents fled to safer areas Tuesday, frightened of
health hazards and the violent rioting over the weekend against
corrupt officials who allowed the waste to enter the country. The
village closest to the dump site was deserted.
	   Police confirmed that four people were killed in road accidents
Monday when more than 1,000 people fled Sihanoukville, bringing
total deaths in connection to the waste shipment to five.
	   A dock worker died a day after cleaning the hold of the ship
that brought the waste about two weeks ago.
	   In Taiwan, the Environmental Protection Bureau said the waste
had been properly treated. The bureau said it was willing to send a
team to Cambodia to investigate. If the investigation showed the
hazards were caused by the Taiwanese waste, the bureau said it
would ask the company that produced it, Formosa Plastic Corp., to
take the waste back.
	   Thailand sent 300 protective suits, 300 gas masks and 100 pairs
of rubber boots to Cambodia to equip local soldiers for the cleanup
process.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, president of the National Assembly,
said that he had been informed by Prime Minister Hun Sen that dlrs
3 million had been paid in bribes to officials to get the waste
into the country. The government has vowed to prosecute them.
	   All seats on buses leaving for the capital, Phnom Penh, 185
kilometers (115 miles) to the north, were fully booked, agents
said.
	   In Phnom Penh, a tourism official said that the presence of the
waste and the riots was hurting Sihanoukville's economy. The town
is a popular holiday spot.
	   ``It is regrettable,'' said Thong Khon, secretary of state at
the Tourism Ministry. ``This problem should not have been allowed
to happen.''

Havel leaves for three-week vacation in Canary Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel and his
wife Dagmar left for a three-week vacation in Canary Islands, the
news agency CTK reported Tuesday.
	   The often-ill president recently recovered from a mild case of
flu and doctors recommended that he take a holiday for his health,
preferably on sea.
	   Havel chose Lanzarotte, one of the Canary Islands. Like last
year, King Juan Carlos invited him to stay at one of his
residences.
	   CTK said that Havel is accompanied by his personal doctor Ilja
Kotik and Dagmar's mother, Marketa Veskrnova.
	   Havel, 62, fought off a life-threatening case of pneumonia in
August and underwent emergency surgery for a ruptured colon in
April.
	   A former chain smoker, Havel has been hospitalized five times
since December 1996, when a third of his lung and a cancerous tumor
were removed.

Judge sets Sendashonga murder trial for Feb. 4
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A judge has set Feb. 4 as the opening date
in the trial of three suspects in the murder of former Rwandan
government minister Seth Sendashonga, news reports said Tuesday.
	   Judge Daniel Aganyanya set the date Monday after the three
suspects pleaded innocent to gunning down the former Rwandan
Interior Minister and his driver in Nairobi May 16, the East
African Standard said.
	   Okiki Kiwanuka of Rwanda, Charles Muhanji Wamuthoni of Kenya and
Christopher Lubanga Mlondo of Uganda have been in police custody
since their arrest May 20.
	   They are not eligible for bail because murder is a capital
offense in Kenya.
	   Sendashonga, a Hutu, was a member of the predominantly Tutsi
Rwandan Patriotic Front that ousted a Hutu extremist government in
Rwanda in July 1994 after it carried out a three-month slaughter of
at least 500,000 people, mostly of them minority Tutsis.
	   Sendashonga and several other government officials were
dismissed from their posts in August 1995 after they protested the
reprisal killings of Hutu civilians by Tutsi soldiers.
	   Sendashonga had been living in exile in Kenya where his wife
works for the United Nations Environment Program.

Serb police crack down on ethnic Albanian town after officer is

<TEXT>
	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police swept through a Kosovo
Albanian stronghold in retaliation for the killing of an officer in
escalating violence that has increased fear of a return to all-out
ethnic war in the troubled province.
	   The events occurred Monday as Sadako Ogata, the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, toured the Serbian province. She was
getting a firsthand look at the hundreds of thousands of people
displaced by fighting that has killed hundreds of people since
government forces launched a crackdown in February against
separatist ethnic Albanians.
	   Ogata then headed for Belgrade for a possible meeting Tuesday
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   In Belgrade, heads of Yugoslavia's Serb-led army met Monday with
NATO's top commander in Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, who repeated
warnings that the alliance might intervene if fighting between Serb
security forces and ethnic Albanian rebels continues, sources close
to the talks said on condition of anonymity.
	   Milosevic averted threatened NATO airstrikes when he signed a
U.S.-sponsored deal last October, promising an end to the military
campaign against separatists in the overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian
province of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   According to a spokesman for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, Monday's sweep began after the slaying of
Serb policeman Milic Jovic.
	   The spokesman, Jorgen Grunnet, said a column of Yugoslav army
vehicles, including seven T-55 tanks, left a military barracks just
south of Podujevo.
	   Afterward, OSCE staff heard tank and machine gunfire from the
direction of the village of Dobrotin, but there have been no
reports of casualties.
	   The vehicles moved Monday afternoon and were fired upon while
passing through the village of Perane, also near Podujevo.
	   ``We have no reports of any direct fight,'' Grunnet said but
added that the army ``returned fire when heading back to the
barracks.''
	   But Hysen Fazliu, a spokesman for the main ethnic Albanian party
in Podujevo, claimed Serb forces clashed with the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army and that an unspecified number of ethnic Albanians
had been arrested.
	   The KLA spokesman in the Podujevo region, Luizim Oraca, said the
clash lasted two hours and that the ``enemy was forced to withdraw,
and one of their tanks was destroyed.''
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   Podujevo, 40 kilometers (25 miles) north Pristina, is an
overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian town near central Serbia. Tensions
there have risen in past weeks as local Serbs complained of a
growing guerrilla presence and demanded the government protect
them.
	   Jovic's killing is the latest in a series of setbacks for
Kosovo's fragile truce. It is certain to enrage the Serbs, already
furious over last week's killings of six Serb youths in a Kosovo
bar and of a prominent Serb official.
	   The attack on Jovic also heightens fears that violence in Kosovo
is moving from the rugged countryside to the towns.
	   Ogata, accompanied by the William Walker, the American head of
peace monitors in Kosovo, visited a part of the ethnic Albanian
majority Serbian province where both Serbs and ethnic Albanians
have been displaced.
	   Part of her trip Monday took her to recent refugees' dwellings
without electricity, running water or other basics.
	   In the central Kosovo town of Malisevo, a former KLA stronghold
retaken by Serb police and largely deserted by its ethnic Albanian
population, Ogata was told by ethnic Albanians that they would not
return to their homes as long as police were present.
	   Later, Ogata heard Serb demands to help in the search for over a
hundred Serb civilians missing in rebel territory since July.
	   ``All I have to say is that a political agreement and peace can
solve your problems,'' Ogata said. ``Then you will be able to
return to your homes and live together.''

China tells balloon to land, but organizers say that's unsafe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with comment from project director &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ China ordered a round-the-world balloon expedition
to land Tuesday, expedition organizers said, but they protested
that they didn't dare because of darkness, cloud cover and the
rugged terrain.
	   ``Impossible _ landing in that area is life-threatening,'' said
project director Mike Kendrick in London, after the balloon team
disclosed the Chinese decision.
	   The ICO Global balloon was over Tibet, 50 miles (80 kms) north
of Bhutan at about 1100 GMT, according to Press Association, the
British news agency.
	   Earlier, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it regretted that
British tycoon Richard Branson, American millionaire Steve Fossett
and Per Lindstrand of Sweden did not abide by an earlier agreement
to fly over southernmost China below 26 degrees north latitude.
	   ``They are stuck in a balloon, they cannot land it at this
particular time,'' Kendrick said in an interview with Sky News.
``There is absolutely nothing we can do but appeal to the Chinese
people for their understanding and their help, and to apologize
profusely.''
	   Kendrick said the balloonists were trying to move south into the
authorized corridor, but the wind was against them. ``I don't think
there is any chance we can make our way south,'' he said.

Eritrea: chances for peaceful settlement not exhausted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Chances for a peaceful settlement to the
seven-month Eritrea-Ethiopian border conflict have not been
exhausted despite a recent and inconclusive OAU summit, a senior
Eritrean official has said.
	   Speaking to reporters late Monday, Foreign Minister Haile
Weldensae the conflict resolution organ of the Organization of
African Unity had only five hours at its meeting last weekend in
Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso to discuss half a dozen conflicts in
Africa.
	   But he said a high-level OAU team made up of representatives
from Zimbabwe, Burkina Faso and Djibouti would continue to work
toward a negotiated settlement to the conflict after drafting a
peace plan in early November.
	   Horn of Africa neighbors Eritrea and Ethiopia clashed in May and
June over undemarcated colonial boundaries, and hundreds were
killed.
	   Thousands of troops are hunkered down on either side of their
common 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) border, and period shelling and
massive weapons buildups keep tensions high.
	   Ethiopia accepted the OAU peace plan, but Eritrea objected to
several points, particularly the one that called for a unilateral
withdrawal of Eritrean troops from the contested Badime area and
the return of Ethiopian administrators.
	   Eritrea's counterproposal, presented to the OAU team two days
before the Dec. 17 summit, called for:
	   _ precise legal language related to border delineation;
	   _ mutual demilitarization of the Mareb Setit border area;
	   _ deletion of the recommendation calling for the return of
Ethiopian administrators to the Badime area;
	   _ altering the paragraph on human rights issues to reflect that
Ethiopia is deporting ethnic Eritreans and not vice-versa.
	   Weldensae said U.S. special envoy Anthony Lake was expected back
in the region for another round of talks with Eritrean and
Ethiopian officials but he did not know the dates of his next
shuttle mission.

Australia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will provide Australia with booster rockets
and a newly designed launch pad for putting commercial satellites
into orbit, a news report said Tuesday.
	   Russia's Makeyev rocket company, from the Ural Mountains region
of Chelyabinsk, signed the deal with Australia's United Launch
Systems International last week, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The Makeyev company is to design a launch pad in eastern
Australia and supply dozens of boosters over five years to the
Australian company, Interfax said.
	   The report did not specify the value of the contract, or when
the work was expected to begin.

Russian ambassador to return to U.S. on Wednesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's ambassador to the United States, who was
recalled last week after America began bombing Iraq, will return to
Washington on Wednesday, an official said.
	   The Russians strongly opposed the U.S. and British air strikes
against Iraq, and recalled ambassadors from both countries. But the
Russians said Tuesday that Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov would return
to his post in Washington a day later.
	   ``The complication of Russian-U.S. relations was not our
choice,'' Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin
told a news conference.
	   ``Now that the United States has stopped using force against
Iraq ... the process of settling the situation in Iraq by political
methods should be restored fully,'' he added.
	   Russia has long opposed the use of force against Iraq, and said
the air strikes only complicated any settlement in the long-running
confrontation between the Arab nation and United Nations over
weapons inspections.
	   In recalling its ambassador, Russia denounced the United States
in harsh rhetoric reminiscent of the Cold War.
	   But Russia said Tuesday that a planned visit next month by U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ``will be important for
overcoming the negative consequences of the U.S. use of force
against Iraq,'' Rakhmanin said.
	   The Russians were still holding discussions with Great Britain
about the return of Moscow's ambassador to London, Rakhmanin said.
	   The Russians have long-standing relations with Iraq and want to
help rebuild the country's oil industry when U.N. sanctions are
lifted.
	   The sanctions were imposed following Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait and are to remain in place until U.N. inspectors verify that
all weapons of mass destruction have been dismantled.
	   The United States and Britain launched their air strike
following a U.N. report saying Iraq had refused to cooperate with
weapons inspectors.

Former consul charged over dlrs 100 million deception
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The former honorary consul of Paraguay in Geneva,
Gustavo Gramont Beres, appeared in court in the city Tuesday on
charges of a dlrs 100 million fraud.
	   Beres, who had been charged for other offenses in Paraguay, was
extradited to Switzerland on the request of Geneva authorities,
said investigating magistrate Leonardo Malfanti.
	   Beres, an Argentine national, was the Paraguayan honorary consul
in Geneva from 1979 to 1989.
	   City authorities began an inquiry into Beres last year, and made
an official request for his extradition in February.
	   After a brief court appearance, Beres was detained in prison
pending his trial. The charges relate to deception and forgery to
the tune of around dlrs 100 million in Swiss francs and German
marks, according to Geneva magistrate Malfanti. He gave no more
details.

In Christmas message, Latin patriarch decries threats to peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a somber Christmas message, the Latin
patriarch of Jerusalem said Tuesday that the cause of peace has
been hurt by Israeli-Palestinian strife and conflict in Iraq.
	   In the Christmas season, ``the whole world...turns its gaze
toward our land and our holy cities with the hope of finding in
them the grace of God which can renew persons and societies,'' said
Michel Sabbah, the top Roman Catholic clergyman in the region.
	   Dressed in a long black robe with a large silver cross around
his neck, Sabbah, a Palestinian, mourned what he said were setbacks
in efforts to bring about peace between Israel and the
Palestinians.
	   ``The peace process remains paralyzed, despite big efforts in
recent days to bring it back to life,'' the patriarch said in his
message. ``The Israeli vision remains too narrow to welcome
Palestinian freedom.''
	   Sabbah also said he hoped the international community would take
steps to try to ease the suffering of the Iraqi people. Four days
of U.S. and British airstrikes on suspected weapons sites last week
killed at least 62 Iraqis and injured 180.
	   ``We hope that the grace of Christmas may enlighten their minds
and hearts and help them find other ways to resolve the conflict
without imposing death on the people,'' he told reporters.
	   The patriarch also called for reconciliation between Muslims and
Christians in the largely Arab city of Nazareth, in northern
Israel, where tensions have increased in recent weeks between the
two communities.
	   Sabbah, quoting the biblical book of James, urged meditation on
the mystery of God, ``the father of all light, from whom comes all
that is good, all that is perfect.''

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A British tourist died in Singapore after he
was struck by a car just an hour after his arrival, state-run
television reported Tuesday.
	   John Alan, 63, was hit by a taxi Sunday morning as he was
crossing a road to buy breakfast less than an hour after he and his
wife arrived in the city-state by bus from Thailand.

Hospital on Monday night, the television news program said.
	   Alan's home town was not disclosed, and police and British High

Briton lecturing in Singapore, was killed in an unsolved

Aid agencies warn famine could resume crisis proportions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Famine, fighting and flooding still
threaten more than 4 million people in Sudan, creating a bleak
outlook for 1999 despite improvements reported since the crisis
earlier this year, Operation Lifeline Sudan warned Tuesday.
	   In its annual needs assessment report, the umbrella body for
United Nations and other relief agencies operating in war-torn
southern Sudan said international response to famine this year
succeeded in alleviating conditions in the western Bahr el-Ghazal
region.
	   However, warning that the situation could easily revert to acute
famine, the report called for an extension of a humanitarian
cease-fire implemented in August and extended to Jan. 15, 1999.
	   ``Many people are surviving on a fragile base which insecurity
could easily shatter,'' Philippe Borel, OLS director and
coordinator for U.N. operations in Sudan, said in a statement.
	   Borel is based in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum.
	   ``Even a few weeks of insecurity, especially in Bahr el-Ghazal,
could produce the kind of crisis we were confronting earlier this
year,'' Borel said.
	   The 15-year civil war for control of southern Sudan, in which an
estimated 1.9 million people have died, many of them from
war-related famine, has caused millions more to flee their homes.
Crops left untended have been looted or destroyed, leaving people
without food.
	   In February, the government in the Arab, Islamic north banned
relief flights to rebel-held areas in the south for two months. The
ban, together with the worst flooding in 50 years, pushed millions
to the brink of starvation.
	   Rebels from the mainly African, Christian and animist south are
fighting government forces for self-determination for the region.
	   Global pressure forced the Khartoum government to lift the
flight ban in April, allowing the world's largest current relief
operation to commence.
	   The U.N. World Food Program estimates that it will have to
supply at least 150,000 tons of food until October 1999 in order to
feed 2 million people still in need in Sudan.
	   ``Although there has been improvement, it's still going to be a
grim year ahead for those recovering from the 1998 crisis,'' said
WFP spokeswoman Lindsey Davies.
	   ``That's why we will continue to pour in food, not only so that
the very weak can continue to survive, but so others can start to
recover. It's still a long way off.''
	   To help in the recovery, relief agencies are planning to
distribute seeds and tools to more than 300,000 households and
fishing equipment to about 120,000 households in rebel-held areas,
OLS said.

Parliament expected to vote on Yeltsin impeachment next month
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: LEADS with impeachment motion to come up next month, ADDS
byline.
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian lawmakers are expected to vote next month
on whether to impeach President Boris Yeltsin, the speaker of
parliament said Tuesday. At present, the impeachment motion appears
likely to fail.
	   Parliament's impeachment committee has already said that Yeltsin
should be removed from office for launching Russia's botched war in
Chechnya, sending in tanks against his hard-line foes in 1993,
instigating the collapse of the Soviet Union, and neglecting
Russia's military.
	   The committee must still decide on a motion that accuses Yeltsin
of waging genocide against the Russian people.
	   Gennady Seleznyov, the speaker of the lower house, or State
Duma, said the committee has almost completed its work and will
send the impeachment motion to the full house in January for a
vote.
	   Yeltsin foes say enough evidence had been presented already to
impeach the president.
	   ``The lower house of the U.S. Congress brought an impeachment
motion against President Clinton only because he told a lie,''
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov told the Interfax news agency.
``But if you collect everything that Yeltsin lied about, two train
loads would not be enough to carry it.''
	   To be approved, the impeachment motion must win a two-thirds
majority in the lower house, which is considered unlikely. If it
passes that hurdle, the motion must also pass through the
Constitutional and Supreme Courts and then win passage in the upper
house of parliament.
	   Only then would Yeltsin be removed from office.
	   Meanwhile, Yeltsin gave a tongue lashing to Russia's top
policeman Tuesday, saying he had failed to stop the falsification
of crime statistics, a new report said.
	   Some police figures indicate that Russia's high crime rate has
gone down a bit in the last few years, but Yeltsin said his data
showed the opposite.
	   ``And you tell me everything is fine,'' Yeltsin told Interior
Minister Sergei Stepashin at the Kremlin meeting, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   ``I treat you with trust and respect,'' Yeltsin said. ``I judge
your work by its results. But God forbid that you should
overestimate yourself a little bit or relax.''
	   Stepashin, who is responsible for the police force, has
acknowledged that police falsified crime figures to earn perks and
make themselves look good. But he promised Yeltsin that statistics
would no longer get any ``window-dressing.''
	   Yeltsin has been sidelined by a string of illnesses, but said
stopping crime remained one of his top priorities.
	   The president also presented state awards to a number of
prominent Russians, including Mikhail Kalashnikov, the designer of
the famous AK-47 assault rifle, and Valentin Vlasov, the
presidential envoy to Chechnya who was freed Nov. 13 after six
months of captivity.
	   Yeltsin was recently hospitalized for two weeks to recover from
pneumonia. He was released about two weeks ago, and has been
holding regular meetings since then.

Indonesia looks for Suharto relative who was granted Jordanian
</HEADLINE>
citizenship
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with office of Jordanian prime minister confirming
Prabowo has been granted citizenship, other details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The government on Tuesday was trying
to locate a relative of ex-President Suharto who was granted
citizenship in Jordan but still faces a kidnapping investigation at
home.
	   The whereabouts of former Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto were not
immediately known after newspapers reported that he had
successfully sought citizenship from Amman. He is reported to have
been traveling in Europe.
	   Several months ago, Indonesian military investigators said they
might court-martial Prabowo, a son-in-law of Suharto, for his
alleged role in the abduction of nine political activists.
	   Prabowo was commander of Indonesia's special forces when the
pro-democracy activists were kidnapped and tortured earlier this
year. He lost his job after the ouster in May of the authoritarian
Suharto, who was dislodged by riots and protests.
	   In Amman, the office of Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh confirmed
Tuesday that Prabowo's bid for citizenship had been endorsed by a
royal decree on Dec. 10.
	   Prabowo is known to have close ties with Jordanian military
officers with whom he conducted joint training exercises in
Jakarta.
	   Indonesian Justice Minister Muladi said the government had asked
its embassy in Amman to investigate the case of Prabowo, a onetime
rising star in the Indonesian military whose career plummeted when
Suharto's fortunes turned.
	   ``The government will have to prevent him from going abroad
because he still has a case to be resolved,'' Muladi said.
	   However, he could not confirm that Prabowo, who for many
Indonesians represents the worst excesses of Suharto's rigid
32-year rule, was even in his homeland.
	   Last week, Prabowo's father told a Jakarta tabloid that his son
was in London.
	   Suharto's successor and former protege, President B.J. Habibie,
is implementing political reforms and the military has pledged to
clean up its human rights record. Student protesters say the
government is not moving fast enough on democratic change.
	   A military court was scheduled on Wednesday to begin the trial
of 11 members of the special forces who have been accused in the
kidnappings of the activists.

Thai Airways denies impact of air crash on its share prices
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Despite the recent crash of a Thai
Airways jetliner that killed 101 people, airline officials asserted
Tuesday that confidence by customers and shareholders remains
undented.
	   Airline officials said at the first shareholders' meeting since
the crash Dec. 11 that safety was Thai Airways' top concern.
	   ``The crash has not affected the share price,'' Mahidol
Chantragkurn, the chairman of the board, told a news conference
after the meeting. ``Shareholders have confidence in the company
and people understand that accidents such as this do not occur
often.''
	   Though Thailand is obliged to privatize the airline under an
economic bailout package supervised by the International Monetary
Fund, Thai Airways remains 93 percent-owned by the government.
	   On Dec. 9, the last day of trading before the crash, the share
price was 45.25 baht (dlrs 1.29). After reaching a low of 41.25
(dlrs 1.17) Dec. 16, it has regained value and closed Tuesday at
45.50 (dlrs 1.30).
	   The plane crashed in heavy rains during a night-time landing
approach at the airport in the southern city of Surat Thani.
	   The pilot, who was killed, has been criticized for making a
third attempt to land even though during the first two he had
difficulty in seeing the runway.
	   The airport has come under criticism for lacking an instrumental
landing system, which helps guide a plane in for landing.
	   The crash has raised questions about whether the airline, which
has had to cut costs as Thailand suffers its worst recession in
decades, has cut too far back and affected safety.
	   Mahidol denied it.
	   ``Thai Airways continues to set safety as its first priority,
even though we are on belt-tightening measures,'' he said. ``The
shareholders are worried about delays in dividends, not the crash's
implications.''
	   Shareholders have agreed to a postponement in dividends because
of the negative impact on earnings of foreign exchange losses,
Mahidol said.
	   Thamnoon Wanglee, president of the airline, said the company has
already paid 79.2 million baht (dlrs 2.2 million) in compensation
for 22 of those killed and 6.8 million baht (dlrs 187,000) for 34
injured.
	   Voice and flight data recorders will be sent to Canada or other
third countries for analysis, said Air Marshal Anek Phusuwan,
deputy chief of the staff of the Royal Thai Air Force.
	   Analysis should be completed in two weeks, Anek said, and the
cause of the crash would be officially disclosed.

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Newly recovered from the flu, Pope John Paul
II on Tuesday asked the faithful to pray for him so he could keep
carrying out his duties as he starts the third decade of his
papacy.
	   John Paul spoke to Rome's cardinals in his annual state of the
church address. Although it focused mainly on the work of this past
year, the speech came in the run-up to the 2000 Jubilee Year that
will be a culminating event of his papacy.
	   ``I ask all to continue to pray so I can serve the Lord each day
with renewed love,'' John Paul said.
	   It was one of his first appearances after a flu last week that
sent his temperature to 38 Celsius (100 F), forcing him to cancel
some appointments.
	   The 78-year-old pontiff made it through the long address without
any obvious signs of discomfort _ no faltering, no coughing fits.
He lingered afterward to speak a few words with many of the
cardinals.

Goran Ivanisevic's father and his opponent convicted of slander
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The father of Croatian tennis star Goran
Ivanisevic and the head of the national tennis association were
found guilty of slandering each other, Croatian media reported
Tuesday.
	   A Zagreb district court on Monday convicted both Srdjan
Ivanisevic and Suad Rizvanbegovic to 30-day prison terms or
one-year suspended sentences for insulting and slandering the
other, Jutarnji list daily reported.
	   For more than a year, the elder Ivanisevic and Rizvanbegovic
have been engaged in a row for a year over who should control
Croatian tennis.
	   The quarrel went so far that Goran Ivanisevic stopped playing
Davis Cup tennis tours for his country, demanding Rizvanbegovic
vacate the top post in Croatia's Tennis Association.
	   He even appealed to President Franjo Tudjman _ an avid tennis
player and fan _ to intervene. But Tudjman apparently chose instead
to back Rizvanbegovic, who is often seen in his company.
	   Following the spat, Srdjan Ivanisevic closed the Croatian
Indoors tour he previously owned. Boris Becker and other famous
players participated in the tournament when it existed.
	   Ivanisevic and Rizvanbegovic both spoke to the press regarding
the quarrel and subsequently sued each other for slander.
	   Rizvanbegovic said he was offended by an interview Ivanisevic
gave to independent Globus weekly in February, in which he accused
Rizvanbegovic of ``buying'' his position with someone else's money
and not being a true Croat, as he arrived only in 1996.
	   Rizvanbegovic, who also is a head of the country's biggest
insurance company, said that the sentence was ``inappropriate.''
	   Ivanisevic, for his part, sued Rizvanbegovic over his claim that
Ivanisevic formed a pro-Yugoslav party in interviews he gave to
Vjesnik and Vecernji list dailies.
	   Croatia proclaimed independence from the former Yugoslavia in
1991, triggering a six-month war with minority Serbs in the
country.

Investigation completed into murder of U.N. worker in Georgia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Police have completed an investigation
into the shooting death of Polish woman who worked for the United
Nations in Georgia, and the case has been sent to court, an
official said Tuesday.
	   Maria Magdalena Wewiorska, 31, was shot at point-blank range on
July 14 when she apparently startled a burglar in her apartment in
central Tbilisi.
	   The suspect, 20-year-old Zurab Bregvadze of Georgia, was
arrested in August.
	   The case was sent to the Tbilisi municipal court last Friday,
and hearings are expected to begin in late January or early
February, said chief investigator Revaz Zarandia.
	   Bregvadze, who lived near Wewiorska, was identified by neighbors
who reported seeing him run out of her house shortly after the
shooting, police officials said.
	   U.N. officials said Wewiorska had moved to Tbilisi to work as a
secretary for the head of the U.N. mission in Georgia.
	   U.N. observers are in Georgia to monitor the truce between
government forces and separatists in the northwestern Black Sea
province of Abkhazia. The separatists took control of the province
in a 1992-93 war.

U.S. returns military drill ground to Okinawa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. armed forces handed back a drill ground in
Okinawa on Tuesday as part of an agreement to reduce the American
military presence on the southern Japanese island, an official
said.
	   The Aha drill site _ comprising 480 hectares (1,186 acres) of
land and 7,900 hectares (19,513 acres) of water _ is the first of
11 U.S. facilities that will revert to Japan under a 1996 deal,
said regional defense official Kenji Fujimoto.
	   The United States has promised to eventually give back 20
percent of the territory in Okinawa occupied by U.S. troops.
	   Marines have been using the Aha facility in northern Okinawa for
small-unit training, including exercises in amphibious landings and
setting up command posts. It lies within the larger Northern
Training area, which Japan has agreed to extend by 37 hectares (93
acres) of land and 119 hectares (300 acres) of water to allow
Marines to continue practicing amphibious landings.
	   Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka was quoted by Kyodo News
as saying the handover was ``very significant'' because it
symbolizes progress in efforts to scale back the U.S. military
presence in Okinawa.
	   ``The government will continue working toward the reorganization
and reduction of the military facilities... to lessen the burden on
Okinawa,'' the top government spokesman told a press briefing.
	   Two-thirds of the 47,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan are
concentrated on the island, about 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles)
southwest of Tokyo, even though it accounts for less than 1 percent
of Japan's total land area.
	   The U.S. military presence has long rankled Okinawa residents,
who have been angered in recent years by a string of violent crimes
_ including the rape of a 12-year-old girl _ committed by Marines
stationed on the island.

Moroccan star signs contract with Southampton
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hughes ruled out for two games &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHAMPTON, England (AP) _ Moroccan international striker
Hassan Kachloul, who scored in the 3-1 victory that lifted
Southampton off the foot of the Premier League on Saturday, has
signed a 2 1/2 year contract by the club.
	   Hired from French runner up Metz on a three-month deal, Kachloul
has impressed Saints manager Dave Jones who has now signed the
27-year-old forward until June 2001.
	   ``Someone recommended him to me, and the next thing I know he
turned up on our doorstep with two suitcases,'' Jones said on
Tuesday.
	   ``But he's really impressed me with his attitude and skill. I'm
delighted to have signed him on a long-term deal, and we are now
working on improving his stamina levels to ensure he can last the
full 90 minutes.''
	   Kachloul will be unable to team up with veteran striker Mark
Hughes in the two games on Saturday and Monday because the Welsh
international has been ruled out through suspension.
	   The former Manchester United, Barcelona and Chelsea star
appeared before a Football Association disciplinary committee on
Tuesday and received the ban for accumulating 11 yellow cards this
season.

French oil company Elf Aquitaine invests in Black Sea drilling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ France's oil giant Elf Aquitaine
signed an agreement Tuesday with Romania's national oil company
Petrom for oil exploration and drilling in the Black Sea.
	   ``This is another important step in Romanian-French bilateral
relations,'' said Radu Berceanu, Romanian trade and industry
minister.
	   It was the second important French investment here in the last
month. Societe Generale paid dlrs 200 million for a 51 percent
stake in the Romanian Development Bank. French auto manufacturer
Renault is in negotiations to buy the Romanian Dacia car maker.
	   Under the oil contract, Elf and Petrom will explore a surface of
10,000 sq. kilometers (4,000 sq. miles) in Black Sea for the next
30 years.
	   Elf will initially pay dlrs 10 million, and if they find oil,
they will pay up to dlrs 500 million for development projects, said
Anca Turcea, a spokeswoman for the Romanian trade and industry
ministry.
	   Elf is one of the world's foremost oil companies which
specializes in deep sea drilling. Romania, once the richest oil
country in the Balkans, has not explored the Black Sea, lacking the
necessary equipment.
	   Petrom extracted in 1998 almost 6 million tons of crude oil all
over the country and exported dlrs 150 million worth of oil.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. chairman Isamu Kawai,
who was arrested this month for allegedly bribing a lawmaker, has
resigned to take responsibility for the scandal, the company said
Tuesday.
	   Kawai, 76, is suspected of giving 5 million yen (dlrs 43,000) in
kickbacks to ruling Liberal Democratic Party legislator Yojiro
Nakajima in exchange for help in securing a government defense
contract.
	   The former Fuji chairman was also indicted Tuesday on the
bribery charges, Kyodo News reported.
	   Yasuyuki Kogure, 64, a former Fuji Heavy executive director, has
also been arrested and indicted on suspicion of making illegal
payments to Nakajima.
	   A Fuji Heavy spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that the chairman post will remain vacant for now.
	   Nakajima, 39, a Liberal Democratic Party member of Parliament,
was arrested last month on charges of ordering false receipts made
to account for missing party money. The arrest was unrelated to the
Fuji Heavy Industries case.
	   Fuji Heavy Industries is the maker of Subaru automobiles.

Russian Communists plan to give quick approval to budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: NEW 7th graf with additional Zyuganov quote. CORRECTS grafs 10
to note that wages debts are to state workers, and does not include
private sector. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said Tuesday he
wasn't entirely pleased with the 1999 budget, but his party would
probably support quick passage because of the country's financial
turmoil.
	   ``We have a difficult choice between bad and very bad because
the present government has inherited from its predecessors only
debts and troubles, but no resources,'' Zyuganov told Russian news
agencies.
	   An austere, realistic budget is seen as essential for
stabilizing Russia's economy. The lower house of parliament, the
State Duma, is to begin discussing the draft budget Thursday, and
passage has required months of rancorous debate in recent years.
	   But the Communists, the largest faction in parliament, have been
generally supportive of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's
government, raising hopes that the budget will win swift approval.
	   ``The budget, it appears, should be passed on the first
reading,'' Zyuganov said.
	   The Duma must approve the budget in four readings, and then it
goes to the upper house, which usually passes it with little delay.
	   The Communists have regularly called for more state spending to
help impoverished individuals and ailing industries. Zyuganov also
said he wanted to see more money for the military, education and
culture.
	   But in the current economic crisis there's broad agreement that
the government simply doesn't have much money to spend.
	   Russia's overall economy is expected to shrink about 5 percent
this year and could be even worse next year. The International
Monetary Fund has forecast a decline of 8.3 percent next year for
Russia, which has seen its economy contract most of this decade.
	   Meanwhile, wage debts to state workers stand at 84.9 billion
rubles (dlrs 4 billion), said Deputy Prime Minister Valentina
Matvienko.
	   Millions of Russians receive their wages and pensions months
late, creating a cycle of debts that continues to hobble the
economy.
	   The government's debt to pensioners now stands at 30 billion
rubles (dlrs 1.4 billion) and overdue subsidies to families with
children is currently at 24 billion rubles (dlrs 1.1 billion).
	   ``We should do all we can not to allow children to go hungry,''
Matvienko said. ``In each such case, the local authorities should
take urgent measures.''
	   Russia is to receive food aid from the United States and Europe
this winter to guard against potential food shortages. So far, no
serious food problems have been reported.
	   The government will sell some of the food aid on the Russian
market, and the money will be used to pay pension arrears, Deputy
Prime Minister Gennady Kulik told a news conference Tuesday.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 10-11 with Barak pledge to revive peace
process, Sharon anecdote, graf 17. TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opened what
promised to be a bare-knuckles re-election campaign Tuesday by
deriding the ``fantasies and ambitions'' of his political rivals
and insisting the public will back his tough stance toward the
Palestinians.
	   ``We will go to the people and the people will give us the
support to achieve peace with security,'' the prime minister told
Israel radio a day after Israel's parliament voted overwhelmingly
for early elections and rejected Netanyahu's peace policies.
	   The collapse of the prime minister's hard-line governing
coalition and the start of what is expected to be a 4-month-long
campaign contest appeared to put the already ailing Mideast peace
process on hold.
	   That is drawing bitter protests from the Palestinians, who
insist Israel is bound to honor the Wye River accord despite the
political turmoil, just as it remains committed to other
pre-existing international agreements.
	   ``It's really unfortunate that the only thing that Mr. Netanyahu
has decided to stop is the peace process with us,'' chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told the AP on Tuesday.
	   Erekat called on the Clinton administration to press Netanyahu
to move ahead with the promised handover of West Bank territory. In
Washington, the State Department said Monday that Israel should go
ahead with the pullback, as stipulated by the accord.
	   Netanyahu refused anew Tuesday to do so, but insisted the
election upheaval did not play a part in the continued freeze on
Israeli compliance.
	   If the Palestinians meet demands laid down over the weekend by
the Cabinet, ``Israel will carry out its part in the agreement,
without any relation to the election schedule,'' the prime
minister's office said in a statement.
	   Netanyahu's latest conditions to the Palestinians, which they
have rejected, include a renunciation of claims to statehood rights
and Jerusalem; a confiscation of arms; an end to violence and
incitement to violence; and a renunciation of claims that Netanyahu
had agreed to release Palestinians jailed for killings.
	   A leading rival in the race for prime minister _ to be chosen by
a direct vote that is likely by the end of April _ is Ehud Barak,
head of the opposition Labor party. He pledged Tuesday that if
elected, he would ``go full engines forward for the peace
process.''
	   ``I would save the mutual trust that is the real precondition
for making bridges over political gaps,'' Barak told the AP.
``Netanyahu has lost the trust.''
	   In addition to Netanyahu and Barak, a half-dozen other figures
have indicated they will jump into what is shaping as a wild
political free-for-all.
	   Others likely to declare their candidacy include hard-liners
such as Benjamin Begin, the son of the late Prime Minister Menachem
Begin, and Limor Livnat, Netanyahu's communications minister.
	   Netanyahu brushed aside polls suggesting he would lose by a slim
margin to Barak and by a considerably wider margin to popular
former army chief of staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, who has indicated
his intention to form a centrist party.
	   ``The fantasies and ambitions of all those who want to be prime
minister _ please. We will allow the voters to decide who needs to
lead the state,'' the prime minister said in the radio interview.
He predicted he would draw ``utmost, massive'' support from voters
from his conservative Likud party.
	   Likud, though, was already weathering a storm of defections. Dan
Meridor, Netanyahu's former finance minister, said Tuesday he was
quitting the party and entering the race for prime minister
himself.
	   The plethora of candidates has already become a topic for jokes.
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, appearing Tuesday at a
ribbon-cutting for a new highway interchange, drew snickers when he
expressed mock surprise that the other dignitaries at the ceremony
hadn't declared their candidacies for prime minister yet. Even
Netanyahu was among those attending, and even he laughed.
	   The early elections bill given preliminary approval by lawmakers
on Monday must pass two more parliamentary readings, but Netanyahu
has said he will not try to block its final passage.

Russian Communists call for defense union with India, China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Communist leaders called Tuesday for a
defense partnership with India and China to offset what they
perceive as the military dominance of the United States, a news
report said.
	   The recent U.S. and British bombings of Iraq showed ``what may
happen if (American) policies are disliked overseas,'' Communist
Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   The proposal for a ``strategic triangle'' between Russia, India
and China was first made by Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
during his trip to India this week. India and China are leading
buyers of Russian arms.
	   Russia, China and India all opposed the use of force against
Iraq to make Saddam Hussein comply with the U.N. weapons
inspectors. Russian hard-liners claimed that the West may some day
attack Russia.
	   Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who serves as speaker of the
lower house of Russia's parliament, supported Zyuganov's call.
	   ``Tomorrow any country whose president or position is opposed by
the masters of the world may become a target of violence,''
Seleznyov was quoted as saying Tuesday during a visit to
Yugoslavia.
	   Seleznyov met with Mira Markovic _ the hard-line communist wife
of Serbia's authoritarian president Slobodan Milosevic _ and the
two condemned the bombings of Iraq, Interfax reported.
	   Markovic was quoted as saying that ``the three historically
great nations _ Russia, India and China _ are capable of assuming
responsibility for the future of the world.''
	   Separately, Russian Deputy Trade Minister Igor Mitrofanov
claimed Tuesday that India and China may buy up to 200 Russian
military aircraft over the next two years. That would bring Russia
between dlrs 8 billion and 10 billion, Interfax reported.
	   Mitrofanov didn't provide any details. An agreement on that
scale would be far in excess of any previous aircraft deals between
the countries.

Eight grand slam singles winners in '98 free-for-all
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS to South American in 15th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By STEVE WILSTEIN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Tennis Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Parity ruled tennis in 1998, a year when eight
players captured grand slam singles titles _ four for the first
time _ and a few stalwarts of the old guard withstood the
challenges of feisty young upstarts.
	   In the end, Pete Sampras secured the men's No. 1 ranking for a
record sixth straight year, a feat he can't imagine anyone else
matching, and Lindsay Davenport grabbed the women's top spot for
the first time.
	   ``I know what it takes,'' Sampras said of his long reign. ``I
really don't see anyone in today's game having the consistency,
having the durability that it takes to be No. 1 six years. That is
the majority of a career. You need the game, you need the heart,
you need the mind. Some guys have two of the three. Some guys have
a little bit of the three. In order to do it for six years, you
need everything.''
	   The competition is so fierce in tennis these days, with anyone
in the top 100 capable of beating anyone else, Sampras said, that
it would take an extraordinary player to come along and do what he
has done.
	   ``Maybe when I'm done playing, or when I'm 56 years old, there
might be somebody able to do it,'' he said.
	   The depth of the game on the men's and women's tours was evident
from the start of the year to the finish.
	   Along the way, it was a free-for-all. Scissor-kicking
30-year-old Petr Korda won his first major at the Australian Open,
where Martina Hingis briefly continued her one-year dominance of
the women's tour.
	   Spain's Carlos Moya notched his first big title at the French
Open, while compatriot Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario proved she's not
quite ready for retirement at 26 as she won for the third time at
Roland Garros.
	   At Wimbledon, Sampras won for the fifth time in six years to
gain his 11th major title, and 29-year-old Jana Novotna finally
delivered more smiles than tears in her third shot at the
championship.
	   When the U.S. Open rolled around, Patrick Rafter proved his '97
victory was no fluke, and Davenport produced the most solid
performance of her six-year career to win her first major.
	   Yet beyond the diversity of all those grand slam champions,
there were others who filled out the year with grand moments, great
challenges and promises for the future.
	   Monica Seles, once indomitable before tragedies and injuries
took their toll, came tantalizingly close to a fairy-tale triumph
in France just three weeks after her father-coach, Karolj, died of
cancer. The crowd and virtually the whole tennis world was pulling
for Seles, and even Sanchez-Vicario, who beat her in their
three-set final, would have been happy to see her opponent win.
	   Steffi Graf made a fitful return to the game at Wimbledon after
a yearlong absence due to injuries and cried when she spoke of how
she had briefly considered retirement. And though the 29-year-old
Fraulein Forehand never quite overcame her rustiness, she sparkled
at times and showed she might have another major or two left in her
if she can stay healthy.
	   Venus Williams started off the year boasting that she would be
No. 1 by the end. She finished a respectable No. 5, and would
surprise no one if she delivered on her promise this year. Her
younger sister, Serena, didn't develop quite as much, but remains a
threat at No. 20.
	   On the men's tour, Marcelo Rios made his mark, reaching his
first major final at the Australian, ascending to the No. 1 spot
for a total of six weeks, and finishing No. 2 with seven titles in
eight finals. The Chilean became the first South American to rank
No. 1 in the 25-year history of the ATP rankings.
	   Spain's Alex Corretja, who lost to compatriot Moya in the French
final, closed out the year by taking the ATP Tour World
Championship in Germany to finish No. 3 in the rankings. A winner
on carpet, clay and hard courts this year, with five titles in
seven finals, Corretja had the highest season-ending ranking of any
Spaniard in ATP history.
	   Andre Agassi never got beyond the fourth round of a major during
the year, but he worked his way back into playing shape with the
biggest one-year jump into the Top 10 in ATP history by climbing
from No. 122 to No. 6. He led the tour with 10 finals, won half of
those, and equaled Rios for the tour lead with 68 match wins.

Christmas lottery distributes massive winnings in Spain

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Christmas festivities got off to a jubilant
start for dozens of retirees in the southeastern town of La Union
who had shares in the total top prize of 42 billion (dlrs 300
million) in Spain's Christmas lottery, _ billed as the world's
richest.
	   News reports said champagne corks were poppping at The
Penioners' Home as residents and neighbors celebrated the club's
win of 3 billion pesetas (dlrs 21 million) after buying 10 of the
140 winning series 21856, each worth 300 million pesetas (dlrs 2.1
million)
	   The lottery, which began in 1818, comprises of number series
split into 140 tickets which are valued at 30,000 pesetas (dlrs
2,100) each. The tickets are subsequently divided into 10 shares
worth 3,000 pesetas (dlrs 21) each and are then often subdivided
into smaller parts.
	   Known as ``El Gordo'' (The Fat One), the lottery dished out a
total of 194 billion pesetas (dlrs 1.4 billion) in winnings this
year to thousands of ticket holders throughout the country.
	   It was not immediately clear exactly how many people in the
pensioners's home had won. Prizes were estimated to range from 1.6
million pesetas (drls 10,000) to 30 million pesetas (dlrs 210,000).
	   ``Let's say I won't be able to run wild with it, but I'll be
able to keep my head high'' Carmen Hernandez, a neighbor of the
club, told the private news agency Europa Press.
	   She said her winnings, which she declined to quantify, would
help get medical treatment for her husband, who suffers from an
unspecified illness.
	   Also lucky was Juan Gomez, a 54-year-old unemployed father of
four who was entitled to 10 million pesetas (dlrs 70,000) after
buying two shares of 500 pesetas (dlrs 3.5) each in what is the
most popular lottery of the year in Spain.
	   ''Now I'll be able to pay off the mortgage and help out my
sons,'' Gomez, who lives in the northeastern town of Sabadell, told
reporters. The national news agency Efe said three of Gomez's sons
were unemployed and a fourth was a student.
	   Shares of the winning number series, 21856, were sold in six
towns across Spain.
	   Each year, millions of television viewers watch as children from
a school in Madrid pick out numbered balls from drums and sing out
the winning number in a ceremony that lasts some four.
	   The second prize of 144 million pesetas (dlrs 1 million) went to
the each of the 140 series numbered 07308.
	   Most Spaniards share tickets with family members, friends and
coworkers, so lottery windfalls ripple through whole communities.
	   Financial pressures were also certain to be easier for
66-year-old street tobacco seller Miguel Trillo who news reports
said planned to use the 30 million pesetas (dlrs 210,000) he'd won
``to pay off debts and share with my daughters.''
	   ``Nobody pays any attention to you when you're broke,'' Efe
cited Trillo as telling journalists in a cafe in the southern port
city of Malaga where he lives.
	   Income from ticket sales was 250 billion pesetas (dlrs 1.8
billion) this year, 8.9 percent up on last year, according to the
State Lottery Department.
	   The Spanish Treasury hives off 30 percent of the total raised
before the draw takes place to keep the winnings tax free.

Bomb threats add to scare at German railways
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Amid jitters about a blackmail attempt
against the German railway, police arrested a man Tuesday for
threatening to blow up a train station.
	   The 44-year-old unemployed man was nabbed shortly after calling
the city fire department saying he would blow up the station in
Fulda, 90 kilometers northeast (55 miles) northeast of Frankfurt.
No bomb was found.
	   Authorities said there was no apparent link to a series of
attacks on rail lines this month linked to extortionists. The
sabotage has prompted overflights by air force reconnaissance
planes equipped with high-performance cameras. Helicopters and 400
border police and are also patrolling rail lines.
	   With Deutsche Bahn railways and travelers alike unsettled,
officials revaled more measures to protect trains Tuesday.
	   Rudi Schaefer, head of the rail workers' union, said on ARD
television that federal border police with night vision equipment
are accompanying trains after dark to help detect any sabotage.
	   Manfred Schell, chairman of the railway engineers union, said
empty trains were being sent out to check main lines before dawn
before the day's passengers traffic starts.
	   The checks center on the northeast of the country, where recent
sabotage has taken place.
	   Federal criminal investigators on Tuesday linked three attacks
to extortionists who the national railways say have demanded 10
million marks (dlrs 6 million) in several ransom letters.
	   In the most serious incident, a cargo train carrying paper rolls
derailed Friday near Anklam, 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of
Berlin, after someone loosened bolts holding down the tracks. No
one was hurt.
	   Bild newspaper reported the special tools used were believed
stolen from the railway in Brandenburg, but officials declined to
confirm that.
	   Also linked to the blackmailers was a similar attack that forced
a high-speed ICE train enroute from Hannover to Berlin into an
emergency stop on Dec. 8.
	   Transport Minister Franz Muentefering has said the government
will spare no ``personnel, energy, money or technology'' to solve
the extortion case.
	   But railway unions have criticized company management, saying
they kept employees in the dark too long about the threat.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opened what
promised to be a bare-knuckles re-election campaign Tuesday by
deriding the ``fantasies and ambitions'' of his political rivals
and insisting the public will back his tough stance toward the
Palestinians.
	   ``We will go to the people and the people will give us the
support to achieve peace with security,'' the prime minister told
Israel radio a day after Israel's parliament voted overwhelmingly
for early elections and rejected Netanyahu's peace policies.
	   The collapse of the prime minister's hard-line governing
coalition and the start of what is expected to be a four-month
campaign contest appeared to put the already ailing Mideast peace
process on hold.
	   That is drawing bitter protests from the Palestinians, who
insist Israel is bound to honor the Wye River accord despite the
political turmoil, just as it remains committed to other
international agreements.
	   ``It's really unfortunate that the only thing that Mr. Netanyahu
has decided to stop is the peace process with us,'' chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told The Associated Press on
Tuesday.
	   Erekat urged the Clinton administration to press Netanyahu to
move ahead with the promised handover of West Bank territory. In
Washington, the U.S. State Department said Monday that Israel
should go ahead with the pullback, as stipulated by the accord.
	   Netanyahu refused anew Tuesday to do so, but insisted the
election upheaval did not play a part in the continued freeze on
Israeli compliance.
	   If the Palestinians meet demands laid down over the weekend by
the Cabinet, ``Israel will carry out its part in the agreement,
without any relation to the election schedule,'' the prime
minister's office said in a statement.
	   Netanyahu's latest conditions to the Palestinians, which they
have rejected, include a renunciation of claims to statehood rights
and Jerusalem; a confiscation of arms; an end to violence and
incitement to violence; and a renunciation of claims that Netanyahu
had agreed to release Palestinians jailed for killings.
	   A leading rival in the race for prime minister _ to be chosen by
a direct vote that is likely by the end of April _ is Ehud Barak,
head of the opposition Labor party. He pledged Tuesday that if
elected, he would ``go full engines forward for the peace
process.''
	   ``I would save the mutual trust that is the real precondition
for making bridges over political gaps,'' Barak told the AP.
``Netanyahu has lost the trust.''
	   In addition to Netanyahu and Barak, a half-dozen other figures
have indicated they will jump into what is shaping as a wild
political free-for-all.
	   Others likely to declare their candidacy include hard-liners
such as Benjamin Begin, the son of the late Prime Minister Menachem
Begin, and Limor Livnat, Netanyahu's communications minister.
	   Netanyahu brushed aside polls suggesting he would lose by a slim
margin to Barak and by a considerably wider margin to popular
former army chief of staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, who has indicated
his intention to form a centrist party.
	   ``The fantasies and ambitions of all those who want to be prime
minister _ please. We will allow the voters to decide who needs to
lead the state,'' the prime minister said in the radio interview.
He predicted he would draw ``utmost, massive'' support from voters
from his conservative Likud party.
	   Likud, though, was already weathering a storm of defections. Dan
Meridor, Netanyahu's former finance minister, said Tuesday he was
quitting the party and entering the race for prime minister
himself.
	   The plethora of candidates has already become a topic for jokes.
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, appearing Tuesday at a
ribbon-cutting for a new highway interchange, drew snickers when he
expressed mock surprise that the other dignitaries at the ceremony
hadn't declared their candidacies for prime minister yet. Even
Netanyahu was among those attending, and even he laughed.
	   The early elections bill given preliminary approval by lawmakers
on Monday must pass two more parliamentary readings, but Netanyahu
has said he will not try to block its final passage.

Eritrea: chances for peaceful settlement not exhausted
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING TO FIX SLUG &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Chances for a peaceful settlement to the
seven-month Eritrea-Ethiopian border conflict have not been
exhausted despite a recent and inconclusive OAU summit, a senior
Eritrean official has said.
	   Speaking to reporters late Monday, Foreign Minister Haile
Weldensae the conflict resolution organ of the Organization of
African Unity had only five hours at its meeting last weekend in
Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso to discuss half a dozen conflicts in
Africa.
	   But he said a high-level OAU team made up of representatives
from Zimbabwe, Burkina Faso and Djibouti would continue to work
toward a negotiated settlement to the conflict after drafting a
peace plan in early November.
	   Horn of Africa neighbors Eritrea and Ethiopia clashed in May and
June over undemarcated colonial boundaries, and hundreds were
killed.
	   Thousands of troops are hunkered down on either side of their
common 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) border, and period shelling and
massive weapons buildups keep tensions high.
	   Ethiopia accepted the OAU peace plan, but Eritrea objected to
several points, particularly the one that called for a unilateral
withdrawal of Eritrean troops from the contested Badime area and
the return of Ethiopian administrators.
	   Eritrea's counterproposal, presented to the OAU team two days
before the Dec. 17 summit, called for:
	   _ precise legal language related to border delineation;
	   _ mutual demilitarization of the Mareb Setit border area;
	   _ deletion of the recommendation calling for the return of
Ethiopian administrators to the Badime area;
	   _ altering the paragraph on human rights issues to reflect that
Ethiopia is deporting ethnic Eritreans and not vice-versa.
	   Weldensae said U.S. special envoy Anthony Lake was expected back
in the region for another round of talks with Eritrean and
Ethiopian officials but he did not know the dates of his next
shuttle mission.

Schroeder defends new Berlin Holocaust memorial plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, in remarks
published Tuesday, upheld his government's proposal to build a
Holocaust museum and research center in Berlin instead of a
long-debated huge sculpture.
	   German Jewish leaders have criticized the plan unveiled last
week by culture minister Michael Naumann as not powerful enough to
commemorate the killing of 6 million Jews by the Nazis. But
Schroeder insisted the idea was ``good.''
	   ``It not only helps recall the horror of the Nazi era but also
allows young people to learn something,'' he said in an interview
with the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung daily.
	   Last weekend's bombing of the Berlin grave of a former German
Jewish leader, Heinz Galinski, ``shows how important this
remains,'' he said.
	   Germany's best-known author, novelist Guenter Grass, said he
would back the museum if it is dedicated to all victims of the
Nazis, not only Jews.
	   Half a million Gypsies were killed by the Third Reich as well as
homosexuals and political prisoners, the author of ``The Tin Drum''
noted in an interview with the weekly Die Woche.
	   German politicians and intellectuals have debated plans for a
national Holocaust memorial for 10 years. A plot in central Berlin
has been set aside for it.
	   The leading design had been a cemetery-like field of 2,500
concrete pillars designed by U.S. architect Peter Eisenman.
	   Kohl was the project's biggest backer. But Schroeder, a Social
Democrat who defeated Kohl in September elections, has expressed
doubts about the monument. Parliament is to decide how to proceed
next year.

Russian journalist accused of treason to run for city council
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian military reporter charged with passing
secrets about Russia's navy to Japanese media is running for city
council in the Far Eastern port of Vladivostok, an official said
Tuesday.
	   Capt. Grigory Pasko is in jail in Vladivostok on charges of high
treason for allegedly giving out classified information about the
combat readiness of the Russian Pacific Fleet.
	   Pasko, a reporter for the military newspaper Boevaya Vakhta, or
Combat Vigil, maintains that the documents only detailed
environmental problems at several Russian naval bases.
	   He registered to run in the Jan. 17 election for the Vladivostok
legislature, and the electoral commission has approved his
candidacy, commission chairman Ilya Grinchenko said Tuesday,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. About 140 candidates are
expected to compete for 22 city council seats.
	   Pasko's aide Sergei Ivanchenko said the campaign was aimed at
drawing attention to Pasko's case and helping obtain his released
from pre-trial detention, among other things, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Pasko has been in jail since his arrest in November 1997. His
trial, postponed in October, is now expected to begin in
mid-January.
	   Pasko's case has drawn the attention of Russian and
international human rights organizations and journalist groups.
	   The Committee to Protect Journalists, based in New York, has
said it ``strongly protests the arrest and criminal prosecution of
Grigory Pasko for practicing his profession.''

New PSG president seeks to halt ``spiral to mediocrity''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Struggling French soccer giant Paris Saint-Germain
named Laurent Perpere as its new president on Tuesday.
	   Perpere replaces Charles Bietry, who quit the post Monday after
only five months in charge.
	   Perpere, 47, was previously director of finance at Canal Plus,
the pay television broadcaster that owns the club, the richest in
France.
	   Under Bietry, accused by some former players and officials of
interfering in team matters, PSG had a disastrous run of results
and was hampered by in-fighting.
	   It currently lies in 11th place in the French first division,
only seven points clear of the relegation zone.
	   Perpere said his aim was to qualify for European competition
next season.
	   ``The situation has not been easy for the players. We have seen
too many statements and counter-statements,'' Perpere told
reporters. ``The team is in a spiral of mediocrity and lacks
confidence. We need serenity and cohesion.''

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The world's biggest platinum
producer, Anglo American Platinum Corp., or Amplats, warned that
wage and conditions of employment talks with the National Union of
Mineworkers had reached deadlock and that a strike could begin
Wednesday.
	   ``Amplats is considering various courses of action and
discussions with the NUM are continuing,'' the company said in a
statement to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
	   Amplats said an NUM-led work stoppage occurred at its Lebowa
Platinum Mines division on Sunday. At issue was the use of
lightweight underground drilling equipment, but the dispute had
been ``settled through mutual agreement,'' Amplats said.
	   Steve Calladine, an Amplats spokesman, said he was confident an
agreement would be reached, heading off a strike and possible
disruption to platinum output.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Students and teachers infected
with the AIDS virus must be allowed to attend school and keep their
jobs, an education department spokesman said on Tuesday.
	   Though South Africa's constitution already defends such rights,
the government has recently drawn up policy protecting the 3
million South Africans with the HIV virus or AIDS from being
discriminated against in education.
	   ``This is a national policy to protect the rights of individuals
with AIDS,'' Bheki Khumalo said.
	   South Africa's AIDS epidemic is one of the fastest growing in
Africa, and every day 1,500 South Africans are infected. Sufferers
often become outcasts in society and lose their jobs.
	   The policy document concludes there is an ``insignificant risk''
of spreading the disease in schools and universities. It also
prohibits mandatory testing for pupils and teachers and AIDS
sufferers cannot be forced to disclose they have the virus.
	   ``Learners and students with HIV/AIDS should lead as full a life
as possible and should not be denied the opportunity to receive an
education,'' it said.
	   Where students are too ill to travel to classes, they should be
allowed to study at home, the document recommends.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The Defense Ministry in Harare denied
claims Zimbabwe sent troops to back government forces fighting
rebels in Angola, the state-controlled Herald newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   Officials dismissed allegations that some Zimbabwean soldiers
serving in the Congo were redeployed to fight UNITA rebels, who
have mounted a renewed onslaught against the government of Angolan
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, the newspaper said.
	   The allegations were made by Jonas Savimbi, leader of UNITA, the
Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola. Savimbi said Zimbabwean forces entered
Angola on Friday and were threatening an escalation of fighting.
	   Angolan troops are in a southern African alliance with Zimbabwe
and Namibia supporting embattled President Laurent Kabila in the
Congo.
	   The Herald, seen as a government mouthpiece, said Zimbabwe
President Robert Mugabe last week described Savimbi as a war
criminal who must be sought out and defeated.
	   ``This may have been misconstrued to mean that Zimbabwe will
hunt down Dr. Savimbi,'' the newspaper said, quoting unidentified
defense officials.
	   Zimbabwe has 8,000 troops backed by warplanes and armor in the
Congo.
	   --
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Chances for a peaceful settlement to the
seven-month Eritrea-Ethiopian border conflict have not been
exhausted despite a recent and inconclusive OAU summit, a senior
Eritrean official has said.
	   Speaking to reporters late Monday, Foreign Minister Haile
Weldensae the conflict resolution organ of the Organization of
African Unity had only five hours at its meeting last weekend in
Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso to discuss half a dozen conflicts in
Africa.
	   But he said a high-level OAU team made up of representatives
from Zimbabwe, Burkina Faso and Djibouti would continue to work
toward a negotiated settlement to the conflict after drafting a
peace plan in early November.
	   Horn of Africa neighbors Eritrea and Ethiopia clashed in May and
June over undemarcated colonial boundaries, and hundreds were
killed.
	   Thousands of troops are hunkered down on either side of their
common 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) border, and period shelling and
massive weapons buildups keep tensions high.
	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A judge has set Feb. 4 as the opening date
in the trial of three suspects in the murder of former Rwandan
government minister Seth Sendashonga, news reports said Tuesday.
	   Judge Daniel Aganyanya set the date Monday after the three
suspects pleaded innocent to gunning down the former Rwandan
Interior Minister and his driver in Nairobi May 16, the East
African Standard said.
	   Okiki Kiwanuka of Rwanda, Charles Muhanji Wamuthoni of Kenya and
Christopher Lubanga Mlondo of Uganda have been in police custody
since their arrest May 20.
	   They are not eligible for bail because murder is a capital
offense in Kenya.
	   Sendashonga, a Hutu, was a member of the predominantly Tutsi
Rwandan Patriotic Front that ousted a Hutu extremist government in
Rwanda in July 1994 after it carried out a three-month slaughter of
at least 500,000 people, mostly of them minority Tutsis.
	   Sendashonga and several other government officials were
dismissed from their posts in August 1995 after they protested the
reprisal killings of Hutu civilians by Tutsi soldiers.
	   Sendashonga had been living in exile in Kenya where his wife
works for the United Nations Environment Program.

Staking land claim, Jewish settlers start new neighborhood
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jewish settlers have begun work on a new
neighborhood at near the West Bank town of Jericho in hopes of
preventing the land from being ceded to the Palestinians.
	   Since the signing of the Wye River land-for-security accord two
months ago, settlers have increased the rate of both illegal and
legal building to try to block land transfers with so-called
``facts on the ground.''
	   Construction of the new neighborhood at the Mitzpeh Jericho
settlement of 200 families was approved by the defense ministry
several months ago and work began this week, said Eli Greenwald,
secretary of the local council.
	   ``If we can stop part of the implementation of the agreements,
we will have done a great thing for the state of Israel,''
Greenwald told The Associated Press on Tuesday.
	   Government permission to expand the settlement was granted even
though 10 percent of the homes in it are empty, the settlement
watchdog group Peace Now reported.
	   With the building of the 147 housing units in the new
neighborhood, Mitzpeh Jericho's population will double in size,
Greenwald said. The settlement has permission to build as many as
1,200 homes, which will be done over coming years, he said.
	   Settlers have placed mobile homes on nine new sites near
existing settlements since the Wye agreement, said Hagit Yaari,
spokeswoman for Peace Now.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has frozen
Israeli compliance with the Wye River accord, including land
handovers. But Israeli media say settlers' building is being
spurred by fears a new government might move to implement the pact.
	   Lawmakers on Monday overwhelmingly approved early elections,
which will probably be before the end of April.

Protesting school children block roads across Greece

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ High school children staged roadblocks on
highways and busy city streets across Greece Tuesday, stepping up
their two-month protest against education reforms.
	   The blockades crippled traffic in many parts of Athens and the
northern port city of Salonica and seriously disrupted road
transport elsewhere in the country.
	   The students, who are also occupying some 2,000 high schools,
are protesting against the reforms which introduce stricter marking
systems but will create more university places.
	   Education Minister Gerasimos Arsenis Tuesday insisted the new
measures would be enforced. But, in a concession to the protesters,
he said children in this school year would be given additional
opportunities to improve their grades.
	   ``This system is being enforced for the first time and has led
to some uncertainty, so we are prepared to takes steps to help the
students,'' Arsenis told a news conference.
	   The schools protest has added pressure on Premier Costas
Simitis' Socialist government, struggling to push through a wide
range on cost-cutting reforms this winter.
	   Most of these are part of Greece's attempt to qualify for the
European Union's single currency group by the end of next year. The
reforms have led to frequent strikes and mass demonstrations which
have made life unpleasant for motorists.
	   School children have staged daily rush-hour blockades of Athens'
main streets this month, demanding that the education reform law be
abolished altogether.
	   Teenagers Tuesday, chanting slogans and singing Christmas carols
with protest lyrics, came face-to-face with angry drivers but only
let ambulances and military vehicles through the roadblocks.
	   High blockades were staged outside Athens and other towns.
	   Near the central town of Larissa, school children blocked the
Athens-Salonica highway for several hours, clambering on to parked
tractors provided by disgruntled local farmers.
	   School protest groups voted Sunday to continue their campaign
into the next year, but the government is hoping the roadblocks and
school occupations will fizzle out over the Christmas holidays.

Germany takes France's place in Confederations Cup

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Germany will take part in next year's
Confederations' Cup in Mexico following the withdrawal of World Cup
champions France, FIFA said Tuesday.
	   The tournament will take place July 24 to Aug. 4 _ four days
earlier than planned _ to accommodate the new team, soccer's
governing body said.
	   After weeks of debate over the schedule and to the anger of FIFA
and local organizers, France pulled out because of clashes with its
domestic and European obligations.
	   The French move reflected a feeling by many European squads that
the Confederations Cup is an unnecessary feature on an overcrowded
soccer calendar.
	   In addition to the world champion and host nation, FIFA invited
Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United
States to participate in the competition.
	   ``FIFA consulted the German Football Association who have now
confirmed their participation following France's definite
withdrawal,'' FIFA said in a statement. Germany was eligible as the
1996 European Champion, it said.
	   FIFA initially moved the eight-nation event from Jan. 8-20 to
July 28-Aug. 8 to placate France. The French soccer federation said
it accepted this, but then changed its mind because the French
national league begins its 1999-2000 championship on July 28.
	   France then asked for the competition to be moved to the start
of the summer.
	   But FIFA refused to bow to this request, not least because South
America's Copa Libertadores isn't scheduled to end until June 16,
and the Copa America begins June 29 and runs through July 8.

citizenship
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with brother's remark on whereabouts, status

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The government on Tuesday was trying
to locate a relative of ex-President Suharto who was granted
citizenship in Jordan but still faces a kidnapping investigation at
home.
	   Former Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto's younger brother said Tuesday
that Prabowo was in Jordan's capital, Amman, undergoing medical
treatment.
	   ``Prabowo has been in Jordan for four months along with his
family,'' Hashim Djojohadikusumo told reporters.
	   Several months ago, Indonesian military investigators said they
might court-martial Prabowo, a son-in-law of Suharto, for his
alleged role in the abduction of nine political activists.
	   Prabowo was commander of Indonesia's special forces when the
pro-democracy activists were kidnapped and tortured earlier this
year. He lost his job after the ouster in May of the authoritarian
Suharto, who was dislodged by riots and protests.
	   Indonesian Justice Minister Muladi said the government had asked
its embassy in Amman to investigate the case of Prabowo, a onetime
rising star in the Indonesian military whose career plummeted when
Suharto's fortunes turned.
	   Last week, Prabowo's father told a Jakarta tabloid that his son
was in London.
	   In Amman, the office of Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh confirmed
Tuesday that Prabowo's bid for citizenship had been endorsed by a
royal decree on Dec. 10.
	   Hashim also confirmed the awarding of Jordanian citizenship, but
added that it was only honorary in nature and his elder brother had
no intention of abandoning his Indonesian nationality.
	   He added that his family was proud about it because it was an
honor from a foreign country.
	   Prabowo is known to have close ties with Jordanian military
officers with whom he conducted joint training exercises in
Jakarta.
	   Suharto's successor and former protege, President B.J. Habibie,
is implementing political reforms and the military has pledged to
clean up its human rights record. Student protesters say the
government is not moving fast enough on democratic change.
	   A military court was scheduled on Wednesday to begin the trial
of 11 members of the special forces who have been accused in the
kidnappings of the activists.

	   In Washington, Pentagon officials denied the report of missiles
fired.
	   Gen. Anthony Zinni, commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East,
who was preparing to leave Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland to
visit troops in the Middle East, said: ``We have no reports of any
of our aircraft involved in missile firings.''
	   He said that included British forces. Zinni said flights are
continuing, however.
	   The Iraqi News Agency, quoting an authoritative military
spokesman, said aircraft from the ``criminal aggressors'' _ used to
mean the United States and Britain _ came in two waves and the
second wave opened fire.
	   It said ``four formations of aircraft ... penetrated Iraq's
national airspace'' at 9:15 a.m. (0630 GMT), then returned in the
direction from which they had come.
	   The agency said five more formations entered Iraq at 2:17 p.m.
(1117 GMT) ``and approached northern Basra out of range of our
weapons and fired two stray missiles before fleeing.''
	   ``This violation is part of the policy to harm Iraq,'' the
agency added.

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Police have completed an investigation
into the shooting death of Polish woman who worked for the United
Nations in Georgia, and the case has been sent to court, an
official said Tuesday.
	   Maria Magdalena Wewiorska, 31, was shot at point-blank range on
July 14 when she apparently startled a burglar in her apartment in
central Tbilisi.
	   The suspect, 20-year-old Zurab Bregvadze of Georgia, was
arrested in August.
	   The case was sent to Tbilisi municipal court last Friday, and
hearings are expected to begin on Jan. 25, court official Irina
Dzhaparidze said.
	   Bregvadze, who lived near Wewiorska, was identified by neighbors
who reported seeing him run out of her house shortly after the
shooting, police officials said.
	   U.N. officials said Wewiorska had moved to Tbilisi to work as a
secretary for the head of the U.N. mission in Georgia.
	   U.N. observers are in Georgia to monitor the truce between
government forces and separatists in the northwestern Black Sea
province of Abkhazia. The separatists took control of the province
in a 1992-93 war.

S. African Anglo-American: Zambian copper deal not final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Anglo American Corp., the
South African mining and investment conglomerate, says it is still
negotiating to take over Zambia copper mines despite a statement to
the contrary by a Zambian official.
	   Anglo American said Monday it is concerned about current low
copper prices, and that it has not been able to attract partners,
it said.
	   The company said it has a memorandum of understanding with the
Zambian government, but the memorandum hasn't yet been ratified by
the government or the company.
	   Zambian Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi said Saturday that Anglo
American would take over Nchanga, Nkana and Konkola mines, the
remaining major assets of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines.
	   Anglo American said the memorandum of understanding - between
the government and ZCI Ltd., the company through which Anglo
American holds its interest in the mines - isn't legally binding.
	   ``Negotiations on several important issues are continuing and it
remains uncertain that agreement will be achieved on a basis
acceptable to both sides,'' the company said. ``A joint statement
will be issued on the conclusion of the current negotiations.''
	   Nawakwi said the final touches of the deal would be completed by
March 31. She said the agreement also had the government keeping a
20 percent stake.

Bulgaria thwarts illegal arm export
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria's security services have blocked
an attempt to export locally-manufactured, protable rockets to an
undisclosed African country which is under an international arms
embargo, an official said Tuesday.
	   Kiril Radev, head of Bulgaria's anti-organized crime service,
refused to provide any further details because the operation is
still underway.
	   Radev said agents seized the shipment this fall in cooperation
with ``specialized services'' of the United States and Britain.
	   ``This is an extremely serious case,'' Radev said. ``The plane
which was to be loaded with those weapons had landed in Bulgaria.''
	   Portable antitank and antiaircraft rockets are some of the
products in which Bulgaria's arms industry has specialized since
the Soviet era.

Report: Japan concerned about suspected Iranian missile part sales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi told Iran's
visiting foreign minister on Tuesday he is worried about suspicions
that Iran is supplying missile parts to countries like North Korea,
a report said.
	   Obuchi said that Iranian efforts to allay such fears would help
contribute to the development of bilateral ties, Kyodo News
reported, quoting a Japanese government official.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, who is on a three-day
visit to Tokyo, declined to comment on the issue during his meeting
with Obuchi, Kyodo said.
	   Tokyo has become deeply concerned about North Korean missile
development after the Stalinist state fired a rocket in August that
flew over Japan. U.S. and Japanese officials believe the launch was
a ballistic missile test.
	   Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura invited Kharrazi
during a trip to Tehran last April. Kharrazi's visit is the first
by an Iranian foreign minister to Japan in 11 years.

International officials disqualify Bosnian Serb police officers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The United Nations mission
removed two Bosnian Serb police officers from their duties for
involvement in the torture and ill-treatment of suspects and
witnesses, officials said Tuesday.
	   On Dec. 18, Momir Vukovic and Spasoje Camur were removed from
their duties and lost their certification to work as police in
Bosnia's Serb republic, Kelly Moore, spokeswoman for the U.N.
Mission in Bosnia said Tuesday.
	   Three other men who were involved in the wrongdoings, but who no
longer work as policemen were also stripped of their
qualifications.
	   The five were involved in the investigation of 14 persons who
were detained in August in connection with the killing of Srdjan
Knezevic, local police chief of Pale. Knezevic had switched his
loyalties from No. 1 war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic to more
moderate leaders.
	   International officials launched their own investigation of the
arrest, under suspicions that the 14 detainees were being
mistreated. According to Moore, they found Vukovic and Camur had
direct knowledge the 14 were being hidden and tortured for up to 10
days.
	   The acts committed by these police officers constitutes gross
misconduct and seriously violates international human rights
standards, as well as democratic policing principles, Moore said.
	   In September, U.N. officials also stripped Ljubisa Savic, former
chief of the Bosnian Serb's uniformed police, of his qualifications
for direct engagement in, and supervision of the torture and
ill-treatment of the detainees.
	   The U.N. has demanded that a criminal investigation be initiated
against these officers and will closely monitor this procedure too.
	   Since 1995, the United Nations has been involved in implementing
the peace in post-war Bosnia, including the certification of all
police officers employed by the state. Once stripped of their
qualifications, the officers are barred from ever exercising police
powers again anywhere in the country.

Two dead in South Mogadishu clashes over land
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somali (AP) _ At least two men were killed and more
than 15 others were wounded Tuesday in clashes between heavily
armed militiamen loyal to South Mogadishu warlord Hussein Mohamed
Aidid, witnesses said.
	   One group was connected with the Suleman sub-clan; the other
with an Islamic court in the southern half of the war-torn capital.
	   The fighting was said to be connected to disputes over land
ownership.
	   The witnesses said fighting began when a a group of militiamen
tried to kidnap another man, and militiamen from the Shirkole
Islamic court intervened.
	   Although three of the court's militiamen were wounded, the group
managed to restore calm to the area. One of the would-be kidnappers
as well as second unidentified man were killed.
	   Officials from the Islamic court said they would soon take up
the longstanding land dispute which civilian courts were never able
to resolve.
	   There has been no central government or administration in
Somalia since Aidid's late father, Gen. Mohamed Farah Aidid, and
north Mogadishu warlord Ali Mahdi Mohamed briefly joined forces to
oust longtime dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991, plunging the
country into civil war.
	   Islamic courts have been established in Mogadishu and other
parts of the country in a attempt to curb violence and settle civil
disputes.

	   ``The enemies made a bid that a riot would take place in the
country, but they were wrong because Iraqis are closer to their
leader now than ever,'' the weekly Al-Ittihad said in an editorial.
	   The view was echoed in other government newspapers, which also
claimed the four-day attack had built sympathy for Iraq among the
world's Muslims.
	   Also Tuesday, about 120 U.N. humanitarian workers evacuated
during the airstrikes headed back to Baghdad from neighboring
Jordan. A U.N. official said they would be back at work Wednesday.
	   Khalid al-Izzi, an aide to U.N. humanitarian coordinator Hans
von Sponeck, said the first job would be to assess damage from the
airstrikes.
	   On Monday night, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz gave the first
official casualty figures for soldiers in the bombardment, saying
62 were killed and 180 wounded. He repeated assertions that many
more civilians were killed, but refused to give figures.
	   Iraqi authorities have not taken foreign journalists to sites
where they reported heavy civilian casualties as they have in the
past _ an indication the casualties either were not high or were
scattered.
	   The attacks targeted key military bases, government buildings,
communication centers and military factories.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the airstrikes after chief
U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler accused Iraq of failing to
fully cooperate with his inspectors.
	   The weapons inspectors must certify that Iraq is free of weapons
of mass destruction before the U.N. Security Council will lift
economic sanctions imposed on Baghdad for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   Aziz and other officials said the attacks disrupted telephone
communications to Iraq's south and heavily damaged factories that
could be used to manufacture long-range missiles prohibited under
the U.N. resolutions.
	   In Washington, Zinni said the strikes hit 85 percent of their
targets, 74 percent of them successfully. He said a full damage
assessment of damage would probably take a few more days.
	   Zinni, head of Central Command which oversees U.S. military
operations in the Middle East, showed pictures of damage to Iraq's
Defense Ministry in Baghdad and the headquarter of the ruling Baath
Party.
	   ``I guarantee you, nobody's working in the Baath Party
headquarters,'' he joked, pointing to the scarred building.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, who was with Zinni as he
briefed reporters, termed Operation Desert Fox ``highly
successful.''
	   In London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the airstrikes
have set back parts of Iraq's ``military infrastructure several
years.''
	   Aziz maintained, however, that most of the strikes hit empty
barracks, adding that ``these barracks could be and will be
rebuilt.''
	   A U.S. intelligence report revealed by ABC News said most
critical equipment from inside the missile plants had been moved
and Iraqi technicians responsible for building missiles were at
home in bed _ and not at the plants _ during the attacks.
	   Iraq said that in addition to hitting missile factories, the
bombardments struck colleges, post offices, dormitories, a museum
and an oil refinery.
	   ``They want to ... strip Iraq of any serious industrial
capabilities,'' Aziz told a news conference in Baghdad. ``This is a
policy of hatred.''
	   But he contended that the United States and Britain failed to
seriously harm the Iraqi government or military. ``They boasted of
great success. ... They lied,'' he said.
	   Aziz reiterated Monday that Baghdad will not allow U.N. arms
monitors to return, but chief weapons inspector Butler said it was
up to the Security Council to decide the future of the inspectors.
	   ``It's not for Baghdad alone to make that declaration,'' Butler
told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio on Tuesday.

Villa manager warns Bosnich may go
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Mark Bosnich may have played his last
game for Aston Villa.
	   After six seasons as the club's No. 1 goalkeeper, the
26-year-old Australian, who has turned down several offers of a new
contract, is out of the team because of a shoulder injury and
manager John Gregory is looking for a replacement.
	   Michael Oakes, who has been understudy to Bosnich for the past
four seasons, is performing well and Gregory is looking at
experienced 'keepers, such as Dutch international Edwin van der Sar
and French World Cup star Pierre Barthez to move to Villa Park.
	   ``There is that danger that Mark may have played his last game
for Villa if someone comes in and establishes themselves,'' Gregory
said on Tuesday after Villa had re-estabilished its 3-point lead
atop the Premier League by winning at Charlton on Monday.
	   ``But then I think Mark is aware of the dilemma we are in as a
football club and that we have to look to replace him if he decides
to go.
	   ``Mark knows we have to do what is in the best interests of
Aston Villa. There is no sympathetic view taken by myself. It's all
about business and putting a winning team on the pitch.''
	   Bosnich, who will be a free agent at the end of this season, has
been linked with a move to Italian club AS Roma.
	   Because of his shoulder injury, which will sideline the
Australian for up to two months, there was speculation that Gregory
might go for England Under-21 'keeper Richard Wright. But the Villa
manager discounted a move for the 21-year-old Ipswich player.
	   ``Mark is 26. There are not many Englishman of the same age and
ability, and we might have to cast our net a little bit wider,''
Gregory said. ``You want people with experience if they are going
to have to be pitched into a championship battle.
	   ``We are not in a situation where we can look at some of the
better younger players around because the step up would be a
massive one. I have ruled out Richard Wright.
	   ``I also don't want a stop-gap. I don't want to pay 2 million
pound (dlrs 3.4 million) to get someone in to the end of the season
and then have to go out and spend 5 million (dlrs 8.3 million) on
another one,'' Gregory said.
	   ``It is one thing being linked to Van der Saar and Barthez _ but
I do believe Aston Villa are in a position to entice those sort of
people here.''

Angolan rebels strike center of strategic provincial city
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ UNITA rebels shelled Kuito on Tuesday,
striking the center of the key central highland city for the first
time since launching a retaliatory offensive two weeks ago to break
the government's grip on the area.
	   Several people, apparently civilians, were killed and others
were wounded during the morning attack, according to the private
Radio Eclesia.
	   Rebel artillery shells landed near the palace of the provincial
governor in the center of Kuito, about 500 kilometers (300 miles)
southeast of the capital Luanda, the radio said.
	   A building where several displaced people had taken shelter, and
a missionary school were also hit by mortar fire.
	   Kuito's population has risen to some 160,000 from 100,000 with
the arrival of thousands of displaced people fleeing the fighting
between UNITA and the government that began earlier this month
throughout the central highlands.
	   Kuito, the capital of the province of Bie lying on a vast plain,
has been the most embattled spot.
	   The government launched an attack earlier this month aiming to
gain control of UNITA's central highland strongholds Andulo, also
in Bie, and Bailundo, in the neighboring Huambo province.
	   The rebels were able to secure the bases and then launched an
offensive throughout the central zones, especially in the provinces
of Huambo, Bie and Malange.
	   A UNITA spokesman in Lisbon, Portugal, said UNITA was targeting
government positions in Kuito because the army's attack on the
Andulo had started from there.
	   ``Once Kuito is neutralized, the rest (of Bie province) will be
secured,'' said Carlos Morgado, adding that Kuito was the last town
in Bie under the government's hold.
	   During the two-week-old offensive, the rebels have targeted
Cunji, a village seven kilometers (4 miles) away that overlooks
Kuito. They also have kept Kuito's airport under siege to choke the
government's air supply line.
	   UNITA reportedly has three well-equipped regiments totaling
about 9,000 men entrenched in a diameter of 18 kilometers (11
miles) around Kuito. The government is said to have a 10,000-strong
battalion holed up in the city.
	   A defense analyst for the London-based International Institute
for Strategic Studies said the Angolan government might pull out of
other spots to defend Kuito.
	   ``From a political and logical point of view, it would be a very
important blow'' for the government to lose the provincial capital,
Terry Taylor said by phone.
	   The government has held Kuito since 1994, following heavy
battles with rebel forces which began when UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi rejected his defeat in the country's first elections and
returned to war, breaking a 1991 peace agreement.
	   ``It might make (the government) think seriously about their
deployment in the Republic of Congo,'' Terry Taylor said by phone.
	   The Angolan army has about 400 troops in the Republic of Congo
to support President Denis Sassou-Nguesso against insurgent
outlawed militia groups.
	   The government, along with Zimbabwe and Namibia, is also
supporting Congo's President Laurent Kabila against insurgents who
are backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   Angola has withdrawn at least one battalion from Congo following
the upsurge of fighting against UNITA rebels.
	   UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
_ on Monday accused Namibia and Zimbabwe of sending troops to
support President Jose Eduardo dos Santos in the renewed fighting.
	   Angolan Defense Ministry officials on Tuesday denied the claims.
	   UNITA and the government fought a two-decade civil war following
the country's 1975 independence from Portugal. A 1994 U.N.-brokered
peace agreement unraveled this year amid continuing hostilities
between both sides which have evolved into full-scale war.

Iraq says Western planes fire on Basra in southern Iraq

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.S. and British warplanes violated Iraqi
airspace and fired two ``stray missiles'' Tuesday in the direction
of the southern Iraqi city of Basra, the official Iraqi News Agency
reported.
	   The report did not define what it meant by ``stray missiles'' or
say if they had hit anything. The report comes three days after the
United States and Britain ended four waves of punishing airstrikes
on Iraq.
	   Western jets patrolling a no-fly zone over southern Iraq have in
the past fired if approached by Iraqi aircraft or Iraqi
anti-aircraft batteries lock on with their radar systems to the
Western craft.
	   U.S. officials said, however, they had no indication of Western
forces firing missiles in the region Tuesday.
	   Gen. Anthony Zinni, commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East,
who was preparing to leave Andrews Air Force Base to visit troops
in the Middle East, said: ``We have no reports of any of our
aircraft involved in missile firings.''
	   He said at the Maryland air base that his comment included
British forces. Zinni said flights are continuing, however.
	   The news agency, quoting an authoritative military spokesman,
said aircraft from the ``criminal aggressors'' _ used to mean the
United States and Britain _ came in two waves and the second wave
opened fire.
	   It said ``four formations of aircraft ... penetrated Iraq's
national airspace'' at 9:15 a.m. (0630gmt), then returned in the
direction from which they had come.
	   The agency said five more formations entered Iraq at 2:17 p.m.
(1117gmt) ``and approached northern Basra out of range of our
weapons and fired two stray missiles before fleeing.''
	   ``This violation is part of the policy to harm Iraq,'' the
agency added.
	   The reported incident came as the United States and Iraq
continued to trade rhetoric over the U.S.-British airstrikes of
last week.
	   While Washington characterized the offensive as a success,
Iraq's state-run newspapers declared Tuesday that President Saddam
Hussein's continued hold on power showed Iraq had emerged
victorious from the onslaught.
	   ``The enemies made a bid that a riot would take place in the
country, but they were wrong because Iraqis are closer to their
leader now than ever,'' the weekly Al-Ittihad said in an editorial.
	   The view was echoed in other government newspapers, which also
claimed the four-day attack had built sympathy for Iraq among the
world's Muslims.
	   About 120 U.N. humanitarian workers evacuated during last week's

work Wednesday.

Diana's butler loses charity job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's former butler has lost his job at
the charity set up in her memory.
	   Paul Burrell, 40, the man whom the late princess called ``my
rock,'' cleared out his desk Tuesday and said his goodbyes.
	   Burrell had been the chief fundraiser of the Diana, Princess of
Wales Memorial Fund, but was told that since the charity no longer
was actively raising money, the position wasn't necessary.
	   The fund's chief executive, Andrew Purkis, said he had offered
Burrell a new job as a roving ambassador for the charity, but that
he had refused.
	   Burrell spent the morning packing up boxes from his office, then
left the building saying only, ``I am very sad.''
	   Looking tearful, he hugged another fund employee, Jacqueline
Allen.
	   ``I think the general public know how much Paul has given to the
fund,'' she said later. ``I just think it is tragic that he is no
longer with it.''
	   The charity, which provides money for causes sponsored by the
late princess, will concentrate on managing its existing funds.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Fire broke out after someone poured
gasoline on the lower floor of one of Stockholm's main department
stores as it was crowded with Christmas shoppers Tuesday, injuring
at least two people.
	   Police said they arrested one person in connection with the
fire, but details were not immediately available, the Swedish news
agency TT reported.
	   The store faces the Hoetorget square, directly across from the
city's main concert hall. Firemen clolsed off the square, which
includes about 20 covered stalls for vendors of produce and leather
and woolen goods.
	   One of those injured was taken to hospital for treatment of
smoke inhalation. The extent of the others' injuries were not
immediately known.
	   The fire caused little visible damage to the store and was
declared extinguished about 45 minutes after the alarm

Iraq says Western planes fire on Basra in southern Iraq

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.S. and British warplanes violated Iraqi
airspace and fired two ``stray missiles'' Tuesday in the direction
of the southern Iraqi city of Basra, the official Iraqi News Agency
reported
	   The Pentagon denied the report, and Britain's Defense Ministry
said it was checking the account.
	   The report did not define what it meant by ``stray missiles'' or
say if they had hit anything. The report comes three days after the
United States and Britain ended four waves of punishing airstrikes
on Iraq.
	   Western jets patrolling a no-fly zone over southern Iraq have in
the past fired if approached by Iraqi aircraft or Iraqi
anti-aircraft batteries lock on with their radar systems to the
Western craft.
	   U.S. officials said they had no indication of Western forces
firing missiles in the region Tuesday.
	   U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Anthony Zinni, commander of U.S. forces
in the Middle East, who was preparing to leave Andrews Air Force
Base to visit troops in the Middle East, said: ``We have no reports
of any of our aircraft involved in missile firings.''
	   He said at the Maryland air base that his comment also was
referring to British forces. Zinni said flights are continuing,
however.
	   The news agency, quoting an authoritative military spokesman,
said aircraft from the ``criminal aggressors'' _ used to mean the
United States and Britain _ came in two waves and the second wave
opened fire.
	   It said ``four formations of aircraft ... penetrated Iraq's
national airspace'' at 9:15 a.m. (0630 GMT), then returned in the
direction from which they had come.
	   The agency said five more formations entered Iraq at 2:17 p.m.
(1117 GMT) ``and approached northern Basra out of range of our
weapons and fired two stray missiles before fleeing.''
	   ``This violation is part of the policy to harm Iraq,'' the
agency added.
	   The reported incident came as the United States and Iraq
continued to trade rhetoric over the U.S.-British airstrikes of
last week.
	   While Washington characterized the four-day offensive as a
success, Iraq's state-run newspapers declared Tuesday that
President Saddam Hussein's continued hold on power showed Iraq had
emerged victorious from the onslaught.
	   ``The enemies made a bid that a riot would take place in the
country, but they were wrong because Iraqis are closer to their
leader now than ever,'' the weekly Al-Ittihad said in an editorial.
	   The view was echoed in other government newspapers, which also
claimed the four-day attack had built sympathy for Iraq among the
world's Muslims.
	   About 120 U.N. humanitarian workers evacuated during last week's
airstrikes headed back to Baghdad from neighboring Jordan on
Tuesday morning, and a U.N. official said they would be back at
work Wednesday.
	   Khalid al-Izzi, an aide to U.N. humanitarian coordinator Hans
von Sponeck, said the first job would be to assess damage from the
airstrikes.
	   On Monday night, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz gave the first
official casualty figures for soldiers in the bombardment, saying
62 were killed and 180 wounded. He repeated assertions that many
more civilians were killed, but refused to give figures.
	   Iraqi authorities have not taken foreign journalists to sites
where they reported heavy civilian casualties as they have in the
past _ an indication the casualties either were not high or were
scattered.
	   The attacks targeted key military bases, government buildings,
communication centers and military factories.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the airstrikes after chief
U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler accused Iraq of failing to
fully cooperate with his inspectors.
	   The weapons inspectors must certify that Iraq is free of weapons
of mass destruction before the U.N. Security Council will lift
economic sanctions imposed on Baghdad for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   Aziz and other officials said the attacks disrupted telephone
communications to Iraq's south and heavily damaged factories that
could be used to manufacture long-range missiles prohibited under
the U.N. resolutions.
	   In Washington, Zinni said the strikes hit 85 percent of their
targets, 74 percent of them successfully. He said a full damage
assessment of damage would probably take a few more days.
	   Zinni showed pictures of damage to Iraq's Defense Ministry in
Baghdad and the headquarters of the ruling Baath Party. ``I
guarantee you, nobody's working in the Baath Party headquarters,''
he joked, pointing to the scarred building.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, who was with Zinni as he
briefed reporters, termed Operation Desert Fox ``highly
successful.''
	   In London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the airstrikes
have set back parts of Iraq's ``military infrastructure several
years.''
	   Aziz maintained, however, that most of the strikes hit empty
barracks, adding that ``these barracks could be and will be
rebuilt.''
	   A U.S. intelligence report revealed by ABC News said that most
critical equipment from inside the missile plants had been moved
and Iraqi technicians responsible for building missiles were at
home in bed _ and not at the plants _ during the attacks.
	   Iraq said that in addition to hitting missile factories, the
bombardments struck colleges, post offices, dormitories, a museum
and an oil refinery.
	   ``They want to ... strip Iraq of any serious industrial
capabilities,'' Aziz told a news conference in Baghdad. But he
contended that the United States and Britain failed to seriously
harm the Iraqi government or military.
	   ``They boasted of great success. ... They lied,'' he said.
	   Aziz reiterated Monday that Baghdad will not allow U.N. arms
monitors to return, but chief weapons inspector Butler said it was
up to the Security Council to decide the future of the inspectors.
	   ``It's not for Baghdad alone to make that declaration,'' Butler
told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio on Tuesday.

ICRC needs dlrs 50 million for Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CLARE NULLIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The International Committee of the Red Cross - the
main aid agency in Afghanistan _ wants 50 million Swiss francs
(dlrs 36 million) next year for projects to help the population
fend for itself.
	   Red Cross delegate Juan Martinez said Tuesday that general
economic hardship was growing, even though security had returned to
most parts of the country after years of war.
	   Such was the destitution and weariness of the people that none
heeded the calls of the ruling Taliban religious army to
demonstrate in favor of Iraq during the U.S. and British air
strikes, said Martinez, who just completed a 14-month stint in
Kabul.
	   In contrast to the United Nations and most other relief
organizations, the ICRC has continued its work under the Taliban,
which now controls most of Afghanistan.
	   ``We have had problems, but they haven't been insurmountable,''
said Martinez. ``We have ways of working based on patience and
negotiation. That has paid dividends over time.''
	   The ICRC cut its foreign staff in Afghanistan from 100 to about
60 after an Italian U.N. worker was shot in August.
	   U.N. international personnel pulled out altogether. The Taliban
blamed the incident on renegade soldiers angry at U.S. missile
attacks against suspected terrorist camps in eastern Afghanistan.
	   Even prior to that, relations were tense, with the Taliban upset
at not being given diplomatic recognition, and U.N. agencies
angered at discrimination against women and ban on education for
girls.
	   ``It's easier for us than the United Nations because of the
different mandates,'' said Martinez. ``The ICRC is considered by
everyone as a neutral intermediary. The United Nations isn't.''
	   He said it also helped that the Geneva-based ICRC relied on
discretion rather than publicity to get what it wanted.
	   In July, dozens of private aid groups quit Kabul to protest a
Taliban order forcing them to relocate to abandoned school
dormitories. They are beginning to trickle back _ on the Taliban's
terms _ but haven't yet resumed full-scale operations.
	   Red Cross aid programs are concentrated on 200,000 of the most
vulnerable people in Kabul _ including the handicapped and war
widows who aren't allowed to work to feed their families. It also
has medical care programs for women.
	   Despite the immediate plight of hundreds of thousands of people,
the ICRC wants to shift its focus on to longer-term projects to
help them fend for themselves, said Martinez.
	   After two decades of war and destruction, many have given up
hope.
	   ``We need projects that get people involved and that make them
work and not just be dependent on aid,'' said Martinez. Rather than
handing out charity, the Red Cross is getting people to work in
return for food, he said.
	   The appeal for 50 million francs will be made as part of an
overall appeal for funds early next year.

Germany replaces France in Confederations Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS background; WILL be UPDATED with reaction. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ European champion Germany will
replace World Cup winner France in next year's Confederations' Cup
in Mexico, FIFA said Tuesday.
	   The tournament will take place July 24 to Aug. 4 _ four days
earlier than planned _ to accommodate the Germans, soccer's
governing body said.
	   After weeks of debate over the schedule and to the anger of FIFA
and local organizers, France withdrew because of clashes with its
domestic and European obligations.
	   The French move reflected a feeling by many European squads that
the Confederations Cup is an unnecessary feature on an overcrowded
soccer calendar.
	   In addition to the world champion and host nation, FIFA invited
continental champions Brazil, New Zealand, Egypt and Saudi Arabia
along with South American and CONCACAF runners-up Bolivia and the
United States to participate in the competition.
	   ``FIFA consulted the German Football Association who have now
confirmed their participation following France's definite
withdrawal,'' FIFA said in a sttement.
	   Germany will play in Group B in Guadalajara against Brazil, the
United States and New Zealand.
	   FIFA initially moved the eight-nation event from Jan. 8-20 to
July 28-Aug. 8 to placate France. The French federation said it
accepted this, but then changed its mind because the French
national league begins its 1999-2000 championship on July 28.
	   France then asked for the competition to be moved to the start
of the summer.
	   But FIFA rejected the request. South America's Copa Libertadores
isn't scheduled to end until June 16, and the Copa America begins
June 29 and runs through July 8.

First Palestinian airline arrives in Egypt

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The first commercial Palestinian flight to
Egypt landed at Cairo's International Airport on Tuesday,
inaugurating an air route between the autonomous Gaza Strip and
Egypt, airport officials said.
	   The Palestinian Airlines flight, which carried 14 passengers,
was met by Egyptian Transportation Minister Suleiman Metwally.
	   The inauguration of the route between Gaza and Cairo is a
``confirmation of Palestinian sovereignty over Palestinian lands''
as well as ports and airports, Metwally said.
	   The Gaza airport was inaugurated in late November under the
U.S.-brokered Wye River accord which envisages Israel ceding more
land to the Palestinians in return for security guarantees.
EgyptAir, the national carrier, sent the first plane for the
inauguration.
	   Palestinian Airlines already has a route from Gaza to the
Jordanian capital, Amman.
	   The airline will fly three flights a week to Egypt, an airport
official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Last Friday, Egypt's national carrier, EgyptAir, inaugurated its
route to Gaza.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Christmas festivities started jubilantly
Tuesday for dozens of retirees in a southeastern Spanish town who
will share part of the top prize of 42 billion pesetas (dlrs 300
million) in Spain's lottery _ billed as the world's richest.
	   News reports said champagne corks were poppping at The
Pensioners' Home in La Union as neighbors celebrated the club's win
of 3 billion pesetas (dlrs 21 million) after buying 10 of the 140
winning tickets, each worth 300 million pesetas (dlrs 2.1 million).
	   It was not immediately clear exactly how many pensioners held
shares in tickets for the winning number _ 21856. Prizes were
estimated to range from 1.6 million pesetas (dlrs 10,000) to 30
million pesetas (dlrs 210,000).
	   ``Let's say I won't be able to run wild with it, but I'll be
able to keep my head high'' Carmen Hernandez, a neighbor of the
club, told the private news agency Europa Press.
	   Known as ``El Gordo'' (The Fat One), the lottery dished out 194
billion pesetas (dlrs 1.4 billion) in winnings this year to
thousands of ticket holders throughout Spain.
	   The lottery sells 140 tickets, valued at 30,000 pesetas (dlrs
210) for each five-digit number. The tickets are subsequently
divided into 10 shares worth 3,000 pesetas (dlrs 21) each and are
then often subdivided into smaller parts.
	   Most Spaniards share tickets with family members, friends and
coworkers, so lottery windfalls ripple through whole communities.
Shares of the winning number were sold in six towns across Spain.
	   Each year, millions of television viewers watch as Madrid
schoolchildren pick out numbered balls from drums and sing out the
winning number in a four-hour ceremony.
	   Juan Gomez, a 54-year-old unemployed father of four learned
Tuesday morning that his two shares of 500 pesetas (dlrs 3.5) each
entitled him to 10 million pesetas (dlrs 70,000) in prize money.
	   ``Now I'll be able to pay off the mortgage and help out my
sons,'' said Gomez, who lives in the northeastern town of Sabadell.
The national news agency Efe said three of Gomez's sons were
unemployed and a fourth was a student.
	   Financial pressures were also certain to be easier for
66-year-old street tobacco seller Miguel Trillo who planned to use
the 30 million pesetas (dlrs 210,000) he'd won to pay off debts and
``share with my daughters.''
	   Income from ticket sales was 250 billion pesetas (dlrs 1.8
billion) this year, 8.9 percent up on last year, according to the
department that runs the lottery, founded in 1818.
	   The Spanish Treasury takes 30 percent of the revenues before the
draw to keep the winnings tax-free.
	   The second prize of 144 million pesetas (dlrs 1 million) will be
spilt among holders of tickets bearing the number 07308.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A Colombian cargo plane trying to land
in dense fog crashed early Tuesday just outside the Medellin
airport, killing all five people on board.
	   The Russian-built Antonov carrying morning newspapers went down
just after midnight, 30 minutes after leaving Bogota for Jose Maria
Cordova airport in Colombia's second largest city.
	   Airport officials said the plane struck ground about a half-mile
(a kilometer) from the runway and broke into pieces, throwing the
three-man crew and two passengers over a wide area.
	   Authorities have not determined the cause of the crash, but poor
visibility was suspected.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Christmas festivities started jubilantly
Tuesday for dozens of retirees in a southeastern Spanish town who
will share part of the top prize of 42 billion pesetas (dlrs 300
million) in Spain's lottery _ billed as the world's richest.
	   News reports said champagne corks were poppping at The
Pensioners' Home in La Union as neighbors celebrated the club's win
of 3 billion pesetas (dlrs 21 million) after buying 10 of the 140
winning tickets, each worth 300 million pesetas (dlrs 2.1 million).
	   It was not immediately clear exactly how many pensioners held
shares in tickets for the winning number _ 21856. Prizes were
estimated to range from 1.6 million pesetas (dlrs 10,000) to 30
million pesetas (dlrs 210,000).
	   ``Let's say I won't be able to run wild with it, but I'll be
able to keep my head high'' Carmen Hernandez, a neighbor of the
club, told the private news agency Europa Press.
	   Known as ``El Gordo'' (The Fat One), the lottery dished out 194
billion pesetas (dlrs 1.4 billion) in winnings this year to
thousands of ticket holders throughout Spain.
	   The lottery sells 140 tickets, valued at 30,000 pesetas (dlrs
210) for each five-digit number. The tickets are subsequently
divided into 10 shares worth 3,000 pesetas (dlrs 21) each and are
then often subdivided into smaller parts.
	   Most Spaniards share tickets with family members, friends and
coworkers, so lottery windfalls ripple through whole communities.
Shares of the winning number were sold in six towns across Spain.
	   Each year, millions of television viewers watch as Madrid
schoolchildren pick out numbered balls from drums and sing out the
winning number in a four-hour ceremony.
	   Juan Gomez, a 54-year-old unemployed father of four learned
Tuesday morning that his two shares of 500 pesetas (dlrs 3.5) each
entitled him to 10 million pesetas (dlrs 70,000) in prize money.
	   ``Now I'll be able to pay off the mortgage and help out my
sons,'' said Gomez, who lives in the northeastern town of Sabadell.
The national news agency Efe said three of Gomez's sons were
unemployed and a fourth was a student.
	   Financial pressures were also certain to be easier for
66-year-old street tobacco seller Miguel Trillo who planned to use
the 30 million pesetas (dlrs 210,000) he'd won to pay off debts and
``share with my daughters.''
	   Income from ticket sales was 250 billion pesetas (dlrs 1.8
billion) this year, 8.9 percent up on last year, according to the
department that runs the lottery, founded in 1818.
	   The Spanish Treasury takes 30 percent of the revenues before the
draw to keep the winnings tax-free.
	   The second prize of 144 million pesetas (dlrs 1 million) will be
spilt among holders of tickets bearing the number 07308.

Staking land claim, Jewish settlers start new neighborhood
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jewish settlers have begun work on a new
neighborhood at near the West Bank town of Jericho in hopes of
preventing the land from being ceded to the Palestinians.
	   Since the signing of the Wye River land-for-security accord two
months ago, settlers have increased the rate of both illegal and
legal building to try to block land transfers with so-called
``facts on the ground.''
	   Construction of the new neighborhood at the Mitzpeh Jericho
settlement of 200 families was approved by the defense ministry
several months ago and work began this week, said Eli Greenwald,
secretary of the local council.
	   ``If we can stop part of the implementation of the agreements,
we will have done a great thing for the state of Israel,''
Greenwald told The Associated Press on Tuesday.
	   Government permission to expand the settlement was granted even
though 10 percent of the homes in it are empty, the settlement
watchdog group Peace Now reported.
	   With the building of the 147 housing units in the new
neighborhood, Mitzpeh Jericho's population will double in size,
Greenwald said. The settlement has permission to build as many as
1,200 homes, which will be done over coming years, he said.
	   Settlers have placed mobile homes on nine new sites near
existing settlements since the Wye agreement, said Hagit Yaari,
spokeswoman for Peace Now.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has frozen
Israeli compliance with the Wye River accord, including land
handovers. But Israeli media say settlers' building is being
spurred by fears a new government might move to implement the pact.
	   Lawmakers on Monday overwhelmingly approved early elections,
which will probably be before the end of April.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police killed a Kosovo Albanian
and arrested six other alleged ``terrorists'' Tuesday amid signs of
escalating tensions, including threats by ethnic Albanian
guerrillas of all-out attack unless police leave central Kosovo.
	   Tensions of another kind were generated in Belgrade, where the
top U.N. refugee official shrugged off accusations that she was
biased toward Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
	   Sadako Ogata, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, toured
the province Monday to get a firsthand look at the condition of
tens of thousands of refugees displaced in past fighting.
	   After Ogata met Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic Tuesday in
Belgrade, she rejected claims of pro-Albanian bias at a news
conference also attended by her chief accuser, Bratislava Morina,
the Serbian commissioner for refugees.
	   Both the Kosovo Serbs and Morina complained against alleged bias
Ogata showed by visiting mostly ethnic Albanian refugees, the main
victims of a Serb military crackdown in Kosovo that left about
300,000 people displaced and killed over 1,000.
	   Visibly annoyed by the claims, Ogata blamed both the Serbs and
ethnic Albanians for continued refugee problems in Kosovo, saying
that some 175,000 people have still not returned to their homes
despite being sheltered.
	   ``I strongly condemn (continued) violence and intimidation'' by
both sides in Kosovo, she told reporters.
	   She said she urged Milosevic to implement a promise he made
after he in October signed a U.S.-sponsored Kosovo peace agreement
to grant amnesty for hundreds of ethnic Albanians still held in
Serb prisons on charges of ``terrorist activities.''
	   She did not say what Milosevic answered, but international human
rights groups said they had no information that anyone arrested
during the Kosovo clashes has been released as a result of his
amnesty.
	   More than 1,000 Kosovo Albanians are believed to be in Serbian
prisons and police stations, and at least five have died since
February from beatings and torture, the U.S.-based Human Rights
Watch said earlier this month.
	   Reporting on the shooting, the government-run Media Center said
that the police early Tuesday encountered fire when they tried to
arrest an ethnic Albanian ``terrorist group'' near Pec, west of
Pristina. The police fired back, killing one ethnic Albanian and
arresting six other ``terrorists.''
	   Guerrilla spokesman Adem Demaci warned police to leave central
Kosovo, telling reporters in Pristina: ``We promise, unless they
withdraw from those areas, that they will be attacked everywhere by
our forces.''
	   In Belgrade on Monday, heads of Yugoslavia's Serb-led army met
with NATO's top commander in Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, who
repeated warnings that the alliance might intervene if fighting
between Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian rebels continues,
sources close to the talks said on condition of anonymity.
	   Milosevic averted threatened NATO airstrikes when he signed the
U.S.-sponsored deal, promising an end to the military campaign
against separatists in the overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian province
of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   William Walker, the U.S. head of the 2,000-strong verification
mission in Kosovo, told independent B 92 radio Tuesday that the
Belgrade ``authorities are generally uncooperative with the
mission.''
	   He said that most of the mission's requests to the authorities
``have drawn a negative response,'' according to B 92.
	   Walker also blamed ethnic Albanian rebels for breaking the
cease-fire agreement and acting ``irresponsibly by carrying out
provocative missions.''
	   On Monday, Serb police carried out a sweep of a Kosovo Albanian
stronghold in retaliation for the killing of one of their officers
in escalating violence that has increased fear of a return to
all-out war in the troubled province.
	   According to a spokesman for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, Monday's sweep began after the slaying of
Serb policeman Milic Jovic.
	   The spokesman, Jorgen Grunnet, said a column of Yugoslav army
vehicles, including seven T-55 tanks, left a military barracks just
south of Podujevo.
	   Afterward, OSCE staff heard tank and heavy machine gun fire from
the direction of the village of Dobrotin.

Signs of emerging deal to end Polish miners' protest

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with talks started in 3rd graf, protest by miners from
another union in 4th graf; RECASTS &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said Tuesday he
expected talks between government and labor officials to produce an
agreement that would end a growing labor dispute in Poland.
	   Responding to a strike threat from miners protesting proposed
changes in their pension rules, Buzek said his government never
intended to eliminate pensions for miners and others working in
dangerous conditions who take early retirement.
	   Government officials and leaders of the Solidarity union began
talks Tuesday afternoon on early retirement schemes for miners,
while more than 400 workers in 52 mines continued an underground
sit-in.
	   Also Tuesday, scores of miners from another union gathered in
Warsaw to urge President Aleksander Kwasniewski to veto the pension
law changes, which have been passed by parliament.
	   The new law would set the retirement age to qualify for a full
government pension at 65 for men and 60 for women. Under current
regulations, miners and others in dangerous conditions get a full
pension after working 25 years, no matter their age.
	   Solidarity miners began the sit-in Dec. 10 to demand keeping the
present system. They also oppose a mining restructuring plan that
would cut jobs and production.
	   Workers at coal mines in Silesia, as well as copper, zinc and
lead ore mines, staged a warning strike Monday and voted
overwhelmingly to hold a general strike on an undetermined date.
Solidarity's Mining Section said 98 percent of miners supported the
strike.
	   Buzek, attempting to calm the atmosphere, said Tuesday his
Solidarity-led government never proposed that ``people working in
such difficult conditions like miners had to work until they are
65.''
	   He said the government was negotiating final details of
so-called ``bridge pensions'' for miners retiring after 25 years of
work, covering them until they become eligible for regular pensions
at 65.
	   Buzek's Cabinet, which took power in October 1997 from a leftist
government, has been working on widespread social and economic
reforms expected to complete Poland's transition from communism to
a market economy.
	   The reforms include restructuring ailing industries such as
mining and steel. Coal mining restructuring calls for reducing
production from 137 million tons last year to 110 million tons in
2002, as well as cutting jobs by more than 40 percent _ from
245,000 now to 138,000 in three years.
	   Coal mining, once the country's leading hard-currency earner
during communist times, is still heavily subsidized under Poland's
market reforms that began in 1989.

Germany backs gradual lifting of Iraq sanctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Iraq should be offered a gradual lifting of
United Nations sanctions as an incentive to cooperate with U.N.
weapons inspectors, Germany's foreign minister has said.
	   The comments by Joschka Fischer in a German television interview
late Monday were the first initiative on Iraq policy by the new
center-left government in office since October.
	   By putting equal emphasis on disarming Saddam Hussein but also
helping him lift sanctions, the new German stand could irritate the
United States, which has consistently taken a tough line on
sanctions.
	   Reflecting German unease about U.S. and British airstrikes,
Fischer suggested international efforts to tame Iraq were in a
``no-win situation'' that war would not solve.
	   He called for ``a combination of continuing disarmament controls
in Iraq with humanitarian measures and a step-by-step lifting of
sanctions.''
	   He acknowledged this would require the agreement of all U.N.
Security Council members, including the United States.
	   Fischer's remarks also set the stage for Germany's six-month
presidency of the European Union starting Jan. 1, where he said he
would seek a common European policy on Iraq.
	   With Britain siding with Washington and France critical of
airstrikes, Fischer admitted the task would be difficult.
	   ``Still, the majority of the European Union is taking roughly
the same line as Germany,'' he said. ``And it will be the task of
the German presidency to bring the two positions together.''

Germany takes France's place in Confederations Cup

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Germany will take part in next year's
Confederations' Cup in Mexico following the withdrawal of World Cup
champions France, FIFA said Tuesday.
	   The tournament will take place July 24 to Aug. 4 _ four days
earlier than planned _ to accommodate the new team, soccer's
governing body said.
	   ``The replacement comes as a result of the difficulties which
the French Football Federation had faced in reconciling the
tournament dates with commitments in connection with the French
national team, the UEFA club competitions and the French national
league at the start of next season,'' FIFA said.
	   After weeks of debate over the schedule and to the anger of FIFA
and local organizers, France pulled out because of clashes with its
domestic and European obligations.
	   The French move reflected a feeling by many European squads that
the Confederations Cup is an unnecessary feature on an overcrowded
soccer calendar.
	   In addition to the world champion and host nation, FIFA invited
New Zealand, Bolivia, Brazil, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United
States to participate in the competition.
	   ``FIFA consulted the German Football Association who have now
confirmed their participation following France's definite
withdrawal,'' FIFA said in a statement. Germany was eligible as the
1996 European Champion, it said.
	   Germany _ although it shunned the first Confederations Cup
tournament in 1996 _ hopes to boost its bid to stage the 2006 World
Cup by taking part this time around.
	   Germany will take France's place in Group B, playing in
Guadalajara against Brazil, the United States and New Zealand.
	   Group A, in Mexico City, features Mexico, Bolivia, Egypt and
Saudi Arabia.
	   FIFA initially moved the eight-nation event from Jan. 8-20 to
July 28-Aug. 8 to placate France. The French soccer federation said
it accepted this, but then changed its mind because the French
national league begins its 1999-2000 championship on July 28.
	   France then asked for the competition to be moved to the start
of the summer.
	   But FIFA refused to bow to this request, not least because South
America's Copa Libertadores isn't scheduled to end until June 16,
and the Copa America begins June 29 and runs through July 8.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Fire broke out in a Stockholm
department store crowded with Christmas shoppers Tuesday after
someone poured gasoline on a lower floor. At least two people were
injured.
	   Police said they arrested one person in connection with the
fire, the Swedish news agency TT reported.
	   The store faces Hoetorget square, directly across from
Stockholm's main concert hall. Firefighters closed the square,
which has about 20 covered stalls for vendors of produce, leather
and woolen goods.
	   One of the injured was taken to a hospital and treated for smoke
inhalation. Details on the injury to the other person were not
immediately known.
	   The fire was declared extinguished about 45 minutes after the
alarm sounded.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli raid in eastern Lebanon, CHANGES overline

<TEXT>
	   BAALBEK, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes fired rockets at a
guerrilla-run radio station in eastern Lebanon on Tuesday,
destroying a transmitter, Lebanese security officials said.
	   The jets fired at least six air-to-surface missiles on the hills
around the villages of Nabi Sheet and Janta, about 23 kilometers
(14 miles) southeast of the ancient city of Baalbek.
	   The officials said a transmitter for Hezbollah's Voice of the
Oppressed radio on the edge of Nabi Sheet was destroyed. They spoke
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   A spokesman for the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
confirmed that the 2:45 p.m. (1245 GMT) attack hit a transmitter
but gave no other details. He also spoke on condition his name not
be used.
	   The radio remained on the air, apparently using a backup
transmitter.
	   The security officials said a shepherd and his wife were wounded
in the attack, but did not say how seriously.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Israeli fighter bombers fired four rockets on
suspected guerrilla bases facing Israel's self-styled ``security
zone'' in south Lebanon.
	   The morning attack targeted the wooded hills near Maidoun in the
western Bekaa Valley, 3 kilometers (2 miles) northeast of the zone,
the officials said.
	   The bombing raids came after Hezbollah guerrillas exchanged fire
with Israeli troops and their allied South Lebanon Army militia,
they said.
	   An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem said the Israeli pilots
scored direct hits and that the jets returned safely to base.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, has led the fight to try to oust
Israeli troops and their militia allies from the security, which
Israel set up in southern Lebanon in 1985 to protect its northern
towns from cross-border raids.

Russia criticizes Israel for suspending accord with Palestinians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday blamed Israel
for breaking a peace accord with the Palestinians by setting new
conditions for its implementation.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet on Sunday approved a
tough series of conditions for resuming Israel's already-suspended
compliance with the 2-month-old Wye River accord, brokered by the
United States.
	   Some of those conditions ``go beyond the framework of the signed
agreements,'' said Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir
Rakhmanin. ``That causes us serious concern.''
	   Israel's parliament rejected Netanyahu's position and voted
overwhelmingly for early elections.
	   Russia ``urges the sides to act in strict compliance with their
commitments, demonstrate responsibility, restraint and good will''
in implementing the peace accord, Rakhmanin said.
	   Russia is officially a co-sponsor of the Mideast peace process
launched by a conference in Madrid, Spain, in 1991. But the United
States has played a far greater role.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, who was scheduled to
visit Russia on Friday, has canceled his trip because of the
political situation in Israel. Rakhmanin voiced hope that the visit
would still take place in the future.
	   Netanyahu's latest conditions to the Palestinians, which they
have rejected, include a renunciation of claims to statehood rights
and Jerusalem; a confiscation of arms; an end to violence and
incitement to violence; and a renunciation of claims that Netanyahu
had agreed to release Palestinians jailed for killings.

LONDON: get drunk.

<TEXT>
	   The ICO Global balloon was over Tibet, about 10 miles (15 kms)
north of Bhutan at about 1300 GMT, and Kendrick said organizers
would go to work on plotting a course to catch a jetstream to move
them swiftly on their way.
	   The landing order threatened to end the round-the-world dreams
of British tycoon Richard Branson, American millionaire Steve
Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden.
	   They had been given permission to cross China below 26 degrees
north latitude, but drifted further north after navigating around
Mediterranean storms and closed airspace over Iraq, Iran and
Russia.
	   Earlier in the day, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao had
said China could not agree to the balloon's northerly course, but
he did not call on the crew to withdraw immediately or land.
	   Organizers of the expedition apologized, said they were trying
to head south as quickly as wind and weather permitted _ which is
about 50 mph (80 kmh).
	   Kendrick said Chinese air traffic controllers were informed the
moment the balloon passed over the border, with an apology added to
the communication. The balloon team continued to contact them every
15 minutes to keep the Chinese informed about their position.
	   In February, China withheld permission for a European balloon
team to fly through its airspace, forcing them to land and end
their around-the-world bid.
	   As it became apparent early Monday that the balloon would
inevitably cross into unauthorized Chinese territory, Prime
Minister Tony Blair sent a message to Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
asking for China's help.
	   The ICO Global balloon had already run into trouble on its trip.
Libya unexpectedly revoked permission to enter its airspace, but
the situation was resolved shortly before the three-man crew flew
over the country on Saturday.
	   Then, after steering around thunderstorms near Cyprus, the crew
had to maneuver the 270-foot (82-meter) craft through narrow gaps
between no-fly territories, including Iraq.
	   The crew members estimate the trip could last from eight days to
nearly three weeks. They hope to touch down somewhere in western
Europe at the end of a 24,000-mile (38,000 kms) flight, which will
take them over India, the South China sea, the Pacific and the
United States.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.

Dutch star sidelined for rest of season with knee injury

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ Leeds United's Dutch defender Robert
Molenaar will be out of action for the rest of the season after
suffering a serious knee injury against Arsenal on Sunday.
	   Molenaar suffered damage to his cruciate knee ligaments when he
was tackled by Arsenal striker Nicolas Anelka during Leeds' 3-1
loss at Highbury.
	   A scan on Tuesday revealed the extent of the damage and Leeds
expects Molenaar to be out of action for at least eight months.
	   The Dutch star is the second Leeds defender to be put out of
action with the same injury.
	   Austrian international Martin Hiden twisted his knee at Old
Trafford in Leeds 3-2 loss to Manchester United three weeks ago and
will be out for several months.

Woody Allen says Clinton is being persecuted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Film director Woody Allen on Tuesday said that the
scandal involving President Bill Clinton was silly and had made a
``laughing stock'' of the United States.
	   ``We have a good president who is being persecuted by the
extreme-right for having an affair with a consenting adult. Which
by the way, his wife seems to accept,'' said Allen.
	   ``The country is about show business, and never more so since
this silliness going on with the President,'' the director told a
news conference for the French release of his latest film
``Celebrity,'' a comedy about America's appetite for fame.''
	   ``It's made the United States the laughing stock of the world
and our political atmosphere entertaining, silly and sad,'' he
added, red-eyed and sniffling with the eternal cold.
	   More popular in France, where each of his films is a box office
hit, than at home, Allen has had his own share of sex scandals.
	   Revelations about his relationship with Soon Yi Previn, the
adopted daughter of his former companion Mia Farrow and conductor
Andre Previn, whipped up a media frenzy.
	   He married Previn in Paris exactly a year ago.
	   ``Celebrity'' is shot mainly in Manhattan and features British
actor Kenneth Branagh as the typical Allen character _ a
frustrated, hypocondriac but sympathetic, gossip columnist who has
separated from his wife, played by Judy Davis, making her fourth
appearance in an Allen film.
	   The Brooklyn-born director describes this 27th film as being
about ``overwhelming celebrity run amuck''.
	   ``In the United States, everyone has their own television show:
lawyers, doctors, plastic surgeons ... Soon there won't be any
audience,'' he added.
	   He chose not to play Branagh's character because ``I'm too old
and I wouldn't have given it the same richness and complexity''.
	   Despite the thrashing he gives to America's insatiable craze for
creating super stars, Allen acknowledged the perks of fame.
	   ``There are problems, but they're minor. You have no private
life, journalists write about you and it's not always true, you're
followed around by paparazzi. But they're not life-threatening.
	   ``I won't lie to you. ... Your salary is disproportionately
high, you can always get restaurant reservations and theater
tickets, doctors will come to your house on weekends and when a
policeman stops you for speeding, he asks for your autograph,'' he
explained.
	   The saying goes that a culture can be judged by the celebrities
it creates. Asked what he thought of the society that has made him
a star, Allen answered: ``I think it's a culture in need of help.''

ECB holds last policy-making meeting prior to currency launch
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: To be updated after news conference beginning 17:30 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The European Central Bank's
policy-making committee held its final scheduled meeting Tuesday
before the Jan. 1 launch of Europe's common currency, the euro,
with most tough decisions already out of the way.
	   Suspense over the most important issue _ the level of the
euro-zone's key interest rate _ was eliminated on Dec. 3, when all
11 participating countries slashed rates. Ten cut rates to 3
percent, while Italy cut to 3.5 percent.
	   Italy is expected to cut rates to 3 percent by Jan. 1.
	   The ECB said the new rate will hold for the foreseeable future,
though analysts say a rate cut could happen again next year.
	   ECB President Wim Duisenberg has not ruled that out, but has
said pointedly that boosting Europe's flagging economies needs
structural reform to markets, including the labor market. Tinkering
with interest rates is not a panacea, Duisenberg said.
	   The ECB was expected to announce overnight deposit and overnight
lending rates for the euro area.
	   Analysts expect these to be set at 2.5 and 3.5 percent
respectively. Since the two rates represent the floor and ceiling
for money market rates, a relatively narrow band would act to stem
currency fluctuation which could arise amid the uncertainties of
the euro launch.

Museum buys junk yard site where first Neanderthal bones found
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) _ The Neanderthal Museum has bought a
site currently used by an auto salvage yard where the first
Neanderthal Man remains were discovered, its director said Tuesday.
	   Gerd-Christian Weniger said the site must first be cleared of
old buildings and the junk yard before it can be set up for
visitors.
	   Plans call for a design competition for the site, with work to
run from mid-1999 until some time in 2000, he said.
	   Weniger declined to say how much was paid for the site, located
near the museum in the Neanderthal valley at Mettmann, about 15
kilometers (10 miles) east of Duesseldorf.
	   The first Neanderthal fossil was found in a cave that was
discovered during rock quarry work in 1856. The cave was later
chipped away as quarry work continued.
	   Neanderthals are believed to have lived until 30,000 years ago.

Georgia accuses Russian peacekeepers of firing at its troops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ The Georgian government on Tuesday
accused Russian peacekeepers of triggering a gun battle in the
breakaway province of Abkhazia that led to the death of a Georgian
soldier.
	   The shooting took place late Monday, when Russian peacekeepers
in Abkhazia shelled a Georgian military outpost without
provocation, the Georgian side claimed.
	   The Abkhazian separatists used the shelling as a cover to bypass
the Georgian soldiers and attack them from the rear, the Georgians
said.
	   An 19-year-old Georgian soldier was badly wounded and died in a
hospital early Tuesday, the Georgian Interior Ministry said in a
statement.
	   The Georgians urged the Russian military to investigate the
shooting and punish those responsible.
	   The spokesman for the Russian peacekeepers, Col. Valery
Pokushayev, rejected the Georgian version of events, saying the
Russian ``peacekeepers only open fire when they come under
shelling.''
	   Russian peacekeepers have been deployed in Abkhazia since 1994,
following a truce that ended a 1992-93 war in which Abkhazian
separatists drove out Georgian government troops.
	   The region has remained restive, plagued by frequent clashes.
The Georgian officials have often accused the Russian peacekeepers
of backing the separatists _ a charge they deny.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Tuesday claimed that U.S. and
British warplanes fired two ``stray missiles'' Tuesday toward the
southern city of Basra. The U.S. military denied it.
	   The report by the official Iraqi News Agency did not define
``stray missiles'' or say if they had hit anything. The report
comes three days after the United States and Britain ended four
waves of punishing airstrikes on Iraq.
	   However, a Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Patrick Sivigny, said:
``U.S. forces have not fired any missiles.''
	   Earlier, Marine Corps Gen. Anthony Zinni, commander of U.S.
forces in the Middle East, said he has no reports of either
American or British planes involved in missile firings.
	   The conflicting reports could not be immediately reconciled.
	   Western jets patrolling a no-fly zone over southern Iraq have in
the past fired if approached by Iraqi aircraft or Iraqi
anti-aircraft batteries lock on with their radar systems to the
Western craft.
	   Gen. Zinni, speaking at the Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland,
said the flights are continuing.
	   The Iraqi News Agency, quoting an unnamed authoritative military
spokesman, said aircraft from the ``criminal aggressors'' _ used to
mean the United States and Britain _ came in two waves and the
second wave opened fire.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP)_ Bomb explosions rocked two bingo halls in
Bulgaria's second biggest city Tuesday, the state news agency BTA
reported. Nobody was injured.
	   One of the blasts broke window panes and the other damaged a
car. Both occurred in Plovdiv, 160 kilometers (100 miles) southeast
of Sofia.
	   Bombings and shoot-outs have become a commonplace in Bulgaria in
the nearly 10 years since the end of communist rule in 1989. Crime
has surged fivefold since then.
	   A former athlete, believed to be a local underworld boss, was
shot to death last Sunday near Sofia.
	   In separate incidents over the past two weeks, a businessman in
central Bulgaria was killed by a car bomb and a police chief in
western Bulgaria had his home bombed.

	   HOUSTON (AP) _ While doctors guard the fragile health of the
world's first surviving set of octuplets, the births have rekindled
the medical community's debate over the use of fertility drugs.
	   By the time Nkem Chukwu's (nih-KEHM chuhk-WOO's) eight tiny
children are well enough to be taken home, an estimated dlrs 2
million will have been spent on their care, predicted Dr. Leonard
Weisman, chief neonatologist at Texas Children's Hospital.
	   Dr. Randle Corfman, director of the Midwest Center for
Reproductive Health in Robbinsdale, Minnesota, worried that
insurance companies may reconsider providing health coverage for
women like Mrs. Chukwu who have fertility treatment.
	   Others question whether parents who take fertility drugs really
understand the health risks of underdeveloped multiple births.
	   ``The fact is that the vast majority of these cases (of
quadruplets or more) end in disaster, sometimes for the mom, most
often for the babies,'' Dr. Alan Copperman said in today's New York
Times.
	   Copperman, director of reproductive endocrinology at Mount
Sinai-New York University Medical Center, said every time a case
like the Chukwus' comes along, desperate couples become more
willing to take greater risks.
	   A Saudi woman gave birth to three girls and four boys in
January, and the McCaughey septuplets were born in Iowa just 13
months ago. All of those babies have survived.
	   Doctors said the the Chukwu's infants, who have not yet been
named, could be in the hospital for up to two months, while their
mother may be released within a week.
	   The six girls and two boys remained in critical condition at
Texas Children's.
	   Chief among the worries with the Chukwu children was lung
development. Baby A, the girl born Dec. 8, was delivered 15 weeks
premature. Her two brothers and five sisters were born Sunday
morning, 13 weeks early. All were placed on ventilators.
	   ``It's alarming in the sense premature babies have problems,''
Weisman said.
	   Dr. Brian Kirshon, who delivered the octuplets, said the woman
and her husband, Iyke Chukwu, a respiratory therapist at a Houston
hospital, rejected the idea of ``selective reduction,'' a technique
in which doctors abort some fetuses so others have a better chance
of survival.
	   ``It was totally out of the question,'' to the deeply religious,
Nigerian-born couple, Kirshon said.
	   The octuplets are covered by the family's insurance. But it's a
matter of time, according to Corfman, before insurance companies
re-examine how to cover infertility treatments when multiple births
produce such sickly children.
	   ``Our fear is that is exactly what will happen,'' he said.
``They'll say we cannot cover this.
	   ``When we use these medicines we have to be conscious of the
fact that we cannot predict with certainty which eggs will take.
When we start cranking up having the woman produce more than one
egg, we run the risk of producing more than one baby.''
	   And more babies in a womb designed to hold just one increases
the likelihood the infants will have undersized lungs, brains and
hearts.
	   Weisman said the advent of fertility treatments has forced the
medical community to confront the ethical issues surrounding
multiple births.
	   Should doctors, for example, be more aggressive about promoting
selective reduction? And should multiple births, which are
increasing annually, be viewed as successful notwithstanding the
health risks?
	   ``For certain families who are having trouble conceiving I think
they are a success,'' Weisman said. ``The problem, the side effect
is you wind up with all these multiple pregnancies, multiple births
which result in a lot of increase in health problems.''

Schroeder defends new Berlin Holocaust memorial plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS last graf to restore first reference to Kohl. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, in remarks
published Tuesday, upheld his government's proposal to build a
Holocaust museum and research center in Berlin instead of a
long-debated huge sculpture.
	   German Jewish leaders have criticized the plan unveiled last
week by culture minister Michael Naumann as not powerful enough to
commemorate the killing of 6 million Jews by the Nazis. But
Schroeder insisted the idea was ``good.''
	   ``It not only helps recall the horror of the Nazi era but also
allows young people to learn something,'' he said in an interview
with the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung daily.
	   Last weekend's bombing of the Berlin grave of a former German
Jewish leader, Heinz Galinski, ``shows how important this
remains,'' he said.
	   Germany's best-known author, novelist Guenter Grass, said he
would back the museum if it is dedicated to all victims of the
Nazis, not only Jews.
	   Half a million Gypsies were killed by the Third Reich as well as
homosexuals and political prisoners, the author of ``The Tin Drum''
noted in an interview with the weekly Die Woche.
	   German politicians and intellectuals have debated plans for a
national Holocaust memorial for 10 years. A plot in central Berlin
has been set aside for it.
	   The leading design had been a cemetery-like field of 2,500
concrete pillars designed by U.S. architect Peter Eisenman.
	   Former chancellor Helmut Kohl was the project's biggest backer.
But Schroeder, a Social Democrat who defeated Kohl in September
elections, has expressed doubts about the monument. Parliament is
to decide how to proceed next year.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The former honorary consul of Paraguay in Geneva,
Gustavo Gramont Beres, appeared before a magistrate in the city
Tuesday on charges of a dlrs 100 million fraud.
	   Beres, who had been charged for other offenses in Paraguay, was
extradited to Switzerland on the request of Geneva authorities,
said investigating magistrate Leonardo Malfanti.
	   Beres, an Argentine national, was the Paraguayan honorary consul
in Geneva from 1979 to 1989.
	   City authorities began an inquiry into Beres last year, and made
an official request for his extradition in February.
	   After being questioned, Beres was detained in prison pending his
trial. The charges relate to deception and forgery to the tune of
around dlrs 100 million in Swiss francs and German marks, according
to Geneva magistrate Malfanti. He gave no more details.

Germany replaces France in Confederations Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ European champion Germany will
replace World Cup winner France in next year's Confederations' Cup
in Mexico, FIFA said Tuesday.
	   The tournament will take place July 24 to Aug. 4 _ four days
earlier than planned _ to accommodate the Germans, soccer's
governing body said.
	   ``The replacement comes as a result of the difficulties which
the French Football Federation had faced in reconciling the
tournament dates with commitments in connection with the French
national team, the UEFA club competitions and the French national
league at the start of next season,'' FIFA said.
	   After weeks of debate over the schedule and to the anger of FIFA
and local organizers, France withdrew because of clashes with its
domestic and European obligations.
	   The French move reflected a feeling by many European squads that
the Confederations Cup is an unnecessary feature on an overcrowded
soccer calendar.
	   In addition to the world champion and host nation, FIFA invited
continental champions Brazil, New Zealand, Egypt and Saudi Arabia
along with South American and CONCACAF runners-up Bolivia and the
United States to participate in the competition.
	   ``FIFA consulted the German Football Association who have now
confirmed their participation following France's definite
withdrawal,'' FIFA said in a sttement.
	   Although having shunned invitations to the tournament _
previously held in 1992, 1995 and 1997 _ in the past, Germany hopes
to boost its bid to stage the 2006 World Cup by taking part this
time around.
	   Germany will play in Group B in Guadalajara against Brazil, the
United States and New Zealand.
	   FIFA initially moved the eight-nation event from Jan. 8-20 to
July 28-Aug. 8 to placate France. The French federation said it
accepted this, but then changed its mind because the French
national league begins its 1999-2000 championship on July 28.
	   France then asked for the competition to be moved to the start
of the summer.
	   But FIFA rejected the request. South America's Copa Libertadores
isn't scheduled to end until June 16, and the Copa America begins
June 29 and runs through July 8.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police killed a Kosovo Albanian
and arrested six other alleged ``terrorists'' on Tuesday amid signs
of escalating tension, including threats by ethnic Albanian
guerrillas of all-out attack unless police leave central Kosovo.
	   Tensions of another kind were generated in Belgrade, where the
top U.N. refugee official denied accusations that she was biased
toward Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
	   Sadako Ogata, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, toured
the province Monday to get a firsthand look at the condition of
tens of thousands of refugees displaced in past fighting.
	   After Ogata met Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic Tuesday in
Belgrade, she rejected claims of pro-Albanian bias. She spoke at a
news conference also attended by her chief accuser, Bratislava
Morina, the Serbian commissioner for refugees.
	   Both the Kosovo Serbs and Morina complained against alleged bias
Ogata showed by visiting mostly ethnic Albanian refugees, the main
victims of a Serb military crackdown in Kosovo that left about
300,000 people displaced and killed more than 1,000 since February.
	   Visibly annoyed by the claims, Ogata blamed both the Serbs and
ethnic Albanians for continued refugee problems in Kosovo, saying
that some 175,000 people have still not returned to their homes
despite being sheltered.
	   ``I strongly condemn (continued) violence and intimidation'' by
both sides in Kosovo, she said.
	   She said she urged Milosevic to implement a promise he made
after he in October signed a U.S.-sponsored Kosovo peace agreement
to grant amnesty for hundreds of ethnic Albanians still held in
Serb prisons on charges of ``terrorist activities.''
	   She did not say what Milosevic answered, but international human
rights groups said they had no information that anyone arrested
during the Kosovo clashes has been released as a result of his
amnesty.
	   More than 1,000 Kosovo Albanians are believed to be in Serbian
prisons and police stations, and at least five have died since
February from beatings and torture, the U.S.-based Human Rights
Watch said earlier this month.
	   Reporting on the shooting, the government-run Media Center said
that the police early Tuesday encountered fire when they tried to
arrest an ethnic Albanian ``terrorist group'' near Pec, west of
Pristina. The police fired back, killing one ethnic Albanian and
arresting six other ``terrorists.''
	   Guerrilla spokesman Adem Demaci warned police to leave central
Kosovo, telling reporters in Pristina: ``We promise, unless they
withdraw from those areas, that they will be attacked everywhere by
our forces.''
	   In Belgrade on Monday, heads of Yugoslavia's Serb-led army met
with NATO's top commander in Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, who
repeated warnings that the alliance might intervene if fighting
between Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian rebels continues,
sources close to the talks said on condition of anonymity.
	   Milosevic averted threatened NATO airstrikes when he signed the
U.S.-sponsored deal, promising an end to the military campaign
against separatists in the overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian province
of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   William Walker, the U.S. head of the 2,000-strong verification
mission in Kosovo, told independent B 92 radio Tuesday that the
Belgrade ``authorities are generally uncooperative with the
mission.''
	   He said that most of the mission's requests to the authorities
``have drawn a negative response,'' according to B 92.
	   Walker also blamed ethnic Albanian rebels for breaking the
cease-fire agreement and acting ``irresponsibly by carrying out
provocative missions.''
	   On Monday, Serb police carried out a sweep of a Kosovo Albanian
stronghold in retaliation for the killing of one of their officers
in escalating violence that has increased fear of a return to
all-out war in the troubled province.
	   According to a spokesman for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, Monday's sweep began after the slaying of
Serb policeman Milic Jovic.
	   The spokesman, Jorgen Grunnet, said a column of Yugoslav army
vehicles, including seven T-55 tanks, left a military barracks just
south of Podujevo.
	   Afterward, OSCE staff heard tank and heavy machine gun fire from
the direction of the village of Dobrotin.

Israeli warplanes raid suspected guerrilla bases in Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAALBEK, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes fired rockets Tuesday
at a guerrilla-run radio station in eastern Lebanon, destroying a
transmitter, Lebanese security officials said.
	   The jets fired at least six air-to-surface missiles on the hills
around the villages of Nabi Sheet and Janta, about 23 kilometers
(14 miles) southwest of the ancient city of Baalbek.
	   The officials said a transmitter for Hezbollah's Voice of the
Oppressed radio on the edge of Nabi Sheet was destroyed. They spoke
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   A spokesman for the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
confirmed that the afternoon attack hit a transmitter but gave no
other details. He also spoke on condition his name not be used.
	   The radio remained on the air, apparently using a backup
transmitter.
	   The security officials said a shepherd and his wife were wounded
in the attack, but did not say how seriously.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Israeli fighter bombers fired four rockets on
suspected guerrilla bases facing Israel's self-styled ``security
zone'' in south Lebanon.
	   The morning attack targeted the wooded hills near Maidoun in the
western Bekaa Valley, three kilometers (two miles) northeast of the
zone, the officials said.
	   The bombing raids came after Hezbollah guerrillas exchanged fire
with Israeli troops and their allied South Lebanon Army militia,
they said.
	   An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem said the Israeli pilots
scored direct hits and that the jets returned safely to base.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, has led the fight to try to oust
Israeli troops and their militia allies from the security, which
Israel set up in southern Lebanon in 1985 to protect its northern
towns from cross-border raids.

Scandals of doping, bribery; controversy reigns supreme
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Doping and bribery. Scandal, accusations and
labor disputes. The image of sports in 1998.
	   Even the biggest event _ the World Cup _ was not immune from
controversy.
	   From the red card scare before the World Cup to Ronaldo's
mysterious illness before the final, soccer had to deal all sorts
of non-game distractions like nearly every other sport.
	   To cycling's Tour de France goes the doping scandal of the year.
Cricket saw bribery allegations against Pakistan's Salim Malik
continue _ and then had charges leveled against two of his
accusers, Australia's Shane Warne and Mark Waugh, about taking
controversial payments from an Indian bookmaker.
	   Baseball had its brouhaha in the United States over American
home run record breaker Mark McGwire taking a controversial yet
allowed dietary supplement, and in Japan about the Fukuoka Daiei
Hawks and its manager, legendary home run king Sadaharu Oh,
stealing signs.
	   The National Basketball Association locked out its players after
the season in June and hasn't played a game since.
	   English soccer was rocked with a bribery scandal as the year
ended, but the biggest mess of all seemed to be when 80-year-old
Swiss lawyer and International Olympic Committee member Marc Hodler
claimed vote-buying was common in the selection of host cities.
	   Hodler claimed four ``agents'' _ one an IOC member, had been
involved in schemes to buy votes in the election of host cities.
His claims came after a Salt Lake City television station reported
the American organizers of the 2002 Winter Games had given dlrs
400,000 worth scholarships, some to relatives of IOC members.
	   The Swiss was the first person within the IOC to support claims
of corruption against the Olympic movement. Hodler said he came
forth because he didn't want to see Salt Lake get blamed instead of
those on the inside of the IOC.
	   But everybody seemed to have their own scandal and it was hard
to find a sport which wasn't tainted in 1998.
	   The English Football Association was responsible for soccer's
biggest scandal of the year when chief executive Graham Kelly
resigned over his and chairman Keith Wiseman's decision to loan the
Welsh FA 3.2 million pounds (dlrs 5 million).
	   Kelly and Wiseman acted unilaterally, but denied accusations it
was to get the Welsh FA's support for Wiseman for executive
committee posts at UEFA and FIFA and England's bid for the World
Cup of 2006.
	   But even before that, soccer had other problems. The bitter
election campaign between Sepp Blatter and Lennart Johansson to
replace Joao Havelange as president didn't even end after Blatter
won.
	   Johansson accused his opponent of vote-buying the day after the
election, getting the new president's term off to an inauspicious
start.
	   The World Cup, which many feared would look like a May Day
parade in Red Square with FIFA's directive to referees to punish
any tackle from behind with an ejection, started out like any of
the other quadrennial championships.
	   But midway through the tournament, after Blatter publicly said
referees should be less tolerant of fouling, a flurry of reds
emerged, including three in the South Africa-Denmark game.
	   The French were largely ambivalent to their team until it
reached and eventually won the final, celebrating non-stop for more
than 24 hours. But the reason for their joy was set off by the
great World Cup mystery _ Ronaldo.
	   The two-time FIFA Player of the Year was supposed to be center
stage for Brazil's unprecedented fifth title, but instead wasn't
even listed on the lineup _ even as a reserve _ distributed to the
media more than hour before kickoff.
	   Fifteen minutes later a new lineup was issued, this time with
the shaven-headed 21-year-old as Brazil's starting forward. He
should have stayed in the lockerroom. He played listlessly and the
rest of the Brazilians looked confused and rudderless, resulting in
France's 3-0 victory and a first ever triumph.
	   It was later revealed by coach Mario Zagallo that during the
afternoon Ronaldo had vomited and was taken to the hospital. When
asked why Ronaldo still played, Zagallo went into a rage and
theories grew like germs, including one that team sponsor Nike _
which also uses Ronaldo as a spokesman _ ordered Zagallo to play
him.
	   Zdenek Zemen, the coach of Italian soccer club AS Roma, sparked
a doping scandal by suggesting some star players were taking
performance enhancing drugs. Several high-ranking officials are
under investigation for allegedly concealing the results of
positive tests.
	   But in a scandal plagued year, soccer was one of the lesser
offenders.

	   Besides the Olympics, cycling took the biggest beating thanks to
the doping madness than engulfed the Tour de France.
	   While suspicions have been rampant about the sport for years,
1998 confirmed what many already believed. Three days before the
start of the race, the Festina team masseur was caught with massive
quantities of performance-enhancing drugs, including the
undetectable blood agent EPO.
	   Before it was over, police had raided cyclists rooms, the
competitors staged a strike and seven teams were driven from the
race.
	   Besides Hodler's accusations, the Olympics in Nagano, Japan, had
its own doping controversy when Canadian snowboarder Ross
Rebagliati won the giant slalom gold, but then had it taken away
because he tested positive for marijuana.
	   He claimed he tested positive because of second-hand smoke and
an appeals panel restored his medal.
	   Of course the whole year started out with a doping scandal when
Chinese swimmer Yuan Yuan was caught entering Australia for the
World Championships with more than a little Human Growth Hormone
(HGH).
	   After dominating the 1994 championships in Rome with 16 golds
and 28 medals overall, the Chinese were expected to be a big
presence. But after Yuan was caught, she and her coach were sent
home in disgrace and the Chinese returned to Beijing with only six
golds and more accusations about systematic doping.
	   Cricket's woes revolved largely around three players, Malik,
Warne and Waugh.
	   Malik has been under suspicion for three years after Warne,
Waugh and Australian teammate Tim May accused him of trying to
bribe them during a 1994 tour of Pakistan.
	   The latest inquiry into the matter saw Waugh testify in Pakistan
in October, but the matter took a peculiar twist when in December
it was revealed that Warne and Waugh accepted money from an Indian
bookmaker during a 1994 tour of Sri Lanka.
	   The money supposedly was for pitch and weather information, but
the oddest revelation was that the Australian board not only was
aware, but fined the pair and never disclosed the matter.
	   Baseball had its problems as Dominican Sammy Sosa and McGwire
battled almost until the final day to break Roger Maris'
single-season U.S. Major League Baseball home run record of 61
	   McGwire eventually prevailed with 70, but discovery that he was
taking the muscle-building supplement androstenedione for more than
a year led some to say the mark was tainted. The substance, which
has been associated with some of the same negative side effects as
steroids, is banned by the IOC and some other sports organizations
but is not prohibitted by MLB.
	   Japanese baseball's scandal seemed less nefarious, at least to
Americans, who consider sign-stealing almost like a badge of honor.
	   A 10-day internal investigation by the Hawks said it found no
evidence club personnel were sitting in the stands with binoculars,
intercepting the catcher's signs and relaying them by wireless
radio to another person who would signal the batter as to what
pitch to expect.
	   For fans of the NBA, after the Chicago Bulls won their sixth
title in eight years in June the only thing for them to read about
was the ``lockout''. Club owners essentially have gone on strike
until a new collective bargaining agreement with the players union
is reached. The biggest problem was how to divide about dlrs 2
billion in revenue and with neither side budging, the NBA hasn't
played a game this season and doesn't appear likely to anytime
soon.
	   Otherwise, teams did win, lose and draw. Egypt won its fourth
African Cup, South Africa won the Tri-Nations rugby title and went
on to a record-equalling 18 straight test victories, and Finland's
Mika Hakkinen brought McLaren the Formula One title for the first
time since 1991 when the late Ayrton Senna was driving for the
team.
	   The Olympics produced their own heroes. Norway's Bjorn Daehlie
became the Winter Games'all-time gold medal winner; Japanese
Masahiko Harada and Kazuyoshi Funaki exorcised a 4-year-old demon
when they combined with Takanobu Okabe and Hiroya Saito to win the
team ski jumping; and goalie Dominik Hasek carried the Czech
Republic on his hot glove to the ice hockey crown.
	   But the year started with scandal to cast a morning shadow on
sports, and as the sun set on 1998, several more left little light
to shine on its champions.

	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ In an indication of improved ties
between two Balkan neighbors, Greece's foreign minister arrived in
Macedonia on Tuesday for a series of meetings with government
officials.
	   Theodoros Pangalos' one-day trip is the first official visit by
a European Union minister since the new Macedonian government was
sworn in after October's general elections.
	   Pangalos was met at the airport by his Macedonian counterpart,
Aleksandar Dimitrov.
	   After their meeting in the capital Skopje, the two officials
said their talks concentrated on ``economic issues,'' including
opening an oil pipe line or improving train service.
	   ``It takes courage ... to look forward and overcome the miseries
of the past,'' said Pangalos, but added that the issue of name,
some property issues or minority issues remain unresolved.

Political parties jockey for allies in Bangui

<TEXT>
	   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) _ Recent legislative
elections have weakened the ruling Movement for the Liberation of
the People of Centrafrique, which captured the most seats in
parliament but failed to win an outright majority.
	   Election figures from the second round of staggered voting held
earlier this month were released by the Constitutional Court on
Tuesday, indicating the the MLPC won 47 seats in a parliament of
109. A coalition of several opposition parties control 29 seats
after the two rounds of voting, the court said.
	   The remaining seats belong to a variety of independent
candidates or smaller opposition groups, which may now play a key
role in helping either MLPC or the opposition coalition control the
legislative branch of government.
	   In all, about 840 candidates contested for the 109 parliament
seats _ the vast majority of which ahead of the polls were
controlled by President Ange-Felix Patasse's ruling MLPC.
	   The election is seen as an important effort to stabilize the
Central African Republic, which has been wracked by ethnic and
factional violence since independence more than three decades ago.
	   Amid claims of voting irregularities and possible election
fraud, voter turnout was low for the second stage of the polling
process earlier in the month.
	   Patasse's position is not affected by the vote and presidential
elections are not immediately planned.

	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ In an indication of improved ties
between two Balkan neighbors, Greece's foreign minister arrived in
Macedonia on Tuesday for a series of meetings with government
officials.
	   Theodoros Pangalos' one-day trip is the first official visit by
a European Union minister since the new Macedonian government was
sworn in after October's general elections.
	   Pangalos was met at the airport by his Macedonian counterpart,
Aleksandar Dimitrov.
	   After their meeting in the capital Skopje, the two officials
said their talks concentrated on ``economic issues,'' including
opening an oil pipe line or improving train service.
	   ``It takes courage ... to look forward and overcome the miseries
of the past,'' said Pangalos, but added that the issue of name,
some property issues or minority issues remain unresolved.

Israeli air raid kills seven Lebanese civilians

	   BAALBEK, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes fired missiles at
suspected guerrilla bases in eastern Lebanon Tuesday, killing a
woman and her six children, Lebanese security officials said. A
guerrilla-run radio transmitter also was destroyed in the attack.
	   The officials said the casualties occurred when an Israeli
rocket crashed on a farm where a couple and their seven children
were working in the village of Nabi Sheet, about 23 kilometers (14
miles) southeast of the ancient city of Baalbek.
	   The dead children were between two and 11 years of age.
	   Their father and one other child were wounded, the officials
said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. It was the
worst civilian casualty this year in the war between Israel and
Lebanese guerrillas.
	   There was no word from Israel on the report.
	   Lebanese officials said at least five other air-to-surface
missiles also hit the hills around the villages of Nabi Sheet and
Janta, about five kilometers (three miles) west of the Syrian
border.
	   The officials said a transmitter for Hezbollah's Voice of the
Oppressed radio on the edge of Nabi Sheet was destroyed.
	   A spokesman for the Iranian-backed Hezbollah confirmed that the
2:45 p.m. (1245 GMT) attack hit a transmitter but gave no other
details. He also spoke on condition his name not be used.
	   The radio remained on the air, apparently using a backup
transmitter.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Israeli fighter bombers fired four rockets on
suspected guerrilla bases facing Israel's self-styled ``security
zone'' in an occupied portion of South Lebanon.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, has led the fight to try to oust
Israeli troops and their allied South Lebanon Army militia from the
security zone, which Israel set up in southern Lebanon in 1985 to
protect its northern towns from cross-border raids.
	   The morning attack targeted the wooded hills near Maidoun in the
western part of the Bekaa Valley, just outside the security zone,
the officials said. There was no word on casualties from the raid.
	   The bombing raids came after Hezbollah guerrillas exchanged fire
with Israeli troops and the SLA, they said.
	   An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem said the Israeli pilots
scored direct hits and that the jets returned safely to base.

Iraq says Western planes fire on Basra in southern Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Pentagon spokesman denial, EDITS to conform &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos BAG101,103-104 &QL; 
 &UR; By LOUIS MEIXLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Tuesday claimed that U.S. and
British warplanes fired two ``stray missiles'' Tuesday toward the
southern city of Basra. The United States and Britain denied it.
	   The report by the official Iraqi News Agency did not define
``stray missiles'' or say if they had hit anything. The report
comes three days after the United States and Britain ended four
waves of punishing airstrikes on Iraq.
	   A Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Patrick Sivigny, said: ``U.S.
forces have not fired any missiles.'' Britain's Defense Ministry
likewise denied that British jets had fired any missiles at Iraq on
Tuesday.
	   Western jets patrolling a no-fly zone over southern Iraq have in
the past fired if approached by Iraqi aircraft or Iraqi
anti-aircraft batteries lock on with their radar systems to the
Western craft.
	   The Iraqi News Agency, quoting an unnamed authoritative military
spokesman, said aircraft from the ``criminal aggressors'' _ used to
mean the United States and Britain _ came in two waves and the
second wave opened fire.
	   It said ``four formations of aircraft ... penetrated Iraq's
national airspace'' at 9:15 a.m. (0630 GMT), then returned in the
direction from which they had come.
	   The agency said five more formations entered Iraq at 2:17 p.m.
(1117 GMT) ``and approached northern Basra out of range of our
weapons and fired two stray missiles before fleeing.''
	   ``This violation is part of the policy to harm Iraq,'' the
agency added.
	   The reported incident came as the United States and Iraq
continued to trade rhetoric over the U.S.-British airstrikes of
last week.
	   While Washington characterized the four-day offensive as a
success, Iraq's state-run newspapers declared Tuesday that
President Saddam Hussein's continued hold on power showed Iraq had
emerged victorious from the onslaught.
	   ``The enemies made a bid that a riot would take place in the
country, but they were wrong because Iraqis are closer to their
leader now than ever,'' the weekly Al-Ittihad said in an editorial.
	   The view was echoed in other government newspapers, which also
claimed the four-day attack had built sympathy for Iraq among the
world's Muslims.
	   About 120 U.N. humanitarian workers evacuated during last week's
airstrikes headed back to Baghdad from neighboring Jordan on
Tuesday morning, and a U.N. official said they would be back at
work Wednesday.
	   Khalid al-Izzi, an aide to U.N. humanitarian coordinator Hans
von Sponeck, said the first job would be to assess damage from the
airstrikes.
	   On Monday night, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz gave the first
official casualty figures for soldiers in the bombardment, saying
62 were killed and 180 wounded. He repeated assertions that many
more civilians were killed, but refused to give figures.
	   Iraqi authorities have not taken foreign journalists to sites
where they reported heavy civilian casualties as they have in the
past _ an indication the casualties either were not high or were
scattered.
	   The attacks targeted key military bases, government buildings,
communication centers and military factories.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the airstrikes after chief
U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler accused Iraq of failing to
fully cooperate with his inspectors.
	   The weapons inspectors must certify that Iraq is free of weapons
of mass destruction before the U.N. Security Council will lift
economic sanctions imposed on Baghdad for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   Aziz and other officials said the attacks disrupted telephone
communications to Iraq's south and heavily damaged factories that
could be used to manufacture long-range missiles prohibited under
the U.N. resolutions.
	   In Washington, U.S. Marine Corp Gen. Anthony Zinni, commander of
U.S. forces in the Middle East, said the strikes hit 85 percent of
their targets, 74 percent of them successfully. He said a full
damage assessment would probably take a few more days.
	   Zinni showed pictures of damage to Iraq's Defense Ministry in
Baghdad and the headquarters of the ruling Baath Party. ``I
guarantee you, nobody's working in the Baath Party headquarters,''
he joked, pointing to the scarred building.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen termed Operation Desert Fox
``highly successful.''
	   In London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the airstrikes
have set back parts of Iraq's ``military infrastructure several
years.''
	   Aziz maintained, however, that most of the strikes hit empty
barracks, adding that ``these barracks could be and will be
rebuilt.''
	   A U.S. intelligence report revealed by ABC News said that most
critical equipment from inside the missile plants had been moved
and Iraqi technicians responsible for building missiles were at
home in bed _ and not at the plants _ during the attacks.
	   Iraq said that in addition to hitting missile factories, the
bombardments struck colleges, post offices, dormitories, a museum
and an oil refinery.
	   ``They want to ... strip Iraq of any serious industrial
capabilities,'' Aziz told a news conference in Baghdad. But he
contended that the United States and Britain failed to seriously
harm the Iraqi government or military.
	   ``They boasted of great success. ... They lied,'' he said.
	   Aziz reiterated Monday that Baghdad will not allow U.N. arms
monitors to return, but chief weapons inspector Butler said it was
up to the Security Council to decide the future of the inspectors.
	   ``It's not for Baghdad alone to make that declaration,'' Butler
told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio on Tuesday.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ The former honorary consul of Paraguay in Geneva
appeared before a magistrate Tuesday on charges of a dlrs 100
million fraud.
	   Gustavo Gramont Beres, who had been charged for other offenses
in Paraguay, was extradited to Switzerland on the request of Geneva
authorities, said investigating magistrate Leonardo Malfanti.
	   Beres, an Argentine national, was the Paraguayan honorary consul
in Geneva from 1979 to 1989.
	   City authorities began an inquiry into Beres last year, and made
an official request for his extradition in February.
	   After being questioned, Beres was detained in prison pending his
trial. The charges relate to deception and forgery of dlrs 100
million worth of Swiss francs and German marks, according to Geneva
magistrate Malfanti. He gave no more details.

EU: US sanctions banana trade sanctions dlrs 600 million a year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The EU said Tuesday U.S. sanctions
against European imports resulting from a transatlantic banana
trade dispute totaled dlrs 600 million a year with British and
Italian firms bearing the brunt of the punishment.
	   European Commission spokesman Nigel Gardner called the punitive
tariffs on European Union imports ``arbitrary and illegal.''
	   An initial calculation showed the imports _ ranging from cartons
to batteries to coffee makers to Pecorino cheese _ have an annual
value of 501,167 million euros, roughly dlrs 600 million, he said.
	   British and Italian imports account for respectively 24 and 21
percent of this total, Gardner said.
	   He said the EU will push ahead with ``major changes'' in its
banana import regime that will likely bring imports of Latin
American bananas into the EU from their current 68 percent market
share to around 85 percent.
	   ``We are completely happy our new banana rules comply'' with
World Trade Organization rules, Gardner told reporters.
	   On Monday, the EU executive commission said it will accelerate
steps in the WTO for consultations leading to a panel against
unilateral U.S. measures under Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act.
	   That law lets Washington determine if its trade partners
unfairly protect their markets and whether to impose retaliatory
measures.
	   The banana dispute has dragged on for years. It began when the
EU decided to provide better access to bananas from ex-European
colonies at the expense of U.S.-owned Latin American producers who
serve 85 percent of the world market.
	   Washington has already won one WTO ruling against the EU and
maintains changes in EU banana imports resulting from the WTO
ruling were insufficient. On Monday, it published a list of EU
products that will be hit with 100 percent tariffs that will double
their prices in the United States.
	   Gardner said Britain will be hardest hit. He put the value of
British imports at 120 million euros (dlrs 144 million) a year or
24 percent of all imports targeted by the U.S. sanctions.
	   Italy was second at 103,5 million euros (dlrs 124.2 million),
followed by France, 95.5 million euros (dlrs 114.6 million);
Germany, 70.6 million euros (dlrs 85 million); Belgium, 35.4
million euros (dlrs 42.5 million); Spain, 21.9 million euros (dlrs
26.3 million); Portugal, 12.4 million euros (dlrs 15 million);
Denmark, (11.5 million euros (dlrs 13.8 million); Netherlands, 9.7
million euros (dlrs 11.64 million); Greece, 7.5 million euros (dlrs
9 million); Austria, 5.3 million euros (dlrs 6.4 million); Sweden,
4 million euros (dlrs 4.8 million); Finland, 2.2 million euros
(dlrs 2.6 million); Ireland, 1.9 million euros (dlrs 2.3 million).
	   The EU list was at odds with comments made by U.S. officials
Monday who said products of Denmark and the Netherlands will be
exempted from penalties because they were the only nations who
voted against the EU banana rules.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt is seeking to boost its non-petroleum
exports by 20 percent in 1999, the daily Al-Ahram reported Tuesday.
	   To realize this goal, the government will increase cotton
exports by about 34 percent, the newspaper quoted Trade Minister
Ahmed Guweily as saying.
	   Rice exports will increase from 400,000 tons to 500,000 tons and
the textile sector will boost its exports from 3 billion Egyptian
pounds (dlrs 880 million) to 4 billion pounds (dlrs. 1.17 billion),
he said.
	   Guweily called on public and private sector firms to make full
use of accords signed recently with the Common Market for East and
Central Africa, or COMESA, and bilateral agreements and the free
trade areas set up between Egypt and a number of Arab countries.
	   Other plans for boosting exports include upgrading quality to
make Egyptian products more competitive on the world market,
concluding free trade agreements with other countries and boosting
investment in export-oriented industries.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The government plans to conduct a full
review early next year on ways to encourage and promote economic
investments in the kingdom, a government official said Tuesday.
	   The private sector and the presidents and members of the
financial committees of both houses of Parliament will be consulted
as part of the review, the official said. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   He hinted at the possibility that the new review would include
amendments to an investment promotion law to simplify and
facilitate investment procedures.
	   The government is determined to make tax and customs incentives
more effective and reduce bureaucracy, he said.
	   Earlier this year, Jordan doubled the permitted level of foreign
investments in the commercial, industrial and economic sectors,
producing a 22 percent hike in investment during the
January-November 1998 period compared to the whole of 1997.
 &UR; __
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Israel has agreed to ease restrictions on
transportation of goods between Jordan and the Palestinian
territories, an Israeli Embassy statement said Tuesday.
	   The statement said a meeting of Jordanian-Israeli Joint
Committee decided that Jordanian vehicles will be allowed to
transport goods directly to customers in the Palestinian held
lands.
	   The committee, chaired by Issa Ayoub, director-general of the
transport ministry, and his Israeli counterpart, Nahoum Langental,
agreed that loading and unloading docks should be constructed in
certain areas in Israel, close to the Palestinian territories under
Israeli supervision, the statement said.

Opposition leader: a scrappier approach by Netanyahu's challenger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Photos JRL103-104
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ By all accounts, he's facing an uphill battle:
a campaign to unseat the incumbent prime minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, a media-savvy politician with a talent for selling
himself.
	   So opposition leader Ehud Barak is fighting back _ with the help
of some high-priced American spin doctors. Under their tutelage,
his campaign debut is marked by a scrappier style.
	   When Netanyahu came out swinging, mocking the ``fantasies and
ambitions'' of his political rivals, Barak jabbed back with
ridicule of what he calls ``Orwellian Bibi-speak.''
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, Barak indicated the
issues in Israel's upcoming election would be less about
Israeli-Arab relations and more about the economy and the character
of Netanyahu, known by his nickname ``Bibi.''
	   Barak attacked Netanyahu for giving away too much tax money to
ultra-Orthodox religious parties and Jewish settlers in the West
Bank. He also accused Netanyahu of trying to please everyone,
deriding what he called ``Orwellian Bibi-speak in which you can
hear whatever you want.''
	   ``If peace could be achieved through the (television) screen,
and terror could be defeated through spin, then we have an ideal
prime minister,'' said Barak.
	   Critics accuse Barak of being a lackluster Labor Party leader
who has adopted a me-too approach to the Israel-Palestinian issue
in order to win-over the security-minded voters of the
center-right. Asked if his policies were like Netanyahu's, Barak
said:
	   ``Oh, come on. Whoever wants an extra quarter-million
unemployed, please vote Bibi. Whoever wants paralysis and impasses
please vote Bibi. Whoever wants a government hostage to extremists,
vote Bibi.''
	   By ``extremists'' Barak said he meant ultra-Orthodox factions
and Jewish settlers, who had milked precious resources from
Netanyahu's government and left school classrooms overcrowded and
health services strained as a result.
	   ``The way to get rid of this kind of leverage is to create a a
wide government backed by a big enough fraction of the public that
will enable us to do it,'' he said.
	   ``I respect tradition. I respect religious people. I'm against
arm-twisting in the political arena.''
	   In the interview, Barak defined himself as a ``man of action,''
which is well supported by his resume but not obvious from his
short stature, paunch and seeming shyness.
	   As a paratroop commando in April 1973, he pulled a blond wig
over his black, curly hair and applied lipstick and mascara. His
mission: a commando raid in downtown Beirut to assassinate three
PLO leaders.
	   In May 1972, Barak led a team of 16 commandos, including
Netanyahu, who disguised themselves as airline technicians and
stormed a hijacked Sabena plane, killing two Palestinian hijackers
and capturing two others.
	   To spruce up his image, Barak hired some high-profile American
experts including James Carville, who helped Bill Clinton get to
the White House. The result is a more combative, less intellectual
challenger who says he will win by ``being myself.''
	   In the latest polls, Barak and Netanyahu were nearly even with a
strong showing by Amnon Lipkin Shahak, a former chief of staff who
has yet to announce his candidacy but is expected to head a
centrist party.
	   In a radio interview Tuesday, Netanyahu shrugged off his
challengers:
	   ``The fantasies and ambitions of all those who want to be prime
minister _ please. We will allow the voters to decide who needs to
lead the state.''
	   In the AP interview, Barak skirted questions about what he would
do if Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat declared a state on May 4,
1999, as he has threatened to do if there is no final status
agreement.
	   Netanyahu, who opposes an independent Palestinian state, has
vowed to annex West Bank land around Jewish settlements and in
areas needed for security.
	   Barak said it would be a mistake for Arafat to declare a state
without negotiating security arrangements. But, unlike Netanyahu,
the Labor leader said he would not quibble about the name.
	   ``It's up to them. I'm not going to patronize them,'' he said.
``They have their right to determine the name they call themselves
as long as they fully comply with the mutually agreed terms of
security.''
	   His terms, Barak said, were that Israel would not agree to a
Palestinian army, a division of Jerusalem or a return to the 1967
borders that existed when Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza
Strip in the Six-Day War.
	   Jewish settlements, which now number more than 140 with 150,000
residents, should be clustered into blocs that remain under
Israel's control, but he would not demand ``every isolated
settlement.''

<TEXT>
	   BAALBEK, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes fired missiles at
suspected guerrilla bases in eastern Lebanon Tuesday, killing a
woman and her six children, Lebanese security officials said. A
guerrilla-run radio transmitter also was destroyed in the attack.
	   The officials said the casualties occurred when an Israeli
rocket crashed on a farm where a couple and their seven children
were working in the village of Nabi Sheet, about 23 kilometers (14
miles) southeast of the ancient city of Baalbek.
	   The dead children were between two and 11 years of age.
	   Their father and one other child were wounded, the officials
said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. It was the
worst civilian casualty this year in the war between Israel and
Lebanese guerrillas.
	   There was no word from Israel on the report.
	   Lebanese officials said at least five other air-to-surface
missiles also hit the hills around the villages of Nabi Sheet and
Janta, about five kilometers (three miles) west of the Syrian
border.
	   The officials said a transmitter for Hezbollah's Voice of the
Oppressed radio on the edge of Nabi Sheet was destroyed.
	   A spokesman for the Iranian-backed Hezbollah confirmed that the
2:45 p.m. (1245 GMT) attack hit a transmitter but gave no other
details. He also spoke on condition his name not be used.
	   The radio station remained on the air, apparently using a backup
transmitter.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Israeli fighter bombers fired four rockets on
suspected guerrilla bases facing Israel's self-styled ``security
zone'' in an occupied portion of South Lebanon.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, has led the fight to try to oust
Israeli troops and their allied South Lebanon Army militia from the
security zone, which Israel set up in southern Lebanon in 1985 to
protect its northern towns from cross-border raids.
	   The morning attack targeted the wooded hills near Maidoun in the
western part of the Bekaa Valley, just outside the security zone,
the officials said. There was no word on casualties from the raid.
	   The bombing raids came after Hezbollah guerrillas exchanged fire
with Israeli troops and the SLA, they said.
	   An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem said the Israeli pilots
scored direct hits and that the jets returned safely to base.

China relents and lets balloon continue, organizers say
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: COMBINES previous; UPDATES with Kendrick saying crew has fuel
problem &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ China agreed to let a round-the-world balloon
expedition to continue crossing its territory Tuesday, rescinding
an order that it land in rugged Himalayan terrain, the expedition
organizers said.
	   Project director Mike Kendrick said he had given the news to the
three man crew.
	   ``Gosh, maybe they can start enjoying this flight now,'' he told
a news conference.
	   Kendrick said the Chinese granted permission on condition that
the ICO Global balloon leave prohibited airspace as soon as
possible.
	   ``We are going to look ... for the fastest, most direct route
out of China, which is what the balloon wants to do anyway, so
we're happy to comply with that one,'' Kendrick said.
	   The landing order threatened to end the round-the-world dreams
of British tycoon Richard Branson, American millionaire Steve
Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden.
	   Speaking for the balloonists and the ground crew of about 60
people, Kendrick said: ``We all feel great. If we weren't so busy,
and our jobs weren't so important, we'd all get drunk.''
	   The ICO Global balloon was over Tibet, about 10 miles (15 kms)
north of Bhutan at about 1300 GMT, and Kendrick said organizers
would go to work on plotting a course to catch a jetstream to move
them swiftly on their way.
	   With the diplomatic crisis apparently resolved, Kendrick said
the crew now had a problem of using up a large amount of fuel keep
the balloon free of ice.
	   ``We are doing the fuel calculations now. We have taken a long
time to get where we are, clawing across the Himalayas,'' he said.
``We have used more fuel than we would have expected. We are going
to have to assess the situation.''
	   The crew had been given permission to cross China below 26
degrees north latitude, but drifted further north after navigating
around Mediterranean storms and closed airspace over Iraq, Iran and
Russia.
	   Earlier in the day, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao had
said China could not agree to the balloon's northerly course, but
he did not call on the crew to withdraw immediately or land.
	   Organizers of the expedition apologized, said they were trying
to head south as quickly as wind and weather permitted _ which is
about 50 mph (80 kmh).
	   Kendrick said Chinese air traffic controllers were informed the
moment the balloon passed over the border, with an apology added to
the communication. The balloon team continued to contact them every
15 minutes to keep the Chinese informed about their position.
	   In February, China withheld permission for a European balloon
team to fly through its airspace, forcing them to land and end
their around-the-world bid.
	   As it became apparent early Monday that the balloon would
inevitably cross into unauthorized Chinese territory, Prime
Minister Tony Blair sent a message to Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
asking for China's help.
	   The ICO Global balloon had already run into trouble on its trip.
Libya unexpectedly revoked permission to enter its airspace, but
the situation was resolved shortly before the three-man crew flew
over the country on Saturday.
	   Then, after steering around thunderstorms near Cyprus, the crew
had to maneuver the 270-foot (82-meter) craft through narrow gaps
between no-fly territories, including Iraq.
	   The crew members estimate the trip could last from eight days to
nearly three weeks. They hope to touch down somewhere in western
Europe at the end of a 24,000-mile (38,000 kms) flight, which will
take them over India, the South China sea, the Pacific and the
United States.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.

Ukrainian ex-premier denies corruption charges, vows retaliation
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A former Ukrainian prime minister charged
Tuesday that a Swiss money laundering investigation against him was
inspired by Ukrainian leaders who want to neutralize him before
1999 presidential elections.
	   Pavlo Lazarenko said his recent arrest in Switzerland was the
work of Ukrainian prosecutors who persuaded their Swiss colleagues
to investigate and detain him.
	   ``I have not committed a single violation of Swiss law,''
Lazarenko told a news conference.
	   ``But this case revealed the real aim of Ukrainian authorities:
Lazarenko gets arrested in Switzerland and the (Ukrainian)
authorities then say they have nothing to do with the arrest.''
	   Lazarenko was released last week on dlrs 3 million bail from a
jail in Switzerland following his arrest by Swiss police earlier
this month on money laundering charges.
	   Lazarenko, who heads his opposition Hromada party in parliament,
has turned into an adamant opponent of President Leonid Kuchma and
prominent opposition leader since being fired from the prime
minister's post in July 1997.
	   Until his arrest, many had expected Lazarenko to run in the
October 1999 presidential election. If he doesn't, analysts predict
he will channel his reportedly substantial financial resources to
support another candidate opposing Kuchma.
	   Lazarenko would not say Tuesday whether he would run, but said
his party would discuss the issue at a congress this week.
	   Ukraine's chief prosecutor's office has launched an
investigation against Lazarenko, accusing him of siphoning millions
of dollars out of Ukraine illegally, largely through the national
gas distribution market.
	   On Monday, prosecutors asked parliament to revoke Lazarenko's
immunity so he could be arrested and put on trial on charges of
stealing government funds and illegally stashing about dlrs 4
million abroad.
	   Under Ukraine's constitution, a lawmaker can be prosecuted only
if parliament lifts his immunity. It is unclear when parliament
would debate the prosecutor's request.
	   Lazarenko said the request was an attempt to discredit him and
his opposition party before presidential elections.
	   ``The Ukrainian authorities will be destroying Lazarenko until
the end because they are not interested in his presence in Ukraine
during the presidential elections,'' he said.
	   Lazarenko said he was ready to provide evidence of corruption
and money laundering against several senior government officials,
but said he would not give it to Ukrainian prosecutors.
	   ``Unbiased people are needed to prove facts of corruption in
Ukraine,'' Lazarenko said.
	   Lazarenko did not say who he would give the evidence to or when.
	   But he warned: ``Lazarenko is not an angel, and I'm saying that
honestly. The acts (that were employed against me) cannot be
forgiven.''

IFJ: 49 journalists, 1 photographer killed in the world in 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Norbert Zongo was a leading journalist
in Burkina Faso, Igor Lykov denounced corruption in the Russian
press, Afrim Maliqi criticized Serbian policy towards the Albanian
population of Kosovo.
	   All three were killed by gunmen in 1998. They are among 49
journalists and one photographer slain this year, the International
Federation of Journalists said in a report published Tuesday.
	   Of the 50 victims, 30 journalists and a photographer were killed
for reasons tied to their work, the IFJ's general secretary Aidan
White told a news conference. The IFJ is still investigating the
other 19 cases.
	   The highest death rate was in Colombia, where 10 journalists
were killed in 1998, followed by Mexico, where six journalists were
killed, and Russia, where five journalists died.
	   ``In certain countries, it seems to be accepted that if you kill
a journalist you won't get caught,'' White said, denouncing the
``lack of commitment at political level to trace the killers of
journalists.''
	   IFJ spokeswoman Cailin MacKenzie said the killings were only
``the tip of the iceberg.'' ``In Kosovo, for example, journalists
are being fined enormous amounts of money, newspapers are being
shut down,'' she said.
	   Central and South America remained the most dangerous zone for
journalists in 1998, with a total 22 journalists killed in Brazil,
Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Guatemala.
	   ``In some countries, the situation is improving,'' White said,
noting that for the first time in several years there were no
casualties among the press in Algeria.
	   Last year, as in 1996, 47 journalists were killed in the world.
	   White said the IFJ bases its evidence on locally-based sources,
as well as testimonies from the colleagues and relatives of the
victims.

SAfrican judge frees five convicted in Christmas 1995 massacre
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Party leaders appealed for
calm Tuesday after a judge released five people who were jailed for
the politically motivated massacre of 18 people on Christmas three
years ago.
	   The attack in 1995 was carried out by supporters of the Zulu
nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party in Shobashobane, a village 525
kilometers (330 miles) southeast of Johannesburg.
	   It was a particularly shocking episode in the decade-long war
between IFP militants and followers of the African National
Congress.
	   The fighting in the years before all-race elections in 1994 left
more than 10,000 people dead. With the next elections approaching
in mid-1999, many fear a resurgence of tensions.
	   ``We are asking people to restrain themselves,'' said Dumisani
Makhaye, an ANC spokesman in KwaZulu-Natal Province, site of
Shobashobane and scene of much of the violence.
	   Ruling in an appeal, Judge Jan Hugo overturned the convictions
of five of 13 men found guilty in the massacre and ordered them
released from prison. The judge found they had been wrongly
convicted, the South African Press Association reported. One of
those freed was Sipho Ngcobo, a leading IFP official in the area.
	   No opinion accompanied the ruling. No one was available in his
office Tuesday to comment.
	   The ANC reacted to the ruling with ``shock and disbelief,'' the
party said in a statement. It said it was ``ironic'' that the
decision came just a few days before the third anniversary of the
killing.
	   The IFP expressed relief at Hugo's ruling.
	   ``We are happy to have our people found not guilty in a court of
law of these terrible crimes,'' said Lauretta Ncgobo, an IFP
spokeswoman. She is not related to Sipho Ngcobo.
	   ``There has been a lot of rumbling going on that area. I would
hope ... there shouldn't be any trouble. We don't want any
trouble,'' she said.
	   In the bloodshed at Shobashobane, a village near the Indian
Ocean town of Port Shepstone, the victims were shot and hacked to
death when some 2,000 IFP supporters attacked.
	   On Monday, ANC officials blamed the IFP for the weekend burning
of 16 houses belonging to ANC supporters in the same rural area.
The Christmas period is particularly volatile because many
city-based workers travel home to see families.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India and Russia will sign a ``strategic
friendship'' agreement next year to reflect their close ties since
the 1971 treaty signed during the Cold War, according to a joint
declaration issued Tuesday.
	   It will be signed during President Boris Yeltsin's planned visit
to India next year, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said
Monday. Yeltsin was scheduled to visit New Delhi in December, but
his trip was postponed as his health deteriorated. No fresh dates
have been set for Yeltsin's visit.
	   ``This political document of paramount importance will set new
parameters and guide further development of the close partnership
between India and Russia,'' said a joint declaration at the end of
a two-day visit by Primakov.
	   On Monday, the two nations signed seven agreements to boost
trade, air services, diplomatic interaction and extradition of
criminals.
	   Officials of both nations are working on a proposal to let New
Delhi to plow back about 10 percent of the money it owes Moscow
into joint venture companies in India, said the Indian official who
cannot be identified under briefing rules.
	   India has been paying about dlrs 1 billion each year to Moscow
for the last five years. The money is used to buy goods such as
tea, tobacco and medicines for Russian companies. New Delhi
suggested that some of that money could be used to set up joint
ventures in India in such areas as power generation, steel
production and information technology, which would benefit the
Russians, the official said.
	   On Tuesday, Primakov reassured Indian business leaders that his
country remains a safe place for investment.
	   Primakov, speaking to Indian industrialists at the end of his
state visit to New Delhi, tried to set at rest concerns about
Russia's economic problems, including the collapse of its banking
system. He said Russia was committed to its international financial
obligations, an open economy and noninterference with dollar
exchange rates.
	   Russia was also proposing lowering taxes for foreign investors
and would consider repaying Indian businessmen who lost money
deposited in banks backed by the government in the recent banking
crisis.
	   He called for a doubling of India-Russia trade by the year 2000
and for increased Indian investment in his country.
	   Russia has been one of India's largest trade partners, but
Russia's economic crisis has hit bilateral trade that has been
dwindling since the breakup of the Soviet Union. Trade between the
two countries has fallen from a high of dlrs 5.5 billion in 1990 to
dlrs 1.5 billion in 1998.
	   ``This we cannot accept,'' said Primakov calling for twofold
increase in trade by 2000 and a fourfold increase by 2005.
	   After his meeting Monday with his Indian counterpart Atal Bihari
Vajpayee, Primakov said the two prime ministers would personally
oversee removal of obstacles in the way of better trade.

Turkey's Akmaya Sanayi Ve Ticaret to buy Romanian refinery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A leading Turkish holding company,
Akmaya Sanayi Ve Ticaret, signed Tuesday an agreement with the
Romanian government to buy a majority stake in Petromidia oil
refinery.
	   Under the agreement, Akmaya will purchase 65 percent of
Petromidia for dlrs 725 million in January 1999, the Romanian
government said in an official statement.
	   The deal includes rescheduling nearly dlrs 260 million of
Petromidia's debt through the Romanian government, the statement
said.
	   Strategically located in the Black Sea port of Constanta, oil
from Petromidia could be transported through western Europe by
waterways via the Danube and Rhine rivers, allowing oil to be
distributed at points along the way from Hungary to Germany.
	   Romania has 10 major oil refineries, built up under the tenure
of former dictator Nicolae's Ceausescu, which produce some 34
million tons of oil per year. Petromidia has an annual capacity of
4.8 million tons.
	   The state currently owns 69 percent of the refinery, while the
remaining 31 percent is held by a private-public investment fund
and the public. Akmaya's 65 percent stake will be wholly the
government share.
	   Akmaya holds assets in a range of companies, including
commodities, steel makers, communications, banking, finance and
insurance, in addition to 100 percent ownership of Turkey's Sumer
Bank.

Iranian court rejects appeal of former mayor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian court has rejected an appeal by
the former mayor of Tehran who was sentenced to five years in jail
in July for corruption, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported
Tuesday.
	   The appeal by Gholamhossein Karbaschi was considered by three
judges and the ``charges and the cases of conviction remain the
same,'' IRNA quoted judiciary spokesman Fotovat Nasiri-Savadkouhi
as saying.
	   IRNA said the court considered some commutation, but did not
make it clear if the sentence was actually reduced. It did not say
when the ruling was made.
	   Karbaschi, a key ally of moderate President Mohammad Khatami,
had been a target of the hard-line political rivals, and many
Iranians saw the trial as a political settling of scores.
	   He was found guilty in July of embezzlement during his eight
years as Tehran's mayor. He was fined 1 billion rials (dlrs
330,000), ordered to pay 600 million rials (dlrs 200,000) to the
city and banned from holding any government job for 20 years.
	   Karbaschi filed an appeal in August.
	   During his trial, which lasted more than a month, Karbaschi
admitted to making mistakes, but denied stealing public money.
	   Karbaschi won wide respect for his work as mayor. He built parks
and social centers and reduced pollution and traffic congestion.
But he also made enemies among the merchant class which resented
his taxes and his support for Khatami, a moderate cleric who
believes in relaxing the Islamic social code. His pro-Khatami
stance also incurred the enmity of hard-liners.
	   Riots erupted in Iran soon after Karbaschi's arrest in April.
	   Following the trial he was allowed to remain free on bail until
there was a ruling on his appeal of the sentence: three years for
embezzling public funds and two years for misappropriation of
government money.
	   For many Iranians, the televised trial gave the first insight
into Iran's judicial process and moderates saw it more as an
indictment of the judiciary than the mayor.

 &UR; NEW YORK: Soviet collapse. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   Having effectively defaulted on some of its debts, the
government's only strategy has been to beg for more Western loans.
The government has warned that Russia may plunge into chaos if
there is no new aid.
	   But Western governments and private institutions, having seen
billions of dollars wasted and misappropriated, are reluctant to
extend any more aid.
	   While some assessments project a mild recovery in the second
half of 1999, all projections call for an overall decline in GDP
ranging from 3 percent to 11 percent. Russia's economy is expected
to shrink about 5 percent in 1998.
	   ``In such conditions the crisis can become permanent,'' warned
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, still struggling to implement a
recovery plan.
	   In Latin America, Brazil will pay the price in 1999 for failing
to curb its dlrs 65 billion budget deficit, and a recession
expected here will stunt growth around the continent.
	   Brazil plans to cut its deficit by some dlrs 23 billion (28
billion reals) next year by raising taxes and reducing spending.
The combination will produce a sharp retraction, easing slightly
after July.
	   The more optimistic economists predict Brazil's economy will
shrink 1 percent. J.P. Morgan estimates a contraction of 3 percent
in 1999.
	   With world oil prices hovering at 12-year lows of around dlrs 10
a barrel, the countries of the Middle East _ especially those in
the Gulf that are heavily dependent on oil _ face deepening
economic problems.
	   Iran may have to reschedule its foreign debt, while countries
like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have slashed budgets and will have to
keep a tight rein on spending in 1999.
	   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, is taking the
biggest beating. Analysts estimate its oil income will fall to dlrs
23 billion in 1998 from nearly dlrs 50 billion in 1997.
	   Most of the Gulf countries already have cut spending, frozen
hiring, postponed developments projects and slowed payments to
contractors _ all moves that will have a depressing effect on their
local economies.
	   Israel's economic slowdown, now in its third year, is expected
to continue through 1999. Former Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman
recently acknowledged that GDP may grow less in 1999 than the
ministry's original forecast of 2.5 percent because of global
market turmoil.
	   Unemployment, forecast to swell to more than 9 percent in 1998
from 7.7 percent in 1997, is expected to remain fairly stable
through 1999.
	   Elsewhere:
	   _ China has drastically increased spending and loosened its
inflation-fighting credit policy efforts to protect the country
from the financial turmoil and economic slumps afflicting its
neighbors. By the last quarter of 1998, those efforts appeared to
be paying off, with signs of recovery in industrial output and GDP
growth, which had dipped to 7.2 percent in the first three
quarters, well below the official target of 8.0 percent.
	   _ In Latin America, Argentina will feel the pinch _ 40 percent
of its exports are to Brazil. Argentine economic growth will shrink
to about half this year's 7 percent, barring further turbulence in
Brazil. Chile's boom years also may be over. Growth in 1999 should
be around 3 percent, accelerating in the second half. After growing
by more than 5 percent in 1997, Venezuela's economy is expected to
shrink at least 1 percent in 1998 mainly due to low oil prices.
Mexico has proposed its most austere budget in 20 years, and a
tight money policy to lower 15.7 percent inflation will mean more
sluggish growth.
	   _ South African economy will grow just 0.2 percent in 1998, down
from the 3 percent predicted earlier. The collapse of the
once-booming ``Asian Tigers'' has dampened global demand for
minerals and commodities, especially gold, that South African
exports rely on.

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Five men were killed in the eastern city
of Pozega when a man entered a bar and sprayed them with
submachine-gun fire, officials said Tuesday.
	   An unidentified suspect was arrested a few hours after the
shooting occurred late Monday, Pozega district judge Nenad Vlasic
said in a statement. Neither the judge nor the police gave any
details of the shooting in the town situated 174 kilometers (109
miles) from Zagreb.
	   The five were the sole customers, said the statement. The bar
owner, who hid when the shooting began, was unhurt.

Former civil servant convicted in child porn scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A former government employee was
convicted Tuesday of downloading pedophilia and other pornography
from the Internet and storing it on a Justice Ministry computer.
	   The 39-year-old man, whose name was not released in line with
Dutch privacy laws, was sentenced to four months' imprisonment
commuted to 172 hours of unpaid public work.
	   Prosecutors had asked a three-judge panel at Hague District
Court for a six-month sentence for the former civil servant, who
was the Justice Ministry's computer systems manager at the time of
the offense.
	   The man was fired last summer when it was found that he had
downloaded thousands of pornographic images, including some of
children being abused, and stored them on computers at his office
and home.
	   He claimed in court that he did not know the pornography he
downloaded included images of children.
	   News of his dismissal and arrest came to light in August as the
nation struggled to come to terms with a scandal unleashed by the
discovery of a huge stash of child pornography which a Dutch-based
ring sold via the Internet to pedophiles all over the world. The
civil servant was not connected to that ring.
	   Possession of child pornography carries a maximum sentence of
six years' imprisonment in the Netherlands.

Kyrgyzstan becomes first ex-Soviet republic to join WTO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan has become
the first former Soviet republic to join the World Trade
Organization.
	   Kyrgyzstan ratified the WTO's terms for entry last month, and
then had to wait 30 days for the membership to become official, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported Tuesday. The 30-day waiting period
expired on Monday.
	   Kyrgyzstan, a rural nation of about 4 million people, has a weak
economy based on agriculture, especially sheep farming. It is one
of the poorest of the 15 former Soviet republics.
	   Kyrgyzstan agreed to reduce import tariffs on goods including
some energy products, chemicals and paper to join the WTO, the
world's main trade body which sets global rules. Kyrgyzstan is the
group's 133rd member, trade officials said.
	   The country also promised to open international and
long-distance telephone services to foreign suppliers by Jan. 1,
2003.
	   Latvia is likely to become the next former Soviet republic to
join the WTO.
	   Russia applied for membership in 1993, but hasn't been admitted.
Kyrgyzstan applied in 1996.

Preston owner talks down manager's move to Old Trafford
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRESTON, England (AP) _ Preston owner Bryan Gray on Tuesday
dispelled rumors that Manchester United was about to sign its
successful manager David Moyes as Alex Ferguson's No. 2.
	   ``It's flattering for David, but there's nothing happening,''
said the chairman of the division two club, which faces defending
titlist Arsenal in the third round of the FA Cup Jan. 4. ``There
has been no contact, and I'm not expecting any from them to be
honest.
	   ``I would not agree to it but I think we're talking about things
which are hypothetical.''
	   Reports linked United with 35-year-old Moyes who has lifted the
once-great club to fourth in the division two standings and on
course for a return to division one for the first time since 1981.
And he's done it without being able to buy any big names.
	   United has not won in five games since Brian Kidd, who had been
Ferguson's No. 2 for seven years, moved on to become manager of
Blackburn. Last Saturday the Reds lost 3-2 at home to Middlesbrough
and squandered a chance to go top of the Premier League.

EU Commission seeks new, bigger aid program for ex-USSR states
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Commission on Tuesday
proposed to raise economic and trade aid for Russia and other
ex-Soviet states and make it focus more on fewer, bigger projects.
	   It recommended the EU boost its TACIS aid program to 4 billion
euros (dlrs 4.8 billion) in 2000-2006, up 33 percent from the
current program that ends in 1999.
	   EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek proposed 25
percent of aid be used to support democracy, trade and investments.
	   He proposed greater differentiation in aid with support for
Russia, Ukraine and the Caucasus states focusing on investments,
regional cooperation and closer ties with central European states
due to join the EU.
	   For former Soviet republics in Central and East Asia, he
suggested that aid focus more on reinforcing democracy, good
governance and economic reforms.
	   Van den Broek said the EU will continue to insist on strict
adherence to aid conditions: recipients must respect democracy, the
rule of law and will get aid in slices ``with each successive
payment made only on the successful completion of the previous
phase.''
	   The TACIS program has been criticized by the European Parliament
and others for aiming at too many small projects, for getting
projects off the ground too slowly and suffering from cumbersome
tendering procedures.
	   Van den Broek said changes in the new-style TACIS program will
avoid a repeat of these shortcomings.

Refugees flood Freetown, while rebels draw nearer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Thousands of refugees poured into
Sierra Leone's capital on Tuesday as fighting intensified between
rebel forces and Nigerian-led West African intervention troops
based in nearby towns.
	   Villagers carried their few possessions on their heads and
walked throughout the night to reach Freetown. In the city, they
slept in the sweltering sun along sidewalks while others pitched
tents and some sought shelter in shop doorways.
	   A number of refugees recounted images of rebel fighters burning
down houses and randomly killing civilians with assault rifles in
the town of Wellington, about 20 miles (35 kilometers) to the east.
There were unconfirmed reports of heavy fighting in other towns
closer to the capital.
	   One of the refugees from Wellington, Arthur Nicol, said he
witnessed rebels gouging out the eyes of the national
general-secretary of the Young Men's Christian Association in
Sierra Leone, Paul Whenzle.
	   ``The rebels killed him only after he gave them all of his
money,'' Nicol added.
	   Faced with apparent the apparent setbacks, officials from the
government and the West African intervention force fighting on its
behalf instituted a press blackout, declining to speak to
journalists about the fighting and banning unauthorized dispatches.
	   Earlier this month a Sierra Leonean journalist working for the
British Broadcasting Corp. was arrested and charged in connection
with a report about fighting in Sierra Leone's interior.
	   Some West African soldiers speaking on condition of anonymity at
checkpoints along the Wellington-Freetown highway said the
coalition army, known as ECOMOG, had driven the rebels away from
Wellington early Tuesday, but the situation remained unstable.
	   Civilians leaving Freetown for Sierra Leone's interior were
turned back by ECOMOG troops, while others trying to take refuge in
the capital underwent vigorous searches before being allowed to
enter.
	   President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's government has been waging war
against members of Sierra Leone's ousted military junta and its
rebel allies.
	   Kabbah was returned to power in March after the ruling military
junta that deposed him was itself ousted.
	   Together with the civilian militia, ECOMOG forces have been
given defense duties by the government, which earlier this year
disbanded the rebellious military and imprisoned thousands of
soldiers suspected of aiding the former junta.
	   Thousands of people have been brutally killed, raped and maimed
by the rebels in a sweeping revenge campaign against the
government.
	   The latest fighting prompted aid workers with the missionary
group Adventist Development and Relief Agency to abandon a hospital
and rehabilitation camp Monday for thousands of war amputees in
Waterloo.
	   On the outskirts of Freetown, the thumping of mortars and rattle
of machine-gun fire could be heard intermittently Sunday night,
when ECOMOG tightened a night curfew and patrolled beaches and
suburbs of the capital. Rebels captured the diamond-mining town of
Kono late last week.
	   Sierra Leone, a diamond-rich country of about 4.5 million
people, has been plagued by intermittent hostilities since 1990
despite the overwhelming unpopularity of the rebel alliance.

Ukrainian ex-premier denies corruption charges, vows retaliation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Kuchma in last two new grafs &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A former Ukrainian prime minister charged
Tuesday that a Swiss money laundering investigation against him was
inspired by Ukrainian leaders who want to neutralize him before
1999 presidential elections.
	   Pavlo Lazarenko said his recent arrest in Switzerland was the
work of Ukrainian prosecutors who persuaded their Swiss colleagues
to investigate and detain him.
	   ``I have not committed a single violation of Swiss law,''
Lazarenko told a news conference.
	   ``But this case revealed the real aim of Ukrainian authorities:
Lazarenko gets arrested in Switzerland and the (Ukrainian)
authorities then say they have nothing to do with the arrest.''
	   Lazarenko was released last week on dlrs 3 million bail from a
jail in Switzerland following his arrest by Swiss police earlier
this month on money laundering charges.
	   Lazarenko, who heads his opposition Hromada party in parliament,
has turned into an adamant opponent of President Leonid Kuchma and
prominent opposition leader since being fired from the prime
minister's post in July 1997.
	   Until his arrest, many had expected Lazarenko to run in the
October 1999 presidential election. If he doesn't, analysts predict
he will channel his reportedly substantial financial resources to
support another candidate opposing Kuchma.
	   Lazarenko would not say Tuesday whether he would run, but said
his party would discuss the issue at a congress this week.
	   Ukraine's chief prosecutor's office has launched an
investigation against Lazarenko, accusing him of siphoning millions
of dollars out of Ukraine illegally, largely through the national
gas distribution market.
	   On Monday, prosecutors asked parliament to revoke Lazarenko's
immunity so he could be arrested and put on trial on charges of
stealing government funds and illegally stashing about dlrs 4
million abroad.
	   Under Ukraine's constitution, a lawmaker can be prosecuted only
if parliament lifts his immunity. It is unclear when parliament
would debate the prosecutor's request.
	   Lazarenko said the request was an attempt to discredit him and
his opposition party before presidential elections.
	   ``The Ukrainian authorities will be destroying Lazarenko until
the end because they are not interested in his presence in Ukraine
during the presidential elections,'' he said.
	   Lazarenko said he was ready to provide evidence of corruption
and money laundering against several senior government officials,
but said he would not give it to Ukrainian prosecutors.
	   ``Unbiased people are needed to prove facts of corruption in
Ukraine,'' Lazarenko said.
	   Lazarenko did not say who he would give the evidence to or when.
	   But he warned: ``Lazarenko is not an angel, and I'm saying that
honestly. The acts (that were employed against me) cannot be
forgiven.''
	   Kuchma responded to his former subordinate's charges later in
the day, calling them ungrounded.
	   ``If (Lazarenko) had anything to say, he would have said it a
dozen times,'' Kuchma said, according to the Interfax news agency.

Hakkinen: Almost unbeatable once he started winning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ At first glance, one might think that the victory
in the Japanese Grand Prix two months ago, the one that gave him
his first Formula One title, was the biggest event in Mika
Hakkinen's career.
	   Yet to the 30-year-old Finn, the 1997-season-ending European
Grand Prix had a much bigger impact.
	   It was in Jerez, Spain, after nearly seven full years and 95
races on the circuit, that he finally won a race and uncorked the
champagne.
	   ``It made a huge psychological difference,'' Hakkinen said.
``When you finally win it makes you look at racing differently. It
takes a lot of pressure away.''
	   Hakkinen has barely stopping winning since.
	   After one victory in 96 tries, Hakkinen won eight of 16 races in
1998 en route to the world title, edging out two-time series
champion Michael Schumacher in the season finale in Suzuka, Japan.
	   Schumacher needed to win in Japan and have Hakkinen finish no
better than third. But the 29-year-old German stalled his engine
starting from the pole, restarted from the back of the grid, and
then blew a tire midway through the race to end his season.
	   The tire failure was also an inglorious end for American tire
maker Goodyear, which equipped Ferrari and was running its final
grand prix. Goodyear entered Formula One in 1965 but said last year
it was pulling out because of rising costs.
	   Granted, McLaren-Mercedes had the fastest cars all season. But
Hakkinen, often described _ but not wholly accurately _ as cold,
taciturn, and colorless _ proved he was as good as the silver
McLaren.
	   Hakkinen won four of the first six races, while teammate David
Coulthard won one and finished second three times. That allowed
Hakkinen to build a 17-point lead over Coulthard and a 22-point
margin on Schumacher.
	   With his Ferrari showing better reliability _ strange but true,
Schumacher managed to tie Hakkinen on points (80) going into the
Luxembourg Grand Prix in Nurburgring, Germany, the next-to-last
race of the season.
	   But Hakkinen, in possibly the best drive of his career, defeated
the pole-sitting Schumacher to dispel any notion he was feeling the
pressure, taking a four-point lead (90-86) heading to Japan.
	   The pressure, in the end, got to Schumacher, who earns dlrs 40
million annually and was trying to win this third world title to
match Ayrton Senna, Jack Brabham, Jackie Stewart, Niki Lauda and
Nelson Piquet. Alain Prost has won four and racing pioneer Juan
Manuel Fangio has five.
	   ``We didn't lose the championship today,'' Schumacher said after
the Japanese Grand Prix. ``We lost in the early stages when we were
too far behind.''
	   Ferrari has not won a series title since 1979. Lauda, a two-time
champion with Ferrari, says the team needs a radical overhaul.
	   ``In Japan, we saw there is something not right in the team,''
he said. ``I could not say what it is, but it surprises me.''
	   Hakkinen finished with 100 points, 14 more than Schumacher, who
was followed by Coulthard (56), Eddie Irvine and his Ferrari (47),
1997 champion Jacques Villeneuve and his Williams (21) and 1996
champion Damon Hill (20), who after struggling for a season with
Arrows returned the fight with Jordan.
	   McLaren also won the constructor's title, its first since 1991.
	   As for Hakkinen, 1999 could be his year again.
	   ``Winning a championship for the team, it gives you more
confidence,'' he said. ``It makes you feel stronger and it makes
you go faster.''
	   ``It makes you be more relaxed. There's no more pressure in
terms of winning or being a world champion. Now it's done. I think
this gives me a lot of strength.''
	   Well documented was Hakkinen's sideswipe with death on Nov. 10,
1995, in the Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide when he suffered a
near-fatal skull fracture in a high-speed crash.
	   Three months later has was back driving like nothing had
happened.
	   ``As soon as I began to recover, I think the spark inside me to
start racing again was impossible to stop,'' Hakkinen explained.
	   Hakkinen was only have of Finland's year in auto racing.
	   Fellow Finn Tommi Makinen claimed a record third straight world
rally title when rival Carlos Sainz's Toyota engine caught fire
just 300 meters from the finish of November's Network Q Rally,
depriving the Spaniard of the crown.
	   Running in fourth at the time, the Spaniard needed only to cross
the final stage's finish line to claim his third season title.
	   Makinen, who entered the rally with a two-point lead on Sainz,
slid out of the race on the first day when he hit an oil slick and
struck a concrete pillar.
	   The Finn was waiting for a car to go to the airport when he
heard he had won the season title.
	   ``My brother rang from the last stage to tell me what had
happened to Carlos,'' Makinen said. ``I couldn't believe it _ I
told him to stop joking. I thought nothing would happen to Carlos,
and I feel very sorry for him. He was very unlucky.''
	   Someone who was luck AND good was Alessandro Zanardi. The
32-year-old Italian won seven of 19 races and took his second
straight CART Indy-car championship in only his third season on the
American open-wheel circuit.
	   But he disappointed many followers of the west side of the
Atlantic by choosing to return to Formula One in 1999.
	   Driving for Target-Chip Ganassi Racing, Zanardi put away the
championship with four races remaining _ the earliest in series
history. He became only the third repeat champion in CART's 20-year
history, matching Bobby Rahal (1986-87) and Rick Mears (1981-82).
	   Zanardi was rewarded for his title with a ride in Formula One,
returning him to the circuit he left after four seasons in 1994.
	   He will move into Williams' stable along with Ralf Schumacher,
who left Jordan, and replaces another Indy-car alumnus, Canadian
Jacques Villeneuve.
	   Villeneuve jumped the Williams ship with Germany's Heinz-Harald
Frentzen, joining the new British American Racing team as lead
driver along with rookie Ricardo Zonta. Frentzen moved to Jordan to
team with Hill.

Anti-Euro demonstrators target central bank's party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UTRECHT, Netherlands (AP) _ A group of squatters protesting the
introduction of the single European currency attacked a concert
hall where the staff of the Dutch central bank were holding a
Christmas party, pelting the building with eggs and smashing
windows.
	   About 50 squatters attacked the Vredenburg hall in Utrecht, 50
kilometers (31 miles) east of Amsterdam, where 350 staff members
from the Netherlands Bank were partying Monday night.
	   Police called to break up the protest arrested five
demonstrators, Dutch television news reported Tuesday.
	   The single European currency, the euro, will debut on paper on
Jan. 1. Euro coins and notes come into circulation in the 11
participating nations by June 30, 2002.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Fire broke out in a department store
crowded with Christmas shoppers Tuesday after a man poured an
inflammable liquid on the floor, police said. At least two people
were injured.
	   The fire started at 2:12 p.m. (1312 GMT) on the ground floor of
the six-story PUB store, one of Stockholm's largest. An explosion
connected with the fire blew out a display window, injuring a
female passerby.
	   Kristian Dalsgaard, a Stockholm police official suprevising the
investigation, told reporters that the fire was quickly
extinguished by the store's sprinkler system, but that it had been
potentially a ''very dangerous'' situation.
	   ''It's terrible that something like this can happen in a big
department store in the middle of the Christmas rush,'' he said.
	   The center of the store is an open, atrium-like space extending
from the top floor to one floor below street-level and the building
quickly filled with smoke, police said.
	   A man whom security guards saw puring liquid on the floor was
grabbed by security guards and turned over to police. Dalsgaard
said little was immediately known about the suspect.
	   The scene outside the store after the fire was calm, with people
lined up at a bank machine set in one of the building's walls. But
the Swedish news agency TT quoted an unnamed employee as saying
''We panicked and ran in every direction.''
	   The fire started in an aisleway next to a cosmetics boutique and
officials speculated the explosion may have been caused by burning
aerosol cans.
	   The store faces the Hoetorget square, directly across from the
city's main concert hall. Firemen closed off the square, which
includes about 20 covered stalls for vendors of produce and leather
and woolen goods, but allowed it to reopen about two hours later.
	   One of those injured was treated for smoke inhalation. The
condition of the woman cut by the flying glass was not immediately
known.
	   Police allowed journalists into the building breifly, showing
there was little fire damage but apparently substantial water
damage.

 &UR; First woman combat pilot joined Iraqi strikes

<TEXT>
	   ABOARD THE USS ENTERPRISE (AP) _ The first American woman
fighter pilot to see combat action took part in the air strikes on
Iraq.
	   Navy Lt. Kendra Williams, 26, flew her FA-18 fighter-bomber as
part of the attack force launched from the aircraft carrier USS
Enterprise in the Gulf.
	   Williams, who was raised in Anchorage, Alaska, was among the
first group of women allowed to train for fighter duty, military
officials said Tuesday. She graduated from jet training at the
Naval Air Station in Kingsville, Texas, in 1997.
	   ``Women have only been in combat aviation a few years,'' she
said last year. ``It's going to take time for people to adjust.''
	   Women have been flying U.S. military helicopters since 1973. But
they are still excluded from ground combat units.
	   In Israel, six women completed training last month to become the
country's first front-line female combat soldiers.

Companies will spend dlrs 2.3 billion to crack millennium bug
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Airlines will spend an estimated dlrs 2.3 billion
preparing their systems for the Millennium and passengers need have
no fears about computer failure, the International Air Transport
Association said Tuesday.
	   ``Airplanes are not going to crash, of course,'' spokesman Tim
Goodyear said. Airlines are not going to put them in a situation
where they might crash.''
	   The association, which represents most of the world's air
carriers, has launched a project to make sure its members are ready
for the Year 2000, or Y2K, when computer systems which have not
been altered could fail because they only recognize the last two
digits of a year and assume it is 1900.
	   IATA is spending dlrs 20 million carrying out personal visits to
702 airports and 74 air traffic control areas worldwide, while
other work will be carried out directly by the airlines.
	   IATA is monitoring airports around the world to ensure they are
making the necessary changes.
	   No total figure has been established for the cost to the air
transport industry of Y2K compliance. The dlrs 2.3 billion figure
represents the costs to airlines alone.
	   There have been widespread public fears that it might not be
safe to be in the air as the clock ticks to midnight at the turn of
the millennium. But Goodyear said these were unfounded.
	   ``The air transport industry sells itself on safety _ it has to
because it is under public scrutiny.''

Police hunt father who attacked son with ax
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Police in the Dutch capital were
involved in a manhunt Tuesday for a father who hacked at his
7-year-old son's head with an ax, leaving the child fighting for
his life.
	   The boy was taken to a hospital with serious injuries to his
head and neck following Monday's attack. His condition was
described as critical but stable late Tuesday.
	   His father, a 34-year-old man of Turkish origin, is in the
middle of acrimonious divorce proceedings with the child's mother,
Amsterdam police said.
	   The man was visiting his son at a family friend's house. When he
saw the child, he pulled a meat cleaver and ax out from under his
clothing and attacked him.
	   The youngster managed to escape but his father chased him down a
street, caught him and hit him in the head with the ax before
fleeing.

Troubled times for foreign doctors in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo available
 &UR; By ANDREW SELSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ After finishing his rounds,
Dr. Krysztof Zapolski went into an operating theater, put a cloth
soaked in anaesthetic over his face and a plastic bag over his
head. Workers found his body the next day.
	   Some of Zapolski's colleagues believe he committed suicide
because of his difficulties with the government over his work
permit. His wife Tracey insists he accidentally overdosed while
taking anaesthetic to relax from work pressures.
	   Whatever the circumstances, the death of the Polish doctor on
Dec. 8 has highlighted the plight of foreign-qualified physicians,
who share the burden of South Africa's massive health care needs.
	   They now find themselves facing the prospect of being ousted
from the country because of inflexible and murky immigration
procedures and because a first generation of South African
doctor-trainees are entering the workforce.
	   Like hundreds of other foreign doctors, Zapolski had to renew
his work permit every few months.
	   In the days preceding his death, he complained to colleagues
that the Home Affairs office said he had given insufficient reason
why his permit should be renewed, according to Dr. Safdar Malick, a
Pakistani who chairs the Foreign Qualified Doctors Association.
	   ``Chris' death was an expression of helplessness and
frustration, a feeling shared by many doctors,'' said Malick, whose
organization investigated Zapolski's death.
	   Doctors who earned their degrees abroad before emigrating to
South Africa find themselves on shaky ground, just as the nation's
health-care system is being strained beyond its limits.
	   Patients are overwhelming understaffed hospitals. Most South
Africans, 3 million of whom have HIV or AIDS, still lack adequate
access to health care, four years after the end of apartheid, which
deprived non-whites of most services.
	   In order to redress the imbalances and extend health care to
everyone, the government this year began requiring medical school
graduates to perform a year of public service.
	   But instead of the program putting more doctors into the field,
cash-strapped hospitals are firing doctors, many of them
foreign-trained, and filling the positions with the lower-paid
interns.
	   Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital is this month terminating the
contracts of 42 foreign-qualified doctors and putting interns in
their places, said hospital spokeswoman Esther Hlongwane. The same
is occurring in other hospitals.
	   Of the 7,000 foreign-trained doctors in South Africa, 2,300 --
including some naturalized South Africans -- have ``limited
registration,'' meaning they can only work in public hospitals,
with the government dictating what medicine they can practice,
Malick said. Of those, 1,100 lack permanent residency and have
temporary work permits.
	   Last week, the Sowetan newspaper reported that Health Minister
Nkosazana Zuma had told foreign doctors with temporary work permits
that they must leave the country by the end of the year.
	   Zuma's spokesman, Vincent Hlongwane, dismissed the report as
``nonsense.'' Hlongwane, no relation to the hospital spokeswoman,
said he was unaware of plans to expel foreign-trained doctors.
	   Nevertheless, the Foreign Qualified Doctors Association is ready
to go to court to stop any expulsions.
	   Such expulsions might be applauded by some native South
Africans, who believe doctors from countries where the pay is lower
are taking jobs from locals.
	   Dr. Shahid Amin, a Pakistani, argued that there aren't enough
doctors in South Africa, period, regardless of nationality.
	   ``In this country, the ratio of patients to doctors is 2,400 to
one,'' he said. ``In many developed countries it is 1,000 to one.''

Bomb explosion damages Pakistani church, injuring one worshipper

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ A bomb exploded Tuesday just after Mass
in a Roman Catholic church in Pakistan, damaging the building and
slightly wounding one worshipper.
	   The bomb exploded in Saint Patrick's Cathedral in the southern
port of Karachi minutes after the end of Mass, sending 100
worshippers rushing from the front of the church, witnesses said.
	   The injured woman was taken to a private hospital. Her condition
was not known.
	   Police said the explosion damaged the inside of the 120-year-old
church.
	   The timed device, containing 200 grams of explosive material,
was hidden under a bench in the main hall, said the chief of
Karachi's bomb disposal squad, Moinuddin, who uses only one name.
	   No group has claimed responsibility of the attack.
	   Religious minorities in Pakistan often complain of persecution
and attacks by the extremist Muslim religious groups. Dozens of
Christians have died in recent years in attacks by Muslim
extremists.
	   Police beefed-up security at all the churches and Christian
localities in Karachi after the explosion.
	   ``It is a terrorist act ahead of Christmas,'' said Shafique
Paracha, a Karachi civil service commissioner.

Lord Soper, socialist peer and soapbox preacher, dies at 95
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lord Soper, a Methodist minister and Britain's
most famous soapbox orator for more than half a century, died
Tuesday. He was 95.
	   Soper had returned to his London home in the morning from the
hospital where he was being treated for a chest infection and sat
in his favorite chair before dying peacefully, the Methodist Church
said.
	   A lifelong supporter of radical causes, the Rev. Lord Soper had
taken to his outdoor podium almost every week since 1926 _ at
lunchtime Wednesdays on Tower Hill in east London, and at 3 p.m.
Sundays at Speaker's Corner in Hyde Park.
	   Soper thrived on give-and-take with hecklers as he expounded his
Christian beliefs, and spoke out against war, poverty, drink,
gambling, capitalism, communism, slave labor, racial inequality and
capital punishment.
	   He continued preaching into old age.
	   ``I keep going because there are not many opportunities for
personal confrontation anymore. They have all been swallowed up by
public relations,'' he told The Times in 1991.
	   '' The great thing about preaching is consistency,'' he added.
``Don't think I'm painting the holy hero, but people know that
whatever the weather, I'll be there.'
	   At the age of 90, Soper was still campaigning _ as president of
the League Against Cruel Sports.
	   Robert Key, a Conservative legislator, praised Soper lavishly
after being told of his death, and added, ``I may have disagreed
with almost all his politics, but I knew a good man when I saw
one.''
	   Soper was made a life peer in 1965 for his work among the poor
and homeless during a 40-year London ministry.
	   Born Donald Oliver Soper into a Methodist family in south
London, he was educated at Cambridge University and the London
School of Economics, where he obtained his doctorate in philosophy.
	   Shortly before beginning his ministry at the South London
Mission in 1926, Soper was pastor at a chapel in London's East End.
There, he started his weekly open air sermons on Tower Hill after
arriving one lunchtime and asking a man sitting on the wall how to
start a meeting.
	   ``Get up on the wall and clap yer 'ands, guv'nor. They'll
come,'' he was told. He did and soon had a crowd.
	   For more than 65 years, in peace and war, whatever the weather,
he got on the wall every Wednesday to harangue passers-by and
workers for 90 minutes with his drill sergeant's voice and deadly
wit.
	   The weekly sermons became so well-known that when he married his
wife, Marie, in 1929, the crowd at Tower Hill bought him a silver
teapot.
	   Soper began his Speakers' Corner orations in the early 1940s,
attracting large congregtions despite competing for audiences with
political extremists, cynics, cranks and believers of every
religious and non-religious persuasion.
	   On Saturdays, he conducted a service at Pentonville Prison,
where he was chaplain, and on Sunday mornings, he preached to
capacity crowds at Kingsway Hall, a Methodist mission.
	   He was elected president of the Methodist Conference in 1953.
	   From 1974 to 1978, he was chairman of Shelter, a charity for the
homeless. In 1981, the World Methodist Council gave him its peace
award.
	   He is survived by four daughters, nine grandchildren and three
great-grandchildren. His wife, Lady Soper, died in 1994.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Students and teachers infected
with the AIDS virus must be allowed to attend school and keep their
jobs, an education department spokesman said on Tuesday.
	   Though South Africa's constitution already defends such rights,
the government has recently drawn up policy protecting the 3
million South Africans with the HIV virus or AIDS from being
discriminated against in education.
	   ``This is a national policy to protect the rights of individuals
with AIDS,'' Bheki Khumalo said. The policy was set out in the
government gazette last Friday.

Schroeder raps minister over nuclear shutdown

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with Schroeder rebukes his environment
minister. New to some points. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder rebuked his
environment minister Tuesday in a dispute over nuclear energy,
provoking the first sharp clash in the new center-left government.
	   Schroeder accused the minister, Juergen Trittin, of jeopardizing
talks with utility firms on shutting down German nuclear power
plants with his own anti-nuclear campaign.
	   Earlier, Trittin announced he was firing the government's two
advisory panels on nuclear safety and indicated he would install
new members less favorable to nuclear power.
	   Schroeder said Trittin, a member of the environmentalist Greens
party, had not cleared the move with him.
	   ``Everyone is called upon not to substitute self-important
attitudes and the symbolism of party politics for dealing with the
political issues,'' said Schroeder, clearly aiming at Trittin.
	   Schroeder, whose Social Democrats won September elections, has
pledged to put Germany on course to shut down its 19 nuclear
plants.
	   But in an interview published Tuesday, Schroeder rejected
pressure for a fast timetable from the Greens, his junior
government partner.
	   ``Some people's ideas of making it by 2004 are mistaken,'' he
told the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper. ``This will
take significantly longer.''
	   At the same time, he denied reports that he has agreed to give
German utilities at least 20 years to scrap nuclear power.
	   He said he remains committed to seeking a shutdown strategy in
talks with power companies starting next month.
	   German media have reported that the two sides reached an
understanding on a timetable in preliminary talks last week.
	   Schroeder has said he could support 20 years, but one report
said he had agreed to give power companies a longer grace period so
they will renounce damage claims for lost earnings.
	   The power industry last week called for 40 years as the only way
for the government to avoid damage claims, which the industry has
estimated at up to 80 billion marks (dlrs 48 billion).
	   Schroeder insisted there was no accord yet.
	   ``I don't want to pin myself down on the time period,'' he told
the newspaper.

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The father of Goran Ivanisevic and the
head of the Croatian tennis federation have been found guilty of
slandering each other, Croatian media reported Tuesday.
	   A Zagreb district court on Monday sentenced both Srdjan
Ivanisevic and Suad Rizvanbegovic to 30 days in prison or one year
suspended for insulting and slandering the other, Jutarnji list
daily reported.
	   For more than a year, the elder Ivanisevic and Rizvanbegovic
have been engaged in a row over the control of Croatian tennis.
	   The quarrel caused Goran Ivanisevic to stop playing in the Davis
Cup for his country, demanding Rizvanbegovic vacate the his post in
the federation.
	   He even appealed to President Franjo Tudjman _ an avid tennis
player and fan _ to intervene. But Tudjman instead apparently chose
to back Rizvanbegovic, who is often seen in his company.
	   Following the spat, Srdjan Ivanisevic folded the Croatian
Indoors tournament he previously operated.
	   Ivanisevic and Rizvanbegovic both spoke to the press regarding
the quarrel and subsequently sued each other for slander.
	   Rizvanbegovic said he was offended by an interview Ivanisevic
gave to independent Globus weekly in February, in which he accused
Rizvanbegovic of ``buying'' his position with someone else's money
and not being a true Croat.
	   Rizvanbegovic, who also is an executive in the country's biggest
insurance company, said his sentence was ``inappropriate.''
	   Ivanisevic, for his part, sued Rizvanbegovic over the accusation
that Ivanisevic formed a pro-Yugoslav party.
	   Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991,
triggering a six-month war with minority Serbs in the country.

Ukrainian ex-premier denies corruption charges, vows retaliation

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A former Ukrainian prime minister charged
Tuesday that a Swiss money laundering investigation against him was
inspired by Ukrainian leaders who want to neutralize him before
1999 presidential elections.
	   Pavlo Lazarenko said his recent arrest in Switzerland was the
work of Ukrainian prosecutors who persuaded their Swiss colleagues
to investigate and detain him.
	   ``I have not committed a single violation of Swiss law,''
Lazarenko told a news conference.
	   ``But this case revealed the real aim of Ukrainian authorities:
Lazarenko gets arrested in Switzerland and the (Ukrainian)
authorities then say they have nothing to do with the arrest.''
	   Lazarenko was released last week on dlrs 3 million bail from a
jail in Switzerland following his arrest by Swiss police earlier
this month on money laundering charges.
	   Lazarenko, who heads his opposition Hromada party in parliament,
has turned into an adamant opponent of President Leonid Kuchma and
prominent opposition leader since being fired from the prime
minister's post in July 1997.
	   Until his arrest, many had expected Lazarenko to run in the
October 1999 presidential election. If he doesn't, analysts predict
he will channel his reportedly substantial financial resources to
support another candidate opposing Kuchma.
	   Lazarenko would not say Tuesday whether he would run, but said
his party would discuss the issue at a congress this week.
	   Ukraine's chief prosecutor's office has launched an
investigation against Lazarenko, accusing him of siphoning millions
of dollars out of Ukraine illegally, largely through the national
gas distribution market.
	   On Monday, prosecutors asked parliament to revoke Lazarenko's
immunity so he could be arrested and put on trial on charges of
stealing government funds and illegally stashing about dlrs 4
million abroad.
	   Under Ukraine's constitution, a lawmaker can be prosecuted only
if parliament lifts his immunity. It is unclear when parliament
would debate the prosecutor's request.
	   Lazarenko said the request was an attempt to discredit him and
his opposition party before presidential elections.
	   ``The Ukrainian authorities will be destroying Lazarenko until
the end because they are not interested in his presence in Ukraine
during the presidential elections,'' he said.
	   Lazarenko said he was ready to provide evidence of corruption
and money laundering against several senior government officials,
but said he would not give it to Ukrainian prosecutors.
	   ``Unbiased people are needed to prove facts of corruption in
Ukraine,'' Lazarenko said.
	   Lazarenko did not say who he would give the evidence to or when.
	   But he warned: ``Lazarenko is not an angel, and I'm saying that
honestly. The acts (that were employed against me) cannot be
forgiven.''
	   Later Tuesday, Kuchma called Lazarenko's claims ungrounded.
	   ``If (Lazarenko) had anything to say (about corruption), he
would have said it a dozen times,'' Kuchma said, according to the
Interfax news agency.

Angolan rebels strike strategic city
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ UNITA rebels shelled a key central
highland city Tuesday, striking for the first time since launching
an offensive two weeks ago to break the government's grip on the
area.
	   Several people, apparently civilians, were killed and others
were wounded during the morning attack on Kuito, about 500
kilometers (300 miles) southeast of the capital, Luanda, according
to the private Radio Eclesia.
	   Rebel artillery shells landed near the palace of the provincial
governor in the center of Kuito, the radio said.
	   A building where several displaced people had taken shelter, and
a missionary school were also hit by mortar fire.
	   Kuito's population has risen to some 160,000 from 100,000 with
the arrival of thousands of displaced people fleeing the fighting
between UNITA and the government that began earlier this month
throughout the central highlands.
	   Kuito, the capital of the province of Bie lying on a vast plain,
has been the most embattled spot.
	   The government launched an attack earlier this month aiming to
gain control of UNITA's central highland strongholds Andulo, also
in Bie, and Bailundo, in the neighboring Huambo province.
	   The rebels were able to secure the bases and then launched an
offensive throughout the central zones, especially in the provinces
of Huambo, Bie and Malange.
	   A UNITA spokesman in Lisbon, Portugal, said UNITA was targeting
government positions in Kuito because the army's attack on the
Andulo had started from there.
	   ``Once Kuito is neutralized, the rest (of Bie province) will be
secured,'' said Carlos Morgado, adding that Kuito was the last town
in Bie under the government's hold.
	   During the two-week-old offensive, the rebels have targeted
Cunji, a village seven kilometers (four miles) away that overlooks
Kuito. They also have kept Kuito's airport under siege to choke the
government's air supply line.
	   UNITA reportedly has three well-equipped regiments totaling
about 9,000 men entrenched in a diameter of 18 kilometers (11
miles) around Kuito. The government is said to have a 10,000-strong
battalion holed up in the city.
	   A defense analyst for the London-based International Institute
for Strategic Studies said the Angolan government might pull out of
other spots to defend Kuito.
	   ``From a political and logical point of view, it would be a very
important blow'' for the government to lose the provincial capital,
Terry Taylor said by phone.
	   The government has held Kuito since 1994, following heavy
battles with rebel forces which began when UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi rejected his defeat in the country's first elections and
returned to war, breaking a 1991 peace agreement.
	   ``It might make (the government) think seriously about their
deployment in the Republic of Congo,'' Terry Taylor said by phone.
	   The Angolan army has about 400 troops in the Republic of Congo
to support President Denis Sassou-Nguesso against insurgent
outlawed militia groups.
	   The government, along with Zimbabwe and Namibia, is also
supporting Congo's President Laurent Kabila against insurgents who
are backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   Angola has withdrawn at least one battalion from Congo following
the upsurge of fighting against UNITA rebels.
	   UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
_ on Monday accused Namibia and Zimbabwe of sending troops to
support President Jose Eduardo dos Santos in the renewed fighting.
	   Angolan Defense Ministry officials on Tuesday denied the claims.
	   UNITA and the government fought a two-decade civil war following
the country's 1975 independence from Portugal. A 1994 U.N.-brokered
peace agreement unraveled this year amid continuing hostilities
between both sides, which have evolved into full-scale war.

Croatian, Bosnian officials open bridge linking Croatia and Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY DARKO LABOR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatian president Franjo Tudjman and
members of the Bosnian presidency ceremonially opened on Tuesday a
newly built bridge on the River Sava, the natural border between
the two countries.
	   The 790-meter (2600-feet) long bridge, linking Zupanja in
eastern Croatia, and Orasje in northeastern Bosnia, provides Bosnia
with a vital northern link to Croatia, and further on to Europe.
	   The new bridge was a joint venture between Bosnian and Croatian
companies, who worked on it for 18 months. The World Bank provided
the dlrs 6.5 million loan, which two countries will repay together.
	   Shelling by Serb rebels destroyed the previous bridge. Its
replacement now connects Croatia with the Muslim-Croat federation
in Bosnia, with the Serb republic just (kilometers) miles away.
	   Speaking at the opening Tudjman said the new bridge symbolizes
the beginning of the ``peacetime era, which paves the way for
progress and peaceful coexistence'' of all three ethnic groups in
Bosnia.
	   ``The reality is such that Croats, Muslims and Serbs live in
this area and they should find solutions to live together and avoid
conflicts,'' state-run HINA news agency quoted Tudjman as saying.
	   Tudjman has been widely accused of seeking to annex
Croat-controlled parts of Bosnia to Croatia proper. Although he
publicly supports the 1995 Dayton peace accord, which envisaged the
Bosnian state within its pre-war borders, many suspect that his
intentions in fact remain unchanged.
	   On Tuesday, he pointed out that the bridge ``connects two parts
of the same nation,'' referring evidently to Bosnian Croats, who
make the majority in the Orasje area.

Russian Communists plan to give quick approval to budget

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament is likely to give the 1999
draft budget preliminary approval Thursday, lawmakers said Tuesday
_ but final passage could still stall over squabbles during later
debates.
	   Russia desperately needs an austere, realistic budget for
resolving the economic crisis. The lower house of parliament, the
State Duma, is to begin discussing the draft budget Thursday.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov _ whose parliamentary faction
has formed the main resistance to passage of the government's
budgets in recent years _ said Tuesday that while he wasn't
entirely pleased with the draft budget, his party would probably
give it initial approval.
	   ``We have a difficult choice between bad and very bad because
the present government has inherited from its predecessors only
debts and troubles, but no resources,'' Zyuganov told Russian news
agencies.
	   Communists are the largest group in parliament, and they have
made the passage of past years' budgets stretch into months of
rancorous debate. The budgets are generally passed months into the
new year.
	   But Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's new Cabinet was formed as
a compromise with the Communist opposition, and includes several
communists. Because of that, many observers say Zyuganov may
abandon his political grandstanding and opposition to the
government.
	   ``The budget, it appears, should be passed on the first
reading,'' Zyuganov said.
	   Other factions also said they would support the budget during
the first reading.
	   However, the first reading has traditionally been the easiest
hurdle to clear. The draft would then need to go through three more
approvals.
	   Major delays usually begin during the second reading, when
lawmakers start to debate details of the distribution of budget
funds.
	   ``Delays with (the budget's) approval, development of all sorts
of lobbyist processes in the Duma ... would not make the budget
better, but would make it less and less realistic,'' President
Boris Yeltsin's economic adviser Alexander Voloshin warned Tuesday.
	   The Communists are calling for more state spending to help
impoverished Russians and ailing industries. Zyuganov also said he
wanted to see more money for the military, education and culture.
	   But because of the economic crisis, the government has even less
money to spend on these areas than in the past.
	   For example, the draft budget envisages an increase of 80
billion rubles (dlrs 3.9 billion), or 22 percent, compared to last
year in spending for science and support to impoverished people,
Voloshin said.
	   However, the budget also forecasts 30 percent inflation, so the
ostensible increase will actually result in less money for those
areas, Voloshin conceded.
	   Russia's markets crumbled this summer, succumbing to global
financial uncertainty, and the country is now facing its worst
economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse.

Fire hits department store during Christmas rush

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Fire broke out in a Swedish department
store crowded with Christmas shoppers Tuesday after a man poured a
flammable liquid on the floor, police said. At least two people
were injured.
	   The afternoon fire started on the ground floor of the six-story
PUB store, one of Stockholm's largest. The blaze set off an
explosion that blew out a display window, injuring a female
passerby.
	   Christian Dalsgaard, the police official supervising the
inquiry, said the fire was quickly extinguished by the store's
sprinkler system, but the situation could have been ``very
dangerous.''
	   ``It's terrible that something like this can happen in a big
department store in the middle of the Christmas rush,'' he said.
	   The center of the store is an open, atrium-like space extending
from the top floor to one floor below street level, and the
building quickly filled with smoke, police said.
	   A man who was seen pouring liquid on the floor was grabbed by
security guards and turned over to police.
	   The suspect was drunk and could not be interrogated until he
sobered up, the Swedish news agency TT quoted police spokesman Mats
Nylen as saying.
	   The fire started in an aisle next to a cosmetics boutique.
Officials speculated the explosion may have been caused by burning
aerosol cans.
	   One of those injured was treated for smoke inhalation. The
condition of the woman cut by the flying glass was not immediately
known.
	   Police allowed journalists into the store briefly. There was
little fire damage but substantial water damage.

Woody Allen says Clinton is being persecuted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Film director Woody Allen on Tuesday said that the
scandal involving President Bill Clinton was silly and had made a
``laughingstock'' of the United States.
	   ``We have a good president who is being persecuted by the
extreme right for having an affair with a consenting adult. Which
by the way, his wife seems to accept,'' Allen said.
	   ``It's made the United States the laughingstock of the world and
our political atmosphere entertaining, silly and sad,'' he added,
red-eyed and sniffling with a cold during a news conference for the
French release of his film ``Celebrity,'' a comedy about America's
appetite for fame.
	   Hugely popular in France, where each of his films is a box
office hit, Allen has had his own share of sex scandals.
	   Revelations about his relationship with Soon Yi Previn, the
adopted daughter of his former companion Mia Farrow and conductor
Andre Previn, whipped up a media frenzy.
	   He married Previn in Paris a year ago.
	   ``Celebrity'' is shot mainly in Manhattan and features British
actor Kenneth Branagh as the typical Allen character: a frustrated
but sympathetic hypochondriac who has split with his wife, played
by Judy Davis, making her fourth appearance in an Allen film.
	   The Brooklyn-born director describes this 27th film as being
about ``overwhelming celebrity run amok.''
	   ``In the United States, everyone has their own television show:
lawyers, doctors, plastic surgeons ... Soon there won't be any
audience,'' he added.
	   He chose not to play Branagh's character because ``I'm too old
and I wouldn't have given it the same richness and complexity.''
	   ``I wanted someone who could capture the Manhattan nervous,
anxious tension I usually write about,'' he said.
	   Despite the thrashing he gives to America's insatiable craze for
creating superstars, Allen acknowledged the perks of fame.
	   ``There are problems, but they're minor. You have no private
life, journalists write about you and it's not always true, you're
followed around by paparazzi. But they're not life-threatening.
	   ``I won't lie to you ... Your salary is disproportionately high,
you can always get restaurant reservations and theater tickets,
doctors will come to your house on weekends and when a policeman
stops you for speeding, he asks for your autograph,'' he explained.
	   Allen's next film is about a jazz musician in the 1930s.
Starring Sean Penn and Uma Thurman, it is based on a script he
wrote some 20 years ago.

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina's Supreme Court has
freed an Iranian woman detained in connection with the bombings of
the Israeli embassy and a Jewish community center here.
	   Lawyers for Nasrim Mokhtari, 43, said she had been released late
Monday for ``lack of evidence,'' but was ordered to remain in the
country while investigators continue their work.
	   Mokhtari was picked up Dec. 2 at the Buenos Aires international
airport after a flight from Paris.
	   Local reports said she was questioned nine times by
investigators and repeatedly denied charges linking her to the 1992
Israeli embassy bombing and the 1994 attack on the community
center.
	   U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies suspect have attributed
the bombings to Iranian-supported terrorist groups. The attacks
claimed a total of 114 lives.
	   Investigators arrested Mokhtari after hearing the testimony of a
Brazilian, Wilson dos Santos, who was arrested last month in
Brazil. He reportedly told authorities he knew of the plans for
both bombings through Mokhtari, who he claimed had terrorist links.
	   Dos Santos has said he alerted Argentine diplomatic officials in
1994 of an imminent bombing but claimed officials didn't take him
seriously.

Italian government, union and employers reach agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Italian government, unions and employers on
Tuesday reached preliminary agreement on an arrangement aimed at
keeping down labor costs in hopes of stimulating job creation.
	   By eliminating some of the tax contributions employers must now
make for each employee, the new accord will reduce the cost of
labor and, it is hoped, generate investment aimed at fighting
unemployment, which runs about 12.5 nationally and roughly double
that in parts of the south.
	   While the pact does not include figures, the head of the Italian
industrialists' group Confindustria, Giorgio Fossa, said the aim is
to shave the cost of labor by around 1.2 percent by the year 2003.
	   In the previous, 1993 accord, wage increases were linked to
government inflation targets and not to real inflation.
Confindustria note the latest accord would take into account
Europe-wide inflation.
	   By helping to fight inflation and reduce labor disputes, the
1993 back was important to Italy's qualification for European
economic and monetary union.
	   As an additional stimulus to investment, the new pact calls for
tax reductions on company profits which are reinvested in machinery
and equipment.
	   Italian Labor Minister Antonio Bassolino said final approval of
the pact should take place by the end of January, once it has been
examined by the parliament and the membership of both union and
employer organizations.
	   Italian Communist leaders criticized aspects of the pact,
contending that workers would lose bargaining power.
	   Effectiveness of pact will also be assessed twice a year.
	   As in the 1993 accord, wages will be negotiated every four
years.
	   The government pledged to provide the equivalent of nearly 1
billion dollars' worth of job training over the next three years.

Cellular phones more common than household lines in Finland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finns have indulged their famed
infatuation with technology so deeply that there are now more
cellular phones than regular telephone subscriptions in the
country, according to government figures released Tuesday.
	   The Ministry of Transport and Communications said 56 out every
100 people in the country own cellular phones, and more are buying
every day. An estimated 60,000 new subscribers come every month,
the ministry said.
	   ``In 1997, we made a cautious prediction to cross 50 percent
coverage by the year 2000 - but it happened in August this year.
The growth has been incredibly strong,'' said Mikael Akermarck, a
researcher at the ministry.
	   The ministry now predicts that 60 out of 100 will have cellular
phones by next spring.
	   The growth in fixed phone line subscriptions has leveled off
completely and many households now own several mobile phones, he
added.
	   Mobile phone maker Nokia, which claims to be the world's
largest, is based in Finland.

Ukraine cancels late fines to encourage tax payments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma has
signed a decree canceling late tax fines for companies that pay all
their 1998 taxes by next February, a news report said Tuesday.
	   The decree, signed Monday, was the latest in a series of
measures Ukraine's cash-strapped government has taken to improve
its chronically poor tax collection.
	   The decree will become effective in a month unless parliament
revokes it, the independent Ukrainian News agency said. Lawmakers
are unlikely to oppose the decree.
	   The nationwide tax debt in Ukraine skyrocketed this year from
January's 2.3 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.09 billion at the time) to
10.2 billion hryvna (dlrs 3 billion) as of Dec. 1, with most
companies trying to escape the suffocating tax burden by declaring
lower incomes, putting off tax payments _ or by not paying taxes at
all.
	   Economic reforms in Ukraine have proceeded slowly since it
gained independence with the 1991 Soviet collapse. The government
has failed to stop the continuing economic decline, which has left
most enterprises loss-making and unable to pay their bills _ or
taxes.

One time favorite Faldo among the outsiders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Barely three years ago before Tiger Woods made his
phenomenal impact on the game, Nick Faldo was the bookmakers
favorite to win any of the Majors.
	   After the worst slump of his spectacular career, he's now quoted
at 40-1 to win the Masters, the British Open or the PGA and 50-1
for the US Open.
	   And this is the man who has won three Masters and three British
Opens. The odds on Colin Montgomerie, who has never won a Major,
are half the odds on Faldo.
	   ``Three years ago Faldo was the automatic favorite to win any
tournament, including any of the majors,'' said Andy Clifton,
spokesman for bookmakers Ladbrokes.
	   ``Even for the Open of '97 we quoted him as 16-1. At this year's
event he was 80-1. That's how bad he was in the first half of the
year.''
	   Yet Faldo ended 1998 with a title when he partnered David Carter
to victory for England at the World Cup in New Zealand.
	   ``A win is a win,'' Clifton said. ``But the conditions were very
British Open type weather with strong winds. And it was not exactly
a world class field.
	   ``We are yet to be convinced. We are yet to see him perform well
in a big tournament with plenty of pressure on.
	   ``He wants to play in three or four of the new World Tour events
and that means being in the top 64 in the world. He's just about on
the bubble and needs to come out firing on all cylinders in the
first half of the year to make sure on in them,'' Clifton said.
	   ``He's swinging the ball OK but he can't get the putts when it
really matters and that just affects his confidence.''
	   Ladbrokes quotes Woods as clear favorite to win any of the
Majors.
	   He's 5-1 for the Masters (next best David Duval at 14-1), 8-1
fpor the British Open (Lee Westwood at 14-1), 9-1 for the US Open
(14-1 Ernie Els) and 9-1 for the PGA (Duval, Els and Westwood all
at 16-1)

Opposition leader: a scrappier approach by Netanyahu's challenger

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ By all accounts, he's facing an uphill battle:
a campaign to unseat the incumbent prime minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, a media-savvy politician with a talent for selling
himself.
	   So opposition leader Ehud Barak is fighting back _ with the help
of some high-priced American spin doctors. Under their tutelage,
his campaign debut is marked by a scrappier style.
	   When Netanyahu came out swinging, mocking the ``fantasies and
ambitions'' of his political rivals, Barak jabbed back with
ridicule of what he calls ``Orwellian Bibi-speak.''
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, Barak indicated the
issues in Israel's upcoming election would be less about
Israeli-Arab relations and more about the economy and the character
of Netanyahu, known by his nickname ``Bibi.''
	   Barak attacked Netanyahu for giving away too much tax money to
ultra-Orthodox religious parties and Jewish settlers in the West
Bank. He also accused Netanyahu of trying to please everyone,
deriding what he called ``Orwellian Bibi-speak in which you can
hear whatever you want.''
	   ``If peace could be achieved through the (television) screen,
and terror could be defeated through spin, then we have an ideal
prime minister,'' said Barak.
	   Critics accuse Barak of being a lackluster Labor Party leader
who has adopted a me-too approach to the Israel-Palestinian issue
in order to win-over the security-minded voters of the
center-right. Asked if his policies were like Netanyahu's, Barak
said:
	   ``Oh, come on. Whoever wants an extra quarter-million
unemployed, please vote Bibi. Whoever wants paralysis and impasses
please vote Bibi. Whoever wants a government hostage to extremists,
vote Bibi.''
	   By ``extremists'' Barak said he meant ultra-Orthodox factions
and Jewish settlers, who had milked precious resources from
Netanyahu's government and left school classrooms overcrowded and
health services strained as a result.
	   ``The way to get rid of this kind of leverage is to create a a
wide government backed by a big enough fraction of the public that
will enable us to do it,'' he said.
	   ``I respect tradition. I respect religious people. I'm against
arm-twisting in the political arena.''
	   In the interview, Barak defined himself as a ``man of action,''
which is well supported by his resume but not obvious from his
short stature, paunch and seeming shyness.
	   As a paratroop commando in April 1973, he pulled a blond wig
over his black, curly hair and applied lipstick and mascara. His
mission: a commando raid in downtown Beirut to assassinate three
PLO leaders.
	   In May 1972, Barak led a team of 16 commandos, including
Netanyahu, who disguised themselves as airline technicians and
stormed a hijacked Sabena plane, killing two Palestinian hijackers
and capturing two others.
	   To spruce up his image, Barak hired some high-profile American
experts including James Carville, who helped Bill Clinton get to
the White House. The result is a more combative, less intellectual
challenger who says he will win by ``being myself.''
	   In the latest polls, Barak and Netanyahu were nearly even with a
strong showing by Amnon Lipkin Shahak, a former chief of staff who
has yet to announce his candidacy but is expected to head a
centrist party.
	   In a radio interview Tuesday, Netanyahu shrugged off his
challengers:
	   ``The fantasies and ambitions of all those who want to be prime
minister _ please. We will allow the voters to decide who needs to
lead the state.''
	   In the AP interview, Barak skirted questions about what he would
do if Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat declared a state on May 4,
1999, as he has threatened to do if there is no final status
agreement.
	   Netanyahu, who opposes an independent Palestinian state, has
vowed to annex West Bank land around Jewish settlements and in
areas needed for security.
	   Barak said it would be a mistake for Arafat to declare a state
without negotiating security arrangements. But, unlike Netanyahu,
the Labor leader said he would not quibble about the name.
	   ``It's up to them. I'm not going to patronize them,'' he said.
``They have their right to determine the name they call themselves
as long as they fully comply with the mutually agreed terms of
security.''
	   His terms, Barak said, were that Israel would not agree to a
Palestinian army, a division of Jerusalem or a return to the 1967
borders that existed when Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza
Strip in the Six-Day War.
	   Jewish settlements, which now number more than 140 with 150,000
residents, should be clustered into blocs that remain under
Israel's control, but he would not demand ``every isolated
settlement.''

Ukraine's government to print money to pay off wage debts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's government will print money next
year to cover its mounting wage arrears, Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko said Tuesday.
	   Pustovoitenko said the Cabinet plans a monetary emission of 1
billion hryvna (dlrs 292 million), all of which would be used to
pay off overdue wages and pensions, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Printing money generally stokes inflation. Pustovoitenko did not
say how he expected next year's money emissions to affect the 1999
inflation rate, which was earlier forecast at 19 percent.
	   Ukraine's government owes more than 2 billion hryvna (dlrs 584
million) to pensioners and about 1 billion hryvna (dlrs 292
million) in unpaid wages to state employees.
	   The debt has been rising for years as the government,
chronically short of revenues, kept delaying social security
payments to pay off its other debts, including those to foreign
creditors.
	   Ukraine has to pay off about dlrs 2 billion on its foreign debt
obligations next year, while its reserves amount to only half that
amount. The cash shortage has forced government officials to
propose printing money.
	   The Cabinet also has said recently that it would use proceeds
from upcoming privatization of the former Soviet republic's
telecommunications monopoly to pay off wage and pension debts.

Iranian court rejects appeal of former mayor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian court has rejected an appeal by
the former mayor of Tehran who was sentenced to five years in jail
for corruption.
	   Gholamhossein Karbaschi's appeal was reviewed by three judges,
and the ``charges and the cases of conviction remain the same,''
Iran's official news agency reported Tuesday. It quoted judiciary
spokesman Fotovat Nasiri-Savadkouhi.
	   The Islamic Republic News Agency did not say when the ruling was
made.
	   Karbaschi was sentenced in July and had been allowed to remain
free on bail pending appeal. IRNA did not say if he had now been
jailed, and judiciary officials could not be reached for comment.
	   Karbaschi, an ally of moderate President Mohammad Khatami, was a
target of hard-line political rivals, and many Iranians saw the
trial as a political settling of scores.
	   He was found guilty of embezzlement during his eight years as
Tehran's mayor. He was sentenced to three years in prison for
embezzlement and two years for misappropriation of government
money.
	   He was also ordered to pay dlrs 500,000 in fines and
compensation to the city and banned from holding any government job
for 20 years.
	   During his trial, Karbaschi admitted to making mistakes, but
denied stealing public money.
	   As mayor, Karbaschi built parks and social centers and reduced
pollution and traffic congestion. But he also made enemies among
the merchant class, which resented his taxes and his support for
Khatami.

Jewish group criticizes Germany on Nazi pensions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ A Jewish group criticized a German court
Tuesday for granting World War II veterans' disability benefits to
two former Nazi SS members.
	   The Simon Wiesenthal Center said the verdict seems to contradict
an amendment passed last year by parliament that allows courts to
strip veterans of disability rights if they ``violated the
principles of humanity or the law'' during the Third Reich.
	   ``It was our understanding that any person who served in the SS
or in others units which carried out crimes against civilians fell
under that category,'' Efraim Zuroff, the center's director for
Israel, said in a statement.
	   The Federal Social Court in Kassel last week overturned lower
court rulings that had denied benefits to two Latvians who served
in the elite Waffen SS during World War II.
	   The court said membership in the Waffen SS by itself was not a
valid reason for Germany to strip a World War II veteran of
benefits. It sent the case back to a lower court.
	   A court spokeswoman refused to give details of the case,
including the men's identities.

Former king returns home for Christmas, New Year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria's former king arrived Tuesday to
celebrate Christmas and New Year in his homeland for the first time
in 52 years of living abroad.
	   Simeon II was accompanied by his wife, Queen Margarita, and one
of their five children, Kalina. They will spend the holidays at the
Czarska Bistritsa palace, in the alpine Rila Mountain, some 60
kilometers (40 miles) south of Sofia.
	   Meeting reporters and a few supporters at the Sofia airport,
Simeon said his feeling of being back home ``was beyond
description'' and wished that ``1999 be better for all
Bulgarians.''
	   The small palace is part of the real estate Simeon is to reclaim
after a high court earlier this year reversed the communist
nationalization of two palaces, three hunting villas and three
country houses owned by his ancestors. All places have served as
government mansions so far. Simeon is expected to visit them during
his stay, scheduled to end Jan. 7.
	   Simeon will still have to pay for staying in Czarska Bistritsa
until legal procedures returning the palace are completed and he
pays due taxes, the minister of public administration, Mario
Tagarinski, told the state news agency BTA.
	   Bulgarian media have reported that Simeon intends to donate some
of his property for public use.
	   Simeon, now a businessman living in Madrid, Spain, was welcomed
by enthusiastic crowds during two visits here in previous years.
	   He acceded to the throne at the age of 6 in 1943, when his
father, Boris III, died shortly after allying Bulgaria with Nazi
Germany. Simeon reigned under regencies until 1946, when the
communists, installed by the Soviet army in 1944, abolished the
monarchy in a referendum widely suspected of being rigged.

US general visits troops in Bosnia

	   TUZLA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ America's top soldier paid a
pre-Christmas visit to U.S. troops based in the northern Bosnian
town of Tuzla on Tuesday and praised them for doing a ``superb
job.''
	   U.S. Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
visited the some 6,900 American soldiers taking part in the
32,000-strong, NATO-led peacekeeping mission ``that is making a
real difference in the lives of the people of Bosnia,'' Shelton
told reporters.
	   Shelton said it was a pleasure to get away from Washington for a
while and to be back among soldiers, airmen, sailors and Marines,
particularly at this time of year.
	   ``With the holiday season upon us, I wanted to briefly visit our
troops here in Bosnia and thank them for the great job they are
doing,'' he said.
	   Although the joint U.S. and British action in the Persian Gulf
was in focus lately, Shelton reminded the troops that ``keeping
Saddam Hussein in his box'' was just one of America's current
military missions.
	   He also praised the U.S. military involvement in Bosnia and said
the troops will continue performing their ``magnificent job'' here,
including continuing to arrest war-crimes suspects as the
opportunities occur.
	   ``America appreciates your sacrifice and your dedication,''
Shelton told the troops.

Remains of all Swissair 111 victims identified, 16 weeks after

crash &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Sixteen weeks after the crash of Swissair Flight
111 shattered the bodies of those on board, police said Tuesday
that remains of all 229 victims have been identified thanks to
state-of-the-art DNA techniques.
	   Police also said more than dlrs 1 million in U.S. currency has
been recovered from the wreckage on the ocean floor off Nova
Scotia. Still missing is a shipment of diamonds.
	   The impact of the Sept. 2 crash was so great that traditional
identification methods, including the use of dental and X-ray
records, were of minimal use in identifying the fragmented remains
retrieved from the Atlantic.
	   Blood samples were collected from relatives of those on board,
and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police coordinated an intensive
operation at several forensic laboratories around Canada to match
the samples with recovered remains.
	   RCMP officers, at a news briefing Tuesday in Halifax, Nova
Scotia, said DNA techniques had never before been used to such an
extent in the aftermath of an air disaster. They said recent
technological advances enabled them to complete tasks in days that
might previously have taken weeks.
	   The RCMP recommended that airlines henceforth keep fingerprint
and DNA records of their crew members to make identifications
easier.
	   About 85 percent of the wreckage of the MD-11 jumbo jet has been
recovered from the seabed, and a scallop dragger is being used in
an effort to scoop up the rest.
	   Investigators, who will take a 10-day holiday break starting
Wednesday, still don't know what caused the crash, but their
efforts are focused on determining the source of a fire in the
front of the jet. There is evidence of heat damage inside and just
outside the cockpit, where the two pilots reported smoke about 16
minutes before the plane crashed en route from New York to Geneva.
	   Vic Gerden, chief investigator for the Transportation Safety
Board of Canada, said small pieces of aluminum from the front of
the plane got so hot they melted moments before the crash.
	   Temperatures in some areas hit at least 1200F (650C), the point
at which that type of aluminum melts, Gerden said. But
investigators still don't know where the fire started.
	   Investigators have been examining hundreds of segments of
electrical wire from the front of the jet for signs of heat damage.
In all, more than 1 million pieces of wreckage have been recovered.
	   Investigators are trying to reconstruct the forward section of
the fuselage, but the process is complicated because many of the
pieces are small and were damaged by the crash.
	   ``It is a pretty challenging puzzle,'' Gerden said.

Vatican keeps up criticism of U.S.-British airstrikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VICTOR L. SIMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The Vatican is keeping up its criticism of
the U.S.-British airstrikes, with its newspaper suggesting Tuesday
that the attacks caused large numbers of civilian casualties.
	   ``The macabre dance around the figures of the real number of
victims,'' said L'Osservatore Romano, is ``yet another offense to
the Iraqi population and the entire family of nations.''
	   ``Hundreds of missiles launched on a city like Baghdad cannot
but have devastated home and stores, causing death, blood and
misery,'' the daily Italian-language newspaper said in a front-page
commentary.
	   Pope John Paul II opposed the 1991 Gulf War, and in the years
since has called for an easing of the sanctions against Iraq.
	   John Paul is generally opposed to the use of sanctions and
embargoes on grounds the measures most harm the weakest in society.
Taking that line, he spoke out against the U.S. economic embargo of
Cuba during a pilgrimage to Havana in January.
	   The Vatican has been especially blunt in its criticism following
the recent airstrikes. It called the attacks ``aggression'' and
said the pope was ``saddened'' that diplomatic efforts broke down.
	   The issue could end up dominating John Paul's scheduled meeting
with President Clinton in St. Louis, Missouri, Jan. 26. The pope is
making a two-day stop in the American city following a visit to
Mexico City and the president and pope are to hold talks in an Air
National Guard hangar at Lambert airport.
	   The criticism has come from the highest officials at the
Vatican.
	   The secretary of state, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, questioned the
``selective'' application of U.N. resolutions. Italian media took
that as a reference to the international community's failure to
demand that Israel meet all resolutions while insisting Iraq do so.
	   Asked by reporters if the airstrikes constituted aggression, the
cardinal replied:
	   ``Either it's a war of defense or a war of aggression. There's
no middle ground.''
	   Sodano, the Vatican's No. 2 official, also reiterated the pope's
desire to visit Iraq to stop at Abraham's Biblical birthplace
during a possible tour of holy sites in the Middle East in 2000.

Fighting sparks humanitarian crisis in Republic of Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ Recent fighting in the
Republic of Congo has put tens of thousands of homeless refugees at
risk of hunger and disease, United Nations aid officials said
Tuesday.
	   The U.N. World Food Program said in a statement received here
that at least 20,000 refugees had poured into the capital of
Brazzaville while many others had fled south to neighboring Congo,
the former Zaire.
	   Many of the refugees are without food, money or personal
possessions. The threat of contagious disease spread by the flood
of civilians has overwhelmed Republic of Congo's shattered health
system.
	   ``Many people who made the long and arduous trek to Brazzaville
just a few days ago are once again running for their lives,'' said
Rigobert Oura, a WFP official in Brazzaville. ``If people continue
to move, it will be extremely difficult for aid agencies to reach
them.''
	   Although the U.N. agency had a stock of 3,000 tons of food in
both Congos, aid officials were concerned of the possibility of a
large scale emergency that would require massive support from the
international community.
	   After weekend clashes between government forces and a rebel
militia, relative calm was restored Monday to the Republic of
Congo's already-battered capital of Brazzaville.
	   Thousands of people fled from the city's southern outskirts to
avoid fighting that left as many as 110 people dead. Although the
hostilities tapered off by Sunday and the area remained quiet
Monday, few people ventured home.
	   The fighting has pitted the forces of President Denis
Sassou-Nguesso with the outlawed ``Ninja'' militia of former Prime
Minister Bernard Kolelas.
	   The hostilities are a reversal of the civil war which ravaged
Brazzaville a year ago when Sassou-Nguesso, backed by his ``Cobra''
militia, took power from his predecessor Pascal Lissouba, a
sometime ally of Kolelas.
	   Sassou-Nguesso, the Republic of Congo's longtime Marxist
dictator now advocating capitalist reform, was ousted in the
country's first multi-party elections in 1992.
	   Neighboring Congo is also grappling with a rebellion that has
drawn in up to six other African countries.

Lord Soper, socialist peer and soapbox preacher, dies at 95

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from prime minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lord Soper, a Methodist minister and Britain's
most famous soapbox orator for more than half a century, died
Tuesday. He was 95.
	   Soper had returned to his London home in the morning from the
hospital where he was being treated for a chest infection and sat
in his favorite chair before dying peacefully, the Methodist Church
said.
	   A lifelong supporter of radical causes, the Rev. Lord Soper had
taken to his outdoor podium almost every week since 1926 _ at
lunchtime Wednesdays on Tower Hill in east London, and at 3 p.m.
Sundays at Speaker's Corner in Hyde Park.
	   Soper thrived on give-and-take with hecklers as he expounded his
Christian beliefs, and spoke out against war, poverty, drink,
gambling, capitalism, communism, slave labor, racial inequality and
capital punishment.
	   He continued preaching into old age.
	   ``I keep going because there are not many opportunities for
personal confrontation anymore. They have all been swallowed up by
public relations,'' he told The Times in 1991.
	   '' The great thing about preaching is consistency,'' he added.
``Don't think I'm painting the holy hero, but people know that
whatever the weather, I'll be there.'
	   At the age of 90, Soper was still campaigning _ as president of
the League Against Cruel Sports.
	   Robert Key, a Conservative legislator, praised Soper lavishly
after being told of his death, and added, ``I may have disagreed
with almost all his politics, but I knew a good man when I saw
one.''
	   Said Prime Minister Tony Blair: ``He will be remembered for his
formidable oratory, his sincere beliefs as a Christian socialist
and his powerful contributions to the national debate.''

Bomb threats add to scare at German railways

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 3-4 with investigation of 13 youths in rail
attacks &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE BOEHMER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Amid jitters about a blackmail attempt
against the German railway, police arrested a man Tuesday for
threatening to blow up a train station.
	   The 44-year-old unemployed man was nabbed shortly after calling
the city fire department saying he would blow up the station in
Fulda, 90 kilometers northeast (55 miles) northeast of Frankfurt.
No bomb was found.
	   Border police said later Tuesday they were investigating 13
youths between the ages of 13 and 17, after three of the group were
caught blocking the rail line between Dessau and Bitterfeld in
eastern Germany and implicated the others in previous attacks.
	   The group is suspected of laying wooden planks and a steel door
on the line in five separate cases. The steel door damaged a
locomotive, police said.
	   Authorities said there was no apparent link to a series of
attacks on rail lines this month linked to extortionists. The
sabotage has prompted overflights by air force reconnaissance
planes equipped with high-performance cameras. Helicopters and 400
border police and are also patrolling rail lines.
	   With Deutsche Bahn railways and travelers alike unsettled,
officials revaled more measures to protect trains Tuesday.
	   Rudi Schaefer, head of the rail workers' union, said on ARD
television that federal border police with night vision equipment
are accompanying trains after dark to help detect any sabotage.
	   Manfred Schell, chairman of the railway engineers union, said
empty trains were being sent out to check main lines before dawn
before the day's passengers traffic starts.
	   The checks center on the northeast of the country, where recent
sabotage has taken place.
	   Federal criminal investigators on Tuesday linked three attacks
to extortionists who the national railways say have demanded 10
million marks (dlrs 6 million) in several ransom letters.
	   In the most serious incident, a cargo train carrying paper rolls
derailed Friday near Anklam, 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of
Berlin, after someone loosened bolts holding down the tracks. No
one was hurt.
	   Bild newspaper reported the special tools used were believed
stolen from the railway in Brandenburg, but officials declined to
confirm that.
	   Also linked to the blackmailers was a similar attack that forced
a high-speed ICE train enroute from Hannover to Berlin into an
emergency stop on Dec. 8.
	   Transport Minister Franz Muentefering has said the government
will spare no ``personnel, energy, money or technology'' to solve
the extortion case.
	   But railway unions have criticized company management, saying
they kept employees in the dark too long about the threat.

Prosecutor requests new arrest warrant for Kurdish rebel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: AMS. RECASTS; ADDS Turkish TV saying Italy ready to send
Ocalan to Ukraine &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A day after saying a court could rule in favor of
extraditing Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan to Turkey, the
Rome magistrate in charge of the case was pushing Tuesday to put
the rebel back in jail so he couldn't flee.
	   Italy has so far refused to extradite Ocalan, citing laws that
forbid it from extraditing suspects to countries where they face
the death penalty. But Rome prosecutor Giovanni Malerba indicated
on Monday that Ocalan could be extradited for crimes that do not
carry the death penalty.
	   Turkey considers Ocalan a terrorist and is the country's No. 1
fugitive.
	   Ocalan, who heads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, was
arrested Nov. 12 when he flew into Rome from Moscow. He was freed a
week later but ordered not to leave Rome.
	   Last week, Rome's appeals court lifted all restrictions on the
Kurdish rebel after Germany withdrew an international arrest
warrant it had issued against him for its own terrorism charges.
	   Italy's justice minister must now decide whether to take up
Malerba's request for a new arrest warrant.
	   Ocalan has requested political asylum in Italy, but Premier
Massimo D'Alema's center-left government is split over what to do.
	   The possibilities mentioned in both Italian and Turkish media
include sending Ocalan to a third-country. In recent days, South
Africa, Libya, Pakistan or North Korea have been mentioned as
possibilities.
	   On Tuesday, Turkey's private television station TGRT reported
that Italy planned to expel Ocalan to Ukraine and had allegedly
already found him an apartment there. The station said Italian
Industry Minister Pierluigi Bersani had informed Turkish officials
about this during a recent trip to Turkey.
	   Close to 37,000 people have been killed since Ocalan's rebel
group began fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey in 1984.

Israeli air raid in Lebanon kills mother and 6 children
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli and Hezbollah statements, guerrilla
reported killed, quote from father; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By MORSHED DANDASH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAALBEK, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes fired missiles at
suspected guerrilla bases in eastern Lebanon Tuesday, killing a
woman and her six children, Lebanese security officials said.
	   A guerrilla also was reported killed and a guerrilla-run radio
transmitter destroyed in the attack.
	   The officials said one Israeli rocket crashed on a farm where a
couple and their seven children were working in the village of Nabi
Sheet, about 23 kilometers (14 miles) southwest of the ancient city
of Baalbek.
	   The mother and six children aged between two and 13 were killed.
	   The father, Mohammed Othman, and one child were wounded, the
officials said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. It
was the worst civilian casualty this year in the war between Israel
and Lebanese guerrillas.
	   ``I felt I was lifted from the ground and then everything went
black,'' Othman, who suffered shrapnel wounds, said from his
hospital bed in Baalbek.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman said Israeli planes
targeted a guerrilla training facility and a broadcast station _ a
transmitter of the Hezbollah guerrilla group's Voice of the
Oppressed radio.
	   Although the targets were not near civilian areas, one missile
hit a building that was not the target, the spokesman said,
describing it as a ``malfunction.''
	   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
``expressed regret'' at the loss of civilian life, and said an
investigation is underway.
	   Lebanese officials said five other air-to-surface missiles also
hit the hills around the villages of Nabi Sheet and Janta, about
five kilometers (three miles) west of the Syrian border.
	   The officials said a guerrilla from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah
was killed and another wounded in the attack. But a Hezbollah
official in Beirut said he was not aware of any guerrilla death.
	   The Hezbollah confirmed that its radio transmitter on the edge
of Nabi Sheet was destroyed. The radio, however, remained on the
air, apparently using a backup transmitter. No other details were
available.
	   In a statement, the Hezbollah called the Israeli raid an
``atrocious crime'' and threatened retaliation.
	   Israeli fighter bombers also fired four rockets earlier Tuesday
at suspected guerrilla bases facing Israel's self-styled ``security
zone'' in an occupied portion of South Lebanon. There were no
casualties from the raid.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, has led the fight to try to oust
Israeli troops and their allied South Lebanon Army militia from the
security zone, which Israel set up in 1985 to protect its northern
towns from cross-border raids.
	   The bombing raids came after Hezbollah fighters exchanged fire
with Israeli troops and the SLA, the officials said.

Companies will spend dlrs 2.3 billion to crack millennium bug
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Airlines will spend an estimated dlrs 2.3 billion
preparing their systems for the millennium and passengers need have
no fears about computer failure, the International Air Transport
Association said Tuesday.
	   ``Airplanes are not going to crash, of course,'' spokesman Tim
Goodyear said. Airlines are not going to put them in a situation
where they might crash.''
	   The association, which represents most of the world's air
carriers, has launched a project to make sure its members are ready
for the Year 2000 _ or Y2K _ bug, when computer systems which have
not been updated could fail because they only recognize the last
two digits of a year and assume it is 1900 instead of 2000.
	   IATA is spending dlrs 20 million carrying out personal visits to
702 airports and 74 air traffic control areas worldwide, while
other work will be carried out directly by the airlines.
	   IATA is monitoring airports around the world to ensure they are
making the necessary changes.
	   No total figure has been established for the cost to the air
transport industry of Y2K compliance. The dlrs 2.3 billion figure
represents the costs to airlines alone.
	   There have been widespread public fears that it might not be
safe to be in the air as the clock ticks to midnight at the turn of
the millennium. But Goodyear said these fears were unfounded.
	   ``The air transport industry sells itself on safety _ it has to
because it is under public scrutiny.''

 &UR; Mitchell heads USOC probe of Salt Lake allegations &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with new comment; changes byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Hoping to calm jittery sponsors and avoid future
mistakes, Northern Ireland peace negotiator and former U.S. Senate
leader George Mitchell was selected Tuesday to head a U.S. Olympic
Committee investigation of bribery allegations in Salt Lake's
successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
	   Mitchell, who helped broker the peace accord in Northern Ireland
and at one time was considered for a seat on the U.S. Supreme
Court, will head a five-member panel that will start work next
week. He expects to report to the USOC by the end of February.
	   Although the USOC inquiry lacks subpoena powers, Mitchell and
committee president Bill Hybl said it would delve quickly into
records supplied by the Salt Lake Organizing Committee and
cooperate with two other investigations already opened into the
bribery case.
	   Any evidence of criminal wrongdoing would be turned over to
prosecutors, Mitchell added. The Justice Department is conducting a
preliminary review of the case to see if further investigation is
warranted.
	   ``I believe the Olympic movement holds a special place in the
hearts and minds of Americans and people around the world,''
Mitchell said. ``We intend to investigate what happened in the past
and make recommendations to assure that the selection of U.S.
candidate cities for future Olympics is fair and above reproach.''
	   Hybl said Salt Lake had promised to cooperate in the
investigation. He would not rule out penalties against organizers
but said the USOC had no intention of taking over Salt lake's
Olympic preparations.
	   ``These games will go on,'' he said. ``They will be one of the
most successful, if not the most successful, Winter Games ever.''
	   The International Olympic Committee and the Salt Lake organizers
launched their own inquiries earlier this month following a report
that a scholarship fund run by the Utah bid committee had benefited
the daughter of an IOC member from Cameroon.
	   SLOC president Frank Joklik said that six IOC relatives were
among 13 recipients of the half-million dollar scholarship fund. He
initially defended the program but later said it was improper,
although he denied the scholarships were meant to buy votes.
	   The case quickly developed into the biggest ethics scandal in
IOC history when Marc Hodler, a senior member from Switzerland and
the man who oversees the committee's ethics rules, said there was
widespread corruption in the voting for Olympic cities, including
payoffs of up to $5 million to agents who promised blocks of votes.
One of those agents was an IOC member, Hodler said.

approved a bill to amend the 1970 patent laws to avoid penalties by
the World Trade Organization.
	   The leftist and socialist lawmakers walked out of the house
after they lost the vote 83-43.
	   The bill will now be introduced in the powerful lower house. It
seeks to provide exclusive marketing rights to foreign agrochemical
and pharmaceutical companies selling their products in the country.
	   The lower house is expected to pass the bill this week with
support from the governing Bharatiya Janata Party and the main
opposition Congress Party. It will then become a law.
	   On Tuesday, the government rejected amendments by leftist and
socialist parties which argued that working people will be hurt
because foreigners will destroy indigenous business.
	   Biplab Dasgupta (Communist Party of India- Marxist) and Rama
Shankar (Socialist Party) didn't accept reformists' view that
patent protections will make India a more attractive place to do
business for foreigners. They accused the government of
compromising national interests.
	   India is expected to start giving patents from the year 2005,
but the WTO has asked New Delhi to provide a mechanism to receive
applications beginning next April. The existing 1970 law catered
for process patent, but did not provide for product patent.
	   The amendment bill is part of economic reforms being pursued by
India since 1991, gradually dismantling its socialist-patterned
economy.
	   Its introduction was hastened by a WTO ruling in a dispute with
the United States that India was yet to fulfill its obligations in
providing marketing rights to foreign companies.
	   A panel set up by the Dispute Settlement Body of the WTO asked
India to immediately set up a mechanism for receiving patent
applications.

Israeli air raid in Lebanon kills mother and 6 children

	   BAALBEK, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes fired missiles Tuesday
at suspected guerrilla bases in eastern Lebanon, killing a woman
and her six children, Lebanese security officials said.
	   A guerrilla also was reported killed and a guerrilla-run radio
transmitter destroyed in the attack.
	   The officials said one Israeli rocket crashed on a farm where a
couple and their seven children were working in the village of Nabi
Sheet, about 23 kilometers (14 miles) southwest of the ancient city
of Baalbek.
	   The mother and six children aged between two and 13 were killed.
	   The father, Mohammed Othman, and one child were wounded, the
officials said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. It
was the worst civilian casualty this year in the war between Israel
and Lebanese guerrillas.
	   ``I felt I was lifted from the ground and then everything went
black,'' Othman, who suffered shrapnel wounds, said from his
hospital bed in Baalbek.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman said Israeli planes
targeted a guerrilla training facility and a broadcast station _ a
transmitter of the Hezbollah guerrilla group's Voice of the
Oppressed radio.
	   Although the targets were not near civilian areas, one missile
hit a building that was not the target, the spokesman said,
describing it as a ``malfunction.''
	   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
``expressed regret'' at the loss of civilian life, and said an
investigation is underway.
	   Lebanese officials said five other air-to-surface missiles also
hit the hills around the villages of Nabi Sheet and Janta, about
five kilometers (three miles) west of the Syrian border.
	   The officials said a guerrilla from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah
was killed and another wounded in the attack. But a Hezbollah
official in Beirut said he was not aware of any guerrilla death.
	   The Hezbollah confirmed that its radio transmitter on the edge
of Nabi Sheet was destroyed. The radio, however, remained on the
air, apparently using a backup transmitter. No other details were
available.
	   In a statement, the Hezbollah called the Israeli raid an
``atrocious crime'' and threatened retaliation.
	   Israeli fighter bombers also fired four rockets earlier Tuesday
at suspected guerrilla bases facing Israel's self-styled ``security
zone'' in an occupied portion of South Lebanon. There were no
casualties from the raid.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, has led the fight to try to oust
Israeli troops and their allied South Lebanon Army militia from the
security zone, which Israel set up in 1985 to protect its northern
towns from cross-border raids.
	   The bombing raids came after Hezbollah fighters exchanged fire
with Israeli troops and the SLA, the officials said.

Iran to loan Tajikistan money for building roads
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Iran has agreed to give Tajikistan a dlrs 25
million loan to build roads and other infrastructure in the Central
Asian nation, which suffered heavy damage in a 5-year civil war, a
news report said Tuesday.
	   About 10 percent of the money will be used to build a highway
from Tajikistan to neighboring Pakistan and to buy road
construction equipment, Tajik Transport Minister Farrukha
Mukhitdinov told the Interfax news agency.
	   The rest of the money will go toward building electric power
stations, creating joint ventures and funding educational
institutions, he said.
	   The report did not say when the loan deal was signed.
	   Earlier this month, Iran agreed to help build a pharmaceutical
factory in Tajikistan.
	   Tajikistan's economy is in shambles following a civil war
between the secular government, which is backed by Russia, and the
mostly Islamic opposition. A truce signed last year ended
large-scale hostilities, but there are still periodic clashes.

National blood bank running dry, tragic consequences predicted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaican hospitals are canceling
surgery and at least two patients may have died because the
national blood bank is running dry.
	   Technologists at the bank in Kingston, the capital, predict more
people could die over the Christmas season, when the Caribbean
island suffers more road accidents and other violence.
	   ``What is happening now is that we can only supply a third of
the demand of our hospitals. I predict some people will die,''
Mirth Treston, a medical technologist at the bank said Tuesday.
	   ``I know at least two men have died as a result of gunshot
injuries'' because no blood was available for transfusions, she
said.
	   Some hospital requests for blood from the bank have been turned
down and they have had to cancel some operations as a result, she
said.
	   Mobile clinics toured the island in a bid to collect blood last
week, but did not have much success. The bank blamed the shortage
on a lack of donors.
	   The national blood bank serves all but two of the island
hospitals. Cornwall Regional Hospital in northern Montego Bay
resort and University Hospital in Kingston, the island's only
training hospital, collect their own blood.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   An upper-level trough of low pressure has intensified across the
local area overnight and is producing unstable atmospheric
conditions in a narrow band extending from St. Croix northeastward
across the U.S. and British Virgin Islands.
	   Fresh northeast trade winds continue to usher patches and bands
of low level moisture underneath this trough to produce scattered
clusters of showers and isolated thunderstorms with a few bands of
showers continuing southwest and across portions of Puerto Rico.
	   This pattern will continue through the early part of the
afternoon before the most active weather begins to shift
southeastward and across the center of the Anegada Passage and into
the northern Leeward Islands.
	   Until that time, look for partly sunny skies across Puerto Rico
with occasional bands of showers moving quickly southwest through
the area.
	   Across the virgin islands, there will be occasional glimpses of
bright sunshine. Passing moderate to heavy showers will gradually
give way to a decrease in cloud cover and showers by late afternoon
or evening.
	   Surface high pressure continues to dominate most of the Atlantic
Ocean today and is maintaining fresh east-northeast trade winds
across the regional waters and rough seas offshore.
	   No significant changes in these marine conditions are expected
through tonight. A slight increase in winds and a decided increase
in the east-northeast trade wind swells are expected to move into
the local waters Wednesday, raising offshore seas to near 9 feet.

Judge orders trial for man in Bahamas tourist slaying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ A judge has ordered a 19-year-old to
stand trial for the murders of two tourists on the Bahamian resort
area of Paradise Island.
	   Magistrate Cheryl Albury handed down the decision Monday
following two weeks of preliminary hearings into the case. She did
not set a date for the trial.
	   Prosecutors claim Terrell McIntosh killed Lori Fogleman, a
schoolteacher from Richmond, Virginia, in July and left her body
near popular Cabbage Beach. She was last seen alive on July 20.
	   McIntosh is also charged him with raping and killing Joanne
Clarke of Oxfordshire, England, on Aug. 21.
	   Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.
	   McIntosh is also charged with stealing Clarke's camera and dlrs
450 in travelers' checks; and with stealing two handbags and dlrs
310 in cash from Fogleman.
	   McIntosh was arrested Aug. 22 but released because of a lack of
evidence. Police arrested him again in September, saying forensic
tests led to the new charges.

Russia's ambassador to Washington returning after recall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's ambassador to the United States, recalled
to protest the bombing of Iraq, will return to Washington on
Wednesday, an official said.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said Tuesday that
Russia didn't want to ``complicate'' its relations with the United
States ``now that the United States has stopped its action, as
Russia insisted,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Ambassador Yuly Vorontsov was recalled last week, as was
Russia's ambassador to Britain.
	   President Boris Yeltsin and Russian leaders across the political
spectrum denounced the U.S. and British attacks on Iraq and
demanded an immediate halt to the campaign. Several top officials
warned that the attacks would hurt Russian-US relations.

Brother Valeri says Russian club wants Rocket
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) _ Idled Russian right wing Pavel Bure, who
hasn't played for the Vancouver Canucks since requesting a trade in
the fall, has an offer to play in Belarus next season, according to
a published report.
	   Bure's brother and Calgary Flames right wing Valeri Bure told
the Calgary Herald the money in Belarus would be similar to the
money he would make in the North American National Hockey League.
	   Valeri Bure said Pavel was on television recently in Europe
explaining the offer from Belarus.
	   ``The president (of a club team) said that if nothing happens he
would pay him money to play in Belarus,'' Valeri Bure said.
	   ``I don't know what Vancouver is going to do, but he might not
even come back here. He might play in Belarus and make the same
type of money that he would here. That's what he said on
television. If nothing happens this year, he would probably go and
play for Belarus. It is a big statement for him to make in front of
a lot of people.''
	   Canucks general manager Brian Burke has taken a hard line on
Bure, maintaining from the outset he will not rush into a trade.
	   Pavel Bure is prohibited from playing for European teams because
he is under contract to the Canucks, who suspended him when he did
not report to the team's training camp. So far, Bure has lost more
than dlrs 1.8 million of his dlrs 5 million-per-season contract
because of the holdout.
	   Pavel has been skating with the Russian national team in Moscow
during the dispute.
	   The pair, who are close, haven't seen each other since August
when Pavel visited North America to celebrate the birth of Valeri's
child. But they speak frequently on the phone.
	   ``I talk to him and he sounds like he wants to get back, but he
can't let that get into his head,'' Valeri Bure said. ``It is
tough, though, for him to sit at home and watch the other guys
play.''

Croatian, Bosnian officials open bridge linking Croatia and Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY DARKO LABOR &QC;

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia's president and the members of
the Bosnian presidency formally opened a new bridge Tuesday on the
River Sava, the natural border between the two countries.
	   The 790-meter (2600-feet) long bridge, linking Zupanja in
eastern Croatia, and Orasje in northeastern Bosnia, provides Bosnia
with a vital northern link to Croatia, and further on to Europe.
	   The new bridge was a joint venture between Bosnian and Croatian
companies, who worked on it for 18 months. The World Bank provided
the dlrs 6.5 million loan, which two countries will repay together.
	   Shelling by Serb rebels destroyed the previous bridge. Its
replacement now connects Croatia with the Muslim-Croat federation
in Bosnia, with the Serb republic just (kilometers) miles away.
	   At the opening, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman said the new
bridge symbolizes the beginning of the ``peacetime era, which paves
the way for progress and peaceful coexistence'' of all three ethnic
groups in Bosnia.
	   ``The reality is such that Croats, Muslims and Serbs live in
this area and they should find solutions to live together and avoid
conflicts,'' state-run HINA news agency quoted Tudjman as saying.
	   Tudjman has been widely accused of seeking to annex
Croat-controlled parts of Bosnia to Croatia proper. Although he
publicly supports the 1995 Dayton peace accord, which envisaged the
Bosnian state within its prewar borders, many suspect that his
intentions in fact remain unchanged.
	   On Tuesday, he pointed out that the bridge ``connects two parts
of the same nation,'' referring evidently to Bosnian Croats, who
make the majority in the Orasje area.

Police hunt father who attacked son with ax
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Police in the Dutch capital were
involved in a manhunt Tuesday for a father who hacked at his
7-year-old son's head with an ax, leaving the child fighting for
his life.
	   The boy was taken to a hospital with serious injuries to his
head and neck following Monday's attack. His condition was
described as critical but stable late Tuesday.
	   His father, a 34-year-old man, is in the middle of acrimonious
divorce proceedings with the child's mother, Amsterdam police said.
	   The man was visiting his son at a family friend's house. When he
saw the child, he pulled a meat cleaver and ax out from under his
clothing and attacked him.
	   The youngster managed to escape but his father chased him down a
street, caught him and hit him in the head with the ax before
fleeing.

New Israeli law requires radio stations to play more local music
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Half of all music played on Israeli stations
must be homegrown, according to a law passed Tuesday by Israel's
parliament.
	   The law, which passed with bipartisan support, applies to Israel
state-run radio, army radio and privately-run regional stations _
although many radio stations already broadcast predominantly
domestic content.
	   Reshet Gimel, the state-run pop music station, switched to an
all-Israeli format in the early 1990s when MTV became available in
Israel.
	   The law will likely affect specialty programs hardest _ for
instance, those devoted to jazz. Classical music programs and
foreign language programs will be exempt.
	   Some in the music business had questioned the need for the law,
saying that Israel's thriving recording industry benefited from
exposure to outside influences.
	   Backers of the law say there's plenty of foreign music already
available _ on MTV, on radio stations from neighboring Arab lands
and on pirate stations.
	   Benny Dudkevitch, a producer with Israel radio, said the new law
``will encourage more Israeli performers to record their music.''

Violence persists as peace envoys and relief workers visit Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo Albanian guerrillas warned of
all-out war Tuesday unless Serb police pull out of central parts of
the province, amid new violence that left one ethnic Albanian dead
and six others in custody.
	   Also Tuesday, US officials met with top guerrilla commanders in
Kosovo's rugged countryside in apparent effort to resuscitate a
de-facto truce increasingly frayed by bloodshed and possibly pave
the way for negotiations on the Serbian province's future.
	   The Serb-run Media Center reported that police pursuing
perpetrators of recent shootings killed one ``terrorist'' suspect
and arrested six others in the area. The source said the police
encountered fire and killed the ethnic Albanian when firing back.
	   The head of U.S. peace monitors in Kosovo, Shawn Burns and U.S.
State Department official Larry Rossin met top commanders of the
Kosovo Liberation Army in a remote village in central Kosovo.
	   The U.S. officials declined comment after the three-hour talks.
But KLA commander Jakub Krasniqi said: ``We hope that American and
European diplomacy will show more understanding for the KLA and
that they will support the Albanian people.''
	   The KLA has been stridently opposed to any plan for Kosovo that
stops short of independence for the Albanian-majority province, now
part of Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic
	   In the province's capital, Pristina, guerrilla spokesman Adem
Demaci warned police to leave central Kosovo, telling reporters:
``We promise, unless they withdraw from those areas, that they will
be attacked everywhere by our forces.''
	   Demaci said the police is not welcome in the parts of Kosovo
where there is no Serbian population.
	   Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs in Kosovo 9 to 1 and nearly all
demand independence. Hundreds have died and nearly 300,000 were
forced from their homes when ethnic tensions erupted into a war
this year.
	   The worst violence ended when Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, pulled out under US pressure some government forces and
agreed to allow 2,000 international peace verifiers into the
province.
	   But the head of the verifiers, William Walker, suggested his
people were being impeded, telling independent B 92 radio Tuesday
that the Belgrade ``authorities are generally uncooperative with
the mission.''
	   He said that most of the mission's requests to the authorities
``have drawn a negative response,'' according to B 92.
	   Walker also blamed ethnic Albanian rebels for breaking the
cease-fire agreement and acting ``irresponsibly by carrying out
provocative missions.''
	   Diplomatic efforts, and apparently the latest US meeting with
the guerrillas, are currently focused on bringing the KLA closer to
moderate ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   The ethnic Albanian camp needs to be united before meaningful
negotiations can begin on Kosovo's future. However, the Serbian
government refuses to deal with the KLA, calling it a ``terrorist
group.'' And the Serbian stand _ no more than limited autonomy for
Kosovo _ is far removed from the independence demands voiced both
by the KLA and more indirectly by the Rugova camp.
	   In Belgrade, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, fresh from
a fact-finding trip in Kosovo, said that some 175,000 people have
still not returned to their homes, although they have found
shelter.
	   Commissioner Sadako Ogata shrugged off accusations, leveled at
her by a Serbian refugee official, that she was biased toward
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.
	   ``I strongly condemn (continued) violence and intimidation'' by
both sides in Kosovo, Ogata told reporters, visibly annoyed by the
claims.
	   In Belgrade on Monday, heads of Yugoslavia's Serb-led army met
with NATO's top commander in Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, who
repeated warnings that the alliance might intervene if fighting
between Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian rebels continues,
sources close to the talks said on condition of anonymity.
	   Milosevic averted threatened NATO airstrikes when he signed the
October agreement, promising an end to the military campaign
against separatists.

Students end hunger strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Student protesters in Albania ended a
hunger strike Tuesday after the government agreed to meet some of
their demands for better conditions.
	   About 40 students on Tuesday ended their 12-day long hunger
strike, when the state said it would invest more money into
realizing better water and energy conditions in the dormitories. It
also said scholarships would go up 10-20 percent from the current
dlrs 30 to 35.
	   ``It's really a good thing reaching such conclusion, even if it
is late'' said Besnik Jaku, a 22-year-old striker.
	   Albanian Minister of Education Et'hem Ruka asked that the
students be patient with the meeting of their requests, ``since we
are talking about 10,000 students who are living in dorms.''
	   The hunger strike began on Dec. 10 in a disco in the Tirana
University dormitory complex. Students from Shkodra University, in
northern Albania, later joined in the protest.
	   One week later, police entered the dormitory and broke up the
strike, because the authorities said one of the students was
suffering from hepatitis C.
	   The students resumed the strike the same day, supported by
Democratic leader Sali Berisha.
	   On Monday, Berisha met with Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli
Majko to discuss the strike.

	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Thousands of refugees poured into
Sierra Leone's capital on Tuesday as fighting intensified between
rebel forces and Nigerian-led West African intervention troops
based in nearby towns.
	   Villagers carried their few possessions on their heads and
walked throughout the night to reach Freetown. In the city, they
slept in the sweltering sun along sidewalks while others pitched
tents and some sought shelter in shop doorways.
	   A number of refugees recounted images of rebel fighters burning
down houses and randomly killing civilians with assault rifles in
the town of Wellington, about 20 miles (35 kilometers) to the east.
There were unconfirmed reports of heavy fighting in other towns
closer to the capital.
	   Faced with the apparent setbacks, officials from the government
and the West African intervention force fighting on its behalf
instituted a press blackout, declining to speak to journalists
about the fighting and banning unauthorized dispatches.
	   ECOMOG commander Timothy Shelpidi issued a written appeal to
state radio late Tuesday for citizens to remain calm. Despite
attacks in Waterloo and other parts of the country causing a mass
refugee exodus, ECOMOG was in control of the security situation and
was ``seeking and destroying'' rebel hideouts, he said.
	   ``Do not panic and abandon your homes at the sound of gunfire,''
Shelpidi said. ``You need to be aware that the rebels are using
your fear to achieve their aims.''
	   Shelpidi warned refugees to beware of ``rebels who may have
mingled among you, pretending to be displaced people. Keep a
lookout for any suspicious movements.''
	   Yet he lashed out at civilians for spreading panic with false
rumors about the spread of hostilities.
	   ``We need your support to enable us to deal decisively with the
rebels,'' he said. ``We cannot do that if you panic and flood onto
the streets.''

Turkish St. Nicholas group incensed over Levis ad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A group that promotes St. Nicholas is
incensed over an ad by the Turkish branch of U.S. clothing
manufacture Levi Strauss and Co. because it contends the publicity
distorts the image of Santa.
	   The half-page ad in daily Hurriyet last week showed a
sad-looking Santa Claus sitting with his head bowed, with his
sleigh parked and his reindeers, with their heads cut off, hanging
on the wall.
	   The ad, announcing cut-price Levi's goods for the holiday
season, says Father Christmas will be made redundant this year
because ``there is no need to wait for gifts from anyone.''
	   In predominantly Muslim Turkey, people give each other gifts for
New Year.
	   ``Nobody has the right to show Father Christmas in such a
depressing mood especially on the eve of Christmas,'' Muammer
Karabulut, the president of the Father Christmas Foundation, said
Tuesday. ``Levi has damaged the holy image of Santa Claus, who
represents hope for children.''
	   The association promotes peace and the legend of St. Nicholas,
who is believed to have lived in the Turkish Mediterranean town of
Demre in the 4th century and given sacks of gold coins to dowryless
young girls.
	   ``We had no intention of humiliating Santa Claus,'' said Nil
Celik, a Levi Strauss official in Turkey. ``We canceled the
advertisement the day the foundation warned us.''
	   Karabulut said lawyers would ask the prosecutor's office on
Wednesday in Demre to launch a lawsuit against the San
Francisco-based clothing company.

Turkish St. Nicholas group incensed over Levis ad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A group that promotes St. Nicholas is
incensed over an ad by the Turkish branch of U.S. clothing
manufacture Levi Strauss and Co. because it contends the publicity
distorts the image of Santa.
	   The half-page ad in daily Hurriyet last week showed a
sad-looking Santa Claus sitting with his head bowed, with his
sleigh parked and his reindeers, with their heads cut off, hanging
on the wall.
	   The ad, announcing cut-price Levi's goods for the holiday
season, says Father Christmas will be made redundant this year
because ``there is no need to wait for gifts from anyone.''
	   In predominantly Muslim Turkey, people give each other gifts for
New Year.
	   ``Nobody has the right to show Father Christmas in such a
depressing mood especially on the eve of Christmas,'' Muammer
Karabulut, the president of the Father Christmas Foundation, said
Tuesday. ``Levi has damaged the holy image of Santa Claus, who
represents hope for children.''
	   The association promotes peace and the legend of St. Nicholas,
who is believed to have lived in the Turkish Mediterranean town of
Demre in the 4th century and given sacks of gold coins to dowryless
young girls.
	   ``We had no intention of humiliating Santa Claus,'' said Nil
Celik, a Levi Strauss official in Turkey. ``We canceled the
advertisement the day the foundation warned us.''
	   Karabulut said lawyers would ask the prosecutor's office on
Wednesday in Demre to launch a lawsuit against the San
Francisco-based clothing company.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Sixteen weeks after the crash of Swissair Flight
111 shattered the bodies of those on board, police said Tuesday
that remains of all 229 victims have been identified thanks to
state-of-the-art DNA techniques.
	   Police also said more than dlrs 1 million in U.S. currency has
been recovered from the wreckage on the ocean floor off Nova
Scotia. Still missing is a shipment of diamonds.
	   The impact of the Sept. 2 crash was so great that traditional
identification methods, including the use of dental and X-ray
records, were of minimal use in identifying the fragmented remains
retrieved from the Atlantic.
	   Blood samples were collected from relatives of those on board,
and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police coordinated an intensive
operation at several forensic laboratories around Canada to match
the samples with recovered remains.
	   RCMP officers, at a news briefing Tuesday in Halifax, Nova
Scotia, said DNA techniques had never before been used to such an
extent in the aftermath of an air disaster. They said recent
technological advances enabled them to complete tasks in days that
might previously have taken weeks.
	   The RCMP recommended that airlines henceforth keep fingerprint
and DNA records of their crew members to make identifications
easier.
	   By comparison, the vast majority of remains from TWA Flight 800,
which crashed off the New York coast in 1996, were identified by
dental records, either alone or in combination with other methods.
Only seven of the 230 remains were identified throught DNA.

Spanish parliament approves 1999 budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID (AP) _ Spain's parliament on Tuesday approved a
government budget for the coming year that aims to reduce the
country's budget deficit to 1.6 percent of gross national product,
down from the 2.4 percent expected for this year.
	   The spending plan also anticipates a decline in unemployment to
17.4 percent from rates above 19 percent, far higher than the
European average.
	   Finance Minister Rodrigo Rato said the budget is part of the
government's plan to erase the deficit by 2002 to promote a stable
climate for the euro, the common European currency to be introduced
Jan. 1.
	   Deputies from the ruling Popular Party approved the budget
Tuesday backed by deputies from regional parties.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian guerrillas warned of
all-out war Tuesday unless Serb police pull out of central Kosovo,
amid new violence that left one ethnic Albanian dead and six others
in custody.
	   Also Tuesday, U.S. officials met with top guerrilla commanders
in Kosovo's rugged countryside in apparent effort to resuscitate a
de-facto truce increasingly frayed by bloodshed and possibly pave
the way for negotiations on the Serbian province's future.
	   The Serb-run Media Center reported that police pursuing
perpetrators of recent shootings killed one ``terrorist'' suspect
and arrested six others in the area. The source said the police
encountered fire and killed the ethnic Albanian when firing back.
	   The head of U.S. peace monitors in Kosovo, Shaun Byrns, and a U.
S. State Department official met top commanders of the Kosovo
Liberation Army in a remote village in central Kosovo.
	   The U.S. officials declined comment after the three-hour talks.
But KLA commander Jakub Krasniqi said: ``We hope that American and
European diplomacy will show more understanding for the KLA and
that they will support the Albanian people.''
	   The KLA has been stridently opposed to any plan for Kosovo that
stops short of independence for the Albanian-majority province, now
part of Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic
	   In the province's capital, Pristina, guerrilla spokesman Adem
Demaci warned police to leave central Kosovo, telling reporters:
``We promise, unless they withdraw from those areas, that they will
be attacked everywhere by our forces.''
	   Demaci said the police is not welcome in the parts of Kosovo
where there is no Serbian population.
	   Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs in Kosovo 9 to 1 and nearly all
demand independence. Hundreds have died and nearly 300,000 were
forced from their homes when ethnic tensions erupted into a war
this year.
	   The worst violence ended when Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, pulled out under US pressure some government forces and
agreed to let 2,000 international peace verifiers into the
province.
	   But the head of the verifiers, William Walker, suggested his
people were being impeded, telling independent B 92 radio Tuesday
that the Belgrade ``authorities are generally uncooperative with
the mission.''
	   He said that most of the mission's requests to the authorities
``have drawn a negative response,'' according to B 92.
	   Walker also blamed ethnic Albanian rebels for breaking the
cease-fire agreement and acting ``irresponsibly by carrying out
provocative missions.''
	   Diplomatic efforts, and apparently the latest US meeting with
the guerrillas, are currently focused on bringing the KLA closer to
moderate ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   The ethnic Albanian camp needs to be united before meaningful
negotiations can begin on Kosovo's future. However, the Serbian
government refuses to deal with the KLA, calling it a ``terrorist
group.'' And the Serbian stand _ no more than limited autonomy for
Kosovo _ is far removed from the independence demands voiced both
by the KLA and more indirectly by the Rugova camp.
	   In Belgrade, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, fresh from
a fact-finding trip in Kosovo, said that some 175,000 people have
still not returned to their homes, although they have found
shelter.
	   Commissioner Sadako Ogata shrugged off accusations, leveled at
her by a Serbian refugee official, that she was biased toward
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.
	   ``I strongly condemn (continued) violence and intimidation'' by
both sides in Kosovo, Ogata told reporters, visibly annoyed by the
claims.
	   In Belgrade, heads of Yugoslavia's Serb-led army met Monday with
NATO's top commander in Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, who repeated
warnings that the alliance might intervene if fighting between Serb
security forces and ethnic Albanian rebels continues, sources close
to the talks said on condition of anonymity.
	   Milosevic averted threatened NATO airstrikes when he signed the
October agreement, promising an end to the military campaign
against separatists.

Zagallo reportedly to coach Portuguesa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Months after losing the World Cup
final and his job, former Brazilian national team coach Mario
Zagallo has agreed to coach Portuguesa, the Globo TV network
reported Tuesday.
	   Portuguesa, for years a second-level club in Sao Paulo, has
emerged as a national contender in recent years. It reached the
finals of the Brazilian championship in 1996 and the semifinals
this year.
	   Zagallo, 67, won the World Cup as a player in 1958 and 1962, as
coach in 1970 and as team coordinator in 1994. His only loss came
this year, when Brazil lost the final 3-0 to France.
	   Zagallo also has coached clubs in Brazil and the Middle East. He
would replace Candinho, who quit after Portuguesa was eliminated by
Cruzeiro in the semifinals.

Israel's race for prime minister shapes up as a free-for-all

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Even with his boss standing by, Israeli Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon couldn't resist a little political joke.
Waving his hand at a group of low-level officials, he expressed
innocent surprise they weren't all running for prime minister.
	   Just about everyone else, it seems, is getting ready to jump
into the race.
	   On Tuesday, the first day of what's likely to be a long and
bruising electoral campaign, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was
bracing for an onslaught from all sides _ but expressing confidence
he would win ``utmost, massive'' voter support.
	   It was a notable show of bravado from a leader who only a day
earlier had been handed a stinging rejection of his peace policies
by lawmakers, who then voted overwhelmingly to hold early
elections.
	   It will be several more days before the lineup against Netanyahu
becomes clear, but at least half a dozen Israeli politicians have
announced candidacies or are weighing bids to become prime
minister. Balloting is expected by the end of April in what's
likely to be the last direct election for the post.
	   One of Netanhayu's toughest potential rivals, popular former
army chief of staff Lt. Gen. Amnon Lipkin Shahak, isn't campaigning
yet. He's still in the army and keeping quiet in line with military
regulations, but he's expected to be demobilized within days.
	   Another leading rival is Ehud Barak, head of the opposition
Labor party. He declared Tuesday that Netanyahu had ``lost the
trust'' necessary to negotiate any real peace with the
Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu brushed aside polls suggesting Barak could beat him by
a slim margin and Shahak by a wide one.
	   ``We will go to the people and the people will give us the
support to achieve peace with security,'' he told Israel radio.
	   Netanyahu's onetime finance minister, Dan Meridor, declared his
candidacy Tuesday, and quickly weighed in with a harsh assessment
of his former boss.
	   Meridor told Israel TV Netanyahu was ``a man who will say no in
the morning and yes in the evening ... a manipulator, a cynic, a
man who does not tell the truth.''
	   It also became clear Tuesday that Netanyahu would face a
leadership challenge from within the ranks of his own Likud party.
	   ``There must be a contest and it must be clean,'' lawmaker Uzi
Landau told Israel TV, indicating that if he himself didn't try for
the party leadership, he would back someone who did.
	   Netanyahu also sought Tuesday to deflect Palestinian complaints
that the peace process had already become a casualty of Israel's
political turmoil.
	   Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said Israel was
bound to honor the Wye accords despite the election upheaval, just
as it was committed to any other existing international agreement.
	   ``It's really unfortunate that the only thing that Mr. Netanyahu
has decided to stop is the peace process with us,'' Erekat told The
Associated Press.
	   Netanyahu, however, said Palestinian refusal to accept new
Israeli conditions for implementing the Wye River accord _ not the
election campaign _ was behind Israel's continuing freeze on
complying with the peace pact.
	   The prime minister's office said Israel will ``carry out its
part in the agreement without any relation to the election
schedule'' as soon as the Palestinians meet the latest conditions,
including a demand that they stop saying they will declare a
Palestinian state in May.

Moscow looking festive, but tinsel can't hide gloom

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ On orders of the mayor, Moscow is looking
downright festive these days.
	   Every store in the city is festooned with mandatory holiday
decorations. Streets are aglow with colored bulbs. The beaming face
of Grandfather Frost _ Russia's Santa Claus _ can be seen
everywhere, wishing the populace a Happy New Year.
	   With Mayor Yuri Luzhkov leading the way, Muscovites are throwing
themselves into the spirit of the season as best they can. But the
tinsel can't hide the gloom in the air. The economic crisis has
sharply cut most Russians' buying power, and holiday gift-buying
has become a depressing exercise in making do with less.
	   Merchants are especially downcast. Asked how business was going,
fur seller Valentina Goncharinko laughed bitterly. ``I can give you
a really short answer: It's really bad,'' she said.
	   Even in bad times, this is a magical time of year in the Russian
capital. The city is fully cloaked in snow, the air has an
invigorating bite to it (a nice way of saying it's frigid), the
theater, ballet and opera seasons are at their peak and people are
busy preparing for the big day.
	   That would be New Year's, not Christmas. After 70 years of
state-enforced atheism, Christmas is still largely an afterthought
here _ literally, since it falls on Jan. 7 on the Russian calendar.
But Russians celebrate New Year's much as many Westerners celebrate
Christmas, with alcohol-fueled family gatherings around the
``yolki,'' or New Year's tree, and gift exchanges with family and
friends.
	   One glance at the throngs now mobbing the city's shops and
outdoor markets would be enough to convince a newcomer to Moscow
that this city is still the post-communist boomtown some people
were describing a year or two ago.
	   At the upscale Manezh shopping mall, hard by the Kremlin,
teen-age mall rats cruise in packs and chic New Russians carry bags
bearing logos such as United Colors of Benetton, Nike and Lego.
	   At the new, Finnish-owned Stockmann's, a full-fledged,
three-level Western department store on the traffic-choked Garden
Ring Road, saleswomen startle shoppers with one of the rustiest
phrases in the Russian language: ``May I help you?''
	   And at the open-air Luzhniki market, the largest and busiest in
the former Soviet Union, throngs of shoppers push, shove, throw
elbows and lash tongues in some of the most spirited
urban-guerrilla shopping in the world.
	   But merchants say the crowds are thinner than last year, and
that people are buying less and driving harder bargains. Shoppers
agree that this will be a leaner, meaner New Year as a result of
the ruble devaluation and economic crash that hit Russia hard in
August.
	   The sky was sheet-metal gray and the weather unusually warm _
within a degree or two of freezing _ as Valentina Ivanova tried on
a muskrat fur coat at the Luzhniki market one day recently.
	   Underfoot, slush had become mixed with decomposing cardboard,
candy wrappers, plastic strapping cord and cigarette butts to form
a lumpy, brownish-black mass. Loud Turkish pop music blared from
loudspeakers; the smoke of cheap cigarettes mingled with the smell
of grilling meat from nearby food stands.
	   More than 4,000 vendors compete at Luzhniki from stalls offering
a head-spinning array of mostly inferior consumer products, from
Brand X children's toys to X-rated sex toys, from 50-cent socks to
dlrs 2.50 shirts and dlrs 9 rabbit-fur hats.
	   The coat Ivanova was trying, a brown model with spiky bristles,
was selling for dlrs 80. Her husband, who had promised her a fur
coat for New Year's, looked on admiringly as she flounced a bit in
a mirror held above the slush by a saleswoman, who cooed about how
good it looked. Finally, she took it off and decided to keep
looking.
	   She liked it, she said, but maybe she'd find something better
elsewhere.
	   Both she and her husband, Igor, are in the Russian air force,
and haven't received their salaries for months. The money they have
received is worth far less because of the ruble devaluation.
	   ``Last year, I could have bought two coats for this money,''
Ivanova said. ``Now, I can buy only one.''
	   Still, she and her husband were resolved to make the best of a
bad deal. They were looking forward to New Year's, and had already
bought a gift for their daughter _ a ``big'' toy that they refused
to describe further.
	   ``If people can,'' Ivanova said, ``they'll try to celebrate the
holiday in the nicest possible way.''
	   Then she turned and, arm in arm with her husband, slogged off
into the slush.

New Israeli law requires radio stations to play more local music
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 3 and 4 with quote from law's sponsor;
CLARIFIES which stations will be affected, grafs 6, 7; minor
editing; ADDS byline.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Half of all music played on Israeli stations
must be homemade, according to a law passed Tuesday by Israel's
parliament.
	   The law, which passed with bipartisan support, applies to Israel
state-run radio, army radio and privately-run regional stations _
although many radio stations already broadcast predominantly
domestic content.
	   Yona Yahav, the Labor party legislator who sponsored the new
measur, said the law was necessary to protect local artists.
	   ``A young culture must build protective barriers, just as
protective barriers are built around products,'' he said.
	   He noted that the law is declarative and does not include
penalties. ``Program producers will not be hauled off to jail,'' he
said, laughing.
	   Reshet Gimel, the state-run pop music station, has been on an
all-Israeli format in the early 1990s _ when MTV became available
in Israel.
	   The law does not apply to specific shows; instead, stations will
be expected to broadcast 50 percent Israeli content each month. How
they distribute it will be up to them.
	   The state-run classical music station will be exempted, as will
Israel's Arabic language service and a station that broadcasts
predominantly foreign language programs, for recent immigrants.
Other stations will be assessed on a monthly basis.
	   Some in the music business had questioned the need for the law,
saying that Israel's thriving recording industry benefited from
exposure to outside influences.
	   Backers of the law say there's plenty of foreign music already
available _ on MTV, on radio stations from neighboring Arab lands
and on pirate stations.
	   Benny Dudkevitch, a producer with Israel radio, said the new law
``will encourage more Israeli performers to record their music.''

Round-the-world balloonists drift over China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES, edits throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By AUDREY WOODS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Three round-the-world balloonists drifted high
over the Himalayas on Tuesday, hoping to catch a jetstream out of
prohibited Chinese airspace as quickly as possible.
	   ``We are going to look ... for the fastest, most direct route
out of China, which is what the balloon wants to do anyway,''
project director Mike Kendrick said after the Chinese balked at
approving the balloon's course.
	   British tycoon Richard Branson, American millionaire Steve
Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden, aloft in the ICO Global
balloon heading eastward around the globe, had received permission
to cross China below 26 degrees north latitude.
	   But they drifted further north Monday after navigating around
Mediterranean storms and closed airspace over Iraq, Iran and
Russia.
	   The project ground crew, headed by Kendrick, said the Chinese
had asked the balloonists to land at the Lhasa airfield Tuesday
morning, but that the balloon overshot the field and it was
impossible to come down anywhere else.
	   Earlier in the day, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao had
said China could not agree to the balloon's northerly course, but
he did not call on the crew to withdraw immediately or land.
	   As it became apparent early Monday that the balloon would
inevitably cross into unauthorized Chinese territory, Prime
Minister Tony Blair sent a message to Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
asking for China's help.
	   The ICO Global project later said the Chinese government,
through the British Embassy in Beijing, had granted permission to
cross the country, on condition the balloon leave Chinese airspace
as soon as possible.
	   ``Thank you to the Chinese government,'' Branson said upon
hearing the news. ``We are embarrassed to have entered the airspace
without permission and relieved that they understand our
position.''
	   The craft was over Tibet, about 10 miles (15 kms) north of
Bhutan, at about 1300 GMT, but Kendrick said it was ``very
difficult to tell'' how long it would take to get out of Chinese
airspace.
	   Balloon pilots navigate by changing the lift of the balloon to
ascend or descend into different wind systems.
	   Kendrick said the crew could have created a problem by using up
a large amount of fuel to fly above the cloud base at 26,000 feet
(8,000 meters) to keep the balloon free of ice.
	   ``We have taken a long time to get where we are, clawing across
the Himalayas,'' he said. ``We have used more fuel than we would
have expected. We are going to have to assess the situation.''
	   The balloon had been moving through China at about 43 knots (48
mph), but Kendrick said the craft would need to reach 100 knots
(115 mph) to get around the world.
	   The crew members estimate the trip could last from eight days to
nearly three weeks. They hope to touch down somewhere in western
Europe at the end of a 24,000-mile (38,000 kms) flight, which will
take them over India, the South China Sea, the Pacific and the
United States.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.
	   Asked where the balloonists hoped to be Christmas Day, Kendrick
said, ``Somewhere in America, fingers crossed.''

Concert organizer guilty of tax evasion, gets five years eight
</HEADLINE>
months &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANNHEIM, Germany (AP) _ The Mannheim state court on Tuesday
convicted a concert organizer of evading 15 million marks (dlrs 9
million) in taxes and sentenced him to five years and eight months
in prison.
	   Matthias Hoffmann, who has organized concerts for Luciano
Pavarotti, Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and star soprano
Montserrat Caballe, among others, was visibly shaken when the
sentence was read.
	   Chief Judge Michael Meyer said Hoffmann had ``grossly worked to
his own advantage,'' in funneling money from concerts through
mailbox companies set up outside Germany ``to enrich himself.''
	   Meyer said Hoffmann was not a victim of poor tax advisors as his
defense had claimed, because they had been warned him repeatedly
that he was using illegal methods.
	   The judge said that the only thing positive about Hoffmann's
actions was that he had paid 6.5 million marks (dlrs 3.9 million)
in back taxes and his admission to guilt in the case.
	   The 47-year-old Hoffmann was released after posting a bond of
1.9 million marks (dlrs 1.1 million) until justice officials verify
trial procedures were correct before the sentence is activated.
	   Defense lawyers Egon Mueller and Alexander Keller said they
would decide within a week whether to appeal the sentence.
	   Pavarotti, Carreras, Domingo and Caballe, were named as suspects
last month for helping Hoffmann evade taxes.
	   Mannheim prosecutor Hubert Jobski said there were signs that the
four may have been involved, but that the investigation had only
started and could take months.
	   Hoffmann's trial began in October.
	   He was initially accused of using unreported payments and shell
companies in Ireland, London and elsewhere to evade almost 24
million marks (dlrs 15 million) in German taxes.
	   He had been in investigative custody since July 30.

Swiss launch publicity campaign on new weapons laws
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MATTHIAS BRUELLMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss authorities launched a big
publicity campaign Tuesday about a new nationwide gun law which
enters into force at the start of next year.
	   The new regulation _ which replaces a wide array of state ones _
introduces tighter licensing arrangements and restrictions on
foreigners buying or owning guns.
	   Switzerland has one of the world's highest rates of gun
ownership in the world, and the right to bear arms is steeped in
centuries-old tradition.
	   In a nation of less than seven million, there are said to be
about 4.5 million guns for recreation, hunting and self-defense. In
addition, every male who serves in the militia army has to keep his
assault rifle at home.
	   Despite this, the Alpine nation has one of the world's lowest
crime rates _ a fact frequently seized on by U.S. gun lobbies.
	   Faced with evidence in the early 1990's that guns brought in
Switzerland were being used in foreign wars and by terrorists, the
government drafted legislation to introduce more controls. This was
approved in a national referendum in 1993.
	   The new law is the outcome of that 1993 vote.
	   All nationals of former Yugoslavia are banned from buying
weapons. The government hopes this will reduce the number of guns
bought in Switzerland and smuggled for use in the war in Kosovo,
just as they were in Bosnia.
	   There will also be a ban on sales to people from Turkey _ which
is faced with a Kurdish insurgency _ Sri Lanka, Algeria and
Albania.
	   There will be stricter registration and ownership rules, and it
will be under central government control to end huge differences
between local cantons (states).
	   People who wish to carry a weapon for self-defense must obtain a
personal gun permit, having satisfied authorities that it is
essential and having passed a theoretical and practical
examination.
	   ``Fear alone is not enough,'' said Claude Mebes, from the
Federal Police's gun information service.
	   The big exceptions to this rule are hunters and sportsmen who
practice on rifle ranges dotted throughout the country. And, of
course, the army weapons.
	   To increase awareness of the new laws, authorities said they
were distributing 32,000 posters in key public places and at police
stations.
	   Current gun owners will have one year in which to obtain a
permit.

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Sixteen weeks after the crash of Swissair Flight
111 shattered the bodies of those on board, police said Tuesday
that remains of all 229 victims have been identified thanks to
state-of-the-art DNA techniques.
	   Police also said more than dlrs 1 million in U.S. currency has
been recovered from the wreckage on the ocean floor off Nova
Scotia. Still missing is a shipment of diamonds.
	   The impact of the Sept. 2 crash was so great that traditional
identification methods, including the use of dental and X-ray
records, were of minimal use in identifying the fragmented remains
retrieved from the Atlantic.
	   Blood samples were collected from relatives of those on board,
and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police coordinated an intensive
operation at several forensic laboratories around Canada to match
the samples with recovered remains.
	   RCMP officers, at a news briefing Tuesday in Halifax, Nova
Scotia, said DNA techniques had never before been used to such an
extent in the aftermath of an air disaster. They said recent
technological advances enabled them to complete tasks in days that
might previously have taken weeks.
	   The RCMP recommended that airlines henceforth keep fingerprint
and DNA records of their crew members to make identifications
easier.
	   By comparison, the vast majority of the 230 passengers who died
aboard TWA Flight 800, which crashed off the New York coast in
1996, were identified by dental records, either alone or in
combination with other methods. Only a few dozen of the 230 remains
were identified through DNA.

IFJ: 49 journalists, 1 photographer killed in the world in 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Norbert Zongo was a leading journalist
in Burkina Faso, Igor Lykov denounced corruption in the Russian
press, Afrim Maliqi criticized Serbian policy towards the Albanian
population of Kosovo.
	   All three were killed by gunmen in 1998.
	   They are among 49 journalists and one photographer slain this
year, the International Federation of Journalists said in a report
published Tuesday.
	   Of the 50 victims, 30 journalists and the photographer were
killed for reasons tied to their work, IFJ general secretary Aidan
White said. The IFJ is still investigating the other cases.
	   The highest death rate was in Colombia, where 10 journalists
were killed in 1998, followed by Mexico and Russia, where six and
five journalists were slain, respectively.
	   Central and South America remained the most dangerous regions,
with a total of 22 journalists killed in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico,
Peru and Guatemala.
	   ``In certain countries, it seems to be accepted that if you kill
a journalist you won't get caught,'' White said, denouncing the
``lack of commitment at political level to trace the killers of
journalists.''
	   ``In some countries, the situation is improving,'' White said,
noting that for the first time in several years there were no
casualties among the press in Algeria.
	   Last year, as in 1996, 47 journalists were killed in the world.
	   White said the IFJ based its findings on local sources, as well
as testimonies from the colleagues and relatives of the victims.

Schroeder raps minister over nuclear shutdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Trittin playing down any conflict, other details
in grafs 6-8 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder rebuked his
environment minister Tuesday in a dispute over nuclear energy,
provoking the first sharp clash in the new center-left government.
	   Schroeder accused the minister, Juergen Trittin, of jeopardizing
talks with utility firms on shutting down German nuclear power
plants with his own anti-nuclear campaign.
	   Earlier, Trittin announced he was firing the government's two
advisory panels on nuclear safety and indicated he would install
new members less favorable to nuclear power.
	   Schroeder said Trittin, a member of the environmentalist Greens
party, had not cleared the move with him.
	   ``Everyone is called upon not to substitute self-important
attitudes and the symbolism of party politics for dealing with the
political issues,'' said Schroeder, clearly aiming at Trittin.
	   At a news conference called later, Trittin played down any
conflict in the coalition or with Schroeder over the nuclear issue.
	   He said that shutting down nuclear power plants was anchored in
the coalition agreement as a declared goal of both parties.
	   At issue was only how it is to be done and he expected agreement
on that at a coalition meeting set for Jan. 13, Trittin said.
	   Schroeder, whose Social Democrats won September elections, has
pledged to put Germany on course to shut down its 19 nuclear
plants.
	   But in an interview published Tuesday, Schroeder rejected
pressure for a fast timetable from the Greens, his junior
government partner.
	   ``Some people's ideas of making it by 2004 are mistaken,'' he
told the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper. ``This will
take significantly longer.''
	   At the same time, he denied reports that he has agreed to give
German utilities at least 20 years to scrap nuclear power.
	   He said he remains committed to seeking a shutdown strategy in
talks with power companies starting next month.
	   German media have reported that the two sides reached an
understanding on a timetable in preliminary talks last week.
	   Schroeder has said he could support 20 years, but one report
said he had agreed to give power companies a longer grace period so
they will renounce damage claims for lost earnings.
	   The power industry last week called for 40 years as the only way
for the government to avoid damage claims, which the industry has
estimated at up to 80 billion marks (dlrs 48 billion).
	   Schroeder insisted there was no accord yet.
	   ``I don't want to pin myself down on the time period,'' he told
the newspaper.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The Rev. Lord Soper, a Methodist minister and
Britain's most famous soapbox orator for more than half a century,
died Tuesday. He was 95.
	   Soper had just returned to his London home from a hospital where
he was being treated for a chest infection, the Methodist Church
said.
	   A lifelong supporter of radical causes, Soper had taken to his
outdoor podium almost every week since 1926 _ at lunchtime
Wednesdays on Tower Hill in east London, and at 3 p.m. Sundays at
Speaker's Corner in Hyde Park.
	   Soper thrived on give-and-take with hecklers as he expounded his
Christian beliefs, and spoke out against war, poverty, drink,
gambling, capitalism, communism, slave labor, racial inequality and
capital punishment.
	   He continued preaching into old age, a familiar figure with
strong features and snow-white hair.

Zakopane official calls banning trips by IOC members `strange'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEATA PASEK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Banning International Olympic Committee
members from visiting potential host cities would be ``a strange
solution'' to the ongoing Olympic bribery scandal, an official in
Zakopane's bid campaign said Tuesday.
	   The southern Poland mountain resort is one of six bidders for
the 2006 Olympics. Now it may have to alter its strategy if IOC
President Juan Antonio Samaranch enforces his call to halt visits
by voting IOC members to bid cities because of the bribery
allegations.
	   ``Changing the rules in the middle of competition is a strange
solution,'' said Piotr Bak, deputy mayor of Zakopane.
	   He said Zakopane sent invitations to all of the more than 100
IOC members and had expected a ``significant number'' to visit.
	   Zakopane planned to jointly host the IOC members with nearby
Poprad, Slovakia _ which is part of a separate bid to host the 2006
Games _ to lower the cost, Bak said.
	   An IOC committee evaluating bid cities spent three days in
Zakopane in early November. During the visit, committee chairman
Chiharu Igaya declared Zakopane fit to host the games, but stressed
that it must resolve a controversy over access to its Tatra
mountain reserve.
	   Environmental groups, intellectuals and some political leaders
have criticized the Polish bid, saying the construction and
alterations needed to stage the Olympics would permanently damage
the pristine Tatra mountains in violation of environmental laws.
	   Organizers of the games in Zakopane planned to hold 39 events in
the Tatra National Park, noted Wojciech Byrcyn, director of the
park designated a natural reserve by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 1992.
	   He called the devastation associated with hosting the Olympics
``crazy.''
	   But Bak said experts would evaluate the environmental effects
and proposals deemed harmful would be changed. Polish officials
previously have suggested holding some skiing events at Poprad to
prevent alterations in the Tatra National Park.
	   Other competitors for the 2006 Games are Poprad-Tatry in
Slovakia; Sion, Switzerland; Turin, Italy; a joint bid by Helsinki,
Finland, and Lillehammer, Norway; and Klagenfurt, Austria, making a
three-country bid that includes regions of Slovenia and Italy.
	   The IOC will choose the winner in June.

Woman's body exhumed after mother tracks down alleged killers

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ The body of a female student was exhumed
for tests Tuesday after her mother claimed to have tracked down her
alleged killers by disguising herself as a prostitute.
	   Case files on 20-year-old Paraskevi Fotiadou, who a coroner said
died of a heroin overdose in June, were reopened this month as a
result of her mother's investigation.
	   Eleni Fotiadou, 44, posed as a hooker and a drug addict to delve
into this northern port city's underworld in an effort to find out
how her daughter died.
	   She said that with the help of a private investigator, she spent
weeks among prostitutes, drug dealers and addicts to gather video
and audio tapes as evidence.
	   As a result, authorities announced on Dec. 3 that eight people
were indicted in connection with the case and face charges
including gang rape and murder.
	   Fotiadou believes her daughter did not die of a heroin overdose,
but was brutally raped, murdered and then injected with drugs to
make the death appear drug-related.
	   The forensic tests on the exhumed body could take weeks.

Frosty relations between Greece, Macedonia appear ready to thaw

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ In an indication of improved ties
between two Balkan neighbors, Greece's foreign minister met in
Macedonia Tuesday with government officials. But talks revealed
some differences remain.
	   Theodoros Pangalos' one-day trip is the first official visit by
a European Union minister since the new Macedonian government was
sworn in after October's general elections.
	   Pangalos and his counterpart, Aleksandar Dimitrov, said their
talks concentrated on economic issues, including discussions on a
possible oil pipeline connecting the northern Greek port of
Salonica with Skopje, and new rail and road links.
	   Both sides agreed a long-standing squabble over the former
Yugoslav republic's name should not get in the way of economic
cooperation.
	   Greece claims the use of the name ``Macedonia'' masks
expansionist aims by its neighbor, and insists the northern Greek
province of Macedonia is the only region entitled to the name.
Talks held under United Nations auspices in New York to resolve the
dispute have made little headway, with 19 rounds of negotiations
already completed.
	   The dispute led to a crippling embargo imposed by Greece on
Macedonia in 1994. Although the embargo was lifted in 1995
following an interim agreement, relations remained frosty.
	   Greece recognizes Macedonia as the ``Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia,'' and will deal with the country only when it uses that
name, which is also the one officially used by the U.N. General
Assembly.
	   The Balkan neighbors are eager to concentrate on now burgeoning
economic ties, but fear the name issue could interfere. The issue
``is a ... hurdle in our relations and is not in accordance with
the mutual desire for cooperation,'' Dimitrov said. His Greek
counterpart agreed. ``It needs courage ... to look forward and
overcome the miseries of the past,'' Pangalos noted.
	   But other problems remain in bilateral relations.
	   Macedonia claims there is a Slavic minority living in northern
Greece, but this is not recognized by Athens.
	   ``Greece will never recognize a Slavic minority in western
Macedonia,'' Pangalos said referring to the northern Greek region.
	   During a joint news conference, Dimitrov stressed such problems
should not pervade bilateral relations. ``We are conscious that
there are particular problems between our countries, but ... we
agreed to make many efforts to solve them so we can turn to the
future,'' he said.
	   Macedonia, which borders ethnically tense Kosovo province, is
particularly interested in reducing friction with its neighbors.
The new government's hopes to eventually join international
organizations such as NATO and the European Union add impetus to
the drive for improving relations with EU member Greece.
	   One of the new government's first decisions was to allow the
deployment on Macedonian soil of a 1,800-strong NATO rapid reaction
force, designed to provide assistance to 2,000 international
verifiers monitoring the situation in neighboring Kosovo.
	   Macedonia seceded from Yugoslavia in 1991 - the only former
Yugoslav republic to do so without bloodshed. It joined NATO's
Partnership for Peace Program in 1995.

Iraq claims U.S.-British planes fired missiles at Basra

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Tuesday accused U.S.-British
warplanes of firing two missiles toward the southern city of Basra,
saying the renewed aggression was part of a policy ``to harm
Iraq.''
	   The Pentagon and the British Defense Ministry denied the claim,
which was reported by the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   Iraq also warned Tuesday that it won't forgive the oil-rich
emirate of Kuwait for allowing the United States and Britain to use
its military bases to mount last week's airstrikes against the
country.
	   Quoting an unnamed spokesman for the Ministry of Culture and
Information, the Iraqi News Agency dismissed Kuwaiti statements
that the emirate was not involved in the Dec. 16-19 airstrikes.
	   ``This justification does not vindicate the (ruling) family ...
of such treacherous and criminal acts it perpetrated against the
Iraqi people,'' INA said.
	   Meanwhile, INA also reported that three children were killed and
20 others wounded in the southern province of Wasit as a result of
the U.S-British assault. It did not elaborate.
	   The casualties would be in addition to the 62 soldiers and an
unspecified number of civilians that Iraq says were killed in the
strikes. The United States says the air raids and 425 Tomahawk
cruise missile strikes targeted defense sites to reduce Iraq's
ability to build weapons of mass destruction.
	   Tensions that had subsided following the end of the punishing
strikes rose again briefly when INA reported that aircraft from the
``criminal aggressors'' came in two waves and violated Iraqi
airspace.
	   It quoted an unnamed military spokesman as saying that ``four
formations of aircraft'' flew over Iraq Tuesday morning and
returned in the direction from which they came.
	   The agency said five more formations entered Iraq about five
hours later, at 2:17 p.m. (1117gmt) ``and approached southern Basra
out of range of our weapons and fired two stray missiles before
fleeing.''
	   ``This violation is part of the policy to harm Iraq,'' the
agency added.
	   The Iraqi report did not define what it meant by ``stray
missiles'' or say if they hit anything.
	   A Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Patrick Sivigny, said ``U.S.
forces have not fired any missiles.'' Britain also said there was
no evidence that any British plane had fired a missile over Iraq
Tuesday.
	   ``As far as we are aware, there is nothing to suggest that this
took place,'' a Defense Ministry spokesman said on the customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The conflicting reports could not be immediately reconciled.
	   Western jets patrolling a no-fly zone over southern Iraq have in
the past fired if approached by Iraqi aircraft or if Iraqi
anti-aircraft batteries locked their targeting radar on the
aircraft.
	   Following the recent bombing campaign, Iraq demanded an end to
no-fly zones in the north and south of the country. The exclusion
zones cover about two-thirds of the country.
	   Also Tuesday, four U.S. peace activists staged a demonstration
at Saddam Medical City _ a hospital complex in Baghdad _ to protest
against the attacks and strong U.S. support for economic sanctions
against Iraq.
	   The members of the Voices in the Wilderness group lit a lamp
using Iraqi oil that they purchased in violation of the U.N.
embargo. The sanctions were imposed following Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
	   ``We bought the oil from Iraq in an open and public defiance of
U.S.-U.N. sanctions,'' said the group's leader, Kathy Kelly of
Chicago, Illinois.
	   The sanctions cannot be lifted until a U.N. weapons inspection
commission certifies that Iraq no more possesses or has the ability
to produce nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles. U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering reiterated
that Tuesday.
	   But following the airstrikes, Iraq declared it will not allow
the U.N. commission to work again in the country.
	   On Tuesday, the government said reconstruction teams were
repairing damage from the strikes, and state television showed
pictures of masons and other workers rebuilding a destroyed house
in Baghdad.
	   Civil defense teams collected unexploded missiles and bombs, the
Iraqi News Agency said. It said the teams defused 65 cluster bombs
and two missiles in the southern province of Wasit.
	   Also, more than 100 U.N. relief workers, who were evacuated to
Amman amid the bombing campaign left the Jordanian capital for
Baghdad Tuesday.

	   The introduction of the euro, a common currency for 11 countries
in Europe, on Jan. 4 will bring several changes to two AP financial
market fixtures. Here's a rundown:
	    &UR; FOREIGN CURRENCY TABLES &QC; 
	   Starting with tables produced Monday, Jan. 4, quotes for the ECU
and its forward contracts will be listed as euro. This item is
slugged BC-US-Foreign Exchange and moves to all points.
	   The currencies from the 11 participating countries will still
appear in the table. There will be a three-year transition period
during which euros and the existing national currencies will both
be recognized as legal tender.
	   However, during this time, the national currencies from the 11
countries will be locked to the euro, meaning that they will move
in unison against the dollar and other currencies as the euro does.
	   The 11 countries launching the euro are Austria, Belgium,
Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.
	    &UR; FOREIGN STOCK TABLES &QC; 
	   Starting Jan. 4, tables that show the prices of stocks traded in
the 11 countries using the euro will be quoted in euros. This item
is slugged BC-Europe Markets, which moves to subscribers in Europe
and Latin America.
	   The list that moves Dec. 31 will contain the current stock price
and the previous stock price in the existing currency. The list
that moves Jan. 4 will have both prices in euros.
	   The exchanges affected are: Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt,
Madrid, Milan, Paris. Exchanges in the list that won't be changing
are: Johannesburg, London, Stockholm and Zurich.

Russian Communists plan to give quick approval to budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: AMs. UPDATES with World Bank promising to free up loan in last
3 grafs. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament is likely to give the 1999
draft budget preliminary approval Thursday, lawmakers said Tuesday
_ but final passage could still stall during later debates.
	   Russia desperately needs an austere, realistic budget for
resolving the economic crisis. The lower house of parliament, the
State Duma, is to begin discussing the draft budget Thursday.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov _ whose parliamentary faction
has formed the main resistance to passage of the government's
budgets in recent years _ said Tuesday that while he wasn't
entirely pleased with the draft budget, his party would probably
give it initial approval.
	   ``We have a difficult choice between bad and very bad because
the present government has inherited from its predecessors only
debts and troubles, but no resources,'' Zyuganov told Russian news
agencies.
	   Communists are the largest group in parliament, and they have
made the passage of past years' budgets stretch into months of
rancorous debate. The budgets are generally passed months into the
new year.
	   But Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's new Cabinet was formed as
a compromise with the Communist opposition, and includes several
communists. Because of that, many observers say Zyuganov may
abandon his political grandstanding and opposition to the
government.
	   ``The budget, it appears, should be passed on the first
reading,'' Zyuganov said.
	   Other factions also said they would support the budget during
the first reading.
	   However, the first reading has traditionally been the easiest
hurdle to clear. The draft would then need to go through three more
approvals.
	   Major delays usually begin during the second reading, when
lawmakers start to debate details of the distribution of budget
funds.
	   ``Delays with (the budget's) approval, development of all sorts
of lobbyist processes in the Duma ... would not make the budget
better, but would make it less and less realistic,'' President
Boris Yeltsin's economic adviser Alexander Voloshin warned Tuesday.
	   The Communists are calling for more state spending to help
impoverished Russians and ailing industries. Zyuganov also said he
wanted to see more money for the military, education and culture.
	   But because of the economic crisis, the government has even less
money to spend on these areas than in the past.
	   For example, the draft budget envisages an increase of 80
billion rubles (dlrs 3.9 billion), or 22 percent, compared to last
year in spending for science and support to impoverished people,
Voloshin said.
	   However, the budget also forecasts 30 percent inflation, so the
ostensible increase will actually result in less money for those
areas, Voloshin conceded.
	   Russia's markets crumbled this summer, succumbing to global
financial uncertainty, and the country is now facing its worst
economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   Russia won some good news Tuesday: a promise of its first loans
from the World Bank since the government devalued the ruble and
defaulted on debt in August, prompting international lenders to
freeze aid.
	   The bank approved a dlrs 400 million loan Tuesday for repairs
and construction on Russia's vast road system, Michael Carter, the
bank's director for Russia, was quoted by Interfax as saying.
	   It did not say when the money was to be released.

Argentine human rights activist, Emilio Mignone, dead at 76
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Emilio Fermin Mignone, an
Argentine human rights activist who fought to reveal the abuses
suffered under past military dictatorship, has died. He was 76.
	   Mignone died Monday night, said a spokesman for the Center of
Legal and Social Studies, a human rights group Mingone helped
found.
	   The May 1976 disappearance of his daughter, Monica, motivated
Mignone to begin his tireless crusade in defense of human rights in
Argentina.
	   Under a military junta which ruled Argentina from 1976-83, some
9,000 people disappeared, the government has said. Human rights
groups insist the number is closer to 30,000.
	   Two years after the military's fall, in 1985, Mignone was an
important witness in the public trials of the junta's former
leaders.
	   He later founded the Center of Legal and Social Studies, one of
Argentina's leading human rights organizations. He also wrote
several books about the country's darkest chapter, including ``The
Church and the Dictatorship'' and ``The Violation of Human Rights
in Argentina.''
	   He is survived by his wife, Angelica Paula Sosa, and four
daughters.

	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ The body of a Greek student was exhumed
for tests Tuesday after her mother claimed to have tracked down her
alleged killers by disguising herself as a prostitute.
	   Case files on 20-year-old Paraskevi Fotiadou, who a coroner said
died of a heroin overdose in June, were reopened this month as a
result of her mother's investigation.
	   Eleni Fotiadou, 44, posed as a hooker and a drug addict to delve
into this northern port city's underworld in an effort to find out
how her daughter died.
	   She said that with the help of a private investigator, she spent
weeks among prostitutes, drug dealers and addicts to gather video
and audio tapes as evidence.
	   As a result, authorities announced on Dec. 3 that eight people
were indicted in connection with the case and face charges
including gang rape and murder.
	   Fotiadou believes her daughter did not die of a heroin overdose,
but was brutally raped, murdered and then injected with drugs to
make the death appear drug-related.
	   The forensic tests on the exhumed body could take weeks.

Former Turkish minister implicated in wiretapping scandal

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A small party has asked the prosecutor's
office to investigate a former interior minister for allegedly
illegally eavesdropping on the country's top-selling newspaper, a
party official said Tuesday.
	   The bid by the leftist Freedom and Solidarity Party came after
the former minister, Meral Aksener, disclosed transcripts of
telephone conversations between a prominent writer of daily
Hurriyet and a minister.
	   ``This is Turkey's Watergate,'' said Atilla Aytemur, a party
official. ``Aksener has to resign immediately as a deputy and be
brought before justice.''
	   Aksener presented the tapes last week with a claim that Hurriyet
maintained close business ties with the government.
	   In the tapes, Hurriyet's editor-in-chief Ertugrul Ozkok and
state minister Gunes Taner were discussing a state loan the paper
asked for a cardboard factory.
	   Ozkok, who confirmed the conversation, was interrogated on
Tuesday in an investigation ordered by Premier Mesut Yilmaz.
	   Ozkok has also petitioned the prosecutor's office for the trial
of Aksener.
	   Aksener is a deputy chairperson of former premier Tansu Ciller's
center-right True Path Party.
	   Conviction for wiretapping without a court order can bring a
sentence of up to three years in prison.
	   Aksener has claimed the tapes, including other conversations by
Hurriyet officials, were given to her by a ``patriot.'' But
newspapers charged that she had her own telephone taping gang
within the interior ministry.
	   Ozkok has contended his responsibilities required him to deal
with the trade affairs of the paper as a highest-ranking official
as well.

Guardians, inmates injured in Turkish prison unrest

<TEXT>
	   IZMIR, Turkey (AP) _ A group of leftist inmates on Tuesday
attacked prison wards with water pipes dismantled from a ward in a
second day of clashes at a prison in this Aegean port city, the
Anatolia news agency reported.
	   Four prison guards and three inmates, belonging to the outlawed
Turkish Revolutionary Communists Union, were slightly injured.
	   The attack was staged in support of another group of leftist
prisoners who on Monday assaulted prison guards with broken glass
after setting their ward on fire to protest the arrest of some of
their comrades. Eight guards were slightly injured in the fighting
and the small blaze was quickly extinguished.
	   The rioting erupted when a group of supporters were taken away
by police Monday for chanting obscenities at security officials
outside the gates of Izmir's Buca prison.

Palestinian journalists protest crackdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinian journalists held a
sit-in Tuesday against repression of the press, closely watched by
security officials armed with video cameras.
	   The Palestinian Authority last week briefly detained at least
ten journalists and shut down several local TV and radio stations
following coverage of pro-Iraqi demonstrations in Palestinian-held
territories.
	   About 100 journalists participated in the sit-in outside the
Palestinian legislature. They bore a coffin draped in newspapers
and magazines on their shoulders.
	   ``Our place is not at the police anti-crime unit,'' one placard
read. ``Yes to freedom of speech,'' said another.
	   The journalists called on the Palestinian Authority to implement
the legislature's Printing and Publishing Law, which includes
guarantees of freedom of the press.
	   That law ``should be the only judge of how to treat the
Palestinian journalist,'' the deputy head of the Palestinian
Journalists Syndicate told the protesters.
	   ``What happened last Friday, detaining journalists at the
Department of the Defense of Morals of the anti-crime unit ... is a
severe violation of the law and freedom,'' Tawfik Abu Khoussa said.
	   Ten police belonging to the anti-crime unit filmed the
proceedings on hand-held cameras, making sure to get each protester
on film.
	   The Palestinian Authority is anxious to sustain good relations
with the United States, and had asked journalists to avoid filming
anti-U.S. protests during last week's U.S.-British bombing of Iraq.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ She lost her baby girl and
nearly her own life.
	   But against the odds of medical science a Catholic homemaker
finally walked out of hospital Tuesday _ more than four months
after being caught in ground zero of Northern Ireland's worst-ever
terrorist attack.
	   Tracey Devine, 27, suffered a slashed face and burns all over
her body when Irish Republican Army dissidents detonated a car bomb
in Omagh, a religiously mixed market town 60 miles (100 kms) west
of Belfast. In all, 29 people died and 370 were wounded in the Aug.
15 blast.
	   Mrs. Devine spent six weeks in a coma in Belfast's Royal
Victoria Hospital. When she awoke, her husband Paul had to tell her
their youngest child, 21-month-old Breda, was among the dead.
	   ``It was one of the hardest things I ever had to do,'' he said,
holding hands with his wife, whose head remains tightly bound with
a plastic face guard, neck brace and bandages. ``She did cope with
it quite well.''
	   Mrs. Devine retains clear memories of the day she traveled from
her village of Donemana to Omagh, accompanied by Breda, her brother
Gary and fiancee Donna Marie. Like so many others, they were
shepherded nearer the bomb by police responding to a misleading
phoned warning.
	   ``The bomb went off right beside us. Wee Breda disappeared in a
flash of light,'' she said, noting that her brother and future
sister-in-law also suffered serious burns.
	   The breakaway IRA faction responsible later called a cease-fire,
though none of its members has been directly charged in connection
with the atrocity.
	   ``I hope somebody forgives them because I never will,'' she
said.
	   Her plastic surgeon, Dr. Mohammed Riaz, said she had stood less
than 30 percent chance of survival but ``proved to be a fighter.''
	   Although she had already endured more than 30 hours of
operations to reconstruct parts of her face and body torn by
shrapnel, Riaz said, ``She's going to require a lot more to get
these scars settled down. It's a long way to go yet.''
	   But those worries are for another day, Mrs. Devine said.
	   ``It's really great to be getting home _ home for Christmas with
the other children,'' she said of Anne, 6, Niamh, 4 and Shay, 2.
``They know Breda won't be coming back, but they're glad they're
going to get their mummy back for Christmas.''

ECB announces two further interest rates cuts for post-Jan. 1 euro

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES after news conference, RECASTS throughout &QL;

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ In a novel approach reflecting the
uncertainties of the Jan. 1 launch of Europe's new currency, the
euro, European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said Tuesday
the bank had decided on an especially narrow corridor for two money
market rates _ for the first three weeks of the euro's existence.
	   After Jan. 21, the rates would revert to a broader corridor.
	   The euro-zone's key interest rate, the securities repurchase
rate, was fixed at 3 percent at the beginning of December, removing
early uncertainty about the setting of the key rate for the euro
area.
	   But in a surprise move, Duisenberg announced two other rates -
the marginal lending and deposit rates - would be set at just 3.25
and 2.75 percent respectively until Jan. 21, when they would
broaden to 4.5 and 2 percent.
	   The rates represent the ceiling and floor of money market
operations.
	   ``The many novelties related to the changeover make it difficult
to foresee whether the euro area money market will indeed work in a
fully integrated way immediately from the very first day,''
Duisenberg said at the bank's last news conference before the
launch.
	   ``This exceptional narrow corridor, of 50 basis points, ... aims
at smoothing the adaptation of market participants,'' he said.
	   The post-Jan. 21 corridor was far broader than analysts had
expected, demonstrating again the ECB's capacity to surprise
markets.
	   Markets were taken by surprise by coordinated rate cuts on Dec.
3 by the 11 euro nations launching the euro.
	   The ECB hopes markets will interpret the bank's ability to
spring surprises as a sign of strength.
	   With just over a week remaining to the begin of the historic
project of currency union, Duisenberg called on governments
launching the euro to stick to promised budgetary discipline.
	   ``Continue to exude ... the political impetus to achieve over
the medium-term balanced budgets and even a small surplus,''
Duisenberg said.
	   ``What I would advise governments to do is to inspire that
feeling of continuity and stability - sooner rather than later.''
	   Calling the euro-zone's core interest rate of 3 percent ``very
low by historical standards,'' Duisenberg said further cuts were
unlikely.
	   ``Markets _ don't expect a change of interest rates in the near
future.''
	   Europe's economy, burdened by instability in the global economy,
has grown by just 2.4 percent in the third quarter over the
previous quarter, about half a percent lower than the average
growth in the first six months compared to 1997's first six months.
	   ``The outlook for the euro area economy is still very much
influenced by the uncertainties surrounding the evolution of the
world economy in 1999,'' Duisenberg said, with industrial
confidence down. He said the ECB would monitor rising wage demands
in some countries as they could create inflation.
	   Despite the uncertain international situation, Duisenberg said
he was optimistic.
	   ``As far as Europe is concerned, (the euro) is being launched
under optimal economic conditions.''
	   From Jan. 1, the 11 national currencies will become
sub-divisions of the euro. Only the ECB will have the authority to
issue national bank notes and approve the volume of coins.
	   By spring, the ECB would have in place prodecures for the 11
national central banks to request authorization to issue national
bank notes.
	   The euro will be phased in slowly. National currencies will
circulate until Jan 1, 2002, when they will be replaced by the new
currency.

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ While doctors guard the fragile health of the
world's first surviving set of octuplets, the births have rekindled
the medical community's debate over the use of fertility drugs.
	   By the time Nkem Chukwu's (nih-KEHM chuhk-WOO's) eight tiny
children are well enough to be taken home, an estimated dlrs 2
million will have been spent on their care, predicted Dr. Leonard
Weisman, chief neonatologist at Texas Children's Hospital.
	   Dr. Randle Corfman, director of the Midwest Center for
Reproductive Health in Robbinsdale, Minnesota, worried that
insurance companies may reconsider providing health coverage for
women like Mrs. Chukwu who have fertility treatment.
	   Others question whether parents who take fertility drugs really
understand the health risks of underdeveloped multiple births.
	   ``The fact is that the vast majority of these cases (of
quadruplets or more) end in disaster, sometimes for the mom, most
often for the babies,'' Dr. Alan Copperman said in today's New York
Times.
	   Copperman, director of reproductive endocrinology at Mount
Sinai-New York University Medical Center, said every time a case
like the Chukwus' comes along, desperate couples become more
willing to take greater risks.
	   A Saudi woman gave birth to three girls and four boys in
January, and the McCaughey septuplets were born in Iowa just 13
months ago. All of those babies have survived.
	   Doctors said the Chukwu's infants, who have not yet been named,
could be in the hospital for up to two months, while their mother
may be released within a week.
	   The six girls and two boys remained in critical but stable
condition today after an uneventful night at the children's
hospital. ``There have been no significant changes in the babies'
conditions,'' Weisman said. ``In these cases, no news is good
news.''
	   Their mother, at neighboring St. Luke's hospital, was moved from
the intensive care unit into a private room, ``much improved and in
very good spirits,'' according to the hospital's Web site.
	   Chief among the worries with the Chukwu children was lung
development. Baby A, the girl born Dec. 8, was delivered 15 weeks
premature. Her two brothers and five sisters were born Sunday
morning, 13 weeks early. All were placed on ventilators.
	   ``It's alarming in the sense premature babies have problems,''
Weisman said.
	   Dr. Brian Kirshon, who delivered the octuplets, said the woman
and her husband, Iyke Chukwu, a respiratory therapist at a Houston
hospital, rejected the idea of ``selective reduction,'' a technique
in which doctors abort some fetuses so others have a better chance
of survival.
	   ``It was totally out of the question,'' to the deeply religious,
Nigerian-born couple, Kirshon said.
	   The octuplets are covered by the family's insurance. But it's a
matter of time, according to Corfman, before insurance companies
reexamine how to cover infertility treatments when multiple births
produce such sickly children.
	   ``Our fear is that is exactly what will happen,'' he said.
``They'll say we cannot cover this.
	   ``When we use these medicines we have to be conscious of the
fact that we cannot predict with certainty which eggs will take.
When we start cranking up having the woman produce more than one
egg, we run the risk of producing more than one baby.''
	   And more babies in a womb designed to hold just one increases
the likelihood the infants will have undersized lungs, brains and
hearts.
	   Weisman said the advent of fertility treatments has forced the
medical community to confront the ethical issues surrounding
multiple births.
	   Should doctors, for example, be more aggressive about promoting
selective reduction? And should multiple births, which are
increasing annually, be viewed as successful notwithstanding the
health risks?
	   ``For certain families who are having trouble conceiving I think
they are a success,'' Weisman said. ``The problem, the side effect
is you wind up with all these multiple pregnancies, multiple births
which result in a lot of increase in health problems.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ The Ministry of Defense on Tuesday detailed some
of the sites targeted by last week's four-day U.S.-British
airstrike against Saddam Hussein's Iraqi regime, as Germany's
defense minister repeated his country's backing for the military
action.
	   ``The German government has made clear we are supporting the
United States and the United Kingdom because military action,
regrettably, was necessary,'' Rudolf Scharping said at a news
conference after talks with his British counterpart, George
Robertson.
	   Scharping's opinion differed from that of German Foreign
Secretary Joschka Fischer, who said in a German TV interview late
Monday that efforts to tame Iraq were a ``no-win situation'' that
war would not solve, and called for ``a combination of continuing
disarmament controls in Iraq with humanitarian measures and a
step-by-step lifting of sanctions.''
	   Scharping, however, called Saddam Hussein a ``political
gangster.''
	   ``Such a state as Iraq has to respect the decisions of the
(United Nations) Security Council. If not, military action is
necessary,'' Scharping said. ``We hope after that military action,
Iraq is ready to act in full compliance with the United Nations.''
	   At a Ministry of Defense briefing, Air Marshall John Day, deputy
chief of Britain's defense staff, said that 85 of the 100 sites
targeted by the airstrikes were hit, with 74 percent classified as
successful missions.
	   Day said that 16 of the strikes were against surface-to-air
missile sites, and 18 were against integrated air defense systems.
In both cases, the Royal Air Force carried out three of the
attacks.
	   Day said that 18 sites providing security for Iraqi attempts to
develop weapons of mass destruction were hit, as were 12 industrial
sites connected to the weapons program.
	   The U.S.-British airstrikes also targeted 20 command and control
sites, six airfields, nine Republican Guard sites, and one economic
target, Day said.
	   Eleven out of the 100 missions were flown by Royal Air Force
Tornado GR1 fighter-bombers stationed 35 miles from the southern
Iraqi border in Kuwait, Day said, adding that the British success
rate in missions was similar to that of the United States.
	   Day said that British bomb damage assessments were deliberately
conservative, ``because it is important the results are right,
particularly where subsequent action depend on those results.''
	   ``For instance, we would wish to be very sure of an assessment
that a surface-to-air missile system had been destroyed before
permitting aircrew to ignore that site during subsequent mission
planning,'' said Day.
	   Day said the action had significantly damaged Saddam's ability
to produce and repair ballistic missiles, and had also hit his L29
unmanned aircraft program.
	   ``As a consequence of our attacks on his military capability,
and particularly on those forces closely associated with his
weapons of mass destruction concealment program, those close to
Saddam will realize that we have the ability to target the regime
as distinct from the Iraqi people,'' Day said.
	   Iraq's refusal to cooperate fully with United Nations inspectors
searching for weapons of mass destruction prompted the United
States and Britain to attack last week, both nations have said.
President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair
declared a halt to the effort Saturday evening.

Suspect arrested in UEFA Cup knife-throwing incident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Police on Tuesday arrested a 19-year-old
man who allegedly threw a knife that struck Italian soccer player
Dino Baggio, injuring him during a UEFA Cup match in Krakow in
October.
	   The PAP state news agency reported the man, identified as Pawel
Michalski, was arrested in Krakow, according to Malgorzata
Wilkosz-Sliwa, a spokeswoman for the local prosecutor's office.
	   If convicted of throwing the knife that injured Baggio, the
suspect could receive a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.
	   Baggio was hit by a knife thrown from the stands in the 80th
minute of the second-round, first-leg match between AC Parma and
Wisla Krakow on Oct. 20. He needed five stitches to close a head
wound.
	   The teams tied 1-1, and AC Parma won the second game 2-1 at home
to advance 3-2 on aggregate.
	   UEFA banned Wisla Krakow from European competition for one year,
meaning the club will be disqualified from the first European
competition it qualifies to compete in over the next five years.

Talks on ending miners' protest fail to reach agreement

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Talks intended to resolve a growing labor
dispute in Poland failed to reach agreement Tuesday, and a union
official said workers' protests would continue.
	   Hundreds of coal miners have joined an underground sit-in at
more than 50 mines in southern Poland to demand that their early
retirement pension plan for working in dangerous conditions should
remain intact.
	   In a separate protest, scores of miners gathered Tuesday in
Warsaw to urge President Aleksander Kwasniewski to veto pension law
changes passed by parliament and awaiting his signature.
	   Miners also staged a warning strike Monday, during which they
voted overwhelmingly for a national strike on an undetermined date,
probably in mid-January, if their demands remain unmet.
	   The bill passed by parliament this month changes pension rules
to make the retirement age 65 for men and 60 for women. Current
rules pay full pensions to miners and others working in dangerous
conditions who have 25 years of duty, no matter their age.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said before Tuesday's talks between
government, employer and labor officials that he expected an
agreement. He said his government never intended to eliminate the
early retirement pensions.
	   But after the meeting, which lasted more than two hours,
management and union officials provided differing versions of what
happened.
	   Wojciech Kornowski, head of the Confederation of Polish
Employers, said miners would receive so-called ``bridge'' pensions
of 70 percent of their monthly wages if they retire with 25 years
of service before the legal age, the PAP state news agency
reported. They would receive the regular full pension when they
reach the legal retirement age.
	   Details of the plan _ such as who will pay for the bridge
pensions _ still needed to be worked out, with more talks scheduled
between the government and employers in early January, Kornowski
said. He added that the offer should end the miners' protests.
	   But Henryk Nakonieczny, leader of the Solidarity union's
National Hard Coal Mining section, said the talks produced no
written agreement.
	   ``Tomorrow we shall determine how to continue the protest,'' he
said, according to the PAP report.
	   Solidarity miners, who began the sit-in Dec. 10, also oppose a
mining restructuring plan that would cut jobs and production.
	   Buzek's Solidarity-led governing coalition, which took power in
October 1997 from a leftist government, has been working on
widespread social and economic reforms expected to complete
Poland's transition from communism to a market economy.
	   The reforms include restructuring ailing industries such as
mining and steel. Coal mining restructuring calls for reducing
production from 137 million tons last year to 110 million tons in
2002, as well as cutting jobs by more than 40 percent _ from
245,000 now to 138,000 in three years.
	   Coal mining, once the country's leading hard-currency earner
during communist times, is still heavily subsidized under Poland's
market reforms that began in 1989.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq accused U.S. and British warplanes of
firing two missiles toward the southern city of Basra on Tuesday,
saying the renewed aggression was part of a policy ``to harm
Iraq.''
	   The Pentagon and the British Defense Ministry denied the claim,
which was reported by the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   Iraq also warned Tuesday that it won't forgive the oil-rich
emirate of Kuwait for allowing the United States and Britain to use
its military bases to mount last week's airstrikes against the
country.
	   Quoting an unnamed spokesman for the Ministry of Culture and
Information, the Iraqi News Agency dismissed Kuwaiti statements
that the emirate was not involved in the Dec. 16-19 airstrikes.
	   ``This justification does not vindicate the (ruling) family ...
of such treacherous and criminal acts it perpetrated against the
Iraqi people,'' INA said.
	   Meanwhile, INA also reported that three children were killed and
20 others wounded in the southern province of Wasit as a result of
the U.S-British assault. It did not elaborate.
	   The casualties would be in addition to the 62 soldiers and an
unspecified number of civilians that Iraq says were killed in the
strikes. The United States says the air raids and 425 Tomahawk
cruise missile strikes targeted defense sites to reduce Iraq's
ability to build weapons of mass destruction.
	   Tensions that had subsided following the end of the punishing
strikes rose again briefly when INA reported that aircraft from the
``criminal aggressors'' came in two waves and violated Iraqi
airspace.
	   It quoted an unnamed military spokesman as saying that ``four
formations of aircraft'' flew over Iraq Tuesday morning and
returned in the direction from which they came.
	   The agency said five more formations entered Iraq about five
hours later, at 2:17 p.m. (1117gmt) ``and approached southern Basra
out of range of our weapons and fired two stray missiles before
fleeing.''
	   ``This violation is part of the policy to harm Iraq,'' the
agency added.
	   A Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Patrick Sivigny, said ``U.S.
forces have not fired any missiles.'' Britain also said there was
no evidence that any British plane had fired a missile over Iraq on
Tuesday.
	   ``As far as we are aware, there is nothing to suggest that this
took place,'' a Defense Ministry spokesman said on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The conflicting reports could not be immediately reconciled.
	   Western jets patrolling a no-fly zone over southern Iraq have in
the past fired if approached by Iraqi aircraft or if Iraqi
anti-aircraft batteries locked their targeting radar on the
aircraft.
	   Following the recent bombing campaign, Iraq demanded an end to
the no-fly zones in the north and south of the country. The
exclusion zones cover about two-thirds of the country.
	   Also Tuesday, four U.S. peace activists staged a demonstration
at Saddam Medical City _ a hospital complex in Baghdad _ to protest
the attacks and strong U.S. support for economic sanctions against
Iraq.
	   The members of the Voices in the Wilderness group lit a lamp
using Iraqi oil that they purchased in violation of the U.N.
embargo. The sanctions were imposed following Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
	   ``We bought the oil from Iraq in an open and public defiance of
U.S.-U.N. sanctions,'' said the group's leader, Kathy Kelly of
Chicago, Illinois.
	   The sanctions cannot be lifted until a U.N. weapons inspection
commission certifies that Iraq no longer possesses or has the
ability to produce nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and
long-range missiles. U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering
reiterated that Tuesday.
	   But following the airstrikes, Iraq declared it will not allow
the U.N. commission to work again in the country.
	   On Tuesday, the government said reconstruction teams were
repairing damage from the strikes, and state television showed
pictures of masons and other workers rebuilding a destroyed house
in Baghdad.
	   Civil defense teams collected unexploded missiles and bombs, the
Iraqi News Agency said. It said the teams defused 65 cluster bombs
and two missiles in the southern province of Wasit.
	   Also, more than 100 U.N. relief workers, who were evacuated to
Amman amid the bombing campaign left the Jordanian capital Tuesday
for Baghdad.

Official urges closure of Russian pulp mill to save Lake Baikal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A major Siberian pulp mill must be closed or
rehauled to save the environment around Lake Baikal, where toxic
waste is killing animals and plants, a government official said
Tuesday.
	   A recent inspection of the Baikal Pulp and Paper Mill revealed
``systematic violations of environmental laws,'' the ITAR-Tass news
agency quoted Viktor Kutsenko, head of the safety department of the
State Environment Committee, as saying.
	   The plant is spilling highly toxic waste directly into Lake
Baikal and contaminating the ground water with other waste
products, he said.
	   The lake is home to nearly 1,000 animal species found nowhere
else in the world and holds about 20 percent of the world's supply
of fresh water.
	   Kutsenko recommended that the mill be shut down or redesigned to
be environmentally safe, ITAR-Tass said. It was unclear what
influence Kutsenko's recommendation would have.
	   The plant insists such a conversion would cripple it
financially.
	   The mill was built 30 years ago, and mainly supplied the Soviet
aircraft industry.
	   Environmental groups have been calling for the its shutdown for
years. Last year, dozens of Lake Baikal's unique species of
freshwater seals died mysteriously, and environmentalists blamed it
on chemical waste from the mill.

 &UR; Frosty relations between Greece, Macedonia appear ready to thaw
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with quotes from Pangalos,
Dimitrov, details. Trims &QL; 
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ In an indication of improved ties
between two Balkan neighbors, Greece's foreign minister met in
Macedonia Tuesday with government officials. But talks revealed
some differences remain.
	   Theodoros Pangalos' one-day trip is the first official visit by
a European Union minister since the new Macedonian government was
sworn in after October's general elections.
	   Pangalos and his counterpart, Aleksandar Dimitrov, said their
talks concentrated on economic issues, including discussions on a
possible oil pipeline connecting the northern Greek port of
Salonica with Skopje, and new rail and road links.
	   Both sides agreed a long-standing squabble over the former
Yugoslav republic's name should not get in the way of economic
cooperation.
	   Greece claims the use of the name ``Macedonia'' masks
expansionist aims by its neighbor, and insists the northern Greek
province of Macedonia is the only region entitled to the name.
Talks held under United Nations auspices in New York to resolve the
dispute have made little headway, with 19 rounds of negotiations
already completed.
	   The dispute led to a crippling embargo imposed by Greece on
Macedonia in 1994. Although the embargo was lifted in 1995
following an interim agreement, relations remained frosty.
	   Greece recognizes Macedonia as the ``Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia,'' and will deal with the country only when it uses that
name, which is also the one officially used by the U.N. General
Assembly.
	   The Balkan neighbors are eager to concentrate on now burgeoning
economic ties, but fear the name issue could interfere. The issue
``is a ... hurdle in our relations and is not in accordance with
the mutual desire for cooperation,'' Dimitrov said. His Greek
counterpart agreed. ``It needs courage ... to look forward and
overcome the miseries of the past,'' Pangalos noted.
	   But other problems remain in bilateral relations.
	   Macedonia claims there is a Slavic minority living in northern
Greece, but this is not recognized by Athens.
	   ``Greece will never recognize a Slavic minority in western
Macedonia,'' Pangalos said referring to the northern Greek region.
	   During a joint news conference, Dimitrov stressed such problems
should not pervade bilateral relations. ``We are conscious that
there are particular problems between our countries, but ... we
agreed to make many efforts to solve them so we can turn to the
future,'' he said.
	   Macedonia, which borders ethnically tense Kosovo province, is
particularly interested in reducing friction with its neighbors.
The new government's hopes to eventually join international
organizations such as NATO and the European Union add impetus to
the drive for improving relations with EU member Greece.
	   One of the new government's first decisions was to allow the
deployment on Macedonian soil of a 1,800-strong NATO rapid reaction
force, designed to provide assistance to 2,000 international
verifiers monitoring the situation in neighboring Kosovo.
	   Macedonia seceded from Yugoslavia in 1991 - the only former
Yugoslav republic to do so without bloodshed. It joined NATO's
Partnership for Peace Program in 1995.

Prosecutor requests new arrest warrant for Kurdish rebel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Italian premier's office declining to comment on
Ukraine angle &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A day after saying it might be possible for an
Italian court to rule in favor of extraditing Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan to Turkey on some charges, a Rome magistrate was
pushing Tuesday to put him back in jail so he couldn't flee Italy.
	   Italy has so far refused to extradite Ocalan, citing laws that
forbid it from extraditing suspects to countries where they face
the death penalty. But Rome prosecutor Giovanni Malerba indicated
on Monday that Ocalan could be extradited for crimes that do not
carry the death penalty.
	   Turkey considers Ocalan a terrorist and is the country's No. 1
fugitive.
	   Ocalan, who heads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, was
arrested Nov. 12 when he flew into Rome from Moscow. He was ordered
set free a week later but also ordered not to leave Rome.
	   Last week, Rome's appeals court lifted all restrictions on the
Kurdish rebel after Germany withdrew an international arrest
warrant it had issued against him for its own terrorism charges.
	   It is now up to Italy's justice minister to decide whether to
take up Malerba's request for a new arrest warrant.
	   Ocalan has requested political asylum in Italy, but Premier
Massimo D'Alema's center-left government is split over what to do.
	   The possibilities mentioned in both Italian and Turkish media
include sending Ocalan to a third-country. In recent days, South
Africa, Libya, Pakistan or North Korea have been mentioned as
possibilities.
	   On Tuesday, Turkey's private television station TGRT reported
that Italy planned to expel Ocalan to Ukraine and had allegedly
already found him an apartment there. The station said Italian
Industry Minister Pierluigi Bersani had informed Turkish officials
about this during a recent trip to Turkey.
	   The Italian premier's office on Tuesday night declined to
comment on the Ukraine angle, which it called the latest rumor.
	   Close to 37,000 people have been killed since Ocalan's rebel
group began fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey in 1984.

Russian Communists plan to give quick approval to budget

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with World Bank saying most loans postponed until at

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament is likely to give the 1999
draft budget preliminary approval Thursday, lawmakers said Tuesday
_ but final passage could still stall during later debates.
	   Russia desperately needs an austere, realistic budget for
resolving the economic crisis. The lower house of parliament, the
State Duma, is to begin discussing the draft budget Thursday.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov _ whose parliamentary faction
has formed the main resistance to passage of the government's
budgets in recent years _ said Tuesday that while he wasn't
entirely pleased with the draft budget, his party would probably
give it initial approval.
	   ``We have a difficult choice between bad and very bad because
the present government has inherited from its predecessors only
debts and troubles, but no resources,'' Zyuganov told Russian news
agencies.
	   Communists are the largest group in parliament, and they have
made the passage of past years' budgets stretch into months of
rancorous debate. The budgets are generally passed months into the
new year.
	   But Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's new Cabinet was formed as
a compromise with the Communist opposition, and includes several
communists. Because of that, many observers say Zyuganov may
abandon his political grandstanding and opposition to the
government.
	   ``The budget, it appears, should be passed on the first
reading,'' Zyuganov said.
	   Other factions also said they would support the budget during
the first reading.
	   However, the first reading has traditionally been the easiest
hurdle to clear. The draft would then need to go through three more
approvals.
	   Major delays usually begin during the second reading, when
lawmakers start to debate details of the distribution of budget
funds.
	   ``Delays with (the budget's) approval, development of all sorts
of lobbyist processes in the Duma ... would not make the budget
better, but would make it less and less realistic,'' President
Boris Yeltsin's economic adviser Alexander Voloshin warned Tuesday.
	   The Communists are calling for more state spending to help
impoverished Russians and ailing industries. Zyuganov also said he
wanted to see more money for the military, education and culture.
	   But because of the economic crisis, the government has even less
money to spend on these areas than in the past.
	   For example, the draft budget envisages an increase of 80
billion rubles (dlrs 3.9 billion), or 22 percent, compared to last
year in spending for science and support to impoverished people,
Voloshin said.
	   However, the budget also forecasts 30 percent inflation, so the
ostensible increase will actually result in less money for those
areas, Voloshin conceded.
	   Russia's markets crumbled this summer, succumbing to global
financial uncertainty, and the country is now facing its worst
economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   The World Bank said Tuesday that it would not release
	   Russia won some good news Tuesday: a promise of its first loans
from the World Bank since the government devalued the ruble and
defaulted on debt in August, prompting international lenders to
freeze aid.
	   The bank approved a dlrs 400 million loan Tuesday for repairs
and construction on Russia's vast road system, Michael Carter, the
bank's director for Russia, was quoted by Interfax as saying.
	   It did not say when the money was to be released.
	   But Carter also said the bank would not release dlrs 950 million
in promised loans for economic restructuring, social security and
the coal industry until at least March, Interfax reported.

Judiciary chief forms committee to investigate writers' killing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The chief of Iran's hard-line judiciary has
ordered the formation of a committee to investigate a spate of
recent mysterious deaths of dissidents, Tehran newspapers reported
Tuesday.
	   The official, Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, said the special
committee was set up to improve coordination of information and
evidence concerning the killing cases, the Farsi-language Iran and
other newspapers reported. No other details were available.
	   A similar special investigative committee has already been set
up by moderate President Mohammad Khatami, and it was not
immediately clear if the one ordered by Yazdi would work
independently or support the other one.
	   All the five dissidents who died during the last month were
critical of the government's hard-line clergymen who are trying to
stymie the social and political reforms of Khatami.
	   Thousands of students and intellectuals demonstrated last week
to protest the killings and called for the dismissal of Yazdi and
other intelligence officials.
	   There is, however, no evidence linking the hard-liners with the
killings, and the conservative faction has suggested that unnamed
foreign forces and even an opposition group in exile could be
killing dissidents to discredit the government.
	   It all began when the head of an Iranian opposition group,
Dariush Foruhar, and his wife, Parvaneh, were found stabbed to
death in their home on Nov. 22.
	   In the following weeks, writers Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh and
Mohammad Mokhtari, disappeared from their homes and their bodies
were were found dumped on the outskirts of Tehran on different
days. They were apparently strangled.
	   Both had tried to establish a writers' association and had been
summoned by a court two months earlier to answer questions about
their activities.
	   Another writer, Majid Sharif, was also found dead after
disappearing from home. But his family said he may have died of a
heart attack.
	   Two more political activists remain missing.

Frosty relations between Greece, Macedonia appear ready to thaw

	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ In an indication of improved ties
between two Balkan neighbors, Greece's foreign minister met in
Macedonia Tuesday with government officials.
	   Theodoros Pangalos' one-day trip is the first official visit by
a European Union minister since the new Macedonian government was
sworn in after October's general elections.
	   Pangalos and his counterpart, Aleksandar Dimitrov, said their
talks concentrated on economic issues, including discussions on a
possible oil pipeline connecting the northern Greek port of
Salonica with Skopje, and new rail and road links.
	   Both sides agreed a long-standing squabble over the former
Yugoslav republic's name should not get in the way of economic
cooperation.
	   Greece claims the use of the name ``Macedonia'' masks
expansionist aims by its neighbor, and insists the northern Greek
province of Macedonia is the only region entitled to the name.
Talks held under United Nations auspices in New York to resolve the
dispute have made little headway, with 19 rounds of negotiations
already completed.
	   The dispute led to a crippling embargo imposed by Greece on
Macedonia in 1994. Although the embargo was lifted in 1995
following an interim agreement, relations remained frosty.
	   Greece recognizes Macedonia as the ``Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia,'' and will deal with the country only when it uses that
name, which is also the one officially used by the U.N. General
Assembly.
	   The Balkan neighbors are eager to concentrate on now burgeoning
economic ties, but fear the name issue could interfere. The issue
``is a ... hurdle in our relations and is not in accordance with
the mutual desire for cooperation,'' Dimitrov said. His Greek
counterpart agreed. ``It needs courage ... to look forward and
overcome the miseries of the past,'' Pangalos noted.
	   Macedonia, which borders ethnically tense Kosovo province, is
particularly interested in reducing friction with its neighbors.
The new government's hopes to eventually join international
organizations such as NATO and the European Union add impetus to
the drive for improving relations with EU member Greece.
	   One of the new government's first decisions was to allow the
deployment on Macedonian soil of a 1,800-strong NATO rapid reaction
force, designed to provide assistance to 2,000 international
verifiers monitoring the situation in neighboring Kosovo.
	   Macedonia seceded from Yugoslavia in 1991 _ the only former
Yugoslav republic to do so without bloodshed. It joined NATO's
Partnership for Peace Program in 1995.

Palestinian journalists protest crackdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinian journalists held a
sit-in Tuesday to protest repression of the press, closely watched
by security officials armed with video cameras.
	   The Palestinian Authority last week briefly detained at least
ten journalists and shut down several local TV and radio stations
following coverage of pro-Iraqi demonstrations in Palestinian-held
territories.
	   About 100 journalists participated in the sit-in outside the
Palestinian legislature. They bore a coffin draped in newspapers
and magazines on their shoulders.
	   ``Our place is not at the police anti-crime unit,'' one placard
read. ``Yes to freedom of speech,'' said another.
	   The journalists called on the Palestinian Authority to implement
the legislature's Printing and Publishing Law, which includes
guarantees of freedom of the press.
	   That law ``should be the only judge of how to treat the
Palestinian journalist,'' the deputy head of the Palestinian
Journalists Syndicate, Tawfik Abu Khoussa, told the protesters.
	   Ten police belonging to the anti-crime unit filmed the
proceedings on hand-held cameras, making sure to get each protester
on film.
	   The Palestinian Authority is anxious to sustain good relations
with the United States, and had asked journalists to avoid filming
anti-U.S. protests during last week's U.S.-British bombing of Iraq.

Italy lowers some phone rates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Italian telecommunications regulator said
Tuesday that it will leave local telephone tariffs unchanged and
reduce regional and long-distance rates in the first stage of
repricing.
	   As of Feb. 1, regional rates will drop by 7 percent and
international rates will fall by 9.6 percent.
	   The first phase of repricing will be followed by moves in March
and July.
	   In that second phase, the authority will switch many calls to
local tariffs from regional tariffs.
	   Measurement of phone calls in seconds instead of usage units
will be phased in between April 1 and June 30.
	   The regulator also aims to switch tariff setting for mobile
phone calls to mobile operators from fixed-line operators.
	   As part of a European Union agreement, Italy is to complete the
necessary repricing of long distance and local phone tariffs by
July.

Egyptian, Libyan foreign ministers discuss Lockerbie, Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The foreign ministers of Egypt and Libya on
Tuesday discussed the possible trial of two Libyan suspects in the
1988 Lockerbie bombing, and the U.S.-Britain airstrikes on Iraq.
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency said Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
and his Libyan counterpart, Omar al-Muntasser, discussed the
Lockerbie issue in the light of the Libyan Parliament's approval
for trying the suspects in a third country.
	   It gave no other details.
	   The two ministers also discussed the Iraq crisis and the U.N
sanctions imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990, the
agency said. Al-Muntasser arrived in Cairo Monday.
	   Libya already has accepted in principle to the trial of the two
suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands but
demanded that, if convicted, they should be jailed in Libya.
	   The Dec. 21, 1988 bombing of the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killed 270 people.
	   The General People's Congress, Libya's parliament, also gave its
conditional approval last week for the trial of the two men in a
country other than the United States or Britain.
	   The United States and Britain insist that the two men should
spend the jail term in Britain.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, speaking at a memorial service
Monday on the bombing's 10th anniversary, warned that the United
States would seek even stronger measures against Libya if the
suspects were not turned over.
	   Libya is under U.N. air sanctions aimed at forcing its
government to hand over the suspects.

Mohamed Al Fayed to judge Miss Universe 1999, Oprah Winfrey maybe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT HOFFMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHAGUARAMAS, Trinidad (AP) _ Mohamed Al Fayed _ owner of
London's famed Harrods department store and father of the late
Princess Diana's beau, Dodi _ will be one of the judges at the 1999
Miss Universe Pageant.
	   Prime Minister Basdeo Panday said he also hoped American
television celebrity Oprah Winfrey would join Al Fayed on the
judge's dais for the beauty contest here on May 26.
	   Panday made the announcement Tuesday at a ``sod-turning''
ceremony to launch the renovation of a 55,000-square-foot
(5,000-square-meter) former U.S. Navy hangar into a Hollywood-style
stage for the event.
	   The pageant will be broadcast live to about 2.5 billion people
from the hangar, near Chaguaramas Bay on the lush northwestern
peninsula of the Caribbean island.
	   ``This marks the start of one of the largest promotional
projects ever embarked on by this country,'' Panday said. ``We seek
to brand Trinidad and Tobago as a destination with a favorable
climate for major investment, tourism and export of goods and
services.''
	   His government is pushing to promote tourism and and help shift
the economy from its almost total dependency on petroleum, natural
gas and manufacturing.
	   Dodi Fayed died along with the princess in a Paris car crash
last year.

Israeli air raid in Lebanon kills mother and 6 children
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Lebanese complaint, northern Israelis in
shelters, background &QL; 
 &UR; By MORSHED DANDASH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAALBEK, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes fired missiles at
suspected guerrilla bases in eastern Lebanon Tuesday, killing a
woman and her six children, Lebanese security officials said.
	   Israel expressed regret at the deaths, the highest civilian
casualties in an Israeli raid since a 17-day bombing blitz of
Lebanon in 1996.
	   Lebanese security officials said one Israeli rocket crashed on a
farm where a couple and their seven children resided in the village
of Nabi Sheet, about 23 kilometers (14 miles) southwest of the
ancient city of Baalbek.
	   The mother and six children aged between two and 13 were killed.
	   The father, Mohammed Othman, and an 11-year-old son were
wounded, the officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   ``I felt I was lifted from the ground and then everything went
black,'' Othman, who suffered shrapnel wounds, said from his
hospital bed in Baalbek.
	   Local television stations showed blackened limbs and other
charred remains of the dead wrapped in blankets at a morgue.
	   Lebanese officials said five other air-to-surface missiles also
hit the hills around the villages of Nabi Sheet and Janta in the
Bekaa Valley.
	   The officials said a guerrilla from the Shiite Muslim militant
Hezbollah was killed and another wounded in the attack. But a
Hezbollah official in Beirut said he was not aware of any guerrilla
death.
	   Lebanon's government complained to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and called for a meeting of a multinational committee
monitoring an understanding between Israel and the guerrillas on
not attacking civilians.
	   Israel's army said in Jerusalem it regretted the loss of
civilian life. It said the jets struck a civilian target by mistake
while targeting a guerrilla training facility and broadcast station
The army called it a ``malfunction.''
	   The Hezbollah confirmed that its radio transmitter on the edge
of Nabi Sheet was destroyed. The radio, however, remained on the
air, apparently using a backup transmitter. No other details were
available.
	   Israeli fighter bombers also fired four rockets earlier Tuesday
at suspected guerrilla bases facing Israel's self-styled ``security
zone'' in an occupied portion of South Lebanon. There were no
casualties from the raid.
	   Hezbollah, the guerrilla group leading the fight against
Israel's occupation of a border zone in the south, promised to
avenge the ``atrocious crime.''
	   Israeli authorities warned residents of northern Israeli
communities to spend the night in bomb shelters in case rockets
were fired.
	   Israeli warplanes flew over southern Lebanon Tuesday night,
occasionally dropping flares apparently to thwart guerrilla
movements along the front line.

Cellular phones more common than household lines in Finland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS new third graf to clarify figures &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finns have indulged their famed
infatuation with technology so deeply that there are now more
cellular phones than regular telephone subscriptions in the
country, according to government figures released Tuesday.
	   The Ministry of Transport and Communications said 56 out every
100 people in the country own cellular phones, and more are buying
every day. An estimated 60,000 new subscribers come every month,
the ministry said.
	   That puts the number of mobile subscriptions slightly above the
2.9 million fixed-line phone subscriptions, which includes both
business and private users, the ministry said.
	   ``In 1997, we made a cautious prediction to cross 50 percent
coverage by the year 2000 - but it happened in August this year.
The growth has been incredibly strong,'' said Mikael Akermarck, a
researcher at the ministry.
	   The ministry now predicts that 60 out of 100 will have cellular
phones by next spring.
	   The growth in fixed phone line subscriptions has leveled off
completely and many households now own several mobile phones, he
added.
	   Mobile phone maker Nokia, which claims to be the world's
largest, is based in Finland.

New trainer looking for Tyson to recapture old style
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Trainer Tommy Brooks is looking for a return of
the old Mike Tyson when the former heavyweight champion makes his
comeback next month.
	   ``In order for him to be successful again, to regain the title,
we have to go back to the old style,'' Brooks said of Tyson (45-3
with 39 knockouts), who has not fought since being disqualified for
biting Evander Holyfield's ears in their rematch in June 1997.
	   Tyson was banned by boxing for a year before having his license
returned by the Nevada State Athletic Commission two months ago.
	   ``We are looking to get that head movement, nonstop punching and
stepping aside and around his opponent back,' Brooks said during a
conference call on Tuesday from Scottsdale, Arizona, where Tyson is
training for his Jan. 16 fight against South Africa's Francois
Botha in Las Vegas.
	   Brooks joined Tyson's camp as head trainer seven weeks ago
without any thought of remaking the man who once was the most
feared heavyweight in the world.
	   ``When you are a new trainer, what I've been concentrating on is
not trying to change his style but working to get back to the Mike
Tyson of old,'' Brooks said. ``I was worried that I might not have
enough time, but he showed me he was taking everything in that we
were working on. He was putting his punches together in bunches and
not trying to take him out in one punch. He was not squaring up.''
	   Brooks was in Holyfield's corner for his two victories over
Tyson. In the rematch, Brooks remembers sensing Tyson's growing
frustration before snapping and biting Holyfield's ear to get
disqualified in the third round.
	   ``The thing that happened to Mike was he wasn't in shape and he
was getting hit by punches that he didn't think he could get hit by
and he just lost it,'' Brooks said.
	   ``He was going back to his corner and not getting any help. He
lost his confidence in his corner. They weren't telling him
anything. He had no program.
	   That won't happen this time.
	   ``We've have been doing our homework on this guy,'' Brooks said
of Botha (39-1, with 24 KOs). ``We are going to capitalize on what
we can do best and just going to take it to him.''

ABL folds, files for bankruptcy

	   PALO ALTO, California (AP) _ The American Basketball League
suspended operations on Tuesday, unable to stem its financial
losses in the third season of the women's league.
	   The league, which announced the move in a telephone recording,
by fax and on its Web site, said it would file for protection under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.
	   The decision leaves the WNBA as the lone U.S. professional
women's basketball league.
	   The nine-team ABL was about a third of the way through this
season when its board of directors decided to halt operations
Monday night.
	   The league had franchises in Chicago; Colorado; Columbus, Ohio;
Nashville, Tennessee; Hartford, Connecticut; Philadelphia;
Portland, Oregon; San Jose; and Seattle. Two franchises, in Long
Beach, California and Atlanta, had folded earlier because of poor
attendance.
	   The WNBA signed most of this year's top college seniors and was
able to lure Dawn Staley, one of the ABL's main attractions.
Standout guard Jen Rizzotti agreed to stay with the New England
Blizzard of the ABL after speaking to the WNBA.
	   The Columbus Quest won titles in the league's only two complete
seasons.
	   The ABL began in 1996 with eight teams and a 40-game schedule.
It expanded to nine teams in its second season, with attendance
increasing 23 percent. The television package included 36 games on
Fox Sports Net and BET.

Clemens withdraws trade demand
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPRING, Texas (AP) _ Roger Clemens withdrew his trade demand on
Tuesday, saying he was prepared to report to spring training with
the Toronto Blue Jays in February.
	   Clemens, the only five-time Cy Young Award winner, had told the
Blue Jays on Dec. 2 to trade him to a team closer to home or to a
contender, citing an agreement he made with then-team president
Paul Beeston in December 1996.
	   Houston, Texas and the New York Yankees were the chief
contenders, but Toronto couldn't find a deal to his liking and
teams were scared off by Clemens' contract demands.
	   During a news conference at his agents' offices, Clemens said
that while he was withdrawing his demand, he would accept a trade
if Toronto still wanted to make one and would not set a condition
of renegotiating his dlrs 31.1 million, four-year contract, which
has two years remaining.
	   After he asked Houston to extend his contract for one year
through 2001 at dlrs 27.4 million _ which would essentially have
given him a dlrs 43.5 million, three-year contract for the next
three seasons _ Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker angrily
pulled out of talks Dec. 13.
	   Clemens' agent, Randy Hendricks, said however that Houston owner
Drayton McLane called to apologize for Hunsicker's behavior and
that the Astros still were in negotiations with the Blue Jays.
	   Toronto wanted three or four quality players or top prospects
for Clemens, who won consecutive Cy Youngs in his first two seasons
with the Blue Jays and went 41-13. He is owed dlrs 16.1 million in
the final two seasons of his Blue Jays contract.
	   When Clemens signed with Toronto, Beeston agreed that team would
trade him if the pitcher became convinced the Blue Jays wouldn't
contend. Clemens became disenchanted after Interbrew SA, the team's
Belgian owner, said a budget with a payroll of about dlrs 40
million, and Toronto made little effort to re-sign Jose Canseco,
who went to Tampa Bay.

Tribunal announces indictment of two Bosnian Croats for persecution
</HEADLINE>
of Muslims in Mostar

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Yugoslav war crimes on Tuesday
announced that it has indicted two Bosnian Croats it holds
responsible for a vicious campaign of terror unleashed in May 1993
that drove tens of thousands of Muslims out of the Bosnian city of
Mostar.
	   The southern city of Mostar was scene of some of the most savage
fighting of the 3 1/2-year war in Bosnia and the city remains
divided between Bosnian Croats and Muslims to this day.
	   The U.N. court indicted Mladen Naletilic, 52, on 17 war crimes
counts for allegedly commanding a paramilitary formation called the
Convicts Battalion that was responsible for a string of atrocities
against Muslims in and around Mostar from May 1993 until March
1994.
	   Naletilic faces four charges of crimes against humanity, six of
grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and seven of breaches of
the laws and customs of war.
	   Also charged was 35-year old Vinko Martinovic, who prosecutors
say commanded a sub unit of the Convicts Battalion called the
Anti-Terrorsit Group. Martinovic faces 22 charges - five of crimes
against humanity, eight grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions
and nine of breaching the laws and customs of war.
	   Exact details of the charges were not immediately released but
the men are charged with personal participation in the atrocities
and for commanding troops responsible for the campaign of
persecution. Both men face maximum life sentences if convicted.
	   Both are Bosnian Croats but also hold Croatian citizenship, the
tribunal said in a press release. They are believed to have been
arrested by Croat authorities and to be in custody in Zagreb.
	   The tribunal did not immediately announce if plans had been made
for their transfer to its high-security holding cells in The Hague.
	   According to a summary of their indictment released late Tuesday
by the U.N. court, the two were responsible for driving tens of
thousands of Muslims out of Mostar.
	   ``The means used for this purpose included killings, beatings,
torture, evictions, destruction of cultural and religious heritage,
looting, ... mass expulsions, detentions and imprisonments,''
prosecutors allege.
	   All of the acts followed ``a pattern of systematic ethnic
discrimination,'' the indictment added.
	   Set up in 1993, the tribunal has indicted more than 50 war
crimes suspects and has more than 20 in custody.

Workers lose jobs, benefits after hurricane hits original Banana

	   LA LIMA, Honduras (AP) _ The banana stalks stand brown and
brittle in the abandoned Chiquita fields, like sculptures of
despair. Around them, the people who for decades have worked the
fields are little better off.
	   A month after Hurricane Mitch destroyed the Honduran production
of Chiquita Brands International and crippled Dole Food Co.
plantations, desperation is settling in for the thousands who
survive off the crop that gave this country its claim to fame as
the original Banana Republic.
	   Next year promises to be even harder.
	   ``I've been left with nothing,'' said Danilo Sanchez, a
37-year-old Chiquita worker who now herds a pair of bone-thin
cattle into the banana fields to feed on rotting fruit.
	   Thousands of workers have lost their jobs. Others are working a
few days a week. Some have lost medical benefits. Most seasonal
workers, like Sanchez, were let go immediately.
	   After the hurricane passed, Chiquita rented aircraft and boats
to help rescue stranded people, and donated millions of dollars in
food, medicine and transportation to Central America.
	   It also let 1,200 seasonal workers go and suspended most of its
7,300 permanent workers for a year.
	   To ease the pain, the company offered full-time workers bonuses
and advances averaging dlrs 370. Workers also can borrow up to dlrs
40 every two weeks.
	   Workers say the loans won't do.
	   ``That's no help to me,'' said Magdelena Sevilla, a single
mother of two who has been camping out in front of her house since
it was covered in mud. ``That's just cutting my throat, because
I'll never be able to work off that debt.''
	   Chiquita is letting workers harvest the 1,700 acres of its
25,000 acres that survived here. The company also says it will
continue to provide schooling and free medical care in addition to
housing for about two-thirds of the workers.
	   ``Up to this point, the company has acted with great social
responsibility,'' said Jimmy Zonta Sing, Chiquita's human resources
and labor relations manager at the La Lima headquarters.
	   Most of the 4,000 full-time workers for Dole, known as Standard
Fruit in Honduras, will continue working a few days a week,
according to their union.
	   To avoid suspending workers, the union agreed to a reduction in
medical benefits: health workers will treat serious and chronic
illnesses, while regular health insurance will not resume until
operations are in full swing again.
	   ``We don't think it's just,'' said Juan Carlos Medina, vice
president of the union representing Dole workers. ``But our backs
were against the wall.''
	   Chiquita union leaders say their colleagues paid too high a
price, especially now that a rise of diarrhea and dengue _ a
mosquito-borne illness that can be fatal _ has put the country on
an epidemic alert.
	   Labor leaders say the health reductions are only one of many
gains that were swept away by the storm.
	   ``The companies are taking advantage of the disaster situation
and using it to introduce changes that we have been fighting
against over the past 10 years,'' said Juan Funez, president of the
union that represents Chiquita workers.
	   ``But what can we do, strike? There is no work. We have no
strength, no power to demand anything.''
	   Company officials plan to implement a new work system long
opposed by unions that assigns more tasks to each worker, to make
operations more efficient.
	   Labor leaders fear it's a prelude to reducing the work force.
	   Officials at Cincinnati-based Chiquita, which wrote off dlrs 50
million this quarter alone, say they're doing their best to soften
the blow while the company makes adjustments to get back on its
feet.
	   Chiquita gets about 15 percent of its bananas from Honduras.
Only Panama and Costa Rica supply Chiquita with more bananas.
	   Even under the best conditions, Chiquita could not begin
replanting until next year and would have nothing to harvest until
2000, said Steven Warshaw, Chiquita's chief operating officer.
	   John Tate, chief financial officer for Dole in Westlake Village,
Calif., said the company estimates its loss from the hurricane at
about dlrs 100 million.
	   He said about 25 percent of Dole's total banana production came
from Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, and half to three-quarters
of that crop was lost.
	   ``To fully rehabilitate, we think, it will take about two
years.''
	   The workers, meanwhile, are trying to rehabilitate too.
	   Some have taken up temporary residence in flooded encampments
that surround the mosquito-infested banana fields.
	   Peasants have moved into the railroad cars used to take bananas
to port.
	   And others have stayed in their three-room wood-slat homes,
which several generations of banana workers often share.
	   Bertilia Contreras shares one room with her five children and a
three-foot-tall plastic Christmas tree. She put it up to cheer her
children, but said they probably won't find anything under it on
Christmas Day.
	   ``When I look out my door, I feel sad. Everything looks so ugly
now,'' she said. ``It's going to be a sad Christmas.''

Golf's global stage keeps growing

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Nick Price never paid attention to the Ryder
Cup, and not just because the only golf he could watch as a
teen-ager was grainy film that was shipped to Rhodesia and shown at
the club on Friday nights.
	   ``It meant nothing to me,'' Price said. ``I didn't grow up
having a chance to play on the Ryder Cup team, so it was never a
contest. I went fishing.''
	   Chances are, Price will never play in a Ryder Cup.
	   But 10 years or so down the road, it's not hard to picture Price
as captain of an International team that takes on Lee Westwood,
Sergio Garcia and the rest of the Europeans at The Belfry.
	   It's bound to happen sooner or later.
	   ``I think there's room for it, and I don't think it would
devalue the Ryder Cup,'' Westwood said shortly after the
International team beat the Yanks.
	   As Jack Nicklaus said in Australia during closing ceremonies of
the Presidents Cup, fresh off the worst rout the United States has
endured, ``We used to think golf was only played in the United
States. We didn't even invent it. I'm not even sure how well we
play it anymore.''
	   The comment was tongue-in-cheek, but the point was unmistakable.
	   Golf is as global as it ever has been. And now that the five
major tours worldwide have joined forces to promote the World Golf
Championship series that starts in February and will travel to
Spain, Asia and Australia the next three years, it will get even
bigger.
	   Big enough even for the Ryder Cup _ or the Presidents Cup _ to
make room for someone else.
	   ``I think ultimately what will happen is a tri-match,'' Nicklaus
said. ``I think the reason that will happen is that right now, it's
a great event every other year for Europe, and a great event other
every year for the rest of the world. But it's harder every year to
get our guys motivated to do that.
	   ``Right now, it's pretty good the way it is,'' he said.
``Someday, probably sooner rather than later, that might happen.''
	   How to go about it is the sticking point. Asked what he meant by
a tri-match, Nicklaus changed the subject because he wasn't quite
sure.
	   Neither was anyone else, for that matter.
	   ``Certainly now, there may be a call for us to play against
Europe, but when are we going to fit it in?'' Price said. ``A
three-way round-robin thing would get kind of confusing to
everyone.''
	   One suggestion is to have the winner of the Presidents Cup play
the winner of the Ryder Cup. Of course, the way the Americans have
played lately, they could find themselves taking off every other
year.
	   And who's to say the International team won't find it difficult
to get motivated for the matches year in and year out?
	   ``The hard thing for the Americans ... is they really don't have
a break,'' Australia's Craig Parry said. ``We've got something to
really go out and play for. The Presidents Cup means something to
our team.''
	   And it meant something to the Americans, although clearly not as
much as the Ryder Cup. It's not like they went down to Port Phillip
Bay and cried their eyes out, which is what Mark Calcavecchia did
after blowing his singles match in the 1991 Ryder Cup at Kiawah
Island.
	   ``Heck, it's almost Christmas time,'' Calcavecchia said. ``We'll
get over it. And two years down the road, a lot of these guys will
be on the team again, and we'll have some new guys, and we'll give
it another shot.''
	   Any kind of merger would require the blessing of PGA Tour
commissioner Tim Finchem, who created the Presidents Cup, and the
PGA of America, which runs the profitable Ryder Cup. For now,
Finchem would like to see both events keep their own identity.
	   ``I would never say never to anything, but I do think that kind
of structure would be a little bit unwieldy and might take a while
to accommodate,'' Finchem said. ``But that's something we may start
talking about in a few years. We'll see what happens.''
	   Until then, there will continue to be two cups with two separate
identities.
	   And right now, neither one belongs to the United States.

	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ Already the Masters and British Open
champion, winner of the World Match Play Championship and PGA Tour
player of the year, Mark O'Meara's sensational season comes to a
close with yet another honor: king of the silly season.
	   The silly season _ now referred to by the PGA Tour as the
``challenge season'' _ includes limited field events (Million
Dollar Challenge) that use different formats (Skins Game, Shark
Shootout) and don't always count toward the world rankings (Grand
Slam).
	   Of players who took part in at least two such events, O'Meara
was the top money-earner with dlrs 730,000. That was enough to
finish ahead of _ who else? _ Tiger Woods, who won dlrs 650,000.
	   Nick Price actually won more, but his dlrs 1 million came from
one tournament, the Million Dollar Challenge in Sun City, South
Africa.
	   O'Meara pocketed dlrs 150,000 from the PGA Grand Slam of Golf, a
record dlrs 430,000 from the Skins Game and dlrs 150,000 from Sun
City. Woods won dlrs 400,000 by beating Vijay Singh in the Grand
Slam, then picked up another dlrs 250,000 from his playoff loss to
Price in Sun City.
	   In third place was Tom Lehman, who made dlrs 480,000. That's
nearly half of what he made during his injury-plagued regular
season. Lehman picked up the bulk of his money from the Skins, and
also got dlrs 60,000 from winning the Pebble Beach Invitational.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BIG MONEY: &LR;  Finishing in the top 64 in the world rankings by
Feb. 15 will be worth at least dlrs 25,000.
	   The International Federation of PGA Tours has completed the
distribution of the dlrs 5 million purses for the three World Golf
Championships events next year, starting with the Andersen
Consulting Match Play Championship at La Costa Resort.
	   The winner of each event gets dlrs 1 million, while last place
is guaranteed at dlrs 25,000.
	   Runner-up at the Match Play and the NEC Invitational, for Ryder
Cup and Presidents Cup players, will be dlrs 500,000, while second
place for the Stroke Play Championship will be a meager dlrs
400,000.
	   Other payoffs for the Match Play in February: dlrs 400,000 for
third place, dlrs 300,000 for fourth, dlrs 150,000 for
quarterfinalists, dlrs 75,000 for making the third round, dlrs
50,000 for the second round.
	   Prize money is official, but counts only toward a player's
designated home tour.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; USGA AWARDS: &LR;  The USGA has chosen 1981 Senior Amateur champion
Edgar Updegraff to receive its top honor _ the Bob Jones Award,
presented annually since 1955 to recognize distinguished
sportsmanship in golf.
	   ``This was entirely unexpected and a little wondrous,'' said
Updegraff, 76, a retired urologist from Tucson, Ariz.
	   Updegraff completed in 17 U.S. Amateurs, six Masters and three
Walker Cup matches during his amateur career. Among his golf
highlights are making his first Walker Cup team in 1963 and a long
chat he had with Jones during the 1962 Masters. His best Masters
finish was a tie for 44th in 1966.
	   Frank Aglim of Dallas, a longtime rules official involved in
golf administration for nearly 50 years, won the Joseph C. Dey
Award for meritorious volunteer service. Noel Jackson of Kingston,
Rhode Island won the Green Section Award for his work with turf.
	   The awards will be presented Feb. 6 at the USGA's annual meeting
in Clearwater, Florida.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; MASTERS DOWN UNDER: &LR;  Add another Masters to Greg Norman's
schedule _ the Australian Masters.
	   Norman, who has won the event six times but has refused to play
since his breakup with International Management Group, has agreed
to play in it for the first time since 1994. IMG organizes a number
of Australian tournaments.
	   The Australian Masters is the second week in February, right
after Norman's Holden International, which he won last year. In a
statement released by IMG, Norman said he was ``proud of his
Australian Masters'' record and looking forward to returning to
Huntingdale.
	   He reportedly will get an appearance fee of about dlrs 300,000.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; FANTASY LEAGUE FILE: &LR;  Sal Johnson knew his massive Pro Golf
guide was successful when he started work on the second edition and
found there wasn't much on which to improve.
	   Pro Golf '99, published by Golfweek and released this month, is
a 204-page look at everything there is to know about PGA Tour
events and 201 players, from David Duval and Tiger Woods to Scott
Gump and Spike McRoy.
	   Johnson, the statistics and information editor for Golfweek,
designed Pro Golf primarily as a comprehensive guide for fantasy
golf leagues. It has a five-year history of a player's performance
on tour and breaks down his career by the month, season, location
of the tournament and kind of course, among other things.
	   It also reviews the last three years of each event and
highlights trends of the winner.
	   Pro Golf '99 can be ordered by calling 1-800-996-4653.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DIVOTS: &LR;  Ernie Els, a two-time U.S. Open champion and a
three-time winner of the World Match Play Championship, received a
lifetime membership on the European tour. The only other non-Euros
to get that privilege are Arnold Palmer, Gary Player and Bob
Charles. ... Highland Oaks in Dothan, Ala., part of the Robert
Trent Jones Golf Trail, will be the site of the Nike Tour
Championship Oct. 21-24. ... John Daly has entered the Murphy's
Irish Open, which comes two weeks before the British Open at
Carnoustie. ... A federal court in California has set an October
trial date for Callaway's lawsuit against Spalding and its ``System
C'' golf ball.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; STAT OF THE WEEK: &LR;  No one has ever won the season-ending Tour
Championship and the following year's season-opening Mercedes
Championship. Tom Lehman came the closest, losing the 1997 Mercedes
in a playoff to Tiger Woods.

New Israeli law requires radio stations to play more local music
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israelis are about to hear more of their own
music on the radio, whether they like it or not.
	   In an effort to promote Hebrew songs and preserve the nation's
culture, Israel's parliament passed law Tuesday that says half of
all music played on Israeli stations must be homemade.
	   The Hebrew-language songs law, which passed with bipartisan
support, applies to Israel state-run radio, army radio and
privately-run regional stations _ although many radio stations
already broadcast predominantly domestic content.
	   Yona Yahav, the Labor party legislator who sponsored the new
law, said it was necessary to protect local artists.
	   ``A young culture must build protective barriers, just as
protective barriers are built around products,'' he said. He noted
the law does not include penalties.
	   ``Program producers will not be hauled off to jail,'' he said,
laughing.
	   The state-run classical music station will be exempted, as will
Israel's Arabic language service and a station that broadcasts
predominantly foreign language programs for recent immigrants.
Other stations will be assessed on a monthly basis.
	   Some in the music business had questioned the need for the law,
saying that Israel's thriving recording industry benefited from
exposure to outside influences.
	   Backers of the law say there's plenty of foreign music already
available _ on MTV, on radio stations from neighboring Arab lands
and on pirate stations.
	   Benny Dudkevitch, a producer with Israel radio, said the new law
``will encourage more Israeli performers to record their music.''

GEC splits military, civilian business amid merger rumors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British electrical giant, The General Electric
Company PLC, said Tuesday that it will separate its civil and
defense businesses, ahead of a rumored dlrs 39 billion merger with
British Aerospace PLC.
	   The separation may take one of several forms, the company said
in a statement, but it ``will enhance the ability of GEC to create
value for its shareholders by leading the international defense
industry consolidation.''
	   The Sunday Times reported this week that GEC and British
Aerospace were close to creating a dlrs 39 billion defense group.
Such an alliance would be the first big-scale union in the European
defense industry.
	   GEC said Tuesday it was talking to a number of defense industry
parties, but didn't give names. The company said that the
discussions were ``proceeding well and have confirmed the
considerable value to be generated from participating in the global
consolidation process.''
	   Paul Beaver, defense analyst with Jane's Information Group, said
that the announcement was part of a restructuring to fulfill
monopoly requirements and ensure the linkup with British Aerospace.
	   GEC's defense operations produce defense equipment ranging from
torpedoes to electronics for British and U.S. warplanes. British
Aerospace produces the Harrier jump jet and will also build part of
the new Eurofighter.
	   The merger, Beaver said ''would create a business combining
British Aerospace platforms with GEC electronics, creating a one
stop shop, whether it is in aircraft, ships or armored vehicles.''
	   On the London Stock Exchange, GEC closed down 18.5 pence (dlrs
0.29) to 537.5 pence (dlrs 8.60), and British Aerospace fell 4
pence (dlrs 0.06) lower at 527 pence (dlrs 8.43).
	   Beaver said that a series of continent-wide mergers between
European defense companies was likely early in the new year,
possibly to include U.S. defense giants.

Palestinians plan to release Hamas leader this week
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The Palestinian leadership is
likely to order the release this week from house arrest of a
prominent Muslim militant leader, officials said Tuesday.
	   Yasser Arafat would probably order the release of Sheik Ahmed
Yassin by Saturday, an official close to Arafat told The Associated
Press.
	   The Hamas leader's case was put to Arafat by Arafat's own Fatah
faction, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Hamas officials said they were aware of the appeals on their
blind, wheelchair-bound leader's behalf.
	   ``We have been informed by some of out brothers from Fatah
regarding this issue, and we hope their recommendations will be
accepted,'' said Hamas spokesman Ismail Haniye.
	   The release of the Hamas leader _ placed under house arrest in
October after a Hamas activist killed himself in an unsuccessful
attempt to blow up a school bus full of Israeli children _ would be
a sign of deteriorating Israeli-Palestinian relations.
	   The attack on the bus came immediately after the U.S.-brokered
accords achieved in Wye River, Maryland.
	   Yassin's house arrest prevented the scuttling of the accord, but
since then, there has been an outbreak of anti-Israel violence
sparked by a refusal to release Palestinians jailed for killings,
and Israel has frozen a planned troop withdrawal from the West
Bank.
	   Among other conditions for going ahead with the withdrawal,
Israel wants the Palestinians to contain incitement by Hamas _ a
popular militant movement that has called for Israel's destruction.
	   Yassin's release would be ``very much in line with the revolving
door policy which we are so upset about,'' said David Bar-Illan, a
senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   ``The less contact the Hamas leaders have with the press, the
less incitement there seems to be,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Palestinians say they have fulfilled their commitments to Wye.
	   ``We have implemented our part of the agreement, and now it's
their turn to implement their part of the agreement,'' said Nabil
Abourdeneh, a top Arafat adviser.
	   The Americans agree.
	   The U.S. State Department called Netanyahu's conditions new, and
credited the Palestinians with having ``worked hard to implement
many of their commitments'' under the agreement.
	   ``It's our expectation that the Wye River memorandum will be
implemented as signed, and without new conditions,'' State
Department spokesman Lee McClenny said.
	   Palestinians are increasingly worried that Netanyahu's decision
this week to go to early elections will further cripple the
already-ailing peace process.
	   ``The early elections do not cancel the agreement we signed with
the Israeli government,'' Abourdeneh said.

Security Council starts discussing steps to map new Iraq policy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos NYR106-107, NYR111 &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Putting aside deep divisions over
sanctions and weapons inspections, the U.N. Security Council on
Tuesday started discussing two less contentious steps to help map a
new policy on Iraq after the U.S.-British bombing campaign.
	   On the table was a revised Russian proposal calling for
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to submit ``an overall assessment of
the current situation on the ground in Iraq'' and a meeting of the
executive board that oversees the weapons inspectors.
	   ``Most members supported this approach today,'' said Russia's
U.N. Ambassador Sergey Lavrov, expressing hope that the council
would reach agreement soon ``in order to get the ball rolling.''
	   The council scheduled another meeting on Iraq for Wednesday.
	   Crucially, the United States did not oppose either step although
diplomats said Washington had some questions about exactly who
would carry out the assessment.
	   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh said the United States
believes ``there could well be some merit'' in a meeting of the 22
commissioners who oversee the U.N. Special Commission, known as
UNSCOM, which is charged with verifying the destruction of Iraq's
chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles.
	   The commissioners usually meet once or twice a year and ``it
seems like one of those steps that the council will probably want
to take,'' Burleigh said.
	   At a news conference in Washington, Undersecretary of State
Thomas Pickering said an assessment of Iraq's compliance with
Security Council resolutions, the role of the council, and the
probability of UNSCOM resuming inspections, ``might be germane and
useful.''
	   ``We are looking at that,'' Pickering said.
	   Lavrov said he envisions an assessment from the
secretary-general and from members of the Special Commission
covering Iraq's humanitarian problems, disarmament and political
situation after the bombing campaign.
	   This will help the council ``decide how we can implement all the
resolutions (on Iraq) further,'' he said.
	   The revised Russian draft resolution ``encourages'' the
secretary-general to continue playing a role ``in promoting
humanitarian relief and healing diplomacy.''
	   Annan has spent much of the year trying to defuse tensions
between Iraq and the council, and helped avert U.S.-British
airstrikes in February and November.
	   Some U.S. diplomats are worried over Annan's stated concern
about the long-term impact of sanctions on Iraq's 22 million
people.
	   The five permanent council members _ the United States, Britain,
France, Russia and China _ remain divided over the future of
UNSCOM, the future of its director Richard Butler, and the future
of sanctions.
	   The United States and Britain want UNSCOM and Butler to remain
on the job.
	   France is floating a still murky proposal for a modified version
of UNSCOM that would prevent Iraq from acquiring banned weapons,
include long-term monitoring, and lift sanctions which Paris
contends cause unintended hardship on the Iraqi people.
	   Russia and China, the most vocal opponents of the bombing, have
also called for the lifting of sanctions and are demanding Butler's
ouster.
	   The Russian draft includes one statement which is unacceptable
to the United States: It would have the council express regret over
the use of force against Iraq.
	   ``We certainly regret the fact that force had to be used in Iraq
_ and it's clear in the council that there will be, I think, lots
of suggestions for changes,'' Burleigh said.

Iraq claims U.S.-British planes fired missiles at Basra
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with arrival of humanitarian aid workers &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos BAG101, 103-104

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Tuesday accused U.S.-British
warplanes of firing two missiles toward the southern city of Basra,
saying the renewed aggression was part of a policy ``to harm
Iraq.''
	   The Pentagon and the British Defense Ministry denied the claim,
which was reported by the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   Iraq also warned Tuesday that it won't forgive the oil-rich
emirate of Kuwait for allowing the United States and Britain to use
its military bases to mount last week's airstrikes against the
country.
	   Quoting an unnamed spokesman for the Ministry of Culture and
Information, the Iraqi News Agency dismissed Kuwaiti statements
that the emirate was not involved in the Dec. 16-19 airstrikes.
	   ``This justification does not vindicate the (ruling) family ...
of such treacherous and criminal acts it perpetrated against the
Iraqi people,'' INA said.
	   Meanwhile, INA also reported that three children were killed and
20 others wounded in the southern province of Wasit as a result of
the U.S-British assault. It did not elaborate.
	   The casualties would be in addition to the 62 soldiers and an
unspecified number of civilians that Iraq says were killed in the
strikes. The United States says the air raids and 425 Tomahawk
cruise missile strikes targeted defense sites to reduce Iraq's
ability to build weapons of mass destruction.
	   Tensions that had subsided following the end of the punishing
strikes rose again briefly when INA reported that aircraft from the
``criminal aggressors'' came in two waves and violated Iraqi
airspace.
	   It quoted an unnamed military spokesman as saying that ``four
formations of aircraft'' flew over Iraq Tuesday morning and
returned in the direction from which they came.
	   The agency said five more formations entered Iraq about five
hours later, at 2:17 p.m. (1117gmt) ``and approached southern Basra
out of range of our weapons and fired two stray missiles before
fleeing.''
	   ``This violation is part of the policy to harm Iraq,'' the
agency added.
	   The Iraqi report did not define what it meant by ``stray
missiles'' or say if they hit anything.
	   A Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Patrick Sivigny, said ``U.S.
forces have not fired any missiles.'' Britain also said there was
no evidence that any British plane had fired a missile over Iraq
Tuesday.
	   ``As far as we are aware, there is nothing to suggest that this
took place,'' a Defense Ministry spokesman said on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The conflicting reports could not be immediately reconciled.
	   Western jets patrolling a no-fly zone over southern Iraq have in
the past fired if approached by Iraqi aircraft or if Iraqi
anti-aircraft batteries locked their targeting radar on the
aircraft.
	   Following the recent bombing campaign, Iraq demanded an end to
no-fly zones in the north and south of the country. The exclusion
zones cover about two-thirds of the country.
	   Also Tuesday, four U.S. peace activists staged a demonstration
at Saddam Medical City _ a hospital complex in Baghdad _ to protest
against the attacks and strong U.S. support for economic sanctions
against Iraq.
	   The members of the Voices in the Wilderness group lit a lamp
using Iraqi oil that they purchased in violation of the U.N.
embargo. The sanctions were imposed following Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
	   ``We bought the oil from Iraq in an open and public defiance of
U.S.-U.N. sanctions,'' said the group's leader, Kathy Kelly of
Chicago, Illinois.
	   The sanctions cannot be lifted until a U.N. weapons inspection
commission certifies that Iraq no longer possesses or has the
ability to produce nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and
long-range missiles. U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering
reiterated that Tuesday.
	   But following the airstrikes, Iraq declared it will not allow
the U.N. commission to work again in the country.
	   On Tuesday, the government said reconstruction teams were
repairing damage from the strikes, and state television showed
pictures of masons and other workers rebuilding a destroyed house
in Baghdad.
	   Civil defense teams collected unexploded missiles and bombs, the
Iraqi News Agency said. It said the teams defused 65 cluster bombs
and two missiles in the southern province of Wasit.
	   Also, more than 100 U.N. relief workers, who were evacuated to
Amman amid the bombing campaign, arrived in Baghdad late Tuesday.
	   The aid workers arrived at a Baghdad hotel in three buses and
made no comments to the press.

	   BAALBEK, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes fired missiles at
suspected guerrilla bases in eastern Lebanon on Tuesday, killing a
woman and her six children, Lebanese security officials said.
	   Israel expressed regret at the deaths, the highest civilian
casualties in an Israeli raid since a 17-day bombing blitz of
Lebanon in 1996.
	   Lebanese security officials said one Israeli rocket crashed on a
farm where a couple and their seven children lived in the village
of Nabi Sheet, about 23 kilometers (14 miles) southwest of the
ancient city of Baalbek.
	   The mother and six children between ages two and 13 were killed.
	   The father, Mohammed Othman, and an 11-year-old son were
wounded, the officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   ``I felt I was lifted from the ground and then everything went
black,'' Othman, who suffered shrapnel wounds, said from his
hospital bed in Baalbek.
	   Local television stations showed blackened limbs and other
charred remains of the dead wrapped in blankets at a morgue.
	   Lebanese officials said five other air-to-surface missiles also
hit the hills around the villages of Nabi Sheet and Janta in the
Bekaa Valley.
	   The officials said a guerrilla from the Shiite Muslim militant
Hezbollah was killed and another wounded in the attack. But a
Hezbollah official in Beirut said he was not aware of any guerrilla
death.
	   Lebanon's government complained to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and called for a meeting of a multinational committee
monitoring an understanding between Israel and the guerrillas on
not attacking civilians.
	   Israel's army said in Jerusalem it regretted the loss of
civilian life. It said the jets struck a civilian target by mistake
while targeting a guerrilla training facility and broadcast
station. The army called it a ``malfunction.''
	   The Hezbollah confirmed that its radio transmitter on the edge
of Nabi Sheet was destroyed. The radio, however, remained on the
air, apparently using a backup transmitter. No other details were
available.
	   Israeli fighter bombers also fired four rockets earlier Tuesday
at suspected guerrilla bases facing Israel's self-styled ``security
zone'' in an occupied portion of South Lebanon. There were no
casualties from the raid.
	   Hezbollah, the guerrilla group leading the fight against
Israel's occupation of a border zone in the south, promised to
avenge the ``atrocious crime.''
	   Israeli authorities warned residents of northern Israeli
communities to spend the night in bomb shelters in case rockets
were fired.
	   Israeli warplanes flew over southern Lebanon Tuesday night,
occasionally dropping flares apparently to thwart guerrilla
movements along the front line.

Australian Open champion Korda failed drugs test: ITF
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Reigning Australian Open tennis
title-holder Petr Korda failed a drugs test at the 1998 Wimbledon
Championships, the International Tennis Federation said Wednesday.
	   Korda, from the Czech Republic, tested positive to nandrolene
metabolites, which is classified as a Class One prohibited
substance under the federation's anti-doping program.
	   The 30-year-old was forced to forfeit the 199 rankings points
and U.S dlrs 94,529 prizemoney he earned at Wimbledon this year.
	   But the federation's Independent Appeals Committee, sitting on
Dec. 22 in London, ruled that as Korda was unaware he had taken or
been administered the banned substance, no further penalty would be
imposed.
	   The appeals committee heard evidence from Korda, his
representatives and the federation before making its ruling.
	   Korda submitted the positive doping sample after bowing out in
the Wimbledon quarterfinals.
	   In a statement, he said he had been informed by the federation
on Aug. 1 that he had tested positive to nandrolene and was issued
with a Notice of Violation in October, against which he appealed.
	   Korda said he and his advisers had made exhaustive, but
unsuccessful, attempts to find the source of the illegal substance.
	   ``I wish to state categorically that I am not a drugs cheat and
would never seek to obtain a competitive advantage over my fellow
professionals by such means,'' Korda said in the statement.
	   ``I am delighted that the Committee has vindicated me.
	   ``This allegation came as a tremendous shock and caused
considerable distress to me and my family.
	   ``From a professional standpoint my performances since August
suffered, as my recent results have shown.
	   ``Whilst I am in the final stages of my career I still love the
game.
	   ``I am delighted that the Committee has cleared my name and that
I am free to carry on playing and competing.
	   ``I would like to say that I completely support the Tennis
Anti-Doping Program and the efforts of the sports authorities to
ensure that the sport is clean.''
	   Under ITF rules, Korda was found to have committed a doping
offense, even though the federation was satisfied he had not taken
the banned substance intentionally.
	   Therefore, it was compelled to deduct the rankings points earned
by Korda at Wimbledon and require him to return his prizemoney.

Iraq claims U.S.-British planes fired missiles at Basra

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq accused U.S. and British warplanes of
firing two missiles toward the southern city of Basra on Tuesday,
saying the renewed aggression was part of a policy ``to harm
Iraq.''
	   The Pentagon and the British Defense Ministry denied the claim,
which was reported by the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   Iraq also warned Tuesday that it won't forgive the oil-rich
emirate of Kuwait for allowing the United States and Britain to use
its military bases to mount last week's airstrikes against the
country.
	   Quoting an unnamed spokesman for the Ministry of Culture and
Information, the Iraqi News Agency dismissed Kuwaiti statements
that the emirate was not involved in the Dec. 16-19 airstrikes.
	   ``This justification does not vindicate the (ruling) family ...
of such treacherous and criminal acts it perpetrated against the
Iraqi people,'' INA said.
	   Meanwhile, INA also reported that three children were killed and
20 others wounded in the southern province of Wasit as a result of
the U.S-British assault. It did not elaborate.
	   The casualties would be in addition to the 62 soldiers and an
unspecified number of civilians that Iraq says were killed in the
strikes. The United States says the air raids and 425 Tomahawk
cruise missile strikes targeted defense sites to reduce Iraq's
ability to build weapons of mass destruction.
	   Tensions that had subsided following the end of the punishing
strikes rose again briefly when INA reported that aircraft from the
``criminal aggressors'' came in two waves and violated Iraqi
airspace.
	   It quoted an unnamed military spokesman as saying that ``four
formations of aircraft'' flew over Iraq on Tuesday morning and
returned in the direction from which they came.
	   The agency said five more formations entered Iraq about five
hours later, at 2:17 p.m. (1117gmt) ``and approached southern Basra
out of range of our weapons and fired two stray missiles before
fleeing.''
	   ``This violation is part of the policy to harm Iraq,'' the
agency added.
	   The Iraqi report did not define what it meant by ``stray
missiles'' or say if they hit anything.
	   A Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Patrick Sivigny, said ``U.S.
forces have not fired any missiles.'' Britain also said there was
no evidence that any British plane had fired a missile over Iraq on
Tuesday.
	   ``As far as we are aware, there is nothing to suggest that this
took place,'' a Defense Ministry spokesman said on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The conflicting reports could not be immediately reconciled.
	   Western jets patrolling a no-fly zone over southern Iraq have in
the past fired if approached by Iraqi aircraft or if Iraqi
anti-aircraft batteries locked their targeting radar on the
aircraft.
	   Following the recent bombing campaign, Iraq demanded an end to
the no-fly zones in the north and south of the country. The
exclusion zones cover about two-thirds of the country.
	   Also Tuesday, four U.S. peace activists staged a demonstration
at Saddam Medical City _ a hospital complex in Baghdad _ to protest
the attacks and strong U.S. support for economic sanctions against
Iraq.
	   The members of the Voices in the Wilderness group lit a lamp
using Iraqi oil that they purchased in violation of the U.N.
embargo. The sanctions were imposed following Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
	   ``We bought the oil from Iraq in an open and public defiance of
U.S.-U.N. sanctions,'' said the group's leader, Kathy Kelly of
Chicago, Illinois.
	   The sanctions cannot be lifted until a U.N. weapons inspection
commission certifies that Iraq no longer possesses or has the
ability to produce nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and
long-range missiles. U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering
reiterated that Tuesday.
	   But following the airstrikes, Iraq declared it will not allow
the U.N. commission to work again in the country.
	   On Tuesday, the government said reconstruction teams were
repairing damage from the strikes, and state television showed
pictures of masons and other workers rebuilding a destroyed house
in Baghdad.
	   Civil defense teams collected unexploded missiles and bombs, the
Iraqi News Agency said. It said the teams defused 65 cluster bombs
and two missiles in the southern province of Wasit.
	   Also, more than 100 U.N. relief workers, who were evacuated to
Amman amid the bombing campaign, arrived in Baghdad late Tuesday.
The aid workers arrived at a Baghdad hotel in three buses and made
no comments to the press.

Ambassador blames Palestinians for stalemate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Israel's ambassador to the United States says
the Palestinians are to blame for the delay in a pullback on the
West Bank.
	   Insisting Israel had not raised new conditions, ambassador
Zalman Shoval said Tuesday all that Israel demands is Palestinian
compliance with terms of the Wye River accords.
	   ``Let us hope they will, so as not to miss another opportunity
for peace,'' Shoval told a gathering of American business leaders
here.
	   The Wye River accords were not ``a one-way ticket,'' the Israeli
diplomat said. ``Unless the Palestinians comply with their part of
the deal and fulfill all their commitments, it will be their fault
if the process is stalled.''
	   The U.S. State Department took another view. It said Israel
should turn over the territory promised to the Palestinians in the
accords in October,
	   And Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, told The
Associated Press in Jerusalem that Israel was bound to honor the
Wye accords despite internal political turmoil.
	   Similarly, State Department spokesman Lee McClenny said, ``It's
our expectation that the Wye River memorandum will be implemented
as signed, and without new conditions.''
	   President Bill Clinton, on a trip to Gaza last week, praised
Yasser Arafat and told the Palestinians they were free to
``determine their own destiny on their own land.''
	   While giving statehood a boost, the administration also has
eased up on Arafat's statehood declarations, saying people should
be free to express their aspirations.
	   The State Department called the prime minister's conditions new,
and credited the Palestinians with having ``worked hard to
implement many of their commitments'' under the agreement.
	   These included annulling clauses in the 1964 charter of the
Palestine Liberation Organization that called for dismantling
Israel as a Jewish state, and ``stepping up the fight against
terror,'' McClenny said.
	   ``We're working with both sides to urge them to complete
implementation as quickly as possible so that the second phase can
be carried out,'' he said.
	   But Shoval said the Israeli government had not suspended the Wye
accords. ``The opposite is true,'' he said.
	   In the Wye accords, Israel agreed to relinquish another 13
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinian Authority if it took
stronger measures to root out terrorists who attack Israel from
Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   The accords provide for matching steps by Arafat on security
before each phase of an Israeli pullback. Israel surrendered 4
percent in a first phase.
	   Clinton and Sandy Berger, his national security adviser, both
said on their trip to the region last week that there was likely to
be a delay in the second phase, but that they hoped it would not be
a long one.

Hottest best-seller in Canada: The ice-storm book
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Back in January, a devastating ice storm was
inflicting misery on millions of people in Quebec and Ontario. Now
that storm is revisited in a coffee-table book that is atop
Canada's holiday bestseller lists.
	   Called ``The Ice Storm'' in English and ``Le Grand Verglas'' in
the French edition, the book has sold almost 100,000 copies since
it was published last month.
	   A Montreal Gazette reporter, Mark Abley, wrote the text, and the
Gazette coordinated an effort by nine regional newspapers to
contribute photographs of the storm.
	   Canadian authorities have ranked the ice storm as the most
disruptive and destructive storm of any sort in national history.
	   Thick coats of ice formed by a week of freezing rain toppled
more than 1,000 power transmission towers and 30,000 wooden utility
poles. More than 3 million people were seriously affected, and even
a month after the storm about 700,000 people were still without
power.
	   Photographs in the book show the extent of the destruction, as
well as the strange beauty of streets cluttered with ice-covered
wires and branches. There are shots of families huddling together
for candlelit meals, and refugees finding comfort in emergency
shelters.
	   Seeking to avoid any impression that they are profiting from
others' misery, the newspapers involved in producing the book are
contributing their share of royalties to charities which have
assisted ice-storm recovery efforts.
	   The publisher, McClelland and Stewart, also is making a donation
of 50 cents per copy.
	   ``This is not an ordinary book,'' McClelland and Stewart
president Douglas Gibson said in an interview Tuesday. ``For anyone
who was exposed to the ice storm, it's something they have to have
in the same way they have to have their high school year book.''
	   The ice storm hit upstate New York and northern New England as
well as Canada, and Gibson said the book would be marketed starting
in March in the northeastern United States.
	   Though only Canadian newspapers contributed photographs, the
pictures include shots of U.S. utility crews which came to Canada
to help with emergency power-line repairs.

	   LA LIMA, Honduras (AP) _ The banana stalks stand brown and
brittle in the abandoned Chiquita fields, like sculptures of
despair. Around them, the people who for decades have worked the
fields are little better off.
	   A month after Hurricane Mitch destroyed the Honduran production
of Chiquita Brands International and crippled Dole Food Co.
plantations, desperation is settling in for the thousands who
survive off the crop that gave this country its claim to fame as
the original Banana Republic.
	   Next year promises to be even harder.
	   ``I've been left with nothing,'' said Danilo Sanchez, a
37-year-old Chiquita worker who now herds a pair of bone-thin
cattle into the banana fields to feed on rotting fruit.
	   Thousands of workers have lost their jobs. Others are working a
few days a week. Some have lost medical benefits. Most seasonal
workers, like Sanchez, were let go immediately.
	   After the hurricane passed, Chiquita rented aircraft and boats
to help rescue stranded people, and donated millions of dollars in
food, medicine and transportation to Central America.
	   It also let 1,200 seasonal workers go and suspended most of its
7,300 permanent workers for a year.
	   To ease the pain, the company offered full-time workers bonuses
and advances averaging dlrs 370. Workers also can borrow up to dlrs
40 every two weeks.
	   Workers say the loans won't do.
	   ``That's no help to me,'' said Magdelena Sevilla, a single
mother of two who has been camping out in front of her house since
it was covered in mud. ``That's just cutting my throat, because
I'll never be able to work off that debt.''
	   Chiquita is letting workers harvest the 1,700 acres (nearly 700
hectares) of its 25,000 acres (10,100 hectares) that survived here.
The company also says it will continue to provide schooling and
free medical care in addition to housing for about two-thirds of
the workers.
	   ``Up to this point, the company has acted with great social
responsibility,'' said Jimmy Zonta Sing, Chiquita's human resources
and labor relations manager at the La Lima headquarters.
	   Most of the 4,000 full-time workers for Dole, known as Standard
Fruit in Honduras, will continue working a few days a week,
according to their union.
	   To avoid suspending workers, the union agreed to a reduction in
medical benefits: health workers will treat serious and chronic
illnesses, while regular health insurance will not resume until
operations are in full swing again.
	   ``We don't think it's just,'' said Juan Carlos Medina, vice
president of the union representing Dole workers. ``But our backs
were against the wall.''
	   Chiquita union leaders say their colleagues paid too high a
price, especially now that a rise of diarrhea and dengue _ a
mosquito-borne illness that can be fatal _ has put the country on
an epidemic alert.
	   Labor leaders say the health reductions are only one of many
gains that were swept away by the storm.
	   ``The companies are taking advantage of the disaster situation
and using it to introduce changes that we have been fighting
against over the past 10 years,'' said Juan Funez, president of the
union that represents Chiquita workers.
	   ``But what can we do, strike? There is no work. We have no
strength, no power to demand anything.''
	   Company officials plan to implement a new work system long
opposed by unions that assigns more tasks to each worker, to make
operations more efficient.
	   Labor leaders fear it's a prelude to reducing the work force.
	   Officials at Cincinnati-based Chiquita, which wrote off dlrs 50
million this quarter alone, say they're doing their best to soften
the blow while the company makes adjustments to get back on its
feet.
	   Chiquita gets about 15 percent of its bananas from Honduras.
Only Panama and Costa Rica supply Chiquita with more bananas.
	   Even under the best conditions, Chiquita could not begin
replanting until next year and would have nothing to harvest until
2000, said Steven Warshaw, Chiquita's chief operating officer.
	   John Tate, chief financial officer for Dole in Westlake Village,
California, said the company estimates its loss from the hurricane
at about dlrs 100 million.
	   He said about 25 percent of Dole's total banana production came
from Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, and half to three-quarters
of that crop was lost.
	   ``To fully rehabilitate, we think, it will take about two
years.''
	   The workers, meanwhile, are trying to rehabilitate too.
	   Some have taken up temporary residence in flooded encampments
that surround the mosquito-infested banana fields.
	   Peasants have moved into the railroad cars used to take bananas
to port.
	   And others have stayed in their three-room wood-slat homes,
which several generations of banana workers often share.
	   Bertilia Contreras shares one room with her five children and a
three-foot-tall (1-meter-tall) plastic Christmas tree. She put it
up to cheer her children, but said they probably won't find
anything under it on Christmas Day.
	   ``When I look out my door, I feel sad. Everything looks so ugly
now,'' she said. ``It's going to be a sad Christmas.''

Palestinians plan to release Hamas leader this week
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The Palestinian leadership is
likely to order the release this week of a prominent Muslim
militant leader placed under house arrest after a suicide bombing
attempt by a Hamas activist, officials said Tuesday.
	   The release of Hamas leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin would be a sign
of deteriorating Israeli-Palestinian relations already strained by
the delay in implementing the latest land-for-peace deal.
	   Yasser Arafat would probably order Yassin's release of by
Saturday, an official close to Arafat told The Associated Press.
	   Hamas officials said they were aware of the appeals on their
blind, wheelchair-bound leader's behalf. ``We have been informed by
some of our brothers from Fatah (Arafat's faction) regarding this
issue, and we hope their recommendations will be accepted,'' said
Hamas spokesman Ismail Haniye.
	   Yassin was placed under house arrest in October after a Hamas
activist killed himself in an unsuccessful attempt to blow up a
school bus full of Israeli children.
	   The attack came immediately after the U.S.-brokered accords
achieved in Wye River, Maryland.
	   Yassin's house arrest prevented the scuttling of the accord, but
there has been an outbreak of anti-Israel violence since then.
Israel has refused to release Palestinians jailed for killings and
has frozen a planned troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   Among other conditions for going ahead with the withdrawal,
Israel wants the Palestinians to contain incitement by Hamas _ a
popular militant movement that has called for Israel's destruction.
	   Yassin's release would be ``very much in line with the revolving
door policy which we are so upset about,'' said David Bar-Illan, a
senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   ``The less contact the Hamas leaders have with the press, the
less incitement there seems to be,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Palestinians say they have fulfilled their commitments to Wye.
	   ``We have implemented our part of the agreement, and now it's
their turn to implement their part of the agreement,'' said Nabil
Abourdeneh, a top Arafat adviser.
	   The Americans agree. The U.S. State Department called
Netanyahu's conditions new, and credited the Palestinians with
having ``worked hard to implement many of their commitments'' under
the agreement.
	   Palestinians are increasingly worried that Netanyahu's decision
this week to go to early elections will further cripple the
already-ailing peace process.
	   ``The early elections do not cancel the agreement we signed with
the Israeli government,'' Abourdeneh said.

Cardinal says church must work to restore Christmas as religious
</HEADLINE>
holiday &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos planned &QL; 
 &UR; By ANITA SNOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Roman Catholic Cardinal Jaime Ortega said Tuesday
that the church must strive to restore the religious traditions of
Christmas now that it has been declared a permanent government
holiday.
	   ``There is a great work that the church must undertake,''
Ortega, the island's leading Catholic churchman, told an afternoon
news conference. ``It is a job that I think will take many years.''
	   While Cubans have embraced the communist government's decision
to give Dec. 25 as an official day off, few understand that the day
commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ, said Ortega.
	   ``The people accept with enthusiasm any day off,'' the prelate
added. ``Now there is curiosity on the part of the new generations
about what Christmas is.''
	   The Catholic church hoped to refresh the Cuban people in the
Christmas traditions of the past later Tuesday evening with the
first outdoor religious Christmas concert celebrated here since the
holiday was abolished in 1969.
	   A church choir that performed during Pope John Paul II's visit
to Cuba early this year was to sing Christmas music rarely heard
outside a church in nearly three decades.
	   The government granted a Christmas holiday last year as a
one-time favor to the pope before his January visit and decided
last month to make it permanent.
	   Thus far, most of the holiday trappings in this formerly
atheistic nation are secular, such as small plastic trees with
twinkling lights.
	   Despite increasing tensions between Cuban churches and a
government that declared itself atheist in 1962, Christmas remained
an official holiday in Cuba until 1969, when the government was
throwing much of the country's resources into an unsuccessful
effort to harvest 10 million metric tons of sugar.
	   The government argued that holidays interfered with the harvest
and also canceled the New Year's holiday that year. The New Year's
holiday _ which also marked the triumph of the revolution led by
Fidel Castro _ soon returned. But Christmas remained a day of work.
	   In November, the Communist Party said mechanization had reduced
the need for manpower in the sugar harvest and declared that
Christmas once again would be a holiday.
	   In 1976, Cuba's constitution guaranteed freedom of religion and
in 1991, the Communist Party dropped its ban on religious
believers. A year later, Cuba declared itself a secular rather than
an atheist state.
	   Restrictions on believers have fallen away and church-state
relations have warmed, especially since the papal visit.

Next up for Mitchell: Olympic scandal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Canadian consultant; ADDS additional
background &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ George Mitchell has another entry on his roll
call of tough jobs _ trying to get to the bottom of the biggest
corruption scandal in Olympic history.
	   Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader who helped broker
peace in Northern Ireland and is expected to play a key role in
President Clinton's impeachment defense, was selected Tuesday to
lead the latest investigation into possible bribery surrounding the
2002 Salt Lake City Olympics.
	   He and four others, including former White House chief of staff
Ken Duberstein and baseball union chief Donald Fehr, will start
their work for the U.S. Olympic Committee next week and hope to
have a report by the end of February.
	   The goal, Mitchell said during a conference call, is to ensure
that future Olympics in the United States are as clean as fans and
sponsors expect them to be.
	   ``I believe the Olympic movement holds a special place in the
hearts and minds of Americans and people around the world,''
Mitchell said. ``We intend to investigate what happened in the past
and make recommendations to assure that the selection of U.S.
candidate cities for future Olympics is fair and above reproach.''
	   The Mitchell inquiry is the third regarding accusations the Salt
Lake City bidders violated International Olympic Committee rules in
the early 1990s by providing dlrs 400,000 in scholarships to
families of IOC members.
	   The Utah capital also gave away skis, custom shotguns and other
lavish gifts, and even provided free medical care, according to
interviews by The Associated Press and other news outlets.
	   The IOC and the Salt Lake Organizing Committee earlier began
investigations, with senior IOC member Marc Hodler saying the
bribery and blackmail goes far beyond the 2002 Games.
	   Mitchell, who helped broker the Northern Ireland peace accord
and probably will play a key roll of contacting senators on
Clinton's behalf as he faces trial, said he found the Olympic
accusations ``disturbing'' but not stunning.
	   ``I spent 30 years in politics and the last three in Northern
Ireland, and not much shocks me anymore,'' he said.
	   While his panel lacks subpoena power, Mitchell said it would
cooperate with the other investigations in hopes of weeding out
corruption. He said he would turn over any evidence of criminal
wrongdoing to prosecutors. The Justice Department is conducting a
preliminary review of the case.
	   ``We would welcome any information that would help us determine
how best to proceed,'' Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin
said.
	   In Salt Lake, SLOC senior vice president of public
communications Shelley Thomas said organizers would cooperate with
the USOC investigation, as they have pledged to do with the other
inquiries.
	   Gordon Hall, chairman of the SLOC's ethics board, said he
expected the organizing committee's investigation to be finished by
Feb. 11.
	   USOC president Bill Hybl said Salt Lake, in turn, had promised
to cooperate in the latest investigation. He would not rule out
penalties against organizers but said the USOC had no intention of
taking over Salt Lake's Olympic preparations.
	   ``These games will go on,'' he said. ``They will be one of the
most successful, if not the most successful, Winter Games ever.''
	   Tuesday's developments came as Olympic officials tried to calm
jittery sponsors, who pay an increasing percentage of the
multimillion-dollar sports budget and are attracted by an image of
quality and high ethical standards.
	   US West, a major sponsor of the 2002 Olympics, wrote to SLOC
president Frank Joklik to protest the ``unsavory allegations.''
Other sponsors have voiced similar concerns.
	   All corporate sponsors, partners and suppliers in the USOC's
marketing programs had been contacted about the case and the
Mitchell panel's investigation, Hybl said.
	   ``Based on what we know, we have told the sponsors that they can
count on full oversight so that it won't happen in the future,''
Hybl said.
	   The USOC president also said that American cities bidding for
future Olympics and Pan American Games must abide by a 25-page set
of ethics guidelines ``that say what you can and cannot do.''
	   No such USOC rules were in effect when Salt Lake won the Winter
Games in 1995, Hybl said, although IOC rules limited gifts to
members to dlrs 150 each.
	   Other members of the Mitchell panel are Roberta Cooper Ramo,
past president of the American Bar Association, and Jeff Benz, a
lawyer and member of the USOC's athletes council.
	   Hodler said that vote-buying affected the elections that chose
Olympic cities for 1996, 1998 and 2000. He said four people _
including one IOC member _ bragged they could provide blocs of
votes for payoffs up to dlrs 5 million, and that 5 percent to 7
percent of the IOC's 115 members were open to bribes.
	   The IOC is considering changes in the vote process and last
weekend president Juan Antonio Samaranch said members could no
longer visit bidding cities. One candidate for the 2006 Winter
Games, the Polish resort of Zakopane, called Samaranch's move a
``strange solution'' to the bribery scandal.

Vancouver gets go-ahead for CART race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ It took almost three months
to satisfy safety and hospitality concerns, but organizers have
convinced Championship Auto Racing Teams to return in September for
the Vancouver Molson Indy.
	   ``We're ecstatic,'' Stuart Ballantyne, the Molson Indy's general
manager, said Tuesday. ``It's a Christmas present for the fans, the
staff, for the sponsors, for everybody involved with the CART
community.
	   ``Clearly this is a good day.''
	   Both drivers and team officials were vocal in their condemnation
of this year's race, won by Dario Franchitti.
	   The drivers complained about the track, saying it didn't allow
enough passing room and questioned its safety. Owners were furious
to find used syringes and condoms in the downtown areas set aside
for hospitality and sponsor entertainment.
	   Tim Mayer, CART's senior vice-president, said Molstar Sports and
Entertainment, which stages the Vancouver race and the Molson Indy
in Toronto, have made proposals to alleviate these problems.
	   ``What we have gone through with Molstar is a pretty exhaustive
process of working on some changes to the facility,'' Mayer said
from Detroit.
	   ``When we received sufficient details from them it made us
confident the changes would meet our requirements.''
	   Ballantyne wasn't specific on the changes. A news conference has
been planned for January to unveil the altered track and other
improvements.
	   ``CART was not satisfied with their overall experience and there
were some issues with the track and with the amenities that have
been changed or there's an agreement to have some changes,''
Ballantyne said. ``That's what's got us today's announcement.''
	   As late as last week Andrew Craig, CART's chairman of the board,
said while he was encouraged by proposals to upgrade the Vancouver
facility the race remained a provisional date on CART's 1999
calendar.
	   Both Ballantyne and Mayer were cautious when asked how important
this year's event will be to the race's future in Vancouver.
Molstar has a contract with CART and the city of Vancouver through
2001.
	   ``Certainly having CART's agreement and the level of detail
we've gotten to today goes a long way toward resolving any issues
that we could have in the future,'' Ballantyne said.
	   Drivers lambasted the new, 14-turn temporary street circuit for
its lack of passing and overtaking areas. They also expressed
concerns about safety in several areas, especially a flat-out turn
directly in front of the pits.
	   Drivers feared they could lose control and crash into a massive
concrete pylon supporting an elevated train track.
	   ``I wouldn't say the track was unsafe but it did not meet our
standards,'' Mayer said. ``I think all of these have been
addressed.''

Defense will give Miami a chance in playoffs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVEN WINE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DAVIE, Florida (AP) _ As John Elway and Terrell Davis can
attest, the National Football League's stingiest defense will make
the Miami Dolphins dangerous in the playoffs.
	   The point was hammered home Monday night against the Denver
Broncos, whose high-powered offense sputtered in a 31-21 defeat at
Miami.
	   The Dolphins (10-5) earned the final AFC playoff berth as a
wild-card entry. They'll need three postseason wins to play at home
in the Super Bowl, but a defense that has allowed the fewest points
in the NFL gives Miami a chance against anybody.
	   The Broncos lead the AFC in scoring, but Miami allowed them just
219 yards and one offensive touchdown _ on a recovered fumble.
	   ``You're not going to see a defensive performance like that very
often, because that was a talented, talented bunch we went up
against,'' coach Jimmy Johnson said Tuesday. ``Appreciate it.''
	   The speedy, swarming Dolphins held Davis to a season-low 29
yards in 16 carries.
	   ``There just wasn't much running room out there,'' he said.
	   Elway went 13-for-36 for 151 yards, including 6-for-20 in the
second half for 61 yards with two interceptions.
	   ``A very long night,'' Elway said. ``They're no slouches.
Whenever you cover the receivers tightly and put pressure on the
quarterback, you're doing the job defensively.''
	   The Dolphins must hope that defense and Dan Marino are enough in
the playoffs. Their running game was again abysmal Monday, and
Miami has averaged just 2.7 yards per rush in the past month.
	   But Marino enjoyed his best performance of the year, throwing
for 355 yards and four scores in his first matchup against Elway
since 1985.
	   ``Dan played great,'' Elway said. ``That's why he is who he
is.''
	   Johnson termed the victory the biggest in his three seasons with
Miami. He bristled at the suggestion that the Broncos (13-2) had
little incentive because they had already clinched the home-field
advantage through the playoffs.
	   ``If you look at the expression on John Elway's face when he's
scrambling and running for yards and trying to pick up first downs
_ I think they were giving a pretty good effort,'' Johnson said.
	   The Dolphins, upset last week to have just one Pro Bowl
selection _ defensive tackle Tim Bowens _ beat a team with nine of
them.
	   ``We proved to the Denver Broncos and the whole NFL that they
missed out on some of our good players in the Pro Bowl,'' said
cornerback Jerry Wilson, who had an interception. ``We wanted to
make a statement this game, and that's what we did.''
	   The statement was that the Dolphins are difficult to score
against, especially at home, where they've allowed six touchdowns
in eight games.
	   Miami's dominance at Pro Player Stadium underscores the
importance of Sunday's final regular-season game at Atlanta. The
Dolphins will clinch a home game in the first round of postseason
if they win, or if New England loses to the New York Jets.
	   The Dolphins' first-round opponent will be one of two AFC East
rivals, New England or Buffalo. Miami beat both at home this season
and lost to both on the road.

Raptors' Willis wants secret ballot on contract
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Kevin Willis of the Toronto Raptors defied his
union leadership Tuesday and called for National Basketball
Association players to vote by secret ballot in hopes of ending the
lockout.
	   ``The majority would vote for the owners' latest proposal, just
to start playing ball again,'' Willis said, referring to the offer
made last week by NBA commissioner David Stern.
	   The lockout began July 1 and the regular season, which was to
begin Oct. 31, has been delayed until at least late January.
	   No new talks are scheduled, with Stern on vacation in Aspen,
Colorado and union chief Billy Hunter in Oakland, California.
	   Tuesday marked the 10th day since the last round of bargaining,
and players continue to lose dlrs 50 million a week in salaries. If
a deal isn't reached soon, the entire season will be scrapped.
Stern has refused to say when it will be too late to save the
season.
	   The league and the players are trying to determine how to divide
about dlrs 2 billion in annual revenue.
	   Steve Woods, Willis' agent and a professor of sports business at
South Carolina, has an antagonistic relationship with the union. In
October, he was escorted by security guards from a players' meeting
in Las Vegas.
	   ``I believe that a blind ballot would be acceptable,'' Woods
said. ``I think 80 percent would accept it (the proposal), based on
the 15 players I talk to on a regular basis. They would accept it
and be ready to play tomorrow.''
	   Union spokesman Dan Wasserman didn't agree.
	   ``We conducted conference calls over the last two weeks with
more than 120 players on each call,'' he said. ``At least a dozen
players on each call specifically told us they will wait for the
negotiating committee to recommend a deal that is worthy of putting
to a vote.
	   ``Every player is entitled to his opinion, although we have not
heard from Kevin Willis directly. But the vast majority of players
support the authority of the negotiating committee to recommend a
deal.''
	   ``A secret ballot is something the union is adamantly against
because they would feel it would tear a hole in their blanket of
unity,'' Woods said. ``The players' union unity is based more on
peer pressure and collective egos rather than on reasonable minds
coming to a reasonable conclusion.''
	   Jerome Stanley, an agent for Brian Shaw, Todd Day and other
players, says his clients do not find the deal acceptable because
it does not protect the interests of middle-class players.
	   ``People misinterpret what this fight is about,'' Stanley said.
``It's not about third-year players' ability to make dlrs 20
million a year. The union has offered restraints on that. The union
has also offered restraints on salary for rookies. The only thing
the union is insisting on is to let the middle-class players share
in the benefits of playing in the NBA.''
	   In an effort to resolve the deadlock, the union has proposed
mediation, but the league rejects such an approach.

Minister: Libya does not want to delay Lockerbie trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Libyan minister's comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya does not want to delay the trial of
the two Lockerbie bombing suspects but only wants to ensure the
``honesty'' of the trial court, the Libyan foreign minister said
Tuesday.
	   Libya is also not worried about U.S. threats of more sanctions
as a tool to get custody of the two Libyan suspects, the minister,
Omar al-Muntasser, told reporters.
	   He was speaking after meeting with Egypt's Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa. Al-Muntasser arrived in Cairo Monday.
	   The Dec. 21, 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killed 270 people. The prime suspects are two Libyan
intelligence agents and Libya is under U.N. air sanctions aimed at
forcing it to hand over the men for trial.
	   ``We are sure of their innocence. Our sons have not done it and
there is no proof of that,'' al-Muntasser said.
	   Libya already has accepted in principle to the trial of the two
men before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands but their
hand over has been held up over a Libyan demand that if convicted,
the suspects should be jailed in Libya.
	   ``There is no procrastination on our part and the only thing is
that we want to be sure of the honesty of the court and the
guarantees,'' al-Muntasser said without elaborating.
	   The General People's Congress, Libya's parliament, also gave its
conditional approval last week for the trial of the two men in a
country other than the United States or Britain.
	   The United States and Britain insist that the two men should
spend the jail term in Britain.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, speaking at a memorial service
Monday on the bombing's 10th anniversary, warned that the United
States would seek even stronger measures against Libya if the
suspects were not turned over.
	   Al-Muntasser said the U.S. threat ``does not worry me, because
we cannot work on the threats.''
	   In any case, imposing more sanctions is the U.N. Security
Council's job and ``I am sure there will be no more sanctions,'' he
said.
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency said al-Muntasser and Moussa
also discussed the Iraq crisis and the U.N sanctions imposed on
Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990.

Shanahan confident slumping team will regain its edge by playoffs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN MOSSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Through 11 games, they were the class of the
National Football League, knocking off opponents with ease. Through
13 games, despite sudden breakdowns, they remained undefeated.
	   Now, the Denver Broncos have lost two straight games. Fans
calling sports talk shows are panicking, and Broncos players are
beginning to doubt themselves.
	   Not to worry, coach Mike Shanahan insisted on Tuesday, less than
24 hours after the Broncos' 31-21 loss to the Miami Dolphins.
	   The unflappable Shanahan said his team, which on Dec. 6 clinched
homefield advantage throughout the playoffs, has momentarily lost
its edge as it closes out the regular season with some meaningless
games.
	   Monday night's game in Miami would have had huge implications if
the Broncos had taken an unbeaten record into Pro Player Stadium.
The Broncos would have had to get by the Dolphins in order to
maintain their hopes for an undefeated season, duplicating a feat
accomplished only by the 1972 Dolphins. Both present and former
Dolphins didn't want that to happen.
	   But the Broncos stumbled the week before, suffering their first
loss, 20-16 to the New York Giants.
	   That took much of the drama out of the game with Miami, although
the game was important to Miami's playoff hopes and pitted future
Hall of Fame quarterbacks Dan Marino and John Elway.
	   Marino was marvelous, throwing for 355 yards and four
touchdowns. But Elway and running back Terrell Davis, the NFL's
leading rusher, both flopped. Elway completed only 13 of 36 passes
for 151 yards and two interceptions, while Davis managed just 29
yards rushing on 16 carries, leaving him with 1,830 yards and one
game remaining _ on Sunday at home against Seattle (8-7).
	   Shanahan said Elway developed a strained hip flexor muscle
during the game that limited his mobility, and Davis was slowed by
bruised ribs _ neither of which should bother either player next
week.
	   But he made it clear that injuries weren't the cause of his
team's latest loss.
	   ``Dan made some great throws, and their receivers made some big
plays in man coverage,'' Shanahan said. ``Defensively, there were a
number of times when we weren't in the right spot. Offensively, we
had some opportunities we didn't take advantage of.''
	   It marked the fourth straight sub-par performance for a Broncos
team that heretofore had appeared invincible.

Cardinal says church must work to restore Christmas as religious
</HEADLINE>
holiday &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos HAV101,104 &QL; 
 &UR; By ANITA SNOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ The Roman Catholic church must strive to restore
the religious traditions of Christmas now that it has been declared
a permanent government holiday, Cardinal Jaime Ortega said Tuesday.
	   While Cubans have embraced the communist government's decision,
few understand that Dec. 25 commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ,
Cuba's leading Catholic churchman told a news conference.
	   ``The people accept with enthusiasm any day off,'' the prelate
added. ``Now there is curiosity on the part of the new generations
about what Christmas is.''
	   The Catholic church hoped to refresh the Cuban people in the
Christmas traditions of the past later Tuesday evening with the
first outdoor religious Christmas concert celebrated here since the
holiday was abolished in 1969.
	   A church choir that performed during Pope John Paul II's visit
to Cuba early this year was to sing Christmas music rarely heard
outside a church.
	   The government granted a Christmas holiday last year as a
one-time favor to the pope before his January visit and decided
last month to make it permanent.
	   Thus far, most of the holiday trappings in this formerly
atheistic nation are secular, such as small plastic trees with
twinkling lights.
	   ``There is a great work that the church must undertake,'' Ortega
said. ``It is a job that I think will take many years.''
	   Despite increasing tensions between Cuban churches and a
government that declared itself atheist in 1962, Christmas remained
an official holiday in Cuba until 1969, when the government was
throwing much of the country's resources into an unsuccessful
effort to harvest 10 million metric tons of sugar.
	   The government argued that holidays interfered with the harvest
and also canceled the New Year's holiday that year. The New Year's
holiday _ which also marked the triumph of the revolution led by
Fidel Castro _ soon returned. But Christmas remained a day of work.
	   In November, the Communist Party said mechanization had reduced
the need for manpower in the sugar harvest and declared that
Christmas once again would be a holiday.
	   In 1976, Cuba's constitution guaranteed freedom of religion and
in 1991, the Communist Party dropped its ban on religious
believers. A year later, Cuba declared itself a secular rather than
an atheist state.
	   Restrictions on believers have fallen away and church-state
relations have warmed, especially since the papal visit.

breach &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A Qantas Airways airliner carrying
former U.S. President George Bush was involved in a security breach
when it took off with three pieces of unaccompanied baggage earlier
this month, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The Age said Qantas only discovered the breach two hours after
the Boeing 747 had left Melbourne bound for Los Angeles via
Auckland on Dec. 13.
	   The report said Qantas and most other airlines had strict rules
that luggage belonging to passengers who fail to board a flight
must be removed before departure.
	   Two passengers who had checked in luggage on the flight failed
to board because they missed a boarding call, the paper said.
	   Bush had been in Melbourne to attend the Presidents Cup golf
tournament.
	   The Age said it was not known whether any one in Bush's party,
including his wife Barbara, was aware of the security breach.
	   A Qantas spokesman said the airline had taken steps ``to avoid a
recurrence of the situation,'' The Age reported.

Howard: Flexible currency absorbed shocks from Asian crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A flexible exchange rate buffered
Australia's economy against shocks from the Asian economic crisis,
Prime Minister John Howard said Wednesday.
	   ``If ever you had an illustration of the advantage of the
flexible exchange rate, it's how it's worked to Australia's favor
over the past year,' Howard told Australian Broadcasting Corp.
radio.
	   ``One of the reasons why Australia has been able to adjust so
well and to absorb without real damage the shocks coming from the
Asian Pacific region is that we've had a flexible exchange rate and
been able to take the adjustments through our exchange rate.
	   ``If we'd have had a regulated approach, a controlled exchange
rate, we would have been knocked around a lot more because the
decisions that are taken daily in a micro way in a flexible
exchange rate system won't be taken in that way in a controlled
exchange rate.''
	   Howard said Australia had suggested a number of reforms to
international finance systems, particularly in relation to the
activities of hedge funds.
	   He said he hoped the Group of 22, the world's middle-sized
economies, including Australia, would take note of the suggestions.
	   ``I think if there can be more concerted action we can smooth
out some of the bumps that have occurred without in any way
undermining the fundamentals of the global market system,'' Howard
said.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ She lost her baby girl and
nearly her own life.
	   But against the odds of medical science a Catholic homemaker
finally walked out of hospital Tuesday _ more than four months
after being caught in ground zero of Northern Ireland's worst-ever
terrorist attack.
	   Tracey Devine, 27, suffered a slashed face and burns all over
her body when Irish Republican Army dissidents detonated a car bomb
in Omagh, a religiously mixed market town 60 miles (100 kms) west
of Belfast. In all, 29 people died and 370 were wounded in the Aug.
15 blast.
	   Mrs. Devine, the last of the Omagh victims to return home, spent
six weeks in a coma in Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital. When she
awoke, her husband Paul had to tell her their youngest child,
21-month-old Breda, was among the dead.
	   ``It was one of the hardest things I ever had to do,'' he said,
holding hands with his wife, whose head remains tightly bound with
a plastic face guard, neck brace and bandages. ``She did cope with
it quite well.''
	   Mrs. Devine retains clear memories of the day she traveled from
her village of Donemana to Omagh, accompanied by Breda, her brother
Gary and fiancee Donna Marie. Like so many others, they were
shepherded nearer the bomb by police responding to a misleading
phoned warning.
	   ``The bomb went off right beside us. Wee Breda disappeared in a
flash of light,'' she said, noting that her brother and future
sister-in-law also suffered serious burns.
	   The breakaway IRA faction responsible later called a cease-fire,
though none of its members has been directly charged in connection
with the atrocity.
	   ``I hope somebody forgives them because I never will,'' she
said.
	   Her plastic surgeon, Dr. Mohammed Riaz, said she had stood less
than 30 percent chance of survival but ``proved to be a fighter.''
	   Although she had already endured more than 30 hours of
operations to reconstruct parts of her face and body torn by
shrapnel, Riaz said, ``She's going to require a lot more to get
these scars settled down. It's a long way to go yet.''
	   But those worries are for another day, Mrs. Devine said.
	   ``It's really great to be getting home _ home for Christmas with
the other children,'' she said of Anne, 6, Niamh, 4 and Shay, 2.
``They know Breda won't be coming back, but they're glad they're
going to get their mummy back for Christmas.''

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On the first day of what's likely to be a long
and bruising electoral campaign, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
braced for an onslaught from all sides _ but expressing confidence
he would win ``utmost, massive'' voter support. It was a notable
show of bravado from a leader who only a day earlier had been
handed a stinging rejection of his peace policies by lawmakers, who
then voted overwhelmingly to hold early elections. It will be
several more days before the lineup against Netanyahu becomes
clear, but at least half a dozen Israeli politicians have announced
candidacies or are weighing bids to become prime minister.
Balloting is expected by the end of April in what's likely to be
the last direct election for the post. (ISRAEL-POLITICS).
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ After miscalculating in the House, President
Bill Clinton's defenders have moved legalistic maneuvers to the
background for now in favor of an aggressive lobbying effort to
stop a Senate impeachment trial and promote censure instead. And
like Monica Lewinsky, who shelved her first lawyer last summer for
two Washington insiders who won her an immunity deal with
prosecutors, the White House is likely to turn to senior statesmen
in both parties to make a case that senators will heed, advisers
say. ``You have to have the wise men go up _ people with the
stature and instant credibility to be heard by 100 senators,'' said
one adviser to the White House involved in the emerging strategy
discussions. The Senate's leading authority on history and
protocol, Democratic Robert Byrd said Monday he believed the
Constitution allows for a censure, but he also warned that any such
deal must not originate with the White House by the Senate.
(US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT).
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq accused U.S. and British warplanes of
firing two missiles toward the southern city of Basra on Tuesday,
saying the renewed aggression was part of a policy ``to harm
Iraq.'' The Pentagon and the British Defense Ministry denied the
claim, which was reported by the official Iraqi News Agency. Iraq
also warned Tuesday that it won't forgive the oil-rich emirate of
Kuwait for allowing the United States and Britain to use its
military bases to mount last week's airstrikes against the country.
Quoting an unnamed spokesman for the Ministry of Culture and
Information, the Iraqi News Agency dismissed Kuwaiti statements
that the emirate was not involved in the Dec. 16-19 airstrikes.
(IRAQ)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Three round-the-world balloonists drifted high
over the Himalayas on Tuesday, hoping to catch a jet stream out of
prohibited Chinese airspace as quickly as possible. British tycoon
Richard Branson, American millionaire Steve Fossett and Per
Lindstrand of Sweden, aloft in the ICO Global balloon heading
eastward around the globe, had received permission to cross China
below 26 degrees north latitude. But they drifted further north
Monday. The project ground crew said the Chinese had asked the
balloonists to land at the Lhasa airfield Tuesday morning, but that
the balloon overshot the field and it was impossible to come down
anywhere else. After Prime Minister Tony Blair intervened, the
Chinese government granted permission to cross the country, on
condition the balloon leave Chinese airspace as soon as possible.
(BALLOON QUEST)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Against the odds of medical
science, a Catholic homemaker finally walked out of the hospital
Tuesday _ more than four months after being caught in ground zero
of Northern Ireland's worst-ever terrorist attack. Tracey Devine,
27, suffered a slashed face and burns all over her body when Irish
Republican Army dissidents detonated a car bomb in Omagh, a
religiously mixed market town 60 miles (100 kms) west of Belfast.
In all, 29 people died and 370 were wounded in the Aug. 15 blast.
Mrs. Devine spent six weeks in a coma in Belfast's Royal Victoria
Hospital. When she awoke, her husband Paul had to tell her their
youngest child, 21-month-old Breda, was among the dead. On Tuesday,
she left the hospital _ the last of the wounded to go home.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Blue-chip stocks lifted the S-and-P 500 index to
a second straight record, but the broad market was weighed down by
profit-taking in the technology group and another dismal showing by
smaller-company shares. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 55.61
points _ of by 0.6 percent _ to 9,044.46, pushing its winning
streak to four sessions and about 250 points. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ With the U.S. economy demonstrating continued
strong growth despite a world slump, Federal Reserve policy-makers
opted Tuesday to leave short-term interest rates unchanged. The
decision, leaving the benchmark rate on overnight loans between
banks at a four-year low of 4.75 percent, follows three rapid-fire
rate cuts this fall. The Fed cut the rate by a quarter-point on
Sept. 29, Oct. 15 and Nov. 17, calming Wall Street, raising stock
prices and loosening the flow of credit to business borrowers,
which had threatened to freeze up in the world financial turmoil
that followed the collapse of the Russian economy in August. After
the last reduction, policy-makers signaled they were done cutting
for a while by saying ``financial conditions can be expected to be
consistent with fostering sustained economic expansion.''
(US-ECONOMY-INTEREST RATES)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ In a novel approach reflecting the
uncertainties of the Jan. 1 launch of Europe's new currency, the
euro, European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said Tuesday
the bank had decided on an especially narrow corridor for two money
market rates _ for the first three weeks of the euro's existence.
After Jan. 21, the rates would revert to a broader corridor. The
euro-zone's key interest rate, the securities repurchase rate, was
fixed at 3 percent at the beginning of December, removing early
uncertainty about the setting of the key rate for the euro area.
But in a surprise move, Duisenberg announced two other rates - the
marginal lending and deposit rates - would be set at just 3.25 and
2.75 percent respectively until Jan. 21, when they would broaden to
4.5 and 2 percent. (GERMANY-EURO)
	   LONDON (AP) _ British electrical giant, The General Electric
Company PLC, said Tuesday that it will separate its civil and
defense businesses, ahead of a rumored dlrs 39 billion merger with
British Aerospace PLC. The separation may take one of several
forms, the company said in a statement, but it ``will enhance the
ability of GEC to create value for its shareholders by leading the
international defense industry consolidation.'' The Sunday Times
reported this week that GEC and British Aerospace were close to
creating a dlrs 39 billion defense group. Such an alliance would be
the first big-scale union in the European defense industry.
(BRITAIN-GEC)
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ France's oil giant Elf Aquitaine
signed an agreement Tuesday with Romania's national oil company
Petrom for oil exploration and drilling in the Black Sea. ``This is
another important step in Romanian-French bilateral relations,''
said Radu Berceanu, Romanian trade and industry minister. It was
the second important French investment here in the last month.
Societe Generale paid dlrs 200 million for a 51 percent stake in
the Romanian Development Bank. French auto manufacturer Renault is
in negotiations to buy the Romanian Dacia car maker. Under the oil
contract, Elf and Petrom will explore a surface of 10,000 square
kilometers (4,000 sq. miles) in Black Sea for the next 30 years.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Anglo American Corp., the
South African mining and investment conglomerate, says it is still
negotiating to take over Zambia copper mines despite a statement to
the contrary by a Zambian official. Anglo American said Monday it
is concerned about current low copper prices, and that it has not
been able to attract partners, it said. The company said it has a
memorandum of understanding with the Zambian government, but the
memorandum hasn't yet been ratified by the government or the
company. Zambian Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi said Saturday that
Anglo American would take over Nchanga, Nkana and Konkola mines,
the remaining major assets of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines.

Minister: Libya does not want to delay Lockerbie trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya doesn't want to delay the trial of the
two Lockerbie bombing suspects but only wants to ensure the
``honesty'' of the trial court, the Libyan foreign minister said
Tuesday.
	   Libya is also not worried about U.S. and British threats of more
sanctions as a tool to get custody of the two Libyan suspects, the
minister, Omar al-Muntasser, told reporters.
	   He was speaking after meeting with Egypt's Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa. Al-Muntasser arrived in Cairo Monday.
	   The Dec. 21, 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killed 270 people. The prime suspects are two Libyan
intelligence agents and Libya is under U.N. air sanctions aimed at
forcing it to hand over the men for trial.
	   ``We are sure of their innocence. Our sons have not done it and
there is no proof of that,'' al-Muntasser said.
	   Libya already has accepted in principle a trial of the two men
before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands but their
handover has been held up over a Libyan demand that if convicted,
the suspects should be jailed in Libya.
	   ``There is no procrastination on our part and the only thing is
that we want to be sure of the honesty of the court and the
guarantees,'' al-Muntasser said without elaborating.
	   The General People's Congress, Libya's parliament, also gave its
conditional approval last week for the trial of the two men in a
country other than the United States or Britain.
	   The United States and Britain insist that the two men should
spend the jail term in Britain.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, speaking at a memorial service
Monday on the bombing's 10th anniversary, warned that the United
States would seek even stronger measures against Libya if the
suspects were not turned over.
	   Britain also said it would ask the Security Council to look at
further measures when it holds its scheduled review of Libyan
sanctions in February.
	   Al-Muntasser said the threat ``does not worry me, because we
cannot work on the threats.''
	   In any case, imposing more sanctions is the U.N. Security
Council's job and ``I am sure there will be no more sanctions,'' he
said.
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency said al-Muntasser and Moussa
also discussed the Iraq crisis and the U.N sanctions imposed on
Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990.

Tribunal indicts two Bosnian Croats for persecuting Muslims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
indicted two Bosnian Croats for a vicious campaign of terror that
drove tens of thousands of Muslims from their homes.
	   The two men, connected to a paramilitary group called the
Convicts Battalion, were allegedly involved in a string of
atrocities in and around Mostar between May 1993 and March 1994,
prosecutors said Tuesday.
	   The U.N. court indicted Mladen Naletilic, 52, on 17 war crimes
counts for allegedly commanding the Convicts Battalion.
	   Naletilic faces four charges of crimes against humanity, six of
breaches of the Geneva Conventions and seven of breaches of the
laws and customs of war.
	   Also charged was Vinko Martinovic, 35, who prosecutors say
commanded a sub-unit of the Convicts Battalion called the
Anti-Terrorist Group. Martinovic faces 22 charges, including five
of crimes against humanity.
	   The city of Mostar in southern Bosnia in 1993 was scene of some
of the most savage fighting of the 3 1-2-year war and the city
remains divided between Bosnian Croats and Muslims.
	   Both men face maximum life sentences if convicted.
	   Both are Bosnian Croats but also hold Croatian citizenship, the
tribunal said in a press release. They are believed to have been
arrested by Croat authorities and to be in custody in Zagreb.
	   The tribunal did not say if plans had been made for their
transfer to its high-security holding cells in The Hague.
	   According to a summary of their indictment released late
Tuesday, the two men used ``killings, beatings, torture, evictions,
destruction of cultural and religious heritage, looting, ... mass
expulsions, detentions and imprisonment'' to drive Muslims from
their homes.
	   All of the acts followed ``a pattern of systematic ethnic
discrimination,'' the indictment added.
	   Set up in 1993, the tribunal has indicted more than 50 war
crimes suspects and has more than 20 in custody.

Three confirmed dead in Mexico helicopter crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican Navy personnel searching the wreckage
of a helicopter that crashed on a sparsely inhabited island in the
Gulf of California recovered the bodies of of three New Zealanders.
	   The three apparently died Saturday when the helicopter they were
using to locate and collar Cimarron sheep crashed on Tiburon
Island, about 10 miles (16 kms) off Mexico's coast.
	   The craft, owned by the U.S. Western Slope Helicopter, was
working on a Mexican government contract to collect and relocate
the big-horn sheep on the island, a New Zealand news agency
reported.
	   A Navy helicopter was able to locate the wreckage of the Hughes
500 chopper Monday after U.S. experts used radio detection gear to
locate signals emitted by collars the New Zealanders had carried to
track the sheep.
	   But seamen were unable to recover the cadavers because of bad
weather and the extremely steep slope where the wreckage was found.
	   The searchers finally climbed up a 3,300-foot (1,000 meter) rock
face Tuesday to get to the bodies, which were partially burned and
thrown out of the cockpit, investigators said.
	   ``It was apparently a high-speed crash, but the causes and
circumstances of the accident won't be known until the Civil
Aeronautics Office finishes its investigation,'' Marco Antonio
Ochoa, an official at the airport in the nearby city of Hermosillo,
told the government news agency Notimex Tuesday.
	   Cloud cover over the island had delayed search efforts and could
have contributed to the crash.
	   Ochoa identified the men as Adam Travor, Mark Williams and
Daniel Innis, but no hometowns were immediately available and
officials at the New Zealand embassy in Mexico City were not
available to confirm that report.
	   Very few people live on Isla Tiburon year round. The Sierra
Menor and the Sierra Kunkaak mountains run across the island,
roughly from north to south. However, the island is very rich in
vegetation and wildlife.
	   Tiburon is a special biosphere reserve, Mexico's biggest island
but with only a small transient population of people, but 39
species of reptiles and 52 species of land mammals.

Many priests not lonely or celibate in Peru's Andes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HUANCAYO, Peru (AP) _ Jose Zarate was eating breakfast with his
wife and three children in their home in this Andean city when the
telephone rang. A merchant wanted him to bless his new medical
supplies shop.
	   Packing his Bible, crucifix and holy water in a black case,
Zarate headed off to carry out his priestly duties in the poor
mountain community 120 miles (190 kilometers) east of Lima.
	   The wiry 72-year-old is one of dozens of married men officially
stripped of their priesthoods and parishes by the Roman Catholic
Church, but who continue giving services in the Andes mountains in
a widely accepted outlaw priesthood.
	   The defrocked priests say they are only being open about a
practice not uncommon among Catholic priests in Peru.
	   Zarate estimates more than 80 percent of priests in Peru have
wives, and often children. Some American priests working in Peru
put the figure closer to one in two _ still among one of the
highest rates in the world, they say.
	   ``Almost all priests in the Andes have families, but they are
forced to hide them,'' Zarate said. ``It's time for the Catholic
hierarchy to end the hypocrisy and make the celibacy of its priests
optional.''
	   Church leaders acknowledge the centuries-old tradition of
non-celibacy in Peru but say they are working to end it by easing
the isolation of priests in remote communities and supervising them
more.
	   ``Before, the priests were almost completely abandoned by the
church _ their bishop visited them once every 10 years _ but the
new mentality is to visit them more often,'' said Archbishop Albano
Quinn of Sicuani in the Andean department of Cuzco. Quinn backs the
church's celibacy position.
	   Priests face extraordinary pressures to form families in Peru's
Andean communities, which often see celibacy as unnatural, said the
Rev. Thomas Garr, an American Jesuit priest who has worked in Peru
for 25 years.
	   Taking a wife is seen as proof of male adulthood. Without one, a
man has great difficulty being taken seriously by Andean people,
Garr said.
	   Added to the social pressure are the years of loneliness and
isolation from the community of priests, he said.
	   ``When I arrived in my Andean parish, people asked me why I
didn't have a woman,'' said Garr, who is not married. ``They joked
that they hoped I didn't take any of their wives, I guess because
it had happened in the past.''
	   Most Andean Indian communities, which were forcibly converted by
the Spanish invaders, are devoutly Catholic but have never
incorporated all church doctrine and they mix in local beliefs,
anthropologists say.
	   In Peru's ancient Inca and Aymara cultures, the holy men had
families, and celibacy is still not fully accepted by those
communities today, said Federico Kauffman-Doig, a Peruvian
archaeologist.
	   Kauffman-Doig, whose great-grandfather was a priest with 10
children, has traveled the Andes in search of ruins for decades. He
often sleeps in the local priest's house when there is no hotel.
	   Most of the priests he has stayed with have had families, he
said. ``They'll say the children in the house are nieces and
nephews, and that the women are cousins.''
	   The church ban on marriage sometimes leads priests to deny or
abandon children, married priests charge. In the Andes, the
expression ``son of a priest'' is used to denote someone who is
denied his fair share.
	   Although the tradition of non-celibate priests is strongest in
Peru, it exists across Latin America.
	   The Latin American Association of Married Priests has chapters
in 11 countries, said former Argentine Bishop Geronimo Podesta, a
member of the association.
	   ``The problem of staying celibate is especially difficult for
priests in Andean countries, and in parts of Africa, where the man
without a family has a low social status,'' Podesta said.
	   The group wants the Catholic hierarchy to make celibacy
optional, arguing the restriction is not demanded in the Bible and
is not feasible in some regions.
	   The church has required celibacy for priests since the 11th
century, before which time it was permissible for them to marry.
	   Zarate's wife of 30 years, Julia Bernuy, said she initially had
doubts about her husband's married-priest status, fearing rejection
by the community.
	   ``But when I saw that people needed him, I came to support his
work,'' she said.
	   Married men as priests aren't universally accepted in the Andes.
	   ``A priest's family is the people of God; he can't have his own
family. I came to this service without knowing the priest was
married and wouldn't have come if I had,'' Domitila Rodriguez, a
34-year-old teacher, said after attending a Mass celebrated by
married priest David Camayo.
	   Others admire the men's honesty or think their marital status
simply doesn't matter.
	   ``It's better that a priest marry and have a family than keep a
woman hidden somewhere as commonly happens,'' said farmer Jorge
Medina.

Hong Kong still betting, but recession cuts into horse track take

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Twice a week, 45 weeks a year, a fifth of the
people in Hong Kong get caught up in the territory's sporting
obsession _ betting on horse races.
	   Nothing, not even recent race-fixing charges, dampens many fans'
fervor for the sport.
	   Every time the horses break out of the gate at Happy Valley race
course, or the newer track at Sha Tin, more than 1 million people
either watch from the grandstands or tune in on television and
radio, hoping they've backed a winner.
	   Yet while the bustle at Happy Valley is as loud as ever, lately
the buzz has been deceptive. Asia's economic downturn has Hong Kong
gamblers putting less money down on the ponies.
	   Like many of the bettors leaving an off-track betting shop,
building painter Yip Yiu Kwong said he's being more cautious about
how much he bets, generally putting down about 20 percent less than
he used to.
	   ``Before, work was easy to find. I had more spare money,'' Yip
said.
	   He said he now bets a few hundred Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
25 to U.S. dlrs 40), trying to turn that modest sum into a small
fortune by picking the top three finishers in a race.
	   As wagering tapers off, the Hong Kong Jockey Club is taking the
blow, and that has wide implications for all of Hong Kong.
	   The club is a nonprofit organization that holds a monopoly on
the racing business in Hong Kong but gives millions to the tax
collector and charity. Gamblers bet some 91.5 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 11.7 billion) on horse races last year, and the
club's take of 17 billion (U.S. dlrs 2.2 billion) went mostly to
the government and to good causes.
	   This year, revenues are down 15 percent. ``The major factor is
still the economy,'' said Wilson Cheng, information secretary at
the Club.
	   About 7.5 percent of the government's tax revenue comes from
betting, and a budget deficit already projected to run into the
billions this year will be aggravated by the shortfall of racing
money.
	   Racing suffered another blow Dec. 15 when authorities announced
the arrest of 13 people, including former and current jockeys, for
allegedly fixing races. One ex-jockey was sentenced to six months
in jail after admitting he accepted bribes of 180,000 Hong Kong
dollars (dlrs 23,000) in exchange for rigging two races in 1996.
	   The scandal failed to deter the faithful, however. Betting
dropped only moderately on the first racing day after the arrests.
	   The fall in revenues has raised questions about how much money
will be going into the Jockey Club's charity fund, which funneled
2.2 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 284 million) to hospitals,
schools and other community services last year. The club says no
donations will be cut for at least two years.
	   Despite the recent slip in betting, Hong Kong racing is the envy
of many horse tracks around the world, Cheng said.
	   While tracks in the United States are struggling with slumping
fan interest and competition from casinos, Cheng said the Jockey
Club sees few people deserting the races for the casinos in nearby
Macau or for the Hong Kong lottery, which the club also operates.
	   Even those who don't like horse racing itself join in the
gambling frenzy.
	   ``I'm not that crazy about horse racing,'' said Anderson Chan, a
businessman who has never been to the track but has been betting on
the horses for 25 years.
	   Horse races have been a part of life in Hong Kong since early
British settlers introduced the sport in the mid-19th century. The
first races were run around the Chinese New Year, and the
associated betting tapped a favorite Hong Kong pastime _ gambling.
	   Although the races and lottery are now the only legal forms of
gambling, smaller-scale betting on the traditional Chinese game
mahjong is widespread.
	   Horse racing is king, though. It is for Hong Kong what baseball
is to the United States or what soccer is to England.
	   ``It's the national sport,'' said Lawrence Wadey, racing
correspondent for the South China Morning Post, which is one of
just two English-language dailies in a territory that boasts about
50 publications devoted to horse racing.

CAPITOL PUNISHMENT: A scandal few wanted and no one could avoid

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ He atoned on three continents and delivered a
speech viewed as so inappropriate for the occasion that one
biographer rushed into print a book subtitled ``A
Four-and-a-Half-Minute-Speech Reveals This President's Entire
Life.''
	   She couldn't keep a secret or a lawyer, and displayed terrible
judgment in selecting a girlfriend with a tape recorder. She dared
to daydream that he would one day leave his wife.
	   Together they made the word ``cigar'' a subject of smirks and
discussion about what to tell the children.
	   He was Bill Clinton, the president. And she, of course, was the
half-his-age, young-enough-to-be-his-daughter Monica Lewinsky, a
White House intern whose lingerie became the subject of official
business.
	   ``In the course of flirting with him, she raised her jacket in
the back and showed him the straps of her thong underwear, which
extended above her pants,'' said the ``Referral to the United
States House of Representatives pursuant to Title 28, United States
Code, 595(c),'' otherwise known as the Starr report.
	   The first kiss followed, reported its author, prosecutor Kenneth
Starr.
	   In the course of the 98th year of the 20th century, Americans
had themselves a scandal few wanted and no one could avoid.
	   It was everywhere. It cost the president his dignity and the
speaker of the House of Representatives his job, then brought down
his would-be successor. It provided Clinton an epitaph, ``I did not
have sexual relations with that woman _ Miss Lewinsky.''
	   It generated 50,000 pages of testimony to a court investigative
panel and 445 pages of conclusions from independent counsel Starr,
who found 11 reasons to impeach the president.
	   Ms. Lewinsky had kissed and told. In love, she could not keep a
secret. Starr's lawyers counted up 12 listeners: six friends, a
former boyfriend, two therapists, her mother, an aunt and the
ever-attentive Linda Tripp.
	   Ms. Lewinsky told one of her friends that maybe when the
president's White House days were over, she would become the second
Mrs. Clinton. The girlfriend told Starr's court panel. Starr told
Congress. Congress told the world on the Internet.
	   He called her ``Sweetie'' or ``Baby.'' She called him
``Handsome.'' They held hands. And talked dirty on the telephone.
Once she asked if he ever expected more from her than sex. He said
he did.
	   As scandals go, this one went in weird directions. The first
lady blamed it on a vast, right-wing conspiracy. Her husband
invoked a Hebrew psalm to say he was sorry and summoned clergy to
receive his regret. And Mrs. Tripp told the American people: ``I'm
you. I'm just like you. I'm an average American.''
	   The Supreme Court made a supreme miscalculation. The court said,
9-0, that Paula Jones could go forward with her sexual harassment
lawsuit against the president. saying it was ``highly unlikely to
occupy any substantial amount of petitioner's time.''
	   As it turned out, the case occupied a substantial amount of
petitioner Clinton's time. The country's, too.
	   Twice the president swore to tell the truth. In January, he
swore to Mrs. Jones' lawyers that he had not engaged in sexual
relations with Ms. Lewinsky. In August, questioned before the court
panel about Ms. Lewinsky's recollections to the contrary, he said
it all depended on what one meant by ``sex.''
	   Whereupon he went to the country in that 4 1-2 -minute speech
and said his behavior had been ``not appropriate'' but his
testimony had been ``legally accurate.'' He had ``misled'' people,
he said. And spent the rest of his speech skewering not himself but
Starr. Absolutely typical of Clinton, concluded biographer David
Maraniss in his new book, ``The Clinton Enigma.''
	   The speech laid an egg _ too short on contrition, said the
consensus, and not just Republicans. The Republicans saw perjury,
mendacity and impeachment.
	   And so Clinton, he of the narrow escapes, hit the atonement
trail. He begged forgiveness at every turn. ``It gets a little
easier the more you do it,'' he said.
	   Around election time, the country seemed to reach a conclusion:
Clinton's behavior was shameful, but times were good. Democrats
took five House seats from the Republicans, and Newt Gingrich
resigned, to be followed by Bob Livingston, his designated
replacement, who owed up to infidelities of his own.
	   And as Republicans in Congress whetted their impeachment axes,
he atoned again, showing up in the Rose Garden to say, ``I would
give anything to go back and undo what I did.''
	   To make the point, having tried just about everything else, he
recited a verse from to ``The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'':
	   The Moving Finger writes, and, having writ,
	   Moves on: nor all your Piety nor Wit
	   Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line.
	   Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.
	   This time, for Bill Clinton, what the Moving Finger writ was a
stinging word: Impeachment. And in the polls that measure his job
performance, he rose.

	   PANDIASSOU, Haiti (AP) _ All his life he farmed without hope of
ever making a real living.
	   Today, Genold Mathieu brings tomatoes, lettuce and fish to the
table for his wife and 14 children. The 10 school-age kids attend
classes. And soon there will be a hospital to treat them when they
are ill.
	   His fortunes, and those of more than 20,000 others in
Pandiassou, have changed in the 2 1-2 years since a Roman Catholic
monk inspired the farmers to build fish ponds.
	   Some people see the project as a model for restoring a measure
of social and economic dignity to Haiti, a ravaged land that often
seems hopelessly mired in lethargy and despair.
	   So dramatic is the change that people in Pandiassou, five
kilometers (three miles) from the central city of Hinche, measure
time as before or after the ponds.
	   Before, most years brought drought _ fatal to farming in a land
made largely arid by centuries of deforestation and land
mismanagement. That meant unemployment, hunger and the death of
livestock _ the equivalent of a pension and savings plan for
subsistence farmers. Even in a good year, a hardworking farmer
could earn only about 2,700 gourdes (dlrs 170) a hectare (dlrs 70
an acre) from the single annual harvest.
	   Now, irrigation from the ponds allows three harvests a year, and
farmers can make 32,000 gourdes (dlrs 2,000) on every hectare (dlrs
800 on every acre) from each harvest. Most have small plots ranging
from a quarter-hectare to a half-hectare (a half acre to 1 1-4
acres).
	   For the first time, Mathieu can grow tomatoes, lettuce and
cabbage, not only millet. Fish from the ponds add protein and taste
to meals that used to consist solely of millet or corn mush.
	   It all started with Brother Franklin Armand and the Little
Brothers and Sisters of the Incarnation, a religious order he
founded 22 years ago. The order, which has 100 religious members
and 200 lay associates, bought land in the area and persuaded the
farmers to use it to build ponds that would serve their community.
	   Today, there are 29 of the ponds, from the size of a swimming
pool to a football field, stocked with tens of thousands of fish.
When the rain falls, water accumulates in the ponds, which feed an
irrigation system for the fields.
	   ``The ponds have saved our lives. We're beginning to see the
light,'' said Alix Sauver Jean-Charles, 65, who has fathered 19
children.
	   The invigorated local economy allowed farmers to form a
cooperative that now has 2,000 members. Most households comprise 10
or more people, including large and extended families and laborers.
With low-interest loans repayable over 20 years, 113 new homes have
been built.
	   The cooperative employs a land surveyor, and members have access
to legal help to settle land disputes. There is a service that
rents oxen and plows.
	   Everyone credits the 51-year-old Armand.
	   ``The word of God doesn't get along with empty bellies and
seatless trousers,'' he said, wearing his perpetual smile. ``Haiti
is a small country. We can solve our problems if we are rigorous,
work hard and have vision.''
	   And a lot of help from friends abroad.
	   The European Union gave dlrs 800,000 for the pond and irrigation
project. The U.N. Development Program provided a dlrs 1 million
grant.
	   The foundation of American philanthropist George Soros provides
dlrs 170,000 a year to schools founded by Armand _ a nursery school
for 100 children and a vocational and secondary school with 400
students.
	   Increasingly, their school breakfast and lunch comes from food
grown locally, giving hope that eventually the cooperative will
support itself.
	   On Nov. 23, the co-op inaugurated a new freezer facility to
store fish, which the members hope to sell.
	   While agricultural production has fallen in most parts of Haiti,
in Pandiassou 103 farms had increased production this year, up from
30 farms with higher output last year.
	   ``We agreed to fund this project because people were already
hard at work here,'' said Michelle Pierre-Louis, the Soros
foundation director in Haiti. ``One day, they will be able to do
without us.''

In bid for stable currency launch, Europe sets interest rates in
</HEADLINE>
narrow range &QL;

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The European Central Bank has set an
extremely narrow range for short-term interest rates in a move
aimed at smoothing the Jan. 1 launch of Europe's new currency, the
euro.
	   Wim Duisenberg, the president of the central bank, also said
Tuesday that it was highly unlikely that the bank's key short-term
rate would be lowered from its current 3 percent, which he called
``very low by historical standards.''
	   ``Markets don't expect a change of interest rates in the near
future,'' he said.
	   The European Central Bank will set monetary policy for the 11
nations initially participating in the euro _ Austria, Belgium,
Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Spain and Portugal. The decision Tuesday on interest
rates was announced in the bank's last news conference before the
euro is inaugurated and on the same day the U.S. Federal Reserve
left its key short-term rates unchanged.
	   The key European securities refinance interest rate, the
interest on short-term loans by the central bank where securities
are pledged as collateral, was fixed at 3 percent at the beginning
of December.
	   On Tuesday, Duisenberg announced two related rates would be set
very closely to the key rate for at least the first three weeks of
the euro's introduction. The deposit rate, the interest banks earn
on overnight deposits with the European Central Bank, was set at
2.75 percent. The marginal lending rate, the interest on overnight
loans by the European Central Bank, was set at 3.25 percent.
Duisenberg said that the narrow range would prevail until Jan. 21.
when the gap between those rates would widen to 2 percent for the
deposit rate to 4.5 percent for the marginal lending.
	   In effect, the European Central Bank set a very limited ceiling
and a floor on short-term rates for the launch of the euro to limit
volatility, said Pierre Ellis, senior international economist at
Primark Decision Economics in New York.
	   ``Clearly, they want to keep things as stable as possible as
they introduce this currency,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief
international economist at Standard and Poor's DRI in Lexington,
Massachusetts.
	   Stability is important because big swings in the euro could
result if European rates gyrate. Higher rates would lift the euro
against the dollar and make it harder for European manufacturers to
compete in terms of price when selling their goods on world
markets.
	   Duisenberg said that by limiting the range of short-term rates
initially to one-half percentage point was aimed at smoothing the
way for implementing the new currency.
	   With just over a week remaining to the begin of the historic
project of currency union, Duisenberg called on governments
launching the euro to maintain fiscal restraint and continue ``the
political impetus to achieve over the medium-term balanced budgets
and even a small surplus.''
	   ``What I would advise governments to do is to inspire that
feeling of continuity and stability _ sooner rather than later,''
he said.

Strong winds, torn sails force American skipper out
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHARLESTON, South Carolina (AP) _ One of three American skippers
left in the Around Alone around-the-world yacht race has turned his
battered boat back toward South Africa after pulling out of the
race.
	   Skipper George Stricker was fighting gail-force winds Tuesday
with all of his sails torn but one. The Kentucky native told race
officials he was being tossed about and blown away in the Indian
Ocean.
	   Stricker and 13 other sailors left Cape Town, South Africa, last
week on the second leg of the race. The race started in Charleston
on Sept. 27 and will end there this spring.
	   ``It was the boat that broke. It wasn't the skipper,'' said
Charleston resident Jeff Shattuck, who helped Stricker with onboard
computer problems before the race's start.
	   Those who have talked to Stricker, 63, say he is in good spirits
despite having to pull out of the race.
	   Winds of over 60 mph (96 kmph) are forecast as the remaining
skippers sail toward New Zealand to finish the 7,000-mile
(11,200-kilometer) second leg of the race.

Fugitive found frozen dead in wheel well of airplane in Trinidad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ The frozen body of a man wanted
on kidnapping charges was found Tuesday in the wheel well of a
jetliner in Trinidad, police said.
	   Former Antiguan police officer Trevor Jacobs, 30, had apparently
snuck into a space in the landing gear apparatus of the MD-80,
which had stopped in Antigua en route from Toronto, said Peter
Hill, customer service manager for Trinidad-based airline BWIA.
	   Documents he carried identified him as Jacobs, and police later
confirmed his identity with fingerprints and a photograph sent from
Antigua, where he is wanted on charges several criminal charges,
including the kidnapping of 60-year-old Donna Pietracupa on Oct. 7.
	   Pietracupa later released unharmed.
	   Airline workers found the body after the airplane had been towed
into a hangar for maintenance at Trinidad's Piarco International
Airport.
	   ``We found the body during an inspection of the landing gear,''
Hill said. ``This raises serious questions about the security at
whatever airport he got into the plane.''

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ A former naval admiral from
Argentina's 1970s dirty war, facing charges of child kidnapping,
benefited from a former underling's testimony on Tuesday.
	   Eduardo Massera, a member of the military junta that ruled in
1976-83, went to court to face testimony from former navy Capt.
Jorge Perren in the case of two children born to parents in
captivity.
	   Recanting from earlier testimony, Perren ``said clearly he had
not received orders for the kidnapping of children,'' Massera's
lawyer, Miguel Arce Aggeo, told reporters.
	   Human rights groups say that children born to dissidents held in
captivity during the ``dirty war'' were frequently adopted by
military officials. Massera's case involves the children of
Patricia Roisinblit and Cecilia Vinas, two women who disappeared in
1976 from the Navy Mechanics School.
	   Vinas family lawyer Alcira Rios said that Perren ``behaved like
an underling facing his superior officer.''
	   Eight years after they received a presidential pardon, charges
of child kidnapping have landed Massera and fellow junta member
Jorge Videla back in court.
	   The Argentine government says nearly 9,000 people disappeared
during the military regime's war on leftists and dissidents. Human
rights groups say the figure is closer to 30,000.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The Civil Aviation Board has
announced it will require Brazil's four largest airlines to pay
special credits to passengers who miss domestic flights because of
overbooking.
	   Starting Wednesday, bumped passengers will get a credit of
between $105 and $350, depending on the flight and the length of
the delay, board director Marco Antonio Oliveira said.
	   The credit is only good for tickets, upgrades or other airline
services. The airline also must pay for meals, phone calls,
transportation and hotels for longer delays.
	   Oliveira said the aviation board had received 716 complaints
this year from victims of overbooking and had issued 138 fines to
the airlines.
	   He added that the plan was an ``emergency measure'' for the
summer vacation season, which starts this month in Brazil.

Asia's top three markets expect to compete for euro dominance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With FEA-The Euro-India &QL; 
 &UR; By THOMAS WAGNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Asian currency markets have been the scene of many
wild battles _ witness the devaluations that threw the region into
financial crisis _ but the next big fight may start off quietly.
	   Thanks to global time zones, traders in Asia will have the first
chance to carry out foreign exchange dealings in the European
Union's new common currency, the euro, after its Jan. 1 launch.
	   The first dealings are likely to be cautious, analysts predict,
as investors try to decide whether euros should be worth slightly
more or slightly less than the world's other two big currencies:
the dollar and the Japanese yen.
	   All eyes will probably be on what happens later on the first
trading day in London and New York. The euro will technically be
launched by 11 EU nations on New Year's Day, which falls on a
Friday, so it won't be traded on financial markets until the
following Monday.
	   But even if the euro gets off to a slow start in Asia, the
trading eventually is expected to intensify into a bitter
competition among its top foreign exchange markets _ Tokyo,
Singapore and Hong Kong _ as they try to dominate the trade.
	   Countries such as China also are expected to use the euro to
diversify foreign reserves now held in dollars, which could
eventually reduce the American currency's dominance in Asia.
	   For weeks, banks in the region's three financial centers have
been working hard to prepare themselves to quote firm euro-dollar
and euro-yen foreign exchange rates when the new currency begins
trading in Asia.
	   In addition, some banks, especially European ones, plan to
create markets with a range of euro-denominated foreign exchange
products, such as euro-British pound and euro-Swiss franc. Britain,
although a member of the 15-nation European Union, is opting out of
the first round of the euro club. Switzerland is not an EU member.
	   To prepare for the new market, the banks have had to train
staffs, educate clients, establish euro-denominated accounts and
adapt and test their computer systems.
	   ``The competition among Singapore, Tokyo and Hong Kong will be
intense,'' said Miron Mushkat, a vice chairman of Indocam Asia
Asset Management in Hong Kong. ``In the present climate, with
financial institutions dealing with the crisis, the euro is likely
to be seized upon as a new opportunity.''
	   Of the three, Tokyo currently boasts the biggest foreign
exchange market, trading an average of dlrs 149 billion in
currencies a day, according to a recent Bank of International
Settlements survey. Trading averaged dlrs 139 billion a day in
Singapore and dlrs 82 billion in Hong Kong.
	   Although Japan's market is bigger than Singapore's, the
Southeast Asian city state is rapidly gaining ground.
	   The value of foreign exchange trading in Singapore grew by 32
percent from 1995 through 1998, the survey said, while Tokyo's
volume dropped 8 percent and Hong Kong's fell 13 percent.
	   While Tokyo naturally focuses on yen trading, Singapore offers a
far more liquid market in the German mark. And that could give it
an edge in the euro, as it replaces the mark.
	   Singapore's de facto central bank, the Monetary Authority of
Singapore, also seems determined to make the city an attractive
center of euro trading.
	   While the three currency markets compete for dominance, bankers
will be studying the euro's potential for being accepted in the
region as a reserve currency.
	   China has announced it may convert a proportion of its dlrs 145
billion worth of foreign exchange reserves into the euro. And other
Asian central banks are expected to follow suit eventually.
	   ``It goes without saying that the bias toward the U.S. dollar in
Asia is likely to diminish over time,'' said Mushkat. ``The only
question is how long that will take and how far it will go.''

Indian software poised for business in euro currency conversions
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Flush with success from lucrative Y2K
projects for American companies, Indian software firms are poised
to do big business with Europe as it switches to the new single
currency.
	   ``Euro currency is a major opportunity for us,'' said Dewang
Mehta, executive director of the National Association of Software
and Services Companies.
	   The group estimates that by 2002, earnings will be close to dlrs
2 billion for Indian companies helping European banks and financial
institutions change to the common currency. Currently, India's
total earnings from software exports is dlrs 2.3 billion.
	   For the last few years, major Indian software companies like
Bangalore-based Infosys and Microland and Satyam Computers in
Hyderabad made their fortunes offering year 2000 solutions to
foreign clients, mainly in the United States. Today, almost a fifth
of 40,000 software professionals are concentrating on the Y2K
problem. Unless reprogrammed or replaced, computers won't be able
to figure out what year it is in 2000.
	   Mehta said many Indian software firms are offering overseas
clients package deals designed to address both the euro and Y2K
conversions.
	   Currently, as many as 158 of the Fortune 500 companies get
software from India. The euro opportunity is likely to extend over
several years as only 11 of the European Union's 15 members will
participate in the Jan. 1 launch of the euro. The other countries
may join later on, keeping the channels open for Indian software
firms.
	   When the world first awoke to Indian software professionals in
the late 1980s, 95 percent of India's earnings came from flying
engineers to service clients abroad. Today, many companies offer
``offshore'' services, meaning that work is done in India and is
linked by high-speed optic fiber to clients abroad.
	   ``Confidence has built up abroad,'' said Seshagiri.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Twice a week, 45 weeks a year, a fifth of the
people in Hong Kong get caught up in the territory's sporting
obsession _ betting on horse races.
	   Nothing, not even recent race-fixing charges, dampens many fans'
fervor for the sport.
	   Every time the horses break out of the gate at Happy Valley race
course, or the newer track at Sha Tin, more than 1 million people
either watch from the grandstands or tune in on television and
radio, hoping they've backed a winner.
	   Yet while the bustle at Happy Valley is as loud as ever, lately
the buzz has been deceptive. Asia's economic downturn has Hong Kong
gamblers putting less money down on the ponies.
	   Like many of the bettors leaving an off-track betting shop,
building painter Yip Yiu Kwong said he's being more cautious about
how much he bets, generally putting down about 20 percent less than
he used to.
	   ``Before, work was easy to find. I had more spare money,'' Yip
said.
	   He said he now bets a few hundred Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
25 to U.S. dlrs 40), trying to turn that modest sum into a small
fortune by picking the top three finishers in a race.
	   As wagering tapers off, the Hong Kong Jockey Club is taking the
blow, and that has wide implications for all of Hong Kong.
	   The club is a nonprofit organization that holds a monopoly on
the racing business in Hong Kong but gives millions to the tax
collector and charity. Gamblers bet some 91.5 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 11.7 billion) on horse races last year, and the
club's take of 17 billion (U.S. dlrs 2.2 billion) went mostly to
the government and to good causes.
	   This year, revenues are down 15 percent. ``The major factor is
still the economy,'' said Wilson Cheng, information secretary at
the Club.
	   About 7.5 percent of the government's tax revenue comes from
betting, and a budget deficit already projected to run into the
billions this year will be aggravated by the shortfall of racing
money.
	   Racing suffered another blow Dec. 15 when authorities announced
the arrest of 13 people, including former and current jockeys, for
allegedly fixing races. One ex-jockey was sentenced to six months
in jail after admitting he accepted bribes of 180,000 Hong Kong
dollars (dlrs 23,000) in exchange for rigging two races in 1996.
	   The scandal failed to deter the faithful, however. Betting
dropped only moderately on the first racing day after the arrests.
	   The fall in revenues has raised questions about how much money
will be going into the Jockey Club's charity fund, which funneled
2.2 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 284 million) to hospitals,
schools and other community services last year. The club says no
donations will be cut for at least two years.
	   Despite the recent slip in betting, Hong Kong racing is the envy
of many horse tracks around the world, Cheng said.
	   While tracks in the United States are struggling with slumping
fan interest and competition from casinos, Cheng said the Jockey
Club sees few people deserting the races for the casinos in nearby
Macau or for the Hong Kong lottery, which the club also operates.
	   Even those who don't like horse racing itself join in the
gambling frenzy.
	   ``I'm not that crazy about horse racing,'' said Anderson Chan, a
businessman who has never been to the track but has been betting on
the horses for 25 years.
	   Horse races have been a part of life in Hong Kong since early
British settlers introduced the sport in the mid-19th century. The
first races were run around the Chinese New Year, and the
associated betting tapped a favorite Hong Kong pastime _ gambling.
	   Although the races and lottery are now the only legal forms of
gambling, smaller-scale betting on the traditional Chinese game
mahjong is widespread.
	   Horse racing is king, though. It is for Hong Kong what baseball
is to the United States or what soccer is to England.
	   ``It's the national sport,'' said Lawrence Wadey, racing
correspondent for the South China Morning Post, which is one of
just two English-language dailies in a territory that boasts about
50 publications devoted to horse racing.

Marches mark first anniversary of massacre in Chiapas hamlet

<TEXT>
	   ACTEAL, Mexico (AP) _ Carrying wooden crosses, flowers and
candles, about 4,000 rebel supporters marched in southern Chiapas
state to mark the first anniversary of the massacre of 45 Indian
villagers in the hamlet of Acteal.
	   Tuesday's ceremonies were by turns mournful _ when villagers
re-enacted the moments when pro-government gunmen burst into the
hamlet and shot its residents _ and angry, when marchers passed an
army outpost near the town.
	   ``Chiapas is not a barracks, army get out,'' the protesters
shouted at soldiers, who they accuse of having done nothing to stop
the massacre and of harassing survivors.
	   A government helicopter buzzed the demonstration four times as
it was taking place and security agents manned roadblocks into the
village, demanding that outsiders going by identify themselves. The
agents filmed outsiders with video cameras.
	   During a yearlong investigation, most of the suspected killers
identified themselves as supporters of Mexico's ruling party, while
the victims belonged to a group that sympathizes with the leftist
Zapatista rebels. Many of those at Tuesday's ceremonies wore masks
or bandanas covering their faces, a style used by the rebels.
	   Roman Catholic Bishop Samuel Ruiz, whose diocese includes
Acteal, called the massacre site _ where many survivors have still
not returned _ ``a monument to (hope for) peace nationally and
internationally, and to the hope for resurrection.''
	   In a ceremony near the spot where the victims _ most them women
and children _ are buried in a common grave, Antonio Gutierrez told
of the pain of the mainly Tzotzil Indian survivors.
	   ``They have squeezed us in and beat us down, but they have not
been able to crush us,'' Gutierrez said, referring to the state and
federal governments, and the paramilitary groups that survivors say
still operate in the hills near here.
	   Bishop Ruiz referred to the common grave when he said ``in this
trench is germinating a new, more peaceful, more just and worthy
Mexico.''
	   Earlier, residents of the hamlet kneeled in prayer as they did
the day of the massacre, while others with wooden rifles burst onto
the scene and re-enacted the killings.
	   The Zapatista rebels staged a brief armed uprising on New Year's
Day 1994, demanding greater democracy and Indian rights. Talks
between the government and rebels have been stalled since 1996.
	   About 135 people have been arrested in connection with the
massacre, but only one has been convicted in the last year. None of
the upper-level state officials in office at the time _ most of
whom have since resigned _ were ever charged in the case.
	   Residents of Acteal say they continue to be harassed and run off
their small parcels of land by pro-government villagers and troops
stationed nearby. Activists estimate that 10,500 Indians from
Chiapas and dozens from other hamlets have fled their homes in
recent years to escape similar threats and harassment.

Boxing's big drama was in a hearing room
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ED SCHUYLER JR. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Boxing Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis, the premier
practicing heavyweights, both won in 1998, but the biggest boxing
drama played out in a Las Vegas hearing room when Mike Tyson got
his license back.
	   Tyson's ban from boxing, a result of his bitting Evander
Holyfield's ears June 28, 1997, ended when the Nevada State
Athletic Commission voted 4-1 Oct. 19 to restore his license. He is
scheduled to fight Francois Botha on Jan. 16 in the MGM Grand at
Las Vegas.
	   Out-of-ring problems, however, did not end for the 32-year-old
former undisputed heavyweight champion.
	   On Dec. 1, he pleaded no contest to misdemeanor assault charges
for kicking or punching two motorists in involved in an auto
accident Aug. 31 at Gaithersburg, Md. He is scheduled to be
sentenced Feb. 5. A an Indiana judge then will decide how it will
affect Tyson's probation, stemming from his conviction for rape.
Tyson's probation is scheduled end in March.
	   Holyfield and Lewis both defended titles in 1998 and were set
for a championship unification fight March 13 in Madison Square
Garden at New York.
	   Holyfield, the 36-year-old IBF-WBA champion, outpointed Vaughn
Bean in less-than-exciting fashion in an IBF mandatory title
defense before 41,357 fans in thc champion's hometown of Atlanta.
He was supposed to make a WBA mandatory defense against Henry
Akinwande of Britain June 6 at New York, but the fight was called
off when Akinwande tested positive for hepatitis-B.
	   Lewis, the 33-year WBC heavyweight champion from Britain,
escaped serious trouble in the first two rounds and stopped Shannon
Briggs in the fifth round March 25 at Atlantic City, New Jersey. He
also made a mandatory defense in which he was unimpressive in
outpointing Zeljko Mavrovic of Croatia Sept. 26 at the Mohegan Sun
Casino at Uncasville, Connecticut.
	   Boxing's biggest non-heavyweight attraction, Oscar De La Hoya,
defended the WBC welterweight title twice. In the second defense,
he stopped Julio Cesar Chavez of Mexico in the eighth round of
their rematch. He was supposed to defend against unbeaten Ike
Quartey of Ghana, a former WBA welterweight champion, but that Nov.
21 bout was rescheduled for Feb. 13 at Las Vegas after De La Hoya
got cut while sparring.
	   In November, a lawsuit was filed in San Bernardino County
(California) Superior Court in behalf of an unidentified women
accusing De La Hoya of raping her in a hotel room at Cabo San Lucas
Mexico in June 1996. The 24-year-old boxer attorney said he thinks
the action was financially motivated.
	   Roy Jones Jr., considered by many boxing people to be the best
pound-for-pound fighter in the world, fought three times _ winning
two championship fights and one non-title match. In the non-title
bout, he stopped Virgil Hill, a former light heavyweight champion,
in the fourth round. Jones, who will be 30 Jan. 16, He added the
WBA light heavyweight title to the WBC championship he already held
by outpointing Lou Del Valle July 18.
	   A potentially big star emerged when only five days after his
21st birthday, Fernando Vargas, in 15th pro fight, stopped Yory Boy
Campas of Mexico, in his 75th fight, in the eighth round Dec. 12
and won the IBF junior middleweight championship.
	   De La Hoya's battering of Chavez, a former junior lightweight,
lightweight and junior welterweight champion, probably ended the
36-year-old Mexican's career, at least as a major fighter.
	   The career of Roberto Duran also apparently came to an end when
the 47-year-old Panamanian was stopped in the third round by
William Joppy in a bid for the WBA middleweight title. Duran posted
a 102-14 record and won lightweight, welterweight, junior
middleweight and middleweight titles in a career that began in
1967. During that time, the only years in which he didn't fight
were 1985 and 1990.
	   Archie Moore, Harry Markson, Chris Dundee and Don Dunphy, who
played longtime key roles in boxing, died during the year.
	   Moore, 84, scored 141 knockouts in an incredible 28-year carrier
which ended at 49 and during which he was world light heavyweight
champion for nine years. Markson, 92, was involved in the promotion
of more than 2,000 fights by the time he retired as president of
Madison Square Garden Boxing in 1973.
	   Dundee, 91, was a longtime promoter and manager and brother of
trainer Angelo Dundee. Dunphy, 90, was the Voice of Boxing,
broadcast more than 2,000 fights on radio and television.

Police storm Buddhist temple to end months of internal strife
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Police, acting on a court order,
stormed a temple in central Seoul on Wednesday, hoping to end a
prolonged leadership struggle between rival monks in South Korea's
largest Buddhist order.
	   At the order's headquarters inside Chogye temple in Seoul, 6,000
riot police, backed by bulldozers and water cannons, moved in
before dawn to expel about 100 dissident monks holed up inside a
five-story administrative building.
	   A shaven-headed monk came out on a third-floor balcony, took off
his shirt and slashed his belly with a knife to protest the police
action. The monk, bleeding, was taken inside.
	   Another monk, also bare-chested, poured petroleum over his body
and threatened to set himself on fire.
	   Police took away 40 dissident monks and their supporters before
moving into the administrative building. Monks poured water from
hoses and threw down fire bombs, rocks, furniture and other items.
	   ``We need to end this standoff quickly. For social stability, we
can't allow it to go on too long,'' said police lieutenant Kim
Sung-ho.
	   The police action came after court officials had twice failed to
serve an expulsion notice to about 100 dissident monks who had been
in control of the building since Nov. 11.
	   A Seoul civil court, acting on a lawsuit filed by ousted
mainstream monks, ordered the renegades to move out of the temple
by Saturday. The occupants, however, refused to heed the order.
	   The trouble began after the order's head, Song Wol-ju, sought a
third four-year term. Opponents occupied his office inside the
Chogye temple, effectively blocking his re-election.
	   The rule stating the order's chief monk cannot serve more than
two terms was enacted in 1994 in an attempt to prevent the office
from wielding too much power.
	   Song claimed that he was not subject to the rule, because he
could not complete his first four-year term in 1980 because of a
disagreement with South Korea's then military government.
	   Song later resigned under pressure but the renegade monks
refused to leave the temple. Instead, they stepped up struggle and
occupied a major temple near Taegu on Monday. Police there were
also poised to intervene there Wednesday.
	   Many religion experts agree that power and money are at the
center of the struggle.
	   The victorious faction gets to control an annual budget of dlrs
10 million, millions of dollars in property and appoint 1,700 monks
to various duties. In the past, those on the losing side were
accused of corruption and deprived of their status as monks.
	   The Chogye Order emphasizes meditative practices and its
traditions date back some 1,000 years to the early Koryo period
(917-1392) of Korean history.

Italian official says he warned Samaranch in April of bidding
</HEADLINE>
misconduct
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The former head of the Italian Olympic Committee
says he alerted IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch eight months
ago to unethical practices in the bidding for the games.
	   Mario Pescante, an IOC member and secretary general of the
European association of Olympic committees, said he wrote to
Samaranch last April expressing concern about irregularities in the
election of Olympic host cities.
	   Pescante said he raised many of the same accusations which Swiss
IOC official Marc Hodler made public 10 days ago, setting off the
biggest ethics scandal in International Olympic Committee history.
	   In an telephone interview Tuesday with The Associated Press,
Pescante said he cited a ``crisis of my vocation as an IOC member''
in his two-page letter to Samaranch.
	   Pescante said his letter included ``precise accusations'' of
wrongdoing but gave no names.
	   ``I spoke of some elements which move in Olympic circles and
influence the vote,'' he said.
	   Samaranch did not respond to the letter, Pescante said.
	   ``I did speak with him later and he said he was concerned (about
the warnings),'' Pescante said.
	   The Italian official said he and others had been aware that Salt
Lake City offered scholarships to relatives of IOC members during
the successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
	   Three separate investigations are underway into the scholarship
fund, which provided nearly dlrs 400,000 in aid to 13 people,
including six IOC relatives.
	   Pescante said scholarships have been used as inducements in the
bidding process ``for a long time.''
	   He said Rome had been approached about offering scholarships
during its unsuccessful bid for the 2004 Summer Games.
	   ``I refused,'' he said.
	   Pescante called for the IOC to establish a ``code of ethics''
for its members and for cities which bid for the games.
	   He questioned why Hodler had chosen to air his allegations to
the world's media during the recent IOC executive board meeting in
Lausanne, Switzerland.
	   Hodler claimed that four agents, including an IOC member, have
been active in promising to secure votes for payment in the
election of host cities. He cited alleged payoffs of up to dlrs 5
million and estimated that 5 to 7 percent of IOC members are open
to bribes.
	   ``We've known about these things for a long time,'' Pescante
said. ``It's strange that it's coming out now just before the
vote.''
	   He was referring to the decision next June on the host for the
2006 Winter Games. The Swiss town of Sion is considered the
favorite, with the Italian city of Turin as its main rival.
	   ``I find the timing strange,'' Pescante said. ``Maybe you know
which country Hodler is from.''
	   Pescante, who was one of the main backers of Rome's 2004 bid,
also questioned why Hodler had not cited any irregularities in last
year's vote awarding those games to Athens.
	   Pescante is one of four Italians on the IOC, having been
appointed to the body in 1994.
	   He resigned as president of the Italian Olympic Committee two
months ago following a scandal over the IOC-accredited drug-testing
laboratory in Rome. The lab was shut down after allegations that
some tests had been mishandled and covered up.
	   Pescante said he had resigned as a matter of principle and that
he had been absolved of any responsibility in the doping scandal in
separate investigations by a magistrate and the government. He said
there was no reason why he should not keep his IOC membership.
	   Pescante criticized proposals, backed by Samaranch, to overhaul
the procedure for selecting Olympic cities by taking the vote away
from the full IOC assembly and allowing the executive board or
other small group to decide.
	   ``I am very offended by this,'' Pescante said. ``This is very
grave. Why should I pay for the mistakes of others? If 10 percent
were doing wrong, you can't just strip the other 90 percent of
their power. You can't punish the whole assembly.
	   ``And what will happen when the IOC elects a new president in
2001? Will that only be up to the executive board, too?''

	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ In Manger Square, tourists are
outnumbered by construction workers raising clouds of dust as they
install new stone tiles in time for Christmas.
	   With Mideast peace in crisis and tensions simmering in the Gulf,
an expected pre-millennium surge in tourism to the city believed to
be Jesus's birthplace has failed to materialize.
	   In fact, tourism has bottomed out. In past years, attendance at
Christmas Eve celebrations has reached into six figures; this year,
Bethlehem officials don't expect more than a trickle.
	   ``The situation in the region and with the peace process is so
bad,'' Mayor Hanna J. Nasser said Tuesday. ``This year I do not
expect that the number of tourists will exceed 20,000.''
	   Israel's refusal last month to release Palestinians jailed for
killing launched a wave of anti-Israel violence _ including attacks
on Israeli soldiers guarding the entrance to Bethlehem that were
broadcast around the world.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton visited the region last week in an
effort to salvage the peace process. He lit the Christmas tree in
Manger Square and joined carolers in song.
	   Days later, demonstrators were burning the U.S. flags that had
fluttered throughout the Palestinian-controlled city during the
visit, protesting the U.S.-British bombing of Iraq.
	   Anxious Palestinian police ordered journalists not to film the
anti-U.S. actions.
	   On Tuesday, officers belonging to the police department's
tourist unit patrolled Manger Square, sidestepping the construction
workers. They hadn't much to do _ they, too, outnumbered the
tourists.
	   A Manger Square vendor said Clinton was partly to blame for his
lack of work.
	   ``Clinton lit the tree here a few days ago, and then he went
back to Washington and lit the sky of Baghdad,'' said Samir Metri,
bearing a stack of postcards and rosaries in his arms. ``It was
much better last year, this year it is awful.''
	   Inside the Church of the Nativity _ an ancient basilica built
atop what is believed to be the manger where Jesus was born _ a
French tourist said that the Iraqi bombing helped keep his
countrymen away.
	   ``A lot of European tourists are afraid because of the pro-Iraqi
demonstrations that have taken place here,'' said Tanguy Pesselev,
a university student. ``People do not feel that it is safe to come
here.''
	   Others blamed the frantic rush to modernize the square for the
expected rush of Christians expected here for Christmas next year,
leading into the year 2000.
	   The workmen are laying large, square stone tiles that are to
cover the football-field-sized square. The square's dlrs 12 million
``Peace Center'' will include a Palestinian culture center and a
nativity museum.
	   ``Does this look like Christmas to you,'' asked Najmeh Handel,
who sells Christmas decorations in an alleyway off the square.
``The rubble, the mess, the garbage. This is unacceptable.''
	   Nasser, the mayor, says the renovations will drag the little
town of 24,000 into the 21st century. The new electricity lines the
Peace Center requires, for instance, will modernize the whole
neighborhood, he said.
	   ``This is a city with an infrastructure that was completely
destroyed during the (Israeli) occupation,'' he said. ``We have to
build and improve ourselves. And in order to build we have to
destroy.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Ten years ago, Florence Griffith Joyner dazzled
the world with her sensational sprint speed. This year, when
Griffith Joyner died suddenly, Marion Jones dazzled the world with
her sensational sprint speed.
	   In only her second full season on the track and field circuit,
Jones went unbeaten in both the women's 100- and 200-meter dashes,
and produced the world's fastest times in both events. Her
clockings of 10.65 seconds in the 100 and 21.62 in the 200 _ both
at the season-ending World Cup in Johannesburg, South Africa _ made
her the No. 2 all-time performer in both dashes, right behind
Griffith Joyner's 10.49 and 21.34, respectively.
	   Griffith Joyner, winner of three gold medals and one silver
medal at the 1988 Olympics, died Sept. 21 when she suffered a
seizure in her sleep and suffocated at her home in Mission Viejo,
California.
	   Jones missed a perfect year, indoors and outdoors, when she was
beaten by 33-year-old Heike Drechsler of Germany in the long jump,
her final competition, in the rain at the World Cup. Drechsler also
won the event in 1985. The loss left Jones with a record of 36
victories in 37 events for the year. She finished with a record
18-sub 11-second clockings and a record nine consecutive sub-10.90s
in her 19 victories in the 100.
	   Her two sprint victories and second-place finish in the long
jump helped the United States women win their first World Cup
title, by 2 points over the European team. Africa won the men's
title for the third straight time.
	   Africa did not get any help from Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia
or Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco in its World Cup victory _ neither
competed _ but the two distance runners were the year's most
dominant male athletes.
	   Gebrselassie and El Guerrouj, both of whom went through the
season unbeaten, shared the new dlrs 1 million Golden League
jackpot with Jones. All three each won their events in all six
Golden League competitions, then won at the IAAF Grand Prix Final
in Moscow.
	   Gebrselassie also regained the world 10,000-meter record in
Hengelo, Netherlands, June 1 with a time of 26:22.75. Twelve days
later in Helsinki, Finland, he reclaimed the world 5,000-meter
record with a clocking of 12:39.36.
	   El Guerrouj set the world 1,500-meter record of 3:26.00 in Rome
July 14, then two days later missed the world mile record by .21
seconds with 3:44.60 at Nice, France, and six days afterward missed
the world 2,000-meter best by .47 seconds with 4:48.35 in
Gateshead, England.
	   While the men's 2,000-meter record survived, the women's did
not, as Ireland's Sonia O'Sullivan lowered it to 9:19.56 in Cork,
Ireland, June 28.
	   One of the year's most dramatic records was set by the United
States 1,600-meter relay team at the Goodwill Games in Uniondale,
New York in July. The foursome of Jerome Young, Antonio Pettigrew,
Tyree Washington and Michael Johnson was timed in 2:54.20.
	   That capped a meet which also included world record-holder
Jackie Joyner-Kersee's victory in her final heptathlon, the year's
top score; world record-holder Dan O'Brien's triumph in his first
decathlon since the 1996 Olympics with 8,755 points, the year's
highest score; Jones' sweep of the 100 and 200 with Goodwill record
times of 10.90 and 21.80, and Johnson's win in the 400 in 43.76,
his fastest time in two years (he ran 43.68 later in the year).
	   Three days after winning her fourth Goodwill title with 6,502
points, the weary Joyner-Kersee _ a six-time Olympic medalist and
world record-holder in the heptathlon _ ended her illustrious
career by placing sixth in the long jump at the U.S. Open at
Edwardsville, Illinois.
	   Marathon world bests also were set this year. Brazil's Ronaldo
da Costa, competing in only his second marathon, slashed 45 seconds
off the men's mark with 2:06:05 in Berlin Sept. 20, and Kenya's
Tegla Loroupe clipped 19 seconds off the women's best with 2:20:47
in Rotterdam April 19. Loroupe also won the World Half-Marathon
title for the second straight year and set a one-hour track race
record.
	   Other outstanding men's performers were Ato Boldon of Trinidad
and Tobago, the world leader in the 100 and 200, with nine times
under 10.00 in the 100, and Paul Tergat of Kenya, winner of the
world cross country title for the fourth time, the world
record-setter in the half-marathon and second-best in the world
over 10,000 meters.
	   Australian Emma George became the first women pole vaulter to
clear 15 feet, raising the record to 15-0 3/4 (4.59 meters), while
Mihaela Melinte of Romania set the women's world hammer throw
record of 239-11 (73.12 meters).
	   Indoors, numerous records were broken. The men's record-breakers
included Gebrselassie in the 2,000 (4:52.86), Kenya's Daniel Komen
in the 3,000 (7:24.90) and 5,000 (12:51.48) and American Maurice
Greene in the 60 (6.39).
	   Women setting records included Mozambique's Maria Mutola in the
800 (1:56.36), Britain's Astia Hansen in the triple jump (49-9),
Romania's Gabriela Szabo in the 2,000 (5:30.53) and American Stacy
Dragila and the Czech Republic's Daniela Bartova in the pole vault
(14-8\). Szabo also was the world outdoor leader in the 1,500,
mile, 3,000 and 5,000, and won the World Cup 3,000.
	   The year was marred by several drug suspensions, including
American Randy Barnes, the world indoor and outdoor record-holder
in the shot put; American Dennis Mitchell, 1992 Olympic bronze
medalist in the 100; Germany's Uta Pippig, three-time winner of the
Boston Marathon; British shot putter Paul Edwards, and Sri Lanka's
Susanthiker Jayasinghe, the 1997 World Championship silver medalist
in the women's 200.
	   Polish Olympic gold medalists Wladyslaw Komar and Tadeusz
Slusarski were killed in a car crash in Warsaw. Komar won the shot
put in 1972 and Slusarski the pole vault in 1976.

Australian Open champion Korda failed drugs test: ITF

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian Open tennis champion Petr
Korda failed a drug test at the 1998 Wimbledon Championships, the
International Tennis Federation said Wednesday.
	   Korda tested positive to banned anabolic steroid nandrolone, but
escaped suspension because the ITF was satisfied that he was not
aware he had taken the substance.
	   The 30-year-old Czech was forced to forfeit the 199 rankings
points and U.S. dlrs 94,529 prizemoney he earned at Wimbledon this
year.
	   The ITF's appeals committee, sitting on Dec. 22 in London, ruled
that as Korda was unaware he had taken or been administered the
banned substance, no further penalty would be imposed.
	   The appeals committee heard evidence from Korda, his
representatives and the federation before making its ruling.
	   Korda submitted the positive doping sample after bowing out in
the Wimbledon quarterfinals.
	   In a statement, he said he had been informed by the federation
on Aug. 1 that he had tested positive to nandrolone and was issued
with a notice of violation in October, against which he appealed.
	   Korda said he and his advisers had made exhaustive, but
unsuccessful, attempts to find the source of the illegal substance.
	   ``I wish to state categorically that I am not a drugs cheat and
would never seek to obtain a competitive advantage over my fellow
professionals by such means,'' Korda said in the statement. ``I am
delighted that the committee has vindicated me.
	   ``This allegation came as a tremendous shock and caused
considerable distress to me and my family.
	   ``From a professional standpoint my performances since August
suffered, as my recent results have shown.
	   ``Whilst I am in the final stages of my career I still love the
game.
	   ``I am delighted that the committee has cleared my name and that
I am free to carry on playing and competing.
	   ``I would like to say that I completely support the Tennis
Anti-Doping Program and the efforts of the sports authorities to
ensure that the sport is clean.''
	   Under ITF rules, Korda was found to have committed a doping
offense, even though the federation was satisfied he had not taken
the banned substance intentionally.
	   Therefore, it was compelled to deduct the rankings points earned
by Korda at Wimbledon and require him to return his prizemoney.

Nike gives NBA stars a new message: No play, no pay
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WILLIAM McCALL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEAVERTON, Oregon (AP) _ Nike has a new message for its
high-priced National Basketball Association pitchmen: No play, no
pay.
	   Slumping sales and a lockout due to a labor dispute have led the
world's largest athletic shoe company to exercise its option to
withhold quarterly endorsement payments to most of the 230 NBA
players it has under contract.
	   ``We are doing this because the lockout is hurting fans, it's
hurting the sport, and it's hurting the value of our investments in
the NBA,'' Vizhier Mooney, a Nike spokeswoman, said Tuesday.
	   The decision risked alienating some athletes, she admitted, but
after three straight quarters of declining Nike profits, the
company must reassess its investment in the league.
	   ``There is no way we'd threaten our relationship with the NBA or
the many NBA players we're partnered with,'' Mooney said. ``But as
a business, we have to make common sense, fiscally responsible
decisions.''
	   Some agents were surprised by Nike's decision.
	   ``I believed they had every intention they would pay,'' said
Aaron Goodwin, an agent who represents Damon Stoudamire and Gary
Payton, among others.
	   ``I'm disappointed they made this decision,'' Goodwin said.
``But I understand fully what they're doing. It's a business, and
things like this happen.''
	   Some agents have said Nike should also withhold the money it
pays the NBA to show it is impartial in the lockout, but the
company had declined to confirm it was cutting back payments to the
league until Tuesday.
	   ``We've been taking these types of steps since July, when
payments to the league were reduced,'' said Mooney, who refused to
say which big-name players were included in the cuts.
	   Nike has a reputation for standing by the star athletes in its
stable. For years, the fear was that it could not afford to
alienate big names and have them defect to another company. Now,
Nike and its competitors are re-examining the value of these big
endorsement contracts and cutting back.

Jadeja up against form and time

 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Indian vice-captain Ajay Jadeja
is fighting against time to be fit for the second cricket test
against New Zealand at Basin Reserve starting Saturday.
	   Jadeja, who will open the batting with Navjot Sidhu, sprained
his right ankle before the abandoned first test in Dunedin and
hasn't trained since.
	   India's net training Wednesday was delayed by six hours when the
team arrived at the ground for a morning session but found the
practice wickets were too wet.
	   ``It is disappointing, but there is little we could do,''
lamented coach Aunshuman Gaekwad. ``We were hoping to go through a
full session today. But it doesn't look like it.''
	   Jadeja was ruled out of the first test after he damaged his
ankle during a friendly game of soccer.
	   ``It wasn't a serious injury,'' manager Saif Drabu said. ``He
will be alright for the second test.''
	   Jadeja didn't train with the rest of the team Wednesday morning
as it held a light fitness and fielding session.
	   ``To be honest, I don't know. I will have to see how I go in the
nets,'' Jadeja told the Associated Press as he hobbled around,
watching his teammates.
	   The team has banned physiotherapist Andrew Kokinos and the team
doctor Ravindra Chadda from speaking to the media.
	   Jadeja is also up against the form of Venkat Laxman, the third
opener on tour.
	   Laxman, a right hander hit a fluent 82 in the 66-run defeat at
the hands of a New Zealand XI in an exhibition one-dayer early this
week.
	   ``To be frank, we are looking at playing the best team. We don't
go by names. We will have to see who plays well. Laxman has played
well and definitely has the edge over Jadeja,'' Gaekwad said.
	   Also trying to be fit in time for the second test is New Zealand
swing bowler Simon Doull.
	   Doull's injury-prone career took a new twist when he injured his
right calf muscle in Dunedin.
	   His previous upper body injuries had restricted his career to 24
tests since his debut in November 1992.
	   Doull said it was too early to say what his chances of playing
were, but said he would not push himself if there was the prospect
of further injury.

	   LA LIMA, Honduras (AP) _ The banana stalks stand brown and
brittle in the abandoned Chiquita fields, like sculptures of
despair. Around them, the people who for decades have worked the
fields are little better off.
	   A month after Hurricane Mitch destroyed the Honduran production
of Chiquita Brands International and crippled Dole Food Co.
plantations, desperation is settling in for the thousands who
survive off the crop that gave this country its claim to fame as
the original Banana Republic.
	   Next year promises to be even harder.
	   ``I've been left with nothing,'' said Danilo Sanchez, a
37-year-old Chiquita worker who now herds a pair of bone-thin
cattle into the banana fields to feed on rotting fruit.
	   Thousands of workers have lost their jobs. Others are working a
few days a week. Some have lost medical benefits. Most seasonal
workers, like Sanchez, were let go immediately.
	   After the hurricane passed, Chiquita rented aircraft and boats
to help rescue stranded people, and donated millions of dollars in
food, medicine and transportation to Central America.
	   It also let 1,200 seasonal workers go and suspended most of its
7,300 permanent workers for a year.
	   To ease the pain, the company offered full-time workers bonuses
and advances averaging dlrs 370, a little more than a month's
salary. Workers also can borrow up to dlrs 40 every two weeks.
	   Workers say the loans won't do.
	   ``That's no help to me,'' said Magdelena Sevilla, a single
mother of two who has been camping out in front of her house since
it was covered in mud. ``That's just cutting my throat, because
I'll never be able to work off that debt.''
	   Chiquita is letting workers harvest the 1,700 acres (nearly 700
hectares) of its 25,000 acres (10,100 hectares) that survived here.
The company also says it will continue to provide schooling and
free medical care in addition to housing for about two-thirds of
the workers.
	   ``Up to this point, the company has acted with great social
responsibility,'' said Jimmy Zonta Sing, Chiquita's human resources
and labor relations manager at the La Lima headquarters.
	   Most of the 4,000 full-time workers for Dole, known as Standard
Fruit in Honduras, will continue working a few days a week,
according to their union.
	   To avoid suspending workers, the union agreed to a reduction in
medical benefits: health workers will treat serious and chronic
illnesses, while regular health insurance will not resume until
operations are in full swing again.
	   ``We don't think it's just,'' said Juan Carlos Medina, vice
president of the union representing Dole workers. ``But our backs
were against the wall.''
	   Chiquita union leaders say their colleagues paid too high a
price, especially now that a rise of diarrhea and dengue _ a
mosquito-borne illness that can be fatal _ has put the country on
an epidemic alert.
	   Labor leaders say the health reductions are only one of many
gains that were swept away by the storm.
	   ``The companies are taking advantage of the disaster situation
and using it to introduce changes that we have been fighting
against over the past 10 years,'' said Juan Funez, president of the
union that represents Chiquita workers.
	   ``But what can we do, strike? There is no work. We have no
strength, no power to demand anything.''
	   Company officials plan to implement a new work system long
opposed by unions that assigns more tasks to each worker, to make
operations more efficient.
	   Labor leaders fear it's a prelude to reducing the work force.
	   Officials at Cincinnati-based Chiquita, which wrote off dlrs 50
million this quarter alone, say they're doing their best to soften
the blow while the company makes adjustments to get back on its
feet.
	   Chiquita gets about 15 percent of its bananas from Honduras.
Only Panama and Costa Rica supply Chiquita with more bananas.
	   Even under the best conditions, Chiquita could not begin
replanting until next year and would have nothing to harvest until
2000, said Steven Warshaw, Chiquita's chief operating officer.
	   John Tate, chief financial officer for Dole in Westlake Village,
California, said the company estimates its loss from the hurricane
at about dlrs 100 million.
	   He said about 25 percent of Dole's total banana production came
from Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, and half to three-quarters
of that crop was lost.
	   ``To fully rehabilitate, we think, it will take about two
years.''
	   The workers, meanwhile, are trying to rehabilitate too.
	   Some have taken up temporary residence in flooded encampments
that surround the mosquito-infested banana fields.
	   Peasants have moved into the railroad cars used to take bananas
to port.
	   And others have stayed in their three-room wood-slat homes,
which several generations of banana workers often share.
	   Bertilia Contreras shares one room with her five children and a
three-foot-tall (1-meter-tall) plastic Christmas tree. She put it
up to cheer her children, but said they probably won't find
anything under it on Christmas Day.
	   ``When I look out my door, I feel sad. Everything looks so ugly
now,'' she said. ``It's going to be a sad Christmas.''

Police storm Buddhist temple to end leadership struggle

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Police, acting on a court order,
stormed a temple in Seoul on Wednesday, ending a 40-day standoff
between rival monks fighting for leadership of South Korea's
largest Buddhist order.
	   About 20 police and monks were injured, some seriously, during
the 30-minute raid on a five-story administrative building inside
Chogye temple, the spiritual home to 8 million South Korean
Buddhists in a nation of 44 million people.
	   About 100 monks and followers were arrested.
	   The temple in downtown Seoul has been the scene of frequent
violent clashes between rival monks since November. Both sides have
since fought viciously for control over the order's administrative
building. In one clash early this month, more than 60 people were
injured, many seriously.
	   Wednesday's police action came after court officials had twice
failed to serve an expulsion notice to about 100 dissident monks
who had been in control of the building since Nov. 11.
	   Nearly five hours after moving inside the temple before dawn,
hundreds of helmeted riot police, firing tear gas and using water
cannons, moved into the building.
	   Dozens of gray-robed monks, some wearing yellow construction
helmets, vehemently fought back, pouring water from hoses and
throwing firebombs, rocks, furniture and other items.
	   A shaven-headed monk came out on a third-floor balcony, took off
his shirt and slashed his belly with a knife to protest the police
action. The monk, bleeding, was taken inside.
	   Another monk, also bare-chested, poured petroleum over his body
and threatened to set himself on fire.
	   Firefighters quickly put out fires apparently set by monks.
	   Five riot police were injured, two seriously, when they fell
from a mechanically driven ladder transporting them to the roof of
the building.
	   ``We need to end this standoff quickly. For social stability, we
can't allow this standoff to go on too long,'' police lieutenant
Kim Sung-ho said.
	   Religion experts said the police action was not expected to
resolve chronic internal conflicts in the order. For years, Chogye
has been plagued by leadership struggles between rival monks.
	   A Seoul civil court, acting on a lawsuit filed by ousted
mainstream monks, ordered the renegades to move out of the temple
by Saturday. The occupants, however, refused to heed the order.
	   The trouble began after the order's head, Song Wol-ju, sought a
third four-year term. Opponents occupied his office inside the
Chogye temple in early November, effectively blocking his
re-election.
	   The rule stating the order's chief monk cannot serve more than
two terms was enacted in 1994 in an attempt to prevent the office
from wielding too much power.
	   Song claimed that he was not subject to the rule, because he
could not complete his first four-year term in 1980 because of a
disagreement with South Korea's then military government.
	   Song later resigned under pressure, but the renegade monks
refused to leave the temple. Instead, they stepped up their
struggle, occupying a major temple near the southeastern city of
Taegu on Monday. Police there were also poised to intervene.
	   Many religion experts agree that power and money are at the
center of the struggle.
	   The victorious faction gets to control an annual budget of dlrs
10 million, millions of dollars in property and appoint 1,700 monks
to various duties. In the past, those on the losing side were
accused of corruption and deprived of their status as monks.
	   The Chogye Order emphasizes meditative practices and its
traditions date back some 1,000 years to the early Koryo period
(917-1392) of Korean history.

Australian Open champion Korda failed drugs test: ITF
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EDITS to clarify &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian Open tennis champion Petr
Korda failed a drug test at the 1998 Wimbledon Championships, the
International Tennis Federation said Wednesday.
	   Korda tested positive to banned anabolic steroid nandrolone, but
escaped suspension because the ITF was satisfied that he was not
aware he had taken the substance.
	   But the 30-year-old Czech was forced to forfeit the 199 rankings
points and U.S. dlrs 94,529 prizemoney he earned at Wimbledon this
year.
	   The ITF's appeals committee, sitting on Dec. 22 in London, ruled
that as Korda was unaware he had taken or been administered the
banned substance, no further penalty would be imposed. Korda said
in a statement that he was pleased with the appeals committee's
finding.
	   ``I wish to state categorically that I am not a drugs cheat and
would never seek to obtain a competitive advantage over my fellow
professionals by such means,'' Korda said in the statement. ``I am
delighted that the committee has vindicated me.''
	   The appeals committee heard evidence from Korda, his
representatives and the federation before making its ruling.
	   Korda submitted the positive doping sample after bowing out in
the Wimbledon quarterfinals.
	   In his statement, he said he had been informed by the federation
on Aug. 1 that he had tested positive to nandrolone and was issued
with a notice of violation in October, against which he appealed.
	   Korda said he and his advisers had made exhaustive, but
unsuccessful, attempts to find the source of the illegal substance.
	   ``This allegation came as a tremendous shock and caused
considerable distress to me and my family,'' said Korda.
	   ``From a professional standpoint my performances since August
suffered, as my recent results have shown.
	   ``Whilst I am in the final stages of my career I still love the
game.
	   ``I am delighted that the committee has cleared my name and that
I am free to carry on playing and competing.
	   ``I would like to say that I completely support the Tennis
Anti-Doping Program and the efforts of the sports authorities to
ensure that the sport is clean.''
	   Under ITF rules, Korda was found to have committed a doping
offense, even though the federation was satisfied he had not taken
the banned substance intentionally.
	   Therefore, it was compelled to deduct the rankings points earned
by Korda at Wimbledon and require him to return his prizemoney.

Clemens withdraws trade demand
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL A. LUTZ &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPRING, Texas (AP) _ Roger Clemens reversed course, saying he no
longer was demanding that Toronto trade him and he would not play
for the Houston Astros under their current management.
	   Clemens, the only five-time Cy Young Award winner, said Tuesday
he had no desire to play for Astros team president Tal Smith and
general manager Gerry Hunsicker, who called a news conference
during the winter meetings to blast Clemens' proposal for a dlrs
27.4 million, one-year extension.
	   ``I'm very upset about what Mr. Smith and Mr. Hunsicker said and
how they directed things toward me as a person,'' Clemens said
during a news conference at the offices of his agents.
	   ``I don't know them personally and they don't know me as a
person,'' Clemens said of Smith and Hunsicker. ``The disappointment
I feel is that I have no interest in playing for two individuals
like that who would make a statement like that and don't know me.''
	   Clemens, who would have gotten dlrs 43.5 million over the next
three years if Houston had accepted his offer, confirmed for the
first time he had a written agreement with the Blue Jays allowing
him to both demand and veto a trade.
	   He is guaranteed dlrs 16.1 million in the final two years of his
contract with Toronto and said he has never asked for a
renegotiation as a condition for agreeing to a trade and wouldn't
in the future. He said he was walking away from an additional dlrs
44 million in guaranteed money by staying with the Blue Jays _
citing extension offers made by other teams willing to trade for
him.
	   Clemens and his agents said that before Hunsicker's news
conference, the Blue Jays and the pitcher were closing on a deal
with Astros owner Drayton McLane.
	   McLane told a Houston television station Tuesday night that he
hasn't given up.
	   ``It certainly is disappointing to hear they said that,'' McLain
said of Clemens and his agents. ``I can't help but believe that
this problem can be resolved. All you can do is say you're sorry.''
	   Clemens notified the Blue Jays in a Nov. 27 letter that he was
demanding a trade to a team closer to home or to a contender,
citing an agreement he made with then-team president Paul Beeston
in December 1996. The Blue Jays made his demand public Dec. 2.
	   Houston, Cleveland and Texas were the chief contenders for
Clemens, with the New York Yankees on the outskirts of talks, but
Toronto couldn't find a deal to its liking.

U.N. urges both sides to refrain from using force in Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council urged both sides
in Cyprus to refrain from using force and extended the mandate of
the U.N. peacekeeping force on the divided island for six months.
	   Two council resolutions, which were unanimously adopted, make no
mention of the planned deployment of Russian S-300 missiles later
this month on Cyprus. Turkey has said it will use force to stop
them, which would probably lead to a war with Greece.
	   Calling for restraint, the council on Tuesday reiterated ``its
grave concern at the continuing excessive levels of military force
and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the rate at which they
are being expanded, upgraded and modernized, including by the
introduction of sophisticated weaponry.''
	   Cyprus has been divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion sparked by
an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. A breakaway
Turkish Cypriot state in the north is recognized only by Turkey.
	   The 2,500-member U.N. peacekeeping force, whose mandate was
extended until June 30, patrols the division between the two sides.
	   The Security Council reiterated its previous position that a
Cyprus settlement must be based on a single, independent state
comprising two politically equal communities which are not linked
with any other country.
	   It called the current status quo ``unacceptable'' and said
``negotiations on a final political solution of the Cyprus problem
have been at an impasse for too long.''
	   The Security Council gave strong backing to efforts by Ann
Hercus, the U.N. representative in Cyprus, to restart direct
negotiations to reunite the divided island.
	   It called for a reduction of tensions along cease-fire lines,
renewed efforts to achieve a comprehensive settlement, and a staged
process to limit and then substantially reduce the level of troops
and arms on Cyprus.
	   The council urged all parties to reduce defense spending and
stressed the importance of eventual demilitarization in an overall
settlement.
	   Turkey maintains 35,000 troops in the northern breakaway state.
	   The council noted continuing restrictions on the movement of
peacekeeping troops and reminded both sides of their obligation to
ensure free movement and prevent violence against the soldiers.
	   Calling the Cyprus issue ``very contentious,'' Britain's U.N.
Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said ``the United Kingdom is very
pleased that in these two resolutions we have good grounds for
moving forward.''
	   ``These are sensitive areas, and of course nobody is getting
everything that they want. We have to go on negotiating, use
diplomacy to the full,'' he said.

Remains of all Swissair 111 victims identified
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous; ADDS that money was on its way to a Swiss
bank &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Sixteen weeks after the crash of Swissair Flight
111 shattered the bodies of those on board, police said remains of
all 229 victims have been identified using state-of-the-art DNA
techniques.
	   Police also said Tuesday that more than dlrs 1 million in U.S.
currency destined for a Swiss bank has been recovered from the
wreckage on the ocean floor off Nova Scotia. Still missing is a
shipment of diamonds.
	   The impact of the Sept. 2 crash was so great that traditional
identification methods, including dental and X-ray records, were of
minimal use in identifying the remains retrieved from the Atlantic.
	   Blood samples were collected from relatives of those on board,
and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police coordinated an operation at
several forensic laboratories around Canada to match the samples
with the recovered remains.
	   RCMP officers, at a news briefing Tuesday in Halifax, Nova
Scotia, said DNA techniques had never before been used to such an
extent following an air disaster. They said recent technological
advances enabled them to complete tasks in days that might
previously have taken weeks.
	   By comparison, the vast majority of remains from TWA Flight 800,
which crashed off the New York coast in 1996, were identified by
dental records, either alone or in combination with other methods.
Only a few dozen of the 230 remains were identified through DNA.
	   The RCMP recommended that airlines henceforth keep fingerprint
and DNA records of crew members to make identifications easier.
	   About 85 percent of the wreckage of the MD-11 jumbo jet has been
recovered from the seabed, and a scallop dragger is being used to
try to scoop up the rest.
	   Investigators, who will take a 10-day holiday break starting
Wednesday, still don't know what caused the crash, but their
efforts are focused on determining the source of a fire in the
front of the jet.
	   There is evidence of heat damage inside and just outside the
cockpit, where the two pilots reported smoke about 16 minutes
before the plane crashed en route from New York to Geneva.
	   Vic Gerden, chief investigator for the Transportation Safety
Board of Canada, said small pieces of aluminum from the front of
the plane got so hot they melted moments before the crash.
	   Temperatures in some areas hit at least 1200 degrees Fahrenheit
(650 degrees Celsius), the point at which that type of aluminum
melts, Gerden said. But investigators don't know where the fire
started.
	   Investigators have been examining hundreds of segments of
electrical wire from the front of the jet for signs of heat damage.
In all, more than 1 million pieces of wreckage have been recovered.
	   Investigators are trying to reconstruct the forward section of
the fuselage, but the process is complicated because many of the
pieces are small and were damaged by the crash.
	   ``It is a pretty challenging puzzle,'' Gerden said.

Report: Some runway lights switched off during Thai plane crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ An airport electrician said half the
runway lights were switched off when a Thai Airways jet crashed
killing 101 people during a nighttime rainstorm two weeks ago, The
Nation newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Waravuth Siri-oat, an electrician at southern Thailand's Surat
Thani airport, told the paper, however, half the lights being shut
off should not have affected the visibility of the runway.
	   The runway lights are 60 meters (198 feet) apart. With half of
them switched off, each working light was 120 meters (396 feet)
apart.
	   The plane crashed on its third attempt to land. Airport
officials have already been a target of questioning for removing
their instrument landing system during runway renovations. The
system helps pilots land in bad weather.
	   A government committee is investigating the cause of the crash
of the Airbus A310-200 on Dec. 11 at Surat Thani, 530 kilometers
(330 miles) southwest of Bangkok and a gateway to popular resort
islands.
	   Some of the 45 survivors blamed the pilot for trying to land
repeatedly in bad weather instead of diverting to another airport
or returning to Bangkok.
	   The pilot had complained to the tower of poor visibility, air
traffic controllers at Surat Thani airport told The Nation.
	   The paper quoted one anonymous Thai Airways pilot who disputed
the electrician's contention that having only half the runway
lights on would not affect visibility.
	   ``We need those lights, especially when the weather is very
bad,'' he told the paper.
	   He added that airport officials should have maximized other
equipment, such as runway lights, considering the instrument
landing system had been removed.

Australians to face Pakistani panel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The Pakistani inquiry probing
cricket bribery will travel to Australia next month to interview
Australian players Shane Warne and Mark Waugh.
	   Warne and Waugh made allegations against Pakistan player Salim
Malik in 1994, accusing him of offering them money to play badly.
	   Australian cricket was rocked this month by revelations of Warne
and Waugh's involvement with an illegal Indian bookmaker during
Australia's tour of Sri Lanka in 1994.
	   Australian Cricket Board chief executive Malcolm Speed said
Wednesday the Lahore-based inquiry, headed by judge Malik Mohammed
Qayyum, would sit in Melbourne on Jan. 8.
	   The Pakistan inquiry will interview Waugh, Warne and Alan
Crompton, the ACB chairman at the time the allegations against
Salim Malik were made.
	   Waugh faced the Pakistan inquiry during Australia's tour there
this year.
	   Speed also announced an independent Australian inquiry into
gambling on cricket will begin Jan. 12. The inquiry will be held in
private.

Coyotes rout Red Wings; Kings stop Penguins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be UPDATED with late games &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Dallas Drake had a goal and two assists as the
Phoenix Coyotes beat the struggling Detroit Red Wings 6-2 on
Tuesday night.
	   Keith Tkachuk and Jeremy Roenick each had a goal and an assist
and Juha Ylonen, Teppo Numminen and Bob Corkum also scored for the
Coyotes, who have won both their meetings with Detroit this season.
	   The Coyotes have won two straight following their first two-game
losing streak of the season and have 42 points, just two behind
first-place Dallas in the Pacific Division.
	   Brendan Shanahan had a goal and an assist and Igor Larionov
scored the other goal for the Red Wings. The two-time defending
Stanley Cup champions have lost three straight, four out of five
and are 4-10 against teams with .500 or better records.
	   Nikolai Khabibulin made 36 saves in the Phoenix net. Detroit's
Chris Osgood had 23 stops.
 &UR; Kings 3, Penguins 0
	   In Pittsburgh, Jamie Storr stopped 25 shots and Glen Murray
scored one goal and set up another in a 27-second span late in the
second period as the Los Angeles Kings beat the Penguins.
	   The win was Larry Robinson's 100th in four seasons as the Kings'
coach. He has a 100-136-43 record in that time.
	   The shutout was the second of the season for Storr and third of
his career. He recorded the Kings' first shutout in Pittsburgh
since March 7, 1979, when Mario Lessard had a 4-0 win at the Civic
Arena.
	   Vladimir Tsyplakov scored the Kings' second goal on a feed from
Murray and Donald Audette added a third-period unassisted tally.
 &UR; Islanders 3, Blues 3
	   In Uniondale, New York, Todd Gill spoiled Zigmund Palffy's
return to the Islanders with his first goal of the season in the
final six minutes, giving the St. Louis Blues a tie.
	   Palffy, playing his first game since ending a long holdout last
week, assisted on two goals. Palffy, the Islanders' top goal scorer
the last three seasons, signed a five-year deal for about dlrs 25
million to end a long and sometimes acrimonious contract battle
with the team.
	   The Islanders were on their way to victory with their top
offensive player back before Gill beat Wade Flaherty with a slap
shot at 5:46.
	   Scott Pellerin and Marty Reasoner also scored for the Blues.
Mariusz Czerkawski scored twice for the Islanders, while Claude
Lapointe had one goal.

Fog disrupts flights in India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Heavy fog stretching across northern
India forced authorities to shut down New Delhi's airport
indefinitely, disrupting international and domestic flights, local
newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   Several international airlines diverted flights to Bombay or
Calcutta and dozens of flights out of New Delhi were canceled after
authorities shut down the airport Tuesday night, the reports said.
No immediate date was set for resumption of operation.
	   The fog has enveloped a large swathe of northern India for the
last eight days. The weather office said it could last a few more
days.
	   Thousands of passengers were stranded in airports across
northern India, especially in New Delhi and the western metropolis
of Bombay, with airlines unable to find accommodation for them in
hotels.
	   Several Indian airports are only now updating equipment that
would allow pilots to fly even if visibility is poor. Domestic
airlines are only beginning to train their pilots in using such
equipment, The Times of India newspaper reported.
