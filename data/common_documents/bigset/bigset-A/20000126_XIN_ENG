<HEADLINE> Japanese Right-Wing Activists Condemned (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government should
be held accountable for telling history as it is and take
effective measures to restrain right-wing forces who have denied
that the Nanjing Massacre ever took place.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made by members of the Foreign Affairs
Subcommittee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) today. They strongly
condemned right-wing activists in Japan who have denied atrocities
committed by Japanese troops in Nanjing in December 1937.
</P>
<P>
This is flagrant defiance of history, the members said. The
Chinese people suffered untold atrocities by Japanese aggressors.
Denying that the Massacre ever took place also runs against world
peace, justice and conscience of the mankind, they said at a
gathering here.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Japanese statesmen will see their history as
a mirror and will learn from the past and promote and develop
peace," they stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Nanjing massacre was an atrocity committed by the Japanese
troops, who killed 300,000 unarmed Chinese. It was a final verdict
of a military tribunal made up of 11 countries including China,
the former Soviet Union, Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Some of the CPPCC members also denounced the atrocity citing
their own experience during the war of resistance against Japan in
the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
They said that it is not accident that a small group of Japan's
right-wing forces have attempted to deny the history of Japan's
invasion of China half a century later. After World War II, they
pointed out, Japan has never earnestly showed repentance for the
invasion of China, and militarist forces have not been destroyed
completed, providing a hotbed for the recovery of the militarist
forces in Japan.

<TEXT>
<P>
The CPPCC members pointed out that along with Japan's economic
development and changes in the international situation, right-wing
forces in the Japanese political circles have also developed.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Japan's right-wing forces produced a movie -- Pride,
A Fleeting Moment in One's Lifetime, whitewashing the atrocities
committed by Japanese soldiers and reversing a verdict of Hideki
Tojo, a chief war criminal during World War II. Two days ago,
right-wing forces performed a farcical play denying the Nanjing
massacre.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before that, the Japanese Supreme Court rejected Azuma
Shiro's case again. Azuma, a Japanese veteran, openly confessed to
atrocities committed by Japanese troops during the Nanjing
Massacre.
</P>
<P>
All the facts show that Japan's right-wing forces have
deliberately conducted anti-China activities, the members said,
adding: "We should keep a vigilant eye against such activities."
</P>
<P>
They stressed that whether the history of the Japanese
militarist invasion of China can be viewed correctly will serve as
a touchstone to show whether the Japanese government is sincere in
maintaining the political basis of Sino-Japanese relations.

<HEADLINE> China Sends Satellite Into Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XICHANG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China successfully put a
telecommunications satellite, the Zhongxing-22, into orbit early
today with a Long March 3-A rocket.
</P>
<P>
The carrier rocket blasted off at 00:45 (Beijing time) from the
Xichang Satellite Launching Center in Sichuan Province, southwest
China.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth flight of the powerful carrier rocket since
it made its debut in 1994. The carrier rocket had previously
succeeded in putting into orbit two telecommunications satellites
and one scientific experimental satellite.
</P>
<P>
Today's launch is the 60th of the Long March carrier family.
Since October 1996, carrier rockets of this family have made 18
successful flights in a row.
</P>
<P>
The Zhongxing-22 satellite weighs 2,300 kilograms. It will be
mainly used for ground telecommunications under the supervision of
the China Telecommunications and Broadcasting Satellite
Corporation. The satellite will be in service for about eight
years.
</P>
<P>
In 30 minutes after launching, the satellite entered the
predetermined earth-synchronous orbit, with a perigee of 210
kilometers, and an apogee of 41,974 kilometers. It is expected to
be positioned at 98 degrees east longitude above the equator.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Iran Keen on Boosting Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Officials from Turkey and Iran on
Wednesday began three days of consultations here on ways and means
to boost bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the Turkey-Iran Joint Economic Commission,
chaired by Turkish Minister of Economy Recep Onal and Iranian
Minister of Transport Mahmoud Hojjati, came amid detente of ties
between the two big regional Islamic neighbors, reported the
Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi paid a two-day visit to
Turkey earlier this month, an event that was widely described as a
breakthrough in the dormant relations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Onal said that Turkey needs to
develop its relations with its friend Iran in every field, mainly
in trade and economy.  Relationship between the Islamic Republic
of Iran and officially secular Turkey is often tense and it hit a
low last July after Tehran accused Turkish jets of bombing its
territory and killing five people.
</P>
<P>
Ankara, which always accused Iran of supporting its outlawed
Kudish Workers' Party, said the bombs hit Kurd rebel targets in
Iraq but later agreed to pay compensation to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The soured bilateral ties have severely affected the trade
between the two neighbors, which Onal said, dropped to 571 million
in 1999 from 2.4 billion dollars in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Given the fact that oil constitutes a big part of the bilateral
trade, Onal proposed to form a joint Business Council to facilitate
oil deal. He also proposed to start cooperation between Turkey's
Eximbank and the Iranian Export Gharantee Fund to finance trade
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Onal, Hucceti said that Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami's foreign policy was aimed at getting along well with its
neighbors and not at interfering in their domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
He agreed that trade relations between the two states are not at
an adequate level. The two sides must try to tap their trade
potentials and use their economic capacities to play a more
effective role in the region.
</P>
<P>
An average 2,000 trucks pass through the Bazargan-Gurbulak
border gate each day, he said. A new border gate could be opened to
reduce the traffic overload and it could be handled to work for 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
Customs, bilateral trade and problems related to border trade
are three major issues expected to be discussed during the
commission meeting.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends Hans Blix to be New Chief Arms Inspector For Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Wednesday said that he had sent a letter nominating
Hans Blix of Sweden to be the chairman of a new U.N. arms
inspection regime for Iraq after learning of Security Council's
unanimous approval.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Annan said "Once I get their consent I
will go ahead and make the appointment and Mr.Blix is available,"
</P>
<P>
"He is a very experienced man. He has already worked in Iraq
and has been in the disarmament field for a long time," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I do hope that Iraq will cooperate, and I think we are going
to do everything we can to get them engaged in the game," the U.N.
chief added.
</P>
<P>
Annan was expected to make the official appointment soon.
</P>
<P>
President of the Security Council, Richard Holbrooke, said
this morning that the Council members had reached consensus on
Hans Blix, former Swedish head of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA), to lead the United Nations Monitoring, Verification
and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) created by resolution 1284
adopted last month to replace now defunct the United Nations
Special Commission (UNSCOM)in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Resolution requested the Secretary-General appoint a
chairman for UNMOVIC within 30 days after the adoption of the
resolution, subject to approval of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Annan last week announced to nominate Rolf Ekeus, another
Swede, to the post, a move met objection from Russia, France and
China.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Immediate End to Hostilities in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Wednesday called for an immediate end to hostilities in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and "the orderly withdrawal
" of all foreign forces from the central African country.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation Security Council, in a unanimously adopted
presidential statement, said that "it reiterates its call for the
immediate cessation of hostilities and the orderly withdrawal of
all foreign forces from the territory of the Democratic Republic
of Congo in accordance with the Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement."
</P>
<P>
Warring parties signed the Lusaka Agreement in July last year,
but they failed to implement the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued at the special meeting of the
Security Council on the peace prospects in the DRC, which began
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The council reaffirms its support for" the Lusaka Cease-fire
Agreement and the relevant U.N. resolution on the DRC, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council urges all the parties to the Lusaka
Cease-fire Agreement to build on the momentum of these meetings in
order to create and sustain the climate necessary for the full
implementation of the agreement," the statement said. "It
underlines the importance of a revised implementation calendar for
the full and effective implementation of the tasks in the
agreement."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has now begun consideration of a
resolution authorizing the extension of the present mandate of the
United Nations Organization Mission in the DRC (MONUC) along the
lines recommended by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It expresses its intention to consider at the appropriate
time preparations for an additional phase of United Nations
deployment and further action," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council supports the establishment of a
coordinated MONUC/Joint Military Commission (JMC) structure with
co-located headquarters and joint support arrangements," the
statement said. "The council believes that this is a vital step in
enhancing the ability of the United Nations to support the Lusaka
Cease-fire Agreement."
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council stresses the importance of the National
Dialogue as called for in the Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement, and
affirms that it must be an open, inclusive and democratic process
conducted independently by the Congolese people under the
established facilitation," the statement said. "It further affirms
that the National Dialogue is the best means for all Congolese
parties to address the political future" of the African nation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement expressed the concern of the Security
Council over the presence in the DRC of "non-signatory armed
groups that have yet to be demobilized constitutes a threat to the
Lusaka process," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The council recognizes that disarmament, demobilization,
resettlement and reintegration are among the fundamental
objectives of the Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement," it added.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council values the continuing leadership of the
peace process by the president of Zambia and, Frederick Chiluba,
the vital contribution of the Southern African Development
Community through its chairman, the president of Mozambique,
Joaquim Chissano, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The council also expressed its appreciation to leaders of the
Organization of African Unity for the organization's "vital role"
in he Lusaka process, the statement said. "It urges them to
continue their essential efforts in close cooperation with the
Security Council and the secretary-general."

<HEADLINE> Niger Appeals to France For Emergency Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The western African state of
Niger Wednesday appealed to France for an emergency aid and a
resumption of cooperation, which was suspended after a coup d'etat
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
President Mamadou Tandja of Niger made the appeal to French
President Jacques Chirac during a meeting at the Elysee
presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
``Ignorance is being installed in my country. The personnel of
health no longer work. People are dying, as if there is a war
without name, but a war which does the same damages as a real war,
'' said Tandja at a press conference after the meeting with Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government does not have the money to pay its
employees and cannot make them work.
</P>
<P>
France suspended its annual aid of 400 million francs (60
million U.S. dollars) to Niger, one of the poorest countries in
the world, after a coup d'etat killed the country's former
president, Ibrahim Bare Mainassara, in April 1999.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Quick U.N. Action to End DRC War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China Wednesday called
on the United Nations and the international community to take
adequate steps at an early date in a bid to put an end to the many-
sided conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Qin Huasun, the Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations, took the floor at an open
Security Council debate on the peace prospects in DRC. The
Wednesday debate is the follow-up to the Monday session in a
series of the U.N. special meeting on DRC.
</P>
<P>
"The international community and the United Nations should
throw in necessary financial and human resources as soon as
possible to resolve the conflict in the DRC, so as to avoid paying
even higher prices in the future," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"To resolve this conflict, African countries and the
international community have conducted unremitting mediation
efforts and brought together the various sides to the conflict to
sign last July's Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, however, the Agreement has not been honestly
observed or implemented," he said. "The long-awaited United
Nations peace-keeping operation is still yet to be put in place,
even though the issue has been under discussion in the Council so
many times."
</P>
<P>
Qin said that he was "gratified to see" a detailed report by U.
N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has proposed on the U.N.
deployment of 5,000 peace-keeping troops to protect 500 unarmed U.
N. military observers.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Council will make full use of this precious
occasion when heads of state of relevant African countries are
gathered here in New York, and move promptly," he said.
</P>
<P>
On how to peacefully end the conflict in DRC, Qin said, "First,
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the DRC must be fully
respected and safeguard. This is the prerequisite for resolving
the conflict."
</P>
<P>
"Second, the Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement, as the basis for
resolving the conflict, should be implemented in full and with all
earnest," he said. "The Agreement is a useful first step by the
African people towards resolving African conflicts."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also called on all sides to respect and support
the mediation efforts by President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia,
the Organization of African Unity and the Southern African
Development Community.
</P>
<P>
"Third, timely deployment of U.N. peace-keeping operation in
the DRC is the essential guarantee for resolving the conflict," he
said. "While listening to the views of relevant African countries,
the Council should consider and implement the Secretary-General's
proposal of sending up to 500 military observers and 5,500-strong
forces to the DRC."
</P>
<P>
"The peace-keeping mission should be given appropriate mandate,
" he said. "This is crucial under the current circumstances and
will be a critical test of the Security Council's political will
and determination."
</P>
<P>
"Fourth, all-inclusive national political dialogue is an
effective means to realize national reconciliation in the DRC," he
said. "At the same time, internal dialogue within the DRC will not
be possible without a stable external environment."
</P>
<P>
"Fifth, the fundamental way out for the DRC to be able to enjoy
lasting peace and stability is for the international community to
help it eradicate poverty and develop the economy," he said. "In
this connection, we support the proposal of convening an
international conference on peace, stability, democracy and
development of the Great Lake area."
</P>
<P>
"The road towards peace in the DRC will not be smooth, but we
are confident that so long as the international community would
grasp the opportunities and make concerted efforts, and so long as
the various sides to the conflict will treat each other sincerely
and honor their commitment, the people of the DRC and the Great
Lake area will surely be able to live in peace and stability in
the not very far future," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says Not to Accept U.N. Resolution Creating New Arms Regime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Ambassador to the
United Nations, Saeed Hasan, said on Wednesday that his country
would not accept the resolution of the U.N. Security Council which
created the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection
Commission(UNMOVIC).
</P>
<P>
Responding to the announcement by President of the Security
Council, Richard Holbrooke, that the Council members had reached
consensus on Hans Blix, former Swedish head of the International
Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA) to lead UNMOVIC, Hasan said it made no
difference who was named to the post because Iraq did not accept a
December 17 resolution creating UNMOVIC.
</P>
<P>
"We are not dealing with this resolution and each and every
part of it," Hasan said.
</P>
<P>
Blix is 71 years old and retired in 1997 after heading the
Vienna-based IAEA, the U.N.'s watchdog, for 16 years until January
1998.
</P>
<P>
The Council adopted a resolution last month which created the
UNMOVIC to replace now defunct the United Nations Special
Commission(UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The resolution requested the U.N. chief appoint a chairman for
UNMOVIC within 30 days of the adoption of the resolution, subject
to approval of the Council. Kofi Annan last week notified the
Council of nomination of Rolf Ekeus, another Swede, for the post,
which met objection from Russia, France and China.
</P>
<P>
There has not been arms inspection for Iraq since December 1998
when the United states and Britain launched military strikes
against the country. UNSCOM withdrew from Iraq days before the
military strikes. Iraq has barred it from returning.

</P>
<P>
"We are not dealing with this resolution and each and every

</P>
<P>
"As has been stated by Mr.Treq Aziz and other Iraqi officials,
the new chairman will not change much in the scheme which has been
prepared by the United States in resolution 1284," the Ambassador
said.
</P>
<P>
"This resolution is not implementable, is not working and it
will not work," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hasan said the United States was "violating Iraqi sovereignty
and territorial integrity daily, violating the Charter of the
United Nations daily, bombing Iraq through the no-fly zones," he
continued.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador said the Council resolution did not take into
consideration the previous espionage activities of the United
Nations Special Commission(UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
Neither the Security Council nor the Secretary-General
bothered to investigate these cases and see whether this took
place or not, he added.

<HEADLINE> SADC Criticized for Rejecting Refugees From Outside Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations refugee
agency on Wednesday criticized the 14-member Southern African
Development Community (SADC) for rejecting refugees from outside
the region.
</P>
<P>
"There is a tendency within SADC of not accepting refugees from
outside the region. That is unacceptable," the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Southern Africa Director Nicolas
Bwakira told a news conference in Zambian capital Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
He gave no specific examples, but said UNHCR was working with
SADC on a plan to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
Bwakira also spoke strongly against other unidentified African
countries that enforced laws keeping refugees inside designated
camps where they could not earn a living.
</P>
<P>
Bwakira was accompanying UNHCR head Sadako Ogata on a mission
to evacuate thousands of sick and hungry Angolan refugees from the
western Zambian border post of Kalabo, where they faced floods, to
a settlement farther inland.
</P>
<P>
Zambia hosts 216,783 refugees, including 171,760 Angolans
fleeing escalation of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR says 21,000 refugees have entered Zambia from Angola
since last October with 12,000 crossing in January alone.
</P>
<P>
The SADC covers Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Namibia, Lesotho, Tanzania, South Africa, Seychelles,
Swaziland, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki will head a delegation to attend the World Economic
Forum (WEF) summit due to be held in Davos, Switzerland from
Friday to next Monday, South African Press Association reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will include Trade and Industries Minister Alec
Erwin, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel and Reserve Bank Governor
Tito Mboweni.
</P>
<P>
"South African participation will be further strengthened by a
substantial representation of the private sector," presidential
spokesman Parks Mankahlana said.
</P>
<P>
He said the summit would provide "unsurpassed opportunities" for
South Africa's political and business leaders to place issues
concerned on the international agenda.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana said the South African government viewed the event as
very important and Mbeki would use the opportunity to meet various
business leaders and investors in the context of the African
renaissance and the African century.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki would also discuss the impact of globalization on
developing countries, and participate with other African leaders
in sessions on investment in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The WEF annual summit is an opportunity for international
political and business leaders to discuss economic, financial and
technological trends and other issues of global importance.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Fund Mozambique's Survey of Land Mines Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Canada has pledged 7.5 million
U.S. dollars to fund Mozambique's survey of areas infested by land
mines this year, a Mozambican official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Artur Verissimo, director of the National Demining Institute
(IND), told Mozambique News Agency that this research will allow
the establishment of basic conditions for the systematic planning
of mine clearance activities over the short, medium and long
terms.
</P>
<P>
"This research will allow us to understand better and have an
overall vision of the situation of land mines in the country", he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Verissimo added that the survey "will allow us to draw up a
national plan of action to deal with this scourge".
</P>
<P>
With such a plan, it will be easier to define the priorities
that must be followed by the operators who actually remove the
mines from the soil, he said.
</P>
<P>
Specialist teams, in coordination with the IND, will undertake
the survey throughout the entire country over a period of 22
months.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that two million land mines were laid around
the country during 16-year civil war. However, less than 60,000
land mines have been removed since the end of the war in 1992.

<HEADLINE> UN Suspends Relocation of Angolan Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUANDA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- United Nations has suspended
its plan to relocate thousands of Angolan refugees in Zambia
because of the escalating conflicts between the Angolan government
troops and the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi near the
Angolan-Zambian border.
</P>
<P>
The chartered flights for carrying humanitarian aid had been
canceled due to the heavy fighting, especially in Angola's
southeastern Cuando Cubango province, said local informed sources.
</P>
<P>
Plans to transport by land some 60 tons of food to about 7,000
newly- camped refugees had also been held up by heavy rains that
made roads terribly muddy, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
Sadako Ogata was quoted by the informed sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the refugee camps in the Kalabo region in western Zambia,
the recent arrivals from Angola are in dire need for food and
other humanitarian goods, said the source. The Angolan refugees
staying in Kalabo are suffering from various diseases, mainly the
malaria and dysentery. They have also reportedly walked an average
of 100 kilometers fleeing the fighting inside Angola.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program (WPF) has begun on Sunday airlifting
aid to the Angolan refugees stranded in the isolated region of
west Zambia, said a spokeswoman of the organization Christiane
Berthiaume.
</P>
<P>
A total of 27 tons of food have been delivered to the Kalabo
region so far, with the first four flights being sent on Sunday,
Berthiaume said.
</P>
<P>
 A week ago the WFP appealed for 100,000 U..S. dollars in
emergency aid for the new wave of Angolan refugees camped along
the Zambeze River in Zambia. There are a total of 160,000 Angolan
refugees were reported in the country so far.

<HEADLINE> Peace Group Asks Barak to Pull out From Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel's peace group the Four
Mothers demonstrated Wednesday in front of the Defense Ministry in
Tel Aviv, urging Prime Minister Ehud Barak to pull out Israeli
troops from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We came here to tell Barak that Israel must withdraw the
defense force from south Lebanon as soon as possible to prevent
further losses of lives there," one demonstrator was quoted by
Israel Radio as saying.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators also said that Israel should speed up peace
talks with Syria, because a peace agreement with Syria could bring
the boys home from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
They urged Barak, who is also defense minister, to put an
immediate ceasefire in south Lebanon as condition for peace talks
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The group was formed several years ago by four mothers whose
sons were killed in south Lebanon. Now it has been expanded into a
large organization in Israel seeking troop withdrawal from the
self-styled security zone, but the name remains the same.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's demonstration was held after another Israeli
soldier, 24-year-old Rafael Zangwill, was killed Tuesday inside the
security zone Israel set up in 1985 after two invasions.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh on Wednesday urged Syria to
rein in Lebanon's militant Islamic group Hezbollah to stop military
operations against the Israeli troops in south Lebanon in order to
move the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Rafael was killed when an anti-tank missile slammed into his
outpost on the western sector of the security zone. He was the
first Israeli soldier to die in Lebanon since August.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, is leading a war of attrition to
oust the 1,500 Israeli troops and their 2,500 allied militiamen
from south Lebanon. It has been believed to be backed by Syria and
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon, said Sneh, adding
that without restraint Hezbollah attacks could cause the situation
in south Lebanon to deteriorate, putting the peace talks in doubt.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria resumed peace talks last December after a 45-
month break. They have held two rounds of talks in the United
States and the third round, scheduled also in the United States
last Wednesday, has been indefinitely postponed because of
significant disagreements.

NICOSIA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Romania's biggest bank, Banca
Comerciala Romana SA, has been granted a licence by the Central
Bank of Cyprus to operate an International Banking Unit (IBU) on
the island, the Cyprus News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The licence was granted Wednesday and allows the Romanian bank
to deal primarily in foreign currencies and work with other non-
resident institutions and individuals both in Cyprus and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The IBU will be subject to supervision and inspection by both
the Central Bank and the National Bank of Romania.
</P>
<P>
The licence enables Banca Comerciala Romana SA's IBU to assume
the operations of the IBU of another Romanian bank, Banca Romana de
Comert Exterior (Bancorex) SA which was established in Cyprus in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Banca Comerciala Romana SA has recently taken over Bancorex.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four IBUs operate at present in Cyprus, but the Central
Bank is expected to grant more licences for IBU in the near future,

<HEADLINE> Mubarak on Arab Summit, Sudan, Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said Wednesday that there is an Arab unanimity on the necessity to
hold an Arab summit, Egypt's official Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inauguration of the 32nd Cairo International Book
Fair, Mubarak voiced Egypt's keenness to convene such an Arab
summit, which is aimed to mend the split within the Arab world,
restore inter-Arab solidarity and achieve a unified position in the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has recently visited Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the
United Arab Emirates, as well as Syria and Jordan to seek
solidarity and coordinate stances with Arab leaders on peace talks
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He noted that no date has yet been set for the summit and that
all Arab countries agreed that such a summit should be preceded by
a well-studied agenda. If held, it would be the first such meeting
in four years.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also said Egypt is keen to maintain stability in Sudan
without interference in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese government forces have been fighting with southern
rebels led by John Garang who have been seeking autonomy for the
predominantly Christian and animist south since 1983 from the
Islamic government in the north.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has repeatedly voiced its readiness to help safeguard
Sudan's unity and territorial integrity and has been mediating
between the Sudanese government and the opposition, out of fear
that possible disintegration of Sudan may endanger its major water
source, the Nile. 
</P>
<P>
On the Syrian-Israeli negotiations, Mubarak said progress on the
Syrian track depends on how far Israel is committed to
implementation of the agreements signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Failure to implement the signed accords and adoption of evasive
tactics create an atmosphere of mistrust and set many obstacles on
the road of negotiations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Syrian-Israeli peace making hit a snag after two rounds of talks
since last December, with the third round put on hold indefinitely
over rifts on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also said that Egypt is doing its best to help mend ties
between Syria and the Palestinians and establish amity between
them. Relation between Syria and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's Fatah movement, impaired in 1983 due to differences over
the Middle East peace process, has remained cool even after
normalization in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Syria, where 300,000 Palestinian refugees are taking shelter, is
competing with the Palestinian authority over the right to
determine the fate of Palestinian refugees residing in neighboring
Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo book fair will be held through February 2 in the
capital city. Some 3,700 publishing houses from 72 countries are
taking part in the fair.
</P>
<P>
The fair, attracting an average of 4 million visitors every
year, is the world's second largest book event after the Frankfurt
book fair in Germany.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Embassy in Turkey Threatened by Terror Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Embassy in Ankara on
Wednesday presented a note to the Turkish Foreign Ministry saying
that it had received information that its diplomats might be
attacked by a terror group.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli Embassy official told Xinhua that they had taken
precautionary measures in the embassy compound and surroundings,
and requested the Turkish Foreign Ministry to take further
necessary steps to protect the residences of Israeli diplomats and
their cars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry conveyed the warnings of the Israeli embassy to
Directorate General of Security, which sent an instruction by fax
to Ankara and Istanbul Security Directorates requesting them to
tighten security measures around the residences of Israeli
diplomats, reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Directorate General of Security ordered police units to
carry out 24-hour guard of the residences and cars belonging to the
Israeli diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Security measures were also intensified around the Israeli
embassy in Cankaya District of Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The embassy official declined to name the terror group, saying
that he was not in the position to talk about intelligence matters.
</P>
<P>
He added that Israeli diplomatic missions and personnel have
frequently come across threats from different terror groups
throughout the world, but in the Middle East Hezbollah poses a big
threat against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Turkish police unleashed a nation-wide dragnet against Hezbollah
last week and operations are continuing in full swing. The Turkish
Hezbollah, reported to have no connections with the Lebanese group
which has the same name, wants to set up a fundamentalist regime in

<HEADLINE> International Business Calls for Strengthened U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The appeal was contained in statement handed over to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan Wednesday by the president of the
International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), Adnan Kassar. The
statement portrayed a world business message for the Millennium
Assembly on the role of the United Nations in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
It was delivered on behalf of the ICC worldwide membership of
more than 7,000 business associations and companies, located in
more than 130 countries and territories.
</P>
<P>
The Millennium Assembly begins on September 5, 2000 in the U.N.
Headquarters in New York, with a summit of heads of state and
government to start the following day. This special session of the
U.N. General Assembly, or the 55th General Assembly session, is to
chart goals and directions for the United Nations and the
international community at the opening of a new century and
millennium.
</P>
<P>
The ICC message urged the upcoming Millennium Assembly to
ensure that the United Nations takes the lead in supporting a
rules-based open system of international trade and investment
while opposing all forms of protectionism.
</P>
<P>
Relevant U.N. agencies and programs, and not the multilateral
trading system, should be the recognized global institutions for
raising environmental and labor standards and promoting human
rights, the ICC said.
</P>
<P>
These are the core values cited by Annan in his initiative for
a Global Compact between the United Nations, business and civil
society.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the Global Compact that the Secretary-General
proposed almost exactly one year ago for cooperation between
business and the United Nations in raising environmental and labor
standards and promoting human rights," said the ICC president said
at a press briefing following his meeting with Annan.
</P>
<P>
The ICC statement said that history has shown that improvements
in human rights and in labor and environmental standards are more
readily attainable in conditions of rising prosperity, produced by
the interaction of the market economy and good governance.
</P>
<P>
"Strong commitment to open markets and the effective treatment
of these issues are mutually reinforcing and should go hand in
hand," it said.
</P>
<P>
The decision to submit a business statement in advance of the
Millennium Assembly next September was taken at a meeting in
Geneva in July between Annan, the heads of relevant U.N. agencies
and the ICC. Top executives from 27 leading international
companies from both developed and developing countries also took
part.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- President of the United
Nations Security Council, Richard Holbrooke, said on Wednesday
that the Council members has reached consensus on Hans Blix,
former Swedish head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, to
lead a new U.N. arms inspection regime for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Holbrooke of the United States, said "We
are passing his name to the Secretary-General of the United
Nations immediately for consideration by the Secretary-General for
further action.'
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said he would informed the U.N. chief that the
Council had not been able to reach agreement on his nomination of
Rolf Ekeus to be the new chief arms inspector.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted a resolution last month which
created the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection
Commission (UNMOVIC) to replace now defunct the United Nations
Special Commission(UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Resolution requested that the Secretary-General appoint a
chairman of UNMOVIC within 30 days of the adoption of the
resolution, subject to the approval of the Security Council. Last
Week, U.N. chief Kofi Annan notified the Council of his nomination
of Rolf Ekeus, another Swede, a move met objection from Russia,
France and China.
</P>
<P>
There has not been arms inspection in Iraq since UNSCOM
withdrew from the country in December 1998 when the United States
and Britain launched military strikes against Iraq under the
pretext that it had failed to cooperate fully with UNSCOM.

LUSAKA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations International
Children's Fund (UNICEF) Wednesday donated to Zambia malaria
prevention and control logistic supplies worth 136,000 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The supplies including 27,000 mosquito nets, 29,000 insecticide

insecticide treated bed-nets by health workers and agents.
</P>
<P>
It also assists the country's health management teams through
the provision of training for both the health staff and community
members on malaria transmission, diagnosis and treatment,
management and treatment of the disease in pregnancy.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Poverty Reduction Strategy Revealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has developed a poverty
reduction strategy to address most of the poverty concerns and
reduce the poor to half of the total population within several
years, a government official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Finance Minister Godfrey Simasiku said the government's
medium- term objective is to reduce poverty from the current 73
percent of the total population to 50 percent by the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
During this period, access to clean water and sanitation will
be increased by 50 percent in rural areas and 100 percent for
urban households, Simasiku said at a workshop on "Living
Conditions in Zambia".
</P>
<P>
Under the basic education program, the government will endeavor
to provide quality education to all primary school eligible
children by 2006, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We need to resuscitate the economy so as to create better
paying jobs both in urban and rural areas," he said, adding that
the government has already formulated deliberate policies aimed at
encouraging private business.
</P>
<P>
This is the only sure way of improving the living standard of
the majority of the people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Director of Census and Statistics David Diangamo said earlier
that seven million out of Zambia's 10 million population were
living in poverty, according to the 1998 survey.

<P>
LUSAKA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Malawi has recorded 22,000 cases
of tuberculosis (TB) annually since 1998, and the number is
expected to hit 29, 000 by the year 2005, a report reaching here
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Most of these cases will be young adults," said Malawi's TB
program manager Dr. Felix Salaniponi.
</P>
<P>
The situation is particularly worrying since TB has a long
treatment regime which means a lot of young people will be off
work thereby affecting the socio-economic development of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Health Ministry of Malawi indicate that
over 90 percent of TB cases in Malawian hospitals are also HIV
positive.
</P>
<P>
The National AIDS Program of Malawi estimates nearly one
million of the country's 10 million population are HIV positive.

HARARE, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean business leader
Wednesday urged the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (Zesa)
to come up with long- term solutions to solving power problems in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Kumbirayi Katsande, president of Confederation of Zimbabwe

Zesa has announced that it could introduce country-wide power

currencies to pay for imports.
</P>
<P>
The unavailability of diesel also worsened the situation at
Zesa which could be forced to cut supplies to residential areas

Zesa imports about 55 percent of the country's power needs from
 Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Not to Sacrifice Principles for EU Deal: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- South African Trade and
Industry Minister Alec Erwin said on Wednesday that his country
would not sacrifice principles just to strike a trade deal with
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
South Africa would negotiate correctly and would stand for
principles, Erwin told a joint meeting of several key committees
in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
"We will not agree to things that we know are disastrous for
the world trade system, just to do a deal," Erwin stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said it was completely unacceptable that the free trade
accord -- signed by all EU member states -- was now in jeopardy
because of objections by Greece and Italy to South Africa's use of
the brands of grappa and ouzo, two popular spirits in Greece and
Italy.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are supported by Luxembourg, Portugal, France
and Spain.
</P>
<P>
The EU-SA trade pact, which should have been implemented from
January 1, has stalled because of objections to the ancillary wine
and spirits accord.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said the South African government was prepared to label
ouzo and grappa as "South African grappa" and "South African
ouzo".
</P>
<P>
However, it would only make this offer if the EU guaranteed that
the wine and spirit accord was separate from the main accord.
</P>
<P>
This would mean that if there was a problem, the dispute
resolution mechanism could be used.
</P>
<P>
The South African government understood that this was a new
issue for the EU, which was causing them legal problems, Erwin
said.
</P>
<P>
"But they will have to resolve those matters, otherwise when we
come to the WTO (World Trade Organization) we are going to have
the same problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU was doing considerable damage to its credibility and it
was regrettable that such an important agreement was beset with
uncertainty, Erwin said.
</P>
<P>
"I regret to say that although we will fight tooth and nail to
ensure that the main agreement continues to apply, I'm unable to
give any guarantee -- its in the hands of the European Union," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid to say that every single time in the last 18 months
that we' ve reached an agreement with them, they've broken it."
</P>
<P>
Erwin called for a rules-based system to govern trade
relations.
</P>
<P>
"Our clash with the EU is a classic of example of where it
would be far better to have the WTO rules in place, than to fight
a really silly war where the EU can use its full economic muscle
against a smaller economy on an issue which really is not going to
be accepted in the WTO," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was important for small countries to have these rules, he
added.
</P>
<P>
EU ambassadors are making a last-ditch attempt on Wednesday to
resolve the matter.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, Norway to Maintain Oil Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Norway, the
world's two largest oil producers, promised on Wednesday to adhere
to the one-year oil output reduction agreement signed by major
producers last March.
</P>
<P>
The stance was announced in a joint statement issued in the
Saudi capital of Riyadh after a meeting between Saudi Minister of
Oil and Mineral Resources Ali Bin Ibrahim Al-Naimi and his
Norwegian counterpart Marit Arnstad, the Kuwait News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreement reached last March by members of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC states
envisages that the oil producers involved slashed their daily
production by about 2.1 million barrels as of April 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
They said that market balance has been achieved through
cooperation and full compliance with the output cuts agreement,
which was reached last March by members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC states.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer and exporter,
undertook a share of 585,000 barrels per day, while Norway, a non-
OPEC member with a daily production of 3 million barrels, chopped
its own output by 200,000 barrels.
</P>
<P>
Since the execution of the output curb, world oil prices, which
hit a decade low of less than 10 U.S. dollars per barrel at the
start of last year, have soared significantly.
</P>
<P>
Price of benchmark Brent crude struck a nine-year high of 27.11
dollars per barrel last Friday, before falling back a little.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two ministers exchanged views on the
current and future conditions on the world oil market.
</P>
<P>
In the joint statement, Saudi Arabia and Norway called for
vigilance and caution for the sake of assuring a sustained market
stability, which they believe, will serve the long-term interests
of oil producers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also discussed means of fostering cooperation in the
field of energy.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian minister arrived in the Gulf kingdom on Tuesday on
her three-day visit. The visit was said to have come within
Riyadh's concern to secure enough support for major oil producers,
who wish to maintain market balance.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia will host a meeting of major oil producing
countries on February to work out a production strategy ahead of
the OPEC ministers' meeting due in Vienna on March 27, during which
OPEC members have to decide on the output issue.
</P>
<P>
At present, major OPEC members have voiced support to the idea
of extending the production squeeze policy, but they are at odds
over a specific time-frame.

billion Korunas (10.56 billion U.S. dollars) and 468.03 billion
Korunas (11.7 billion U.S. dollars) respectively, a rise of 11.8
percent and 1.6 percent from 1998's value, which led to a total of
45.69 billion Korunas (1.14 billion U.S. dollars) in trade
deficits.
</P>
<P>
1999 was a good year for Slovakia. Huge increases in exports
cut the percentage of foreign trade deficit in Slovak's Gross
Domestic Product to 6 percent from 1998's 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, during the first nine months of last year,
Slovakia's deficit in the balance of international payments
dropped by 64.4 percent to 2.73 billion Korunas (68.25 million U.S.
dollars), as compared to the same period in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Ruling, Opposition Factions Intensify Friction Over Seat Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Friction between Japan's ruling
and opposition parties intensified Wednesday after the ruling bloc
forced a special committee of the House of Representatives to
approve a bill to reduce the number of lower house seats.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition, formed by the Liberal Democratic Party (
LDP), Liberal Party (LP) and New Komeito party, voted for the bill
in committee earlier in the day, while the opposition protested by
refusing to attend the committee session.
</P>
<P>
The opposition camp said it will continue to boycott all Diet (
parliament) sessions until the ruling bloc withdraws its plan to
enact the bill at the "beginning" of the current Diet session.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Yukio Hatoyama, leader of the main
opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), said his party may
boycott deliberations on the fiscal 2000 budget "if worse comes to
worse."
</P>
<P>
After the vote, secretaries-general of the opposition parties
urged the House of Representatives Speaker Soichiro Ito not to
hold a plenary session for a vote on the bill.
</P>
<P>
The ruling bloc wants to get the bill passed at the lower house
plenary session by Friday, when Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi delivers a key policy speech to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The proposed bill will cut 20 proportional representation seats
from the 500-seat lower house.
</P>
<P>
The LP, which sees the reduction as part of its political
reform plan, has threatened to quit the ruling bloc if the bill
fails to be enacted at an early date.
</P>
<P>
Local political analysts said if the opposition continues its
refusal to attend Diet sessions, especially during Obuchi's speech
at plenary sessions in both chambers Friday and deliberations on
the budget, Obuchi could opt to dissolve the lower house for a
snap general election.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Party had sought the passage of the bill during the
last extraordinary Diet session, threatening to quit the coalition.
</P>
<P>
After the bill failed to be enacted, the LDP and LP vowed to
work on having it enacted at the current Diet session, which began
on January 20.

MOSCOW -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Wednesday
that Moscow may take retaliatory measures in response to the
proposal by the European Union (EU) Council of Foreign Ministers
for sanctions against Russia.
</P>
<P>
"If the West does not want to implement any programs, we can
hold negotiations and make a decision," Ivanov told the Interfax
news agency.
</P>
<P>
"We may also have programs we do not want to carry out,"
Interfax quoted Ivanov as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov's remarks came after a Foreign Ministry statement
earlier in the day that threatened measures to counter the EU
decision dated January 24.
</P>
<P>
"Russia considers it inappropriate to link political
disagreements with trade and economic relations," the statement
said, referring to the EU Council's threat to impose sanctions on
Russia over its military actions against rebels in its republic of
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"The damage which these moves may inflict on the European Union
may be even worse than the damage inflicted on Russia, which has
to respond appropriately," the statement said, warning that Russia
will take measures to defend its national interests.
</P>
<P>
Moscow expressed regret that the decision of the EU Council "
contains unfounded criticism of the Russian anti-terrorist
operation in Chechnya," the document said.(Russia-EU-Chechnya)

JERUSALEM -- Israel on Wednesday urged Syria to rein in
Lebanon's militant Islamic group Hezbollah to stop military
operations against Israeli troops in south Lebanon in order to
move the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
If Syria truly wants the peace talks with Israel to succeed, it
must prevent every act in south Lebanon that could cause the
situation to deteriorate, Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh
told the Army Radio.
</P>
<P>
Sneh made this call after an Israeli soldier, Rafael Zangwill,
was killed by Hezbollah guerrillas on Tuesday inside the security
zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Rafael, 24, was killed when an anti-tank missile slammed into
his outpost on the western sector of the security zone. He was the
first Israeli soldier to die in Lebanon since August.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a war of attrition
to oust the Israeli troops from the security zone, which Israel
set up in 1985 with a self-proclaimed purpose of protecting its
northern security. The resistance group has been believed to be
backed by Syria and Iran. (Israel-Syria-Hezbollah)

<HEADLINE> Chinese Medicine Found Effective in Killing Cancer Cells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese medical scientists
discovered recently that a Chinese medicinal injection called "
Kanglate" (pronunciation) can kill cancer by preventing the growth
of cancerous blood vessels and malignant tumor genes.
</P>
<P>
The discovery is considered to be a new breakthrough for the
application of Chinese medicines in preventing the spread of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
Up until now there is no such anti-cancer drug in the medical
world that can be widely used to control the growth of cancerous
blood vessels and thus control the growth and transfer of malign
tumors to other parts of body.
</P>
<P>
The painful and mostly poisonous side-effects of synthesized
medicines have impelled scientists to probe further into the
research of anti-cancer Chinese medicines.
</P>
<P>
"Kanglate" was introduced by a pharmaceutical company in east
China's Zhejiang Province and is a key project of the State
Administration of Chinese Medicine.
</P>
<P>
Its clinical effects have overturned the once widely-
acknowledged notion in the medical profession that Chinese
medicine itself cannot kill cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
China's prestigious medical institutions such as China Medical
Research Institution, the Beijing Medical University and Military
Medical Institutions have all confirmed that "Kanglate" is very
effective in controlling the growth of malign tumor genes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese-Aided Nuclear Power Plant Fully Safe:  Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 26 (Xinhua) -- An official from Pakistan
Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) said Wednesda Chashma Nuclear
Power Plant (CHASHNUPP) set up in Pakistan's north with the help
of China was as safe as any nuclear power plant in the advanced
countries.
</P>
<P>
Pervaiz Butt, a PAEC member, was quoted by the Associated Press
of Pakistan as saying that "the plant has been built in accordance
with the international standards."
</P>
<P>
he said CHASHNUPP fully complied with the standards set by
Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
Butt said China has had a long experience in nuclear technology.
"They have been making nuclear-related equipment for years for
their large sized research reactors," he added.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out possibility of the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl
nuclear plant in former Soviet Union in 1980." CHASHNUPP and
Chernobyl are world apart," said Butt.
</P>
<P>
CHASHNUPP was a pressurized water reactor with a very thick
special steel pressure vessel and a three feet thick pre-stressed
concrete containment, noted Butt.
</P>
<P>
"All these arrangements completely prevent any escape of
radioactivity to the environment should an untoward incident takes
place," he said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Further Reduce Child Malnutrition Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is striving to reduce the
rate of malnourished children to 34 percent and the rate of
newborns weighing under 2.5 kg to 10 percent in 2000, Vietnam News
Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The target was set at a conference held in Hanoi on January 25
by the Nutrition Institute under Vietnam's Ministry of Health to
launch a program to reduce malnutrition among children in 2000.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, many types of education on nutrition and
care for mothers and children have been implemented with success
in the country. As a result, the rate of malnutrition of children
under five years old dropped to 36.7 percent in 1999 from 39
percent in 1998, with only 0.8 percent of the children suffering
from serious malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
Some provinces and cities of the country have registered child
malnutrition rates under 30 percent, including Hanoi (21.7 percent)
, Ho Chi Minh City (18.1 percent), Da Nang city (27.6 percent) and
Long An province (29.9 percent).

<HEADLINE> Serious Drought Leaves 9 People Dead in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Famine caused by serious
droughts in the border regions of Bakol and Gedo of Southern
Somalia have left nine people dead and forced thousands of
families to leave their villages and towns.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 villages and small towns have already been
deserted after their shallow water wells dried up owing to the
droughts and lack of rains in the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
The local authority in Bakol region has appealed to the rest of
Somalia and the international community for emergency relief.
</P>
<P>
According to Governor of Bakol region Mohamed Moallim Soransor,
the droughts are now claiming equally the lives of people and
animals.
</P>
<P>
Soransor said nine people have died for the famine in the past
three days in two villages between El-La-Helay and Moro-Gabey,
about 30 Kilometers northwest of Huddor town.
</P>
<P>
A driver who arrived in capital Mogadishu from Bakol region on
Wednesday also confirmed the death of over 100 animals mainly
goats and cattle in the past three or four days.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the other border region of Gedo also state that
lack of water is the main problem the people and livestock are
facing.
</P>
<P>
According to the radio reports, the situation is so desperate
since the next rainy season is still two months away.
</P>
<P>
The lack of water and serious food shortage are equally
devastating the people, especially increasing the
malnutrition-related diseases such as tuberculosis and anemia
which many people are dying for.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Wednesday that Moscow may take retaliatory measures in
response to the proposal by the European Union (EU) Council of
Foreign Ministers for sanctions against Russia.
</P>
<P>
"If the West does not want to implement any programs, we can
hold negotiations and make a decision," Ivanov told the Interfax
news agency.
</P>
<P>
"We may also have programs we do not want to carry out,"
Interfax quoted Ivanov as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov's remarks came after a Foreign Ministry statement
earlier in the day that threatened measures to counter the EU
decision dated January 24.
</P>
<P>
"Russia considers it inappropriate to link political
disagreements with trade and economic relations," the statement
said, referring to the EU Council's threat to impose sanctions on
Russia over its military actions against rebels in its republic of
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"The damage which these moves may inflict on the European Union
may be even worse than the damage inflicted on Russia, which has
to respond appropriately," the statement said, warning that Russia
will take measures to defend its national interests.
</P>
<P>
Moscow expressed regret that the decision of the EU Council "
contains unfounded criticism of the Russian anti-terrorist
operation in Chechnya," the document said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has more than once demonstrated its readiness for an
open and committed discussion of the problem of combating
terrorism in Chechnya. But we do not accept pressure in matters
of territorial integrity and national security," it stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement said Russia is open for a political
dialogue with the EU, which was proposed by the latter, adding
that a meeting between Russia and the EU scheduled for early March
in Lisbon will start an important stage in this process.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Approves Banking Privatization Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Mongolian government on
Wednesday approved a program on privatizing banks.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase of the program, the government will
privatize several State-run commercial banks, including the Trade
and Development Bank, the Innovation Bank and the Mongolian Post
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The government said that reform within the banking system is
one of the most serious problems facing the country's economic
reform. The banks must create a stable financial environment with
a healthy banking system to stimulate economic growth.
</P>
<P>
But Mongolia's current banking system has failed to implement
its financial mediation duty, the government said. If such a
condition continues in the banking sector, the country's economic
development could potentially remain in a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Most of Mongolia's commercial banks have a high level of
unhealthy debt and are incurring deficits.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Turkey Cautiously Optimistic to Turko-Greek Detente By Xing Guoxin Huai Chengbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Although the freezing Turko-Greek
ties is thawing after Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou
visited Ankara last week, some pending disputes between the two
neighbors dampened hopes for normal ties.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Ankara, the first official visit by a Greek
foreign minister since 1962, Papandreou signed agreements for
cooperation in combatting terrorism and organized crimes, as well
as deals on tourism, environment and the protection of investments.
The agreements were designed to build confidence between the two
sides before the tackling of two core issues, namely, the
territorial dispute over the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The visit was hailed by Ankara as another milestone in the
rapprochement process of bilateral ties, which had been mostly
characterized as "hostile".
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here warned that Ankara has to wait and see
when the two sides start to deal with the above-mentioned issues
which have brought the two Aegean neighbors to the brink of war
three times during the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Turkey also intervened militarily on the island of Cyprus in
1974 to prevent Greek Cypriots from uniting with Greece through a
coup.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Turkey cannot make any further concessions over
the two disputes may lead the two countries to freeze their ties,
said critics here.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece have improved relations steadily since the two
sides rushed aid to each other following the devastating
earthquakes which shocked the two countries last summer.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Greece dropped its long-standing objection to
Turkey's candidacy for the European Union (EU) membership. In
return, Turkey agreed that Cyprus could eventually join the EU, and
also agreed to possible international arbitration of some
territorial disputes if the two sides fail to solve them by 2004.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Papandreou also pledged to help push for
Turkey's EU membership.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- An American oil company manager was
kidnapped by Yemeni tribesmen on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The man, who has not been identified, was kidnapped in the
southeastern province of Marib near oil fields operated by the U.S.
company Hunt Oil Co., said a tribesman on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
He has been taken to the mountainous area of Marib, said the
tribesman.
</P>
<P>
An Oil Ministry official said the man worked for a company
called Halliburton which had been sub-contracted by Hunt in Marib.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy in the capital city of Sana would not
immediately comment on the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
Kidnapping is rampant in Yemen. Tribesmen abduct foreigners to
press the government for development projects in their area or the
release of detained tribal members.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Embassy in Turkey Seeks Tighter Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli embassy has asked the
Turkish authorities to beef up security for its personnel after
receiving threats from a radical Islamic group.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made for fears of possible attacks on the homes
and cars of Israeli diplomats in Ankara and Istanbul, the Anatolia
News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The reported threats came in the wake of a nationwide crackdown
by the Turkish government on Hezbollah, a radical Islamic group
seeking an Islamic state in Turkey's southeast.
</P>
<P>
Police killed the leader of the group's militant wing last week
and arrested more than 350 suspected militants.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic group Hezbollah in Turkey is not linked to the
guerrilla group Hezbollah, or Party of God, based in south Lebanon
which has been fighting to oust Israeli forces out of the country.

VIENNA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) said here Wednesday that the inspection on the
remaining nuclear materials at Iraq's Tuwaitha site has been
completed with Iraq's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, the IAEA said the five-member team
conducted on-site measurements and various other inspections, but
no conclusions can be made until the analysis of all relevant data
is completed in the IAEA headquarters in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
The team, which arrived in Baghdad on January 21, has no
connection with an arms verification program imposed on Iraq under
a U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the 1991 Gulf War.

The IAEA inspection is the first to be dispatched since
December 15 when U.N. arms inspectors halted their work due to
Iraq's failure to cooperate.

<HEADLINE> Filipino Athletes Ask Funds for Preparing Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The two sports associations of
taekwondo and archery have formally submitted to the Philippine
Sports Commission (PSC) their financial requests respectively for
the preparation of the forthcoming 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The Taekwondo Association of the Philippines (TAP) has asked
for 2 million pesos (50,000 U.S. dollars) assistance for the
training of its four Sydney Olympics qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
The Olympics-bound Philippine taekwondo athletes include 1999
Southeast Asian Games gold medallists Roberto Cruz (finweight) and
Donald David Geisler (featherweight) as well as Eva Marie Ditan
and Jasmin Stratchan.
</P>
<P>
PSC chairman Carlos Tuason said Wednesday that the request of
TAP will likely get the approval from his four commissioners,
saying "the amount is reasonable" considering there were four
taekwondo qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
Tuason, however, failed to comment on the archery's financial
request which is also worth 2 million pesos.
</P>
<P>
Philippines' top female archer Jennifer Chan is the lone Sydney
qualifier in archery so far, but Philippine Olympic Committee (POC)
president Celso Dayrit expected more qualifiers after the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) had decided to open seven
sports disciplines, including archery, for "invitees".
</P>
<P>
Under the new IOC scheme, the Philippines can recommend as many
as two deserving Filipino athletes without passing the usual pre-
Olympic qualifying tournaments in seven sports that also include
weightlifting, shooting, taekwondo, judo, tennis and triathlon.
</P>
<P>
The recommendees will be submitted to the IOC's tripartite
commission before the March 15 deadline for screening.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senator Wants Local Athletes' Rights Protected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Former Filipino basketball
superstar and now Senator Robert Jaworski lashed out Wednesday at
officials and promoters of the country's different basketball
leagues because of their neglect of the rights of full-blooded
Filipino players.
</P>
<P>
Jaworski, chair of the Senate's committee on games, amusement
and sports, stressed that for every foreign-based admitted into
the country's basketball leagues, "there is one less slot for a
Filipino".
</P>
<P>
"Even if they allow only just one player per team each year,
that amounts to as many and crushes dreams for full-blooded
Filipino players," Jaworski added.
</P>
<P>
Jaworski, who was the country's most popular basketball star
for more than two decades, stressed his point in wanting to
protect the local athletes' rights during the hearing on
professional boxing standards and on the foreign-based basketball
player's issue.
</P>
<P>
It is a well-known fact that Fil-Americans receive much higher
salaries, are afforded extra benefits and treated better than the
locals, thus, creating complaints from the Filipino superstars and
the marginal players as well.
</P>
<P>
The influx of Fil-Ams in Philippine basketball leagues has
caused so much uproar which prompted the Bureau of Immigration to
impose stringent rules and regulations governing their stay.
</P>
<P>
They are also now required to show irrefutable proofs of their
Filipino lineage.
</P>
<P>
Jaworski also urged concerned government agencies to be
consistent in their requirements and transparent in their
procedures.
</P>
<P>
Such consistent rules, he said, are necessary to "avoid
accusation of playing favorites and of applying double standard in
favor of imported or Fil-foreigners over local Filipinos."

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Population Resettlement Project on Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior official said that the
damming of the Three Gorges Project is running on schedule and
will be completed by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Qi Lin, director of the Yangtze Three Gorges Project
Development Corporation under the State Council, said that 190,000
Chinese civilians were resettled from damming areas by the end of
November last year. Housing has been prepared for another 80,000.
</P>
<P>
Qi said that there are 847,500 people living in the damming
area. The relocation project will involve 1.13 million people in
20 counties and prefectures by 2009 when the Three Gorges Project
is expected to be completed. By 2009, 1,600 industrial companies
and factories are expected to relocate their operations elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Funding and technology imports are being carefully monitored
by the State Council. In 1999, funds and technology imports came
to 6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Some 125,000 people, mostly farmers, will be relocated to
Sichuan Province in western China, and other provinces and cities
along the lower reaches of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River and
coastal regions, including Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Qi disclosed that in order to ensure the Three Gorges project
begins to generate electricity in 2003, the resettlement work will
be completed before the first half of 2003.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges project located near Yichang in central China'
s Hubei Province is expected to help control floods and increase
power generating capacity. The project started in 1993 and will
cost an estimated 50.09 billion yuan.

BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
has urged the defense industry to make all efforts to develop high-
tech military weapons and equipment in the new year while
improving its economic efficiency.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to today's national conference organized by the
Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National

</P>
<P>
Wu said that 2000 is a crucial year for restructuring the

In 1999, China's defense industry carried out a major reform in
its management system by reorganizing its five corporations into
ten enterprise groups, successfully launched new-type strategic
missiles and the country's first spaceship, and put more
satellites into orbit.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Seeks Closer Ties With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is desirous to revive its
relations with Syria, which has witnessed 20 years of coldness
resulting mainly from political and water disputes, reported
Turkish Daily News on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted foreign ministry officials as saying that
Turkey signalled the message during State Minister Ramazan
Mirzaoglu's four-day visit to Damascus last week. The two countries
agreed to enhance reciprocal visits to find common ground for
closer ties.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Turkey had accused Syria of sheltering outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party leader Abdullah Ocalan while Syria had
complained about the insufficient water supply from Turkey which
occupies the upper reaches of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers.
</P>
<P>
An agreement, signed between the two countries in Adana, south
Turkey, in October 1998 after Ocalan had been forced to leave
Syria, paved the way for a new era of relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that during his meeting with Syrian Prime
Minister Mahmoud Zouebi, Mirzaoglu reiterated Turkey's support on
Syria and the Palestine in their struggle against Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, Mirzaoglu made it clear that Turkey expects, in return,
Syrian support in the United Nations as Ankara is bidding to serve
as a U.N. Security Council member.
</P>
<P>
Turkey also wants Syria to support the Ankara-nominated
candidate for the secretary-general of the Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
"We repeat our request to Syria to endorse our candidate,
Ambassador Yasar Yakis, for the post of secretary-general of the
OIC. Yasar has an in-depth knowledge of Islamic culture, and he
speaks fluent Arabic," Mirzaoglu told Zouebi.
</P>
<P>
Mirzaoglu also asked the Syrian side to pay attention to the
restoration of the sites of the Ottoman Empire heritage.
</P>
<P>
According to the foreign ministry officials, the Syrian prime
minister responded positively to Mirzaoglu's remarks. Zouebi said
that Syria and Turkey are brothers and any incident which disturbs
one side disturbs the other.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the two sides will make further
efforts to increase the trade volume between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the thorny issue of water, Zouebi said that
Damascus stands for settling the dispute through peaceful means.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Industrial Output Grows 13.8 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total
manufacturing output in 1999 grew by 13.8 percent over 1998 in
real figures with the electronics, the chemical and the
engineering clusters expanding by 23.9, 15.3 and 0.7 percent
respectively, according to data released by Singapore's Economic
Development Board (EDB) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, an EDB official said at a press conference Wednesday
that electronics industry output value grew 15.3 percent in 1999
based on nominal figures at current market prices.
</P>
<P>
The data indicates that the country's manufacturing sector
eased its growth significantly in December 1999, with the year-on-
year growth rate falling to 7 percent in December from 19.4
percent in November compared to the corresponding months in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The data shows that the output of the electronics cluster
increased by 30.5 percent year-on-year in December, pushed up by
the hefty orders for mobile communications equipment as well as
the strong global demand for semiconductor and computer
peripherals, while the chemical cluster declined by 25.9 percent
in the month compared to December 1998, largely dragged down by
the 59 percent plunge in the output of pharmaceuticals and the 11.
6 percent fall in the output of petroleum segment.
</P>
<P>
It also shows that the output of the engineering cluster was 5.
8 percent higher in December than a year ago with the precision
and process engineering contributing to the increase.

KATHMANDU, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Krishna
Bhattarai has urged the country's tourism industry to initiate
innovative marketing abroad to lure more foreign tourists, The
Rising Nepal reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an annual meeting of Hotel Association Nepal (HAN)
Tuesday, Bhattarai stressed on the necessity to involve the
private sector to promote the tourism industry in the country.
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai said the government has adopted the policy of maximum
involvement of the private sector in the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
"To Help tourism industry, the government has set up
independent organizations like Nepal Tourism Board and Civil
Aviation Authority of Nepal," said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"The government has empowered both these organizations to
introduce Nepalese tourism abroad more effectively," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is the third largest foreign exchange earner for Nepal.
Although the country has sufficient infrastructures to accommodate
more than 1.2 million tourists, only some 500,000 tourists visited
Nepal in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Calls for Creating of Housing Department </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada asked lawmakers Wednesday to speed up the passage of a
bill that would create a department of housing, saying this is a
vital part of his mass housing program.
</P>
<P>
The president said in a radio interview that the creation of
the department would mobilize efficiently all resources to provide
Filipinos with decent housing.
</P>
<P>
"That is my request to them. If possible, they should fast
track the passage of the bill," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also bared the details of a financial package for
housing following the allocation of additional funds for the state-
run Home Insurance Guaranty Corp. (HIGC).
</P>
<P>
"The HIGC now has enough funds to guarantee loans for housing.
This will be attractive to private developers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Because of this development, private developers, according to
the president, are now enthusiastic about the housing program and
are willing to take risks unlike before.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said because of the importance that he attached to the
mass housing program, he created a housing commission that he
personally heads.
</P>
<P>
The president also reassured all policemen and soldiers that
they would own their own homes before the end of his term in 2004.
</P>
<P>
At present, Estrada said, the government now has 40 billion
pesos (1 billion U.S. dollars) in seed money for housing, and aims
to raise 50 billion pesos (1.25 billion dollars) more through
government financing institutions.

<HEADLINE> 700 Angolan Rebels Surrender to Govt Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Some 700 rebel soldiers have
laid down their arms since early this month and surrendered to the
Angolan government troops in the central provinces of Bie and
Malange, military sources said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This brings the total number of the repentant Angolan rebel
soldiers to over 6,300 since last September when the government
troops launched the general offensive in the central highland and
captured the former rebel military and political headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the Bie Province Paulino Dias dos Santos highly
praised the 600 repentant rebel soldiers who surrendered
themselves during the fierce battles in the cities of Camacupa and
Catabola, calling other rebels to follow their example.
</P>
<P>
The repentant rebel soldiers will be enrolled in the Armed
Forces of Angola (FAA), he said.
</P>
<P>
In the city of Cangandala in Malange Province, more than 100
other rebels have also laid down their arms and integrated
themselves into the government troops, mainly due to the
pessimistic living conditions in the battle front, military
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The government troops are currently reinforcing their sweeping
operation in the Malange Province with an aim to annihilate all
the rebel strong points.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rose in Tokyo
Wednesday, led by information and technology issues which were
boosted by Tuesday's rebound on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange climbed 215.66 points, or 1.14
percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 19,111.19.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, advanced 31.52 points or 1.93 percent to 1,
664.09.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to 547.58 million
shares from Tuesday's 584.34 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Electric was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
An overnight gain on Wall Street, particularly in the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index, made investors in Tokyo
feel good about buying back stocks, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The yen's stabilization at a relatively weak level against the
U.S. dollar was another factor boosting export-oriented technology
issues, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Information and telecom-related issues attracted active buying
from bargain hunters who were stirred into action after the issues
recently weakened to reasonable levels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, semiconductor-related issues were strong thanks to
their favorable business performances, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, gainers outnumbered

<HEADLINE> Panel Inaugurated to Reform Japan's English Education System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Education Minister
Hirofumi Nakasone inaugurated an advisory group Wednesday to
review and revise Japan's English-teaching methods in a bid to
combat the reputation of Japanese as poor English-speakers,
ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
The group, which has 22 specialists in English education, will
explore methods which would give Japanese students practical
English ability.
</P>
<P>
The panel is expected to discuss the system of recruiting and
training English teachers as well as English tests in entrance
exams for senior high schools and colleges, and will propose ways
to provide students with greater opportunity to use English in the
classroom.
</P>
<P>
The panel is scheduled to draw up proposals by the end of this
year on measures to enhance students' communicative ability.
</P>
<P>
As part of Japan's compulsory education program, students start
studying English in junior high school at age 12 and most students
continue their English studies throughout university.
</P>
<P>
Even though most Japanese students study English for 10 years
in school, many still cannot communicate effectively in English.
</P>
<P>
Japan placed 18th among Asia's 21 participating countries and
regions in the 1998-99 average score report of the Test of English
as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), indicating that Japanese still rank
among the poorest users of English in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Algeria May Attempt to Make Arms Purchase From France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Algeria will not exclude
purchasing arms from France, which froze military sales to Algeria
in 1993, Algerian Foreign Minister Youssef Yousfi said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Tribune, Yousfi said that French
arms producers don't have to worry about being "ostracized" by
Algeria when they decided to solicit arms contracts.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to talk with them without any preconditions," he
said when asked if Algiers would once again try to buy military
materials from France.
</P>
<P>
France froze its arms sale to Algiers in 1993, one year after a
civil war broke out between government forces and Islamic rebels
in the country.
</P>
<P>
But military cooperation between France and Algeria has never
ceased. France has continued to train Algerian officers,
especially those in charge of health matters, according to
official French sources.

's Younes El Aynaoui.
</P>
<P>
The second seeded Russian won 6-0, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4).
</P>
<P>
He will play either fourth seeded Nicolas Kiefer of Germany or
Swedish 12th seed Magnus Norman.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov has taken full advantage of a draw that allowed him
to advance to the semis without meeting another seeded player.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time in the tournament that I've felt the
way I wanted to," Kafelnikov said.
</P>
<P>
Until Wednesday the Russian had been out of sorts and
struggling to find his range, timing and self belief.
</P>
<P>
"Once I get through the first two matches I started to believe
in myself much more," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot easier for players to beat me in the first round,"
he added. "After that it is hard to compete with me."
</P>
<P>
His victory ended the run of success for Moroccan players at
the open.
</P>
<P>
El Aynaoui had been one of three Moroccans to make the third
round and along with countryman Hicham Arazi, one of two to reach
the quarters.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- To help National Sports
Associations (NSAs) preparing for the 2001 Southeast Asian Games
in Kuala Lumpur, the Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) has formed
a task force for the biennial event.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to have a direct hand in preparation for SEA
Games. We wanted to assure POC is in close coordination with the
NSAs as they prepare their athletes," said POC president Celso
Dayrit in Wednesday's general assembly meeting.
</P>
<P>
Cycling President Joaquin Presyler was appointed as chairman
while sepak takraw chief Maria Tantiangco and wushu president
Jimmy Ong were chosen as members of the Task Force.
</P>
<P>
Presyler said the first assignment they would make is to make
sure how many competition events will be included in the biennial
event. The SEA Games Federation meeting will be held on March 10.
</P>
<P>
Dayrit said he expected host Kuala Lumpur to include 26 to 30
events and brushed aside speculations that Malaysia would follow
the 1999 SEA Games host Brunei which reduced the number to only 20.
</P>
<P>
"I have a strong belief that Kuala Lumpur will not follow what
Brunei did because we really wanted to make enough preparation for
the next SEA Games," said Dayrit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dayrit announced that shooter George Earnshaw was
able to make appearance in Sydney Olympic Games in the ongoing
qualifying round in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
With Earnshaw's victory, the Philippines has now a total of 15
Olympic qualifiers.

is the only fictitious divine animal in Chinese mythology while
all the other 11 kinds of animals do exist in the world.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Minister: Visit Boosts Bilateral Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Canadian Minister of
Natural Resources Ralph Goodale said at a news conference here
today that his visit has successfully deepened bilateral relations
between Canada and China.
</P>
<P>
A sustainable, developing Canada-China relationship of mutual
benefit has been enhanced through bilateral talks and the numerous
seminars on various natural resources held during the current
visit, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that this positive outcome was demonstrated not
only by the improved dialogue and mutual understanding, but also
by the important governmental and business agreements signed.
</P>
<P>
He described his visit as "cordial, substantial and encouraging.
"
</P>
<P>
Goodale is visiting China as the head of a large delegation of
government officials and representatives of over 70 Canadian
companies, most of which are leaders in the natural resources
industry.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Beijing, representatives from both
governments signed memos of understanding on sustainable
development in mineral and metal, and forestry industries.
</P>
<P>
Goodale also met with Chinese Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao, and
other senior leaders.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that our Chinese colleagues will have a deeper
understanding of the extensive scope of technology, hi-tech
particularly, which Canada possesses in the field of natural
resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both nations are expected to cooperate more closely to meet the
challenge brought on by changes in the climate, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian delegation will also visit Shanghai and the
Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in east China and Yunnan province in
southwest China.

<P>
Tang pointed out that the issue of how to look at history is a
major one of principle that hinges on the political foundation of
Sino-Japanese relations. The Japanese government has repeatedly
made solemn statements and commitments on the issue of history in
bilateral political documents and on many other occasions. It has
admitted that it has committed aggression and expressed its
remorse and apology to the Chinese people for that.
</P>
<P>
"We value these statements and commitments made by the Japanese
side. But the Japanese side should not stop short of actions.
Promise should be honored and action must be taken to produce
results," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that the Japanese side should translate its
statements and commitments into concrete action and fulfil its
international obligations to the letter.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the strong demand of the Chinese side that the
Japanese government show good faith, take up its responsibility
and act resolutely to contain the under current of the rightist
elements to revive militarism and reverse the aggression Japan
launched in history, and make greater efforts to educate the young
people in Japan in history in a correct perspective.
</P>
<P>
"These are some of the actions that the Japanese government
should take to eliminate the pernicious consequences of this
incident and safeguard the political foundation of China-Japan
relations. This it the only way for Japan to win trust from its
Asian neighbors, from the vast number of peace-loving people and
from the international community," Tang pointed out.

<P>
Tang pointed out that the intensified efforts made by the
Japanese rightists to whitewash the history of aggression are not
"accidental or isolated." On the contrary, their moves have "
profound social and historical underpinnings," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Facts have proven time and again that the thoughts of
militarism are still deeply rooted in Japanese society, he said,
adding that such a reality sounds an alarm for the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"Experience from history tells us that the adverse effect of
such a force can never be underestimated," the minister warned.
</P>
<P>
Under the pretext of "freedom of speech," Tang continued, the
Japanese government permitted right-wing forces to persist in
their actions regardless of the opposition from the Chinese people
and the majority of the Japanese people.
</P>
<P>
"Could such freedom be developed to the extent that it can
randomly hurt the feelings of people in other countries, or
trample on justice and truth by the willfulness of a few people?"
he asked.
</P>
<P>
If it's true that the Japanese government has denounced the
absurd rhetoric of the right-wingers and not taken their position,
"Why does the Japanese government remain indifferent and take no
action?" Tang asked.
</P>
<P>
As long as the Japanese government continues to hold such an
attitude, the relationship between Japan and its neighboring
nations and on the improvement of its international image will be
negatively impacted, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, it will do lasting harm to the Japanese nation,"
he warned.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan police launched a
massive cordon and search operation in the north of Colombo
Wednesday in the wake of intelligence reports that several Tamil
rebel suicide bombers have infiltrated into the capital city,
police sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said police relentlessly searched several lodges
and guest houses located in the Pettah area in Colombo in the last
two weeks to track down hard-core terrorists who are believed to
have taken shelter in these places.
</P>
<P>
The rebel suicide bombers from east of the country were
involved in all the recent bomb attacks on the Colombo Town hall
premises and the Prime minister's Office, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan government is to adopt new security
regulations next month to prevent Tamil rebels' suicide bombers
from infiltrating into the capital of Colombo and other southern
towns from east and north of the country, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting a 17-year war against the
government for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the
island country.

MANILA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada assured Wednesday his support to any move to stamp out
drug trafficking as long as they are within the bounds of the law.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio program, the president stressed the need
for the entire nation to unite in the fight against drug
trafficking, instead of criticizing moves to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is in favor of any measure that would isolate
drug dealers so long as these measures fall within the bounds of
law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Estrada urged Secretary Alfredo Lim of the
Department of Interior and Local Government and Philippine
National Police (PNP) Chief Deputy Director General Panfilo Lacson
to carry on their good work in fighting the drug menace.
</P>
<P>
The president is confident that with Lim and Lacson heading the
fight against drug trafficking, the government will see a
significant decline in the number of cases of drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
"My directive to them is like a military order. Carry on the
good work, and I assure you of my full support," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Foreign Policy Would Focus on Global Order: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Foreign Minister Alhaji
Sule Lamido has said that his country's foreign policy would now
focus on the economic benefits of the emerging global order, the
New Nigerian newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The focus on Africa as the centerpiece of Nigeria's foreign
policy is no longer appropriate as the globalization has become an
instrument of influence redistribution among nations, the minister
said in capital Abuja lately.
</P>
<P>
Lamido pointed out that the thrust of Nigeria's foreign policy
is to focus its strategies for maximum manipulation of influence,
capabilities and landmass towards enhanced share of the benefits
of globalization for Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The new policy would concentrate attention on the structure,
mechanisms and institutions that allocate world resources to
international organizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister cited that these organizations include the United
Nations, the World Trade Organization, the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund, the G-7 (Group of Seven) and the
Creditors' Clubs.
</P>
<P>
Lamido stressed that only with enhanced access and influence at
these levels, can Nigeria be positioned to sustain its moral and
strategic commitments to Africa, especially for peace, security,
economic development and continent integration.
</P>
<P>
The new changes in foreign policy would facilitate rapid
industrialization and higher productivity, which would in turn
generate full employment, improve standard of living and democracy
in the most populous African country, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Nigeria could achieve this through
an organized African market, single currency and an African
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Despite the new focus, he said, Nigeria's Conflict Free African
Project would remain a key foreign policy pursuit.
</P>
<P>
"But this concern with Africa for our own strategic and moral
reasons cannot now be the dragging force of our foreign policy,"
he noted.

<HEADLINE> Burundians Agree in Principle to Launch Int'l Probe into Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Six Burundi delegations
holding consultations in Tanzania have in principle agreed to form
an international inquiry commission on the genocide in the central
African state, a Tanzanian newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed international inquiry commission would be assigned
to investigate genocide suspects and deal with amnesty issues in
the spirit of national reconciliation, the Guardian reported.
</P>
<P>
However, there is disagreement among the delegations over who
should be regarded as genocide suspects because the killings had
been taking place since 1965, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The period of investigations is another problem which caused
disagreement among the delegations representing respectively the
Bujumbura government, Burundi National Assembly, Unity for
National Progress, the Front for Democracy in Burundi, the
National Council for Defense of Democracy and the National
Convention Party.
</P>
<P>
Some delegations insisted that investigations should cover the
whole period from the day when Burundi achieved independence to
the present day. But others demanded that they should only deal
with the 1993 coup attempt in which the first democratically
elected president Melchior Ndadaye was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
Further reports said that the delegations are close to reaching
an agreement on the application of a democratic system for
parliamentary and presidential elections, although they disagree
on the future arrangement of the country's defense and security
forces.
</P>
<P>
The consultations, which started on January 18, are expected to
end Thursday.

Savimbi, Baro said on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of
founding of the Republic of India.
</P>
<P>
He said that he believes the Angolan government has the
capacity to invert the chaotic situation in a short period.
</P>
<P>
The Indian envoy expressed optimism over the future of the
civil conflict between the Angolan government troops and the rebel
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>

two nations as "excellent", saying that there exists good mutual
understanding between the two peoples.

PARIS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- France's consumption of tobacco
remained little changed in amount in 1999 as compared with the
previous year, a health organization said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The consumption of manufactured cigarettes dropped by 0.2
percent in 1999, while the consumption of self-rolled cigarettes
and cigar increased by 1.3 percent and 2.5 percent, said Sante
Contre Tabagisme (health against smoking).

high enough.

<HEADLINE> Distortion of History Intolerable: Association Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua)-- The China-Japan Friendship
Association issued a statement today, venting its "utmost
indignation" over recent anti-China activities in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The statement lashed out at a Japanese right-wing gathering in
Osaka on January 23 to deny the 1937 Nanjing Massacre, calling the
rally a "wicked action aimed at distorting historical truth,
beautifying the Japanese invasion of China, disturbing and
damaging Sino-Japanese relations."
</P>
<P>
The recent Japanese Supreme Court ruling that denied the appeal
of veteran Japanese soldier Azuma Shiro is unjustifiable and
essentially supports the right-wing extremists, according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
"The unparalleled atrocities committed by the Japanese soldiers
in Nanjing 62 years ago are a tragedy rarely seen in human history,
and the truth of these actions has been proved with an abundance
of irrefutable evidence," the statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
Any attempts to challenge the truth of the Nanjing Massacre or
to deny Japan's invasion of China will deeply wound the Chinese
people, grossly violate the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement, the
Treaty of Peace and Friendship between China and Japan, and the
China-Japan Joint Declaration, as well as damage the long-term
Sino-Japanese friendship, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
History will judge these acts as foolish and they will be duly
punished, said the statement. "We hope that the Japanese
government will learn from the past, teach the truths of history
to its citizens, take measures to stem the current trend of
denying truth, and follow the road of peaceful development."
</P>
<P>
The China-Japan Friendship Association emphasized in the
statement that it is willing to work toward the development of
bilateral friendly relations of peace together with friendly
organizations in Japan and the peace-loving Japanese people.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Lambastes Japanese Anti-China Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government and all
the Chinese people are indignant over both the actions taken by
the Japanese rightist force to distort history by denying the 1937
Nanjing Massacre and an unjust verdict from the Japanese Supreme
Court against an ex-Japanese soldier, Chinese Foreign Minister
Tang Jiangxuan said here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in a meeting with Japanese Ambassador to
China Sakutaro Tanino.
</P>
<P>
Tang described the recent anti-China rally held in Osaka as a "
perverse act" and the recent verdict of the Japanese Supreme Court
as "an oppression of justice and an open support of rightists" by
the Japanese judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Japanese right-wing forces on January 23 held a gathering in
Osaka to openly deny the 1937 Nanjing Massacre, in which more than
300,000 unarmed Chinese service men and civilians were killed.
Before the anti-China rally, the Japanese Supreme Court again
rejected the case of Azuma Shiro, an ex-soldier of the Japanese
armed forces, who witnessed the massacre and published his diary
to expose the truth of the atrocities.
</P>
<P>
Since early this month, Tang said, the Chinese Foreign Ministry,
the Chinese embassy in Japan and the Chinese Consulate in Osaka
have time and again lodged solemn complaints with the Japanese
government and the Osaka authorities on the planned anti-China
gathering. China expressed its serious concern over the move and
demanded that the Japanese side acts in the best interests of
China-Japan relations and takes resolute actions to stop the rally.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Tang, the Japanese government and the
Osaka authorities disregarded China's requests, and ultimately
triggered a "serious political situation."

<HEADLINE> IAEA Team Wraps up Nuclear Inspection in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A team of nuclear experts with
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) left Baghdad
Wednesday morning after concluding an inspection mission on Iraq's
nuclear materials.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Abu Zahra of Egypt, the IAEA team leader told reporters
before departure that they had fulfilled the mission and would
report the inspection results to the IAEA headquarters in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
Zahra had already said on Tuesday that he was satisfied with the
cooperation by Iraqi officials in his mission, but refused to talk
about any inspection results.
</P>

The IAEA inspection, which began on Saturday, is the first in
Iraq by any international agency since U.N. arms inspectors
withdrew from Iraq hours before the United Statas and Britain
launched airstrikes against Iraqi targets in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
The five-member IAEA team, which also includes two Yugoslavians,
a Mexican and a Russian, arrived here Friday with a mission to make
sure Iraq's nuclear stocks are not used for military purpose.
</P>
<P>
The inspection is part of the world-wide monitoring of nuclear
facilities by the Vienna-based U.N. agency and is not directly
related to the stormy U.N. campaign to disarm Iraq after the 1991
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
"We are here to perform routine physical inventory checking for
nuclear material," Zahra told reporters on Saturday, adding that
the inspection was part of the monitoring program imposed on all
signatories to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which Iraq
signed in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is obliged, under the terms of the 1991 Gulf cease-fire, to
dismantle its weapons of mass destruction as well as long-range
missiles.
</P>
<P>
According to the IAEA, although all weapon-usable materials have
been removed from Iraq in accordance with the U.N. resolutions
adopted after the Gulf War, Iraq still has about 1.8 tons of low-
enriched uranium as well as several tons of natural and depleted
uranium.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's cooperation with the IAEA had been smooth before the U.S.
-British air strikes against Iraq in December 1998, which triggered
the suspension of the U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq, of which
IAEA was in charge of nuclear file.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the U.N. Security Council in October 1998, the
IAEA declared that Iraq no longer had the ability to produce
nuclear weapons, but said Baghdad still had to answer questions
about its past atomic program.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council last December adopted resolution 1284
requiring Iraq to allow a new arms control body to return to the
country in exchange for possible suspension of the sanctions
imposed on Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The resolution has yet to be implemented amid rejection from
Iraq and differences within the Security Council over choosing the
head of the new arms watchdog, called UNMOVIC, or the U.N.
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission.

<P>
ANKARA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, who will depart on
Thursday for the World Economic Forum at Davos of Swiss, expects to
persuade foreign businessmen to invest in Turkey, especially in its
energy and transportation projects.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- For the third time in two and a half months, revolt broke out
on Tuesday again in Turkish Metris Prison, where many members of
the extremist Islamic Great East Raiders Front (IBDA-C) are locked
up.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the revolt was once again the attempt to transfer
Salih Mirzabeyolu, leader of the radical Islamist group, to another
prison.
</P>
<P>
This time, however, the revolt failed to achieve its aim and
Mirzabeyolu was finally removed from Metris in an operation in
which seven inmates were wounded and 21 were taken in for
interrogation.

whole Europe.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Observe Gallstone Formation for First Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli researchers have
observed for the first time the formation of gallstones in their
initial stages, an achievement which could lead to earlier
diagnosis of the common digestive disease, a local daily reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A joint research team at Technion, or the Israeli Institute of
Technology, and Tel Aviv University, used two complementary state-
of-the-art microscopy systems to observe how gallstones are formed,
the Jerusalem Post newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
This observation can help doctors learn how to inhibit the
formation of gallstones through medication and dietary changes,
thus eliminating the need for invasive treatment, the paper quoted
one of the researchers, Prof. Yeshayahu Talmon at the Technion, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Gallstones, one of the commonest and most expensive digestive
diseases, are formed when microscopic particles of cholesterol are
precipitated in the gallbladder from bile. Left untreated,
gallstones can cause acute pancreatitis, cholangitis and liver
damage.
</P>
<P>
It's estimated that half a million people in the U.S. alone,
mostly women, will have their gallbladders surgically removed this
year simply because of gallstones, making it the commonest surgical
procedure in that country.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the latest finding may produce strategies that
could prevent or reverse cholesterol gallstone formation from the
beginning through medication and dietary change.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore electronics
industry's output value grew 15.3 percent in 1999, an official
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing a press conference on the industry's performance in
1999 and its outlook in 2000, Barry Sim, director of the
Electronics Division of the Economic Development Board of
Singapore, said that his country's electronics industry registered
an output of 70.1 billion Singapore dollars (about 48 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1999, up 15 percent over the 1998 output of 60.8
billion Singapore dollars (about 36.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sim said that in 1999, most sub-clusters of the industry
recorded a positive growth with the infocoms products and semi-
conductor sub-clusters surging up by 37.8 and 24.6 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Sim predicted that his country's electronics cluster will
experience a strong growth in 2000 as continued strong regional
and worldwide demand for electronics products following the
recovery from the Asian crisis will give a hefty boosting to the
industry.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Gets $9.6M War Reparations From Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has since October
1998 paid Tanzania 9.6 million U.S. dollars as compensation for
the costs in the war against former Ugandan dictator Iddi Amin's
invasion in 1978/79, Tanzanian media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The money had been disbursed to the Tanzanian ministries of
defense and national service, and foreign affairs and
international cooperation, Deputy Finance Minister Crispin Hauli
told the National Assembly (parliament) in session in the central
city of Dodoma Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under an bilateral agreement reached in September 1998, the
Ugandan government has to pay 123.2 million dollars as
compensation for Tanzania's loss of property and lives in the war,
the deputy minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Out of the amount, 64.39 million dollars has already been
verified and the remaining 58.8 million dollars is still being
verified, Hauli told parliament.
</P>
<P>
He also said that his government would look into the
possibility of compensating victims in the regions where the war
against Amin was fought.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, with over 100,000 Ugandan citizens executed and
diplomatic ties cut with every nation in the world, Amin moved on
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan soldiers occupied a 700-square-mile section of Tanzania
for two months, torturing Tanzanian citizens and slaughtering
livestock.
</P>
<P>
A toppled Amin was given refuge by the Saudis, who are thought
to have limited his movements to the isolated holy city of Mecca.

BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China's first comprehensive web
site for E-commerce opened here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The "TOe.com" gateway web site, funded by an investment company

<HEADLINE> China Speeds Up Development of New Energy Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China is taking pains to
develop various new and renewable energy sources focusing on
hydropower, solar, wind, geothermal and tidal sources, hoping to
make up for the declining production of traditional energy sources.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Energy Research Society (CERS), China is
rich in new and renewable energy sources. Statistics shows that
China has recoverable wind energy sources of 160 million kw,
geothermal sources of 3.5 million kw and tidal energy sources of
more than 20 million kw.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country's vast rural areas have nearly 300
million tons of biological materials for developing methane gas.
</P>
<P>
To date, China's annual use of new and renewable energy has
reached 300 million tons of standard coal.
</P>
<P>
Over 200,000 mini and small wind generators have been installed
in households in the mountain areas, remote pastoral areas and
islands. And China has imported medium and large wind generators
from Denmark, the Netherlands, and the USA to equip over 20 wind
power plants.
</P>
<P>
According to the CERS experts, more than 50,000 small-hydro
power stations have been set up nationwide. Some 75 percent of the
rural households in China have installed coal-saving stoves, with
annual bio-gas production topping 1.5 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
China is also rich in tidal energy, with 90 percent of the
source located in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces. So far, a dozen
tidal power stations have emerged nationwide with total installed
capacity of 20,000 kw.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States is concerned that momentum on the Israeli-
Syrian peace track may be lost, a government official said Tuesday
after first Damascus and then Jerusalem canceled their negotiators'
trips to Washington.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton had hoped the separate U.S.-Israeli
and U.S.-Syrian technical consultations on the U.S. working paper
would serve at last to keep the process "warm" until Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh
decided to reopen the next round of talks.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- While the Israeli-Syrian talks floundered Tuesday, reports
surfaced that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat presented the
principal points of its final-status plan to U.S. President Bill
Clinton during Arafat's Washington travel last week.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also asked the Americans to supply a draft peace
agreement akin to what they presented to the Israeli and Syrian
delegations at Shepherdstown, West Virginia earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The report by Israeli State Comptroller Eliezer Goldberg on
the financing of the last Knesset (parliament) and prime
ministerial election campaigns will be released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report will include former Supreme Court president's
findings on those non-profit associations, which worked for Ehud
Barak during the elections.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- An Israeli soldier, 24-year-old Staff Sergeant Rafeal
Zangwill, was killed Tuesday morning when a Hezbollah anti-tank
missile scored a direct hit on the Israel Defense Forces' Rotem
outpost in the western sector of the security zone in South
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He was the first soldier killed in action in Lebanon in nearly
six months.

<HEADLINE> India Celebrates Republic Day Amid Tight Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW Delhi, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A grand military parade was
held here on Wednesday amid tight security to celebrate the 51st
anniversary of the founding of the Republic of India.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, who arrived here on
Monday for a five-day state visit, was present at the ceremony as
a chief guest of the Indian government together with Indian
President Kocheril Raman Narayanan and Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people lined up on both sides of the street near
the presidential palace in central Delhi to witness the spectacle,
which featured for the first time the elite paratroopers, marine
and para commandos, and Agni-II, a long-range missile developed by
India.
</P>
<P>
Students and cultural workers took this occasion to perform a
variety of cultural heritage while government institutions showed
their advancement in nearly every field of the Indian economy.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the nation on the eve of the Republic Day,
the day on which India's first constitution came into force on
January 26, 1950, President Narayanan said that the fury of
patient and long-suffering poor people would be unleashed if
economic reforms and globalization did not provide equality of
status and opportunity to them.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that that the so-called "three-way fast lane of
liberalization, privatization and globalization must provide safe
pedestrian crossing for the unempowered Indians" so as to move
towards equality of status and opportunity among Indians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he regretted that even 50 years after becoming a
republic, justice -- social, economic, and political -- remains an
unrealized dream for millions of Indians and benefits of economic
reforms are yet to reach them.

<HEADLINE> Norwegians Help Remove 357,250 Mines in Angola in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The People's Aid of Norway
(APN), a Norwegian non-government organization, has helped defuse
and remove 357,250 mines in Angola in 1999, the official Jornal de
Angola newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The mines, mostly anti-tank and anti-personnel, were removed in
the south and central provinces of Huila, Cunene, Cuando Cubango,
Benguela and Malange, APN sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In these provinces, the APN sappers have also found 67,865
other mines still to be defused in an area of some 950,000 square
meters, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that some 11 million mines have been laid in
the Angolan territory during the over-25-year civil conflict,
killing innumerable civilians and leaving 150,000 handicapped.
</P>
<P>
The renewed civil war between the government troops and the
UNITA rebels led by Jonas Savimbi in late 1998 has hindered the
implementation of programs of mine-clearance launched by the
Angolan government and the non- governmental organizations (NGOs).
</P>
<P>
All the government's mine-clearing activities in the southern
African country had been paralyzed and 18 sapper teams had been
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
However, with the military development in the central
highlands, the government restarted its mine-clearance program
while the NGOs began expanding their activities to the central,
east and south regions of the country, most of which were recently
liberated by the government troops.

<HEADLINE> Merchants Bank to Build Branch in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China Merchants Bank has been
approved by the People's Bank of China, the central bank, to build
a branch in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Ma Weihua, governor of Merchants Bank, said they have also been
making plans to set up branches in other major world financial
centers.
</P>
<P>
Establishment of overseas branches is aimed to speed up the
pace of internationalization of Merchants Bank, said Ma, adding
his bank would send 50 workers abroad to work or receive training.
</P>
<P>
Ma said he believed that China's accession into the World Trade
Organization will give China Merchants Bank good opportunities for
expanding reform and development -- and will also create
challenges. To counter them, the bank has studied ways to list
companies, issue financial bonds, and accelerate computerization
in business operations.
</P>
<P>
With headquarters in Shenzhen, Merchants Bank is a national
joint-stock commercial bank. By the end of 1999, the bank's
assets totaled 180.3 billion yuan, total deposit savings climbed
to 132.08 billion yuan, and the outstanding volume of loans
reached 91.6 billion yuan.

trillion yuan at the end of 1999, an increase of 226.3 billion
yuan from that of the year's beginning.
</P>
<P>
He said that CCB extended more than 1.15 trillion yuan in loans
from January through December of last year, in response to the
central government policy to increase domestic spending and
support the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, housing loans to individuals amounted
to 58.4 billion yuan, up 33.5 billion yuan from the beginning of
the year, and consumer loans used to support sales of automobiles
amounted to 2.12 billion yuan, up 1.95 billion yuan from the year'
s beginning.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that with regard to international businesses, the
bank gave priority to developing businesses related to
international settlement of accounts for Chinese export companies.
He said that the bank still plays a leading role in the country's
merchant banking services.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the bank generated two billion yuan of business income
from intermediary banking services, and the total number of Dragon
Credit Card users rose 58 percent to reach 49.2 million.
</P>
<P>
The total transaction value of the credit cards hit 285.6
billion yuan in 1999, up 26 percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China Construction Bank (CCB)
has decided to invest more in housing loans to support China's
ongoing housing reform, CCB announced today.
</P>
<P>
The bank has so far provided 244 billion yuan in loans for real
estate projects, 20.19 percent of the total amount of its loans,
up from 17.46 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Specializing in long- and medium-term credit business, the CCB
began its real estate business more than ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
Along with advancing China's housing reform, the CCB has
extended its business sphere to personal credit and housing
consumer loans.
</P>
<P>
The CCB extended a total of 58.35 billion yuan in housing loans

<HEADLINE> La Nina Blamed for Bitter Cold in Northern China: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese meteorologist said
today that the La Nina phenomenon is the culprit behind the past
two months of bitter cold in northern China.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Zhenguo, a meteorologist with China's National Climate
Center, said northern China has been blasted three times since mid-
December by strong cold air currents from Siberia, bringing about
sub-zero temperatures as low as minus-14 degrees centigrade and
rarely seen snow.
</P>
<P>
He said the current La Nina occurrence started in the fall of
1998, when the warm waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean turned
cold, triggering atmospheric abnormalities in Asia and frequent
cold currents from Siberia, where a cold air mass broke up and
moved south.
</P>
<P>
The cold winds met with warm, wet southeasterly currents in
northern China, resulting in an abrupt drop in temperature, snow
in the north, and rain in the south.

<P>
He said the cold weather is out of the ordinary for many
northerners, as they have experienced 13 consecutive warm winters.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said it is still too early to say whether the warmer
winter cycle, which began in 1986 due to global warming, has ended.
</P>
<P>
"You have to take into consideration the entire three months of
the winter season, beginning from December, when determining
whether the average daily air temperature is abnormal or not," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Climatic changes in China in the past century have shown that
both warm and cold winter cycles last for roughly 30 years, Zhao
said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Appoints New Supreme Court Chief Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Wednesday appointed
a new Supreme Court Chief Justice after the former chief justice
refused to take oath under the Provisional Constitutional Order (
PCO) enforced by the military government.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan President Rafiq Tarar administered the oath of the new
chief justice, Irshad Hasan Khan, and six other judges of the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
However, six out of the 13 judges of the apex court, including
the former chief justice, Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui, had refused to
take oath under the PCO.
</P>
<P>
In an overnight major development, the administration of Chief
Executive General Pervez Musharraf announced that all judges of
the Supreme Court, Federal Shariat Court and High Courts in the
provinces will take new oath under the PCO.
</P>
<P>
The PCO, announced after the army suspended the constitution,
is considered a move by the military government to seek the
legality of the coup that took place last October.
</P>
<P>
The PCO says: "Notwithstanding the abeyance of the provisions
of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan ...
Pakistan shall subject to this Order and any other orders made by
the Chief Executive, be governed, as nearly as may be, in
accordance with the Constitution."
</P>
<P>
General Musharraf, who attended the oath taking ceremony on
Wednesday morning along with federal ministers and other senior
officials, said the decision to administer oath to the judges
under the PCO was taken in the best national interest.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever has happened is in the interests of the country," he
said in brief comments to the state-run Associated Press of
Pakistan after the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question on the refusal of swearing in of six
judges, he said he reserved further comments on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Manila Sees Fish Self-sufficiency by 2004 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Agriculture Secretary
Edgardo Angara projected Wednesday that the country would be self-
sufficient and in fact would have a surplus in fish in four years,
at least by the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
Angara said in a statement that for the year 2000 alone, the
fishery production target throughout the country is 3 million
metric tons which would be a big leap from the 2.8 million metric
tons last year.
</P>
<P>
For the past seven years, the average yearly fish production
was 2.7 million metric tons. But for the first time last year,
production was up by more than 100,000 metric tons, he said.
</P>
<P>
Angara tasked the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources to
help spur fish production throughout the country not only in
municipal and commercial fishing but also in aquaculture.
</P>
<P>
Fish is the country's number one source of protein. In the
drive towards fish self-sufficiency, the government is pushing to
the maximum the production of milk fish and tilapia which are
considered as the Filipinos' staple fish today, he said.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Attorney General Sacked for Trying to Arrest Opposition Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibari government
has replaced its Attorney General Ali Mohamed Omar hours after he
issued a warrant for arresting 10 opposition leaders, media here
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Hafidh Ally said in a statement that Omar
has been replaced by Judge Saleh Abdalla Damoha.
</P>
<P>
The statement, broadcasted late Tuesday by the official
Zanzibar radio Sauti ya Tanzania Zanzibar, gave no reason for the
sudden change.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came hours after Omar issued a new warrant for
the arrest of 10 leaders of the main opposition party, the Civic
United Front (CUF), on the eve of the second hearing of a treason
trial.
</P>
<P>
CUF Secretary General Seif Shariff Hamad and Vice Chairman
Shaaban Mloo as well as eight other top party leaders are involved
in the treason case.
</P>
<P>
Omar intended to join them on a list of 18 CUF members accused
of treason charges, stressing that the hearing of the treason case
could not start unless they were arrested.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the arrest of the opposition leaders was
necessary on grounds that they masterminded the plot to overthrow
the Zanzibari government and remove President Salmin Amour from
power.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen suspects including four members of the Zanzibari House
of Representatives were arrested in November 1997 on allegations
of conspiring to topple the Zanzibari president and the
revolutionary government. But these suspects have been pleading
not guilty to the treason charges.
</P>
<P>
The first hearing of the case was held last Wednesday which saw
fierce clashes between police and rioters, with at least 29 people
including 14 policemen injured and hospitalized and some 40 other
people arrested.
</P>
<P>
The second hearing of the treason case is expected to be held
Thursday under a Nigerian judge, Gariba Tumaka, recently picked by
the Zanzibari High Court.

LUSAKA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- There is no specific framework
required for governments to go by when drawing up their poverty
reduction strategies, an International Monetary Fund (IMF)
official has said.
</P>
<P>
IMF resident representative in Zambia, Kenneth Meyers, said in
Lusaka Tuesday that the fund has not required governments to
follow any laid down procedures in drawing up their strategies
because all countries have different needs regarding poverty
levels and required economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The IMF will not be involved in developing the strategies to be
used in implementing poverty reduction and growth facility as this
will have to be done by respective governments in consultation
with civil society and cooperating partners, media here Wednesday
quoted Meyers as saying.

<P>
KAMPALA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
allocated 31 percent of the national budget to the education
sector to produce qualified manpower, the New Vision daily
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the government considers education one of its
top priorities crucial for the development of the east African
country, acting Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Education
and Sports, Pius Bigirimana, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Education is the cornerstone and a condition for national
survival and prosperity, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Bigirimana said that 61 percent of the fund is put aside for
the primary education under the program of Universal Primary
Education (UPE).
</P>
<P>
Uganda launched the UPE program in January 1997. Primary
school enrolment has now reached 6.5 million pupils, twice that of

<HEADLINE> WTO Entry to Bring Fundamental Changes to China: People's Daily (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO) will give a powerful push to the country'
s economic restructuring and its plan for building a socialist
market economy, the People's Daily says in a front-page article
today.
</P>
<P>
China's bid to enter the WTO is an important step taken to
further reform and opening up to the outside world in the face of
economic globalization, says the signed article, entitled "March
to the Outside for the Revitalization of China".
</P>
<P>
By joining the WTO, China will get more development
opportunities on the international economic stage, have a more
influential role in making trade rules and handling trade disputes,
and receive relatively more fair treatment.
</P>
<P>
These positive outcomes, the article says, show that China's
entry into the WTO proves the wisdom of Deng Xiaoping's words
that "development is the final choice."
</P>
<P>
China has basically established a framework for a socialist
market economy after 21 years of reform. But the country still has
a long way to go to complete the growth process.
</P>
<P>
"China's entry into the WTO will be a big push in the further
restructuring of China's economy and in the building of a
socialist market economy," says the article.

<HEADLINE> WTO Entry to Bring Fundamental Changes to China: People's Daily (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's WTO membership will ultimately lead to the breakup of
regional protectionism and the monopoly in certain industries, and
result in the formation of a market system that is unified, open
and competitive, says the article.
</P>
<P>
"The WTO membership will accelerate the process of building a
market economy, and help the country make full use of the market
system," it says.
</P>
<P>
In addition, WTO membership will give China better access to
the international market, and Chinese companies will have more
chances to strike investment and trade deals overseas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as China cuts its tariffs, grants more market access
and non-discriminative treatment to overseas businesses, as it has
promised, China's companies will have to improve themselves to
survive the imminent global competition, the article says.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it says, during this transformation process, the
government will have to adapt its management style to better
accommodate the expanding market economy.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the government will have to change its current
management approach, and make decisions in a more scientific,
democratic and systematic way. Relevant laws will also be refined.
</P>
<P>
But, the article says, the WTO entry will inevitably bring some
negatives; some industries will feel pressure, particularly those
low-level, capital-intensive and technology-intensive sectors.
</P>
<P>
"To maintain the political and economic independence and to
safeguard the economic safety of our country, we must strengthen
our comprehensive national power and improve the competitiveness
of China's industries," it says.

<HEADLINE> Training Programs Benefit 300,000 Filipino Workers in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Over 300,000 Filipino workers,
mostly displaced employees, benefited in 1999 from the government'
s skills training programs and other efforts, the Presidential
Palace said Wednesday in a report.
</P>
<P>
The report prepared by the Presidential Management Staff (PMS)
showed that of this number, 8,069 were trained in entrepreneurship
development while another 193,073 workers were assisted in setting
up various livelihood projects.
</P>
<P>
A total of 128,944 graduates were also trained in various
vocational and technical skills as of September 1999, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
"We effectively implemented a set of interventions to
effectively support the critical adjustments needed by labor and
management in respond to the challenges of trade liberalization
and globalization," the PMS said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, "we shifted our focus on training to enhance
employability with priority given to displaced workers and their
families," the PMS stated.
</P>
<P>
The government, according to the report, also shifted its focus
to the countryside to assist workers displaced by the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
These efforts benefited 15,568 farmers and fisherfolk as of
September last year through training programs in entrepreneurship,
agro-development and livelihood courses.
</P>
<P>
The government also placed priority on enhancing the skills of
Filipino sea-based workers to make them more globally competitive
and maintain the country's position in the world as the number one
supplier of skilled seafarers.
</P>
<P>
Since July 1998, a total of 16,113 maritime officers have
benefited from the training programs and upgrading courses
provided by the government, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government said earlier it aims to bring down
the country's unemployment from the present level of 3.14 million
people to 2.8 million people in the next five years.

NAIROBI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Sixty Kenyan women died as a
result of domestic violence in 1998/99, according to a study
conducted by the Kenyan Federation of Women Lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Kenya was lagging behind in reforming laws affecting women,
which has given room for increased violence against women, said
Martha Koome, chairperson of the federation.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the federation is working on drafting laws to curb
the menace against women, Koome was quoted as saying by
Wednesday's East African Standard.
</P>
<P>
Plans are underway to establish a center to house victims of
domestic violence, she noted.
</P>
<P>
"This step will ensure the victims do not go back home to their
husbands who vent more anger on them, causing injuries and even
deaths," she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Koome said that the Equality Act which her
federation had presented to Parliament has gone through.
</P>
<P>
The act outlaws discrimination against women and calls for
equal distribution of services among men and women, she added.

<P>
KAMPALA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni is scheduled to give a talk on the talk-show program of

involvement in the conflict of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Minister for Presidency Ruhakana Rugunda confirmed this

</P>
<P>
Museveni is currently in New York attending a special session

DRC President Laurent Kabila has been accusing Uganda of
backing the DRC rebels and invading his country, a charge roundly
denied by Kampala.

Meanwhile, Rugunda confirmed that President Museveni may also
talk on CNN about the coming referendum on political system in the
east African country and about other things, though the main topic
is about the DRC issue.

TOKYO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Japan's trade surplus in 1999
dipped 11.7 percent from a year earlier to 12,352.7 billion yen (
about 108 billion U.S. dollars) for the first decline in three

<HEADLINE> No-Risk for China's Pro-Active Fiscal Policy: Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Adhering to a pro-active fiscal
policy in the next one or two years will not bring about any
financial risks for China, Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng
said here today.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference sponsored by the Information Office
of the State Council this morning that considering the size of the
budget deficit and government debt, continuing to adopt a pro-
active fiscal policy within rational limits and issuing a certain
amount of treasury bonds every year will not cause financial risks.
</P>
<P>
"This year's budget deficit will not increase remarkably from
that of last year. It may even be smaller than that of last year,
but is unlikely to be much smaller," he said.
</P>
<P>
Xiang said that the Ministry of Finance will begin to reform
the compilation of the central government's budget this year, and
for the first time in history, the interest expenditures of
foreign and domestic debts will be included in the budget for this
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that though the tens of billions of yuan of interest
spending will bloat the budget deficit, this does not necessarily
mean that the government is borrowing more.
</P>
<P>
Xiang pointed out that the Chinese government saw a record
growth of fiscal revenue in 1999, and will continue to carry out a
pro-active fiscal policy this year to offset the impact of
inadequate domestic demand and international factors.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance will also modify the compilation of and
more details to the central budget this year. It will also pioneer
sectional budgets in four ministries, including the Ministry of
Education, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry of
Labor and Social Security, and the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The budgets of these four ministries will be handed to the
National People's Congress for the record along with the general
budget of the central government.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the proportion of the Chinese government's fiscal
revenue in the gross domestic product (GDP) rose to around 13
percent from 12.4 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Also last year, the central government's expenditures on
education increased by over 20 percent from 1998, while
expenditures for scientific undertakings, infrastructure
construction, and social security, increased by 14 percent, 70
percent, and 170 percent, respectively.

<HEADLINE> China Steps Up Hydropower Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China will add an annual
installed hydropower capacity of 5 million kw, on average, between
2000 and 2010, to usher in a booming decade of hydropower
development.
</P>
<P>
According to the country's hydropower development plan, the
country will develop a total hydropower capacity of 70 million kw
by the end of this year, and by 2010 the figure will rise to 125
million kw, or 33.1 percent of the country's exploitable
hydropower resources.
</P>
<P>
China is among the countries in the world that have the richest
hydropower resources, with exploitable water energy resources
estimated at 376 million kw, said a senior official with the China
State Power Corporation (CSPC).
</P>
<P>
However, much still needs to be done to exploit these enormous
hydropower resources, he said, adding that the country's total
hydropower generating capacity accounts for only 13.8 percent of
the exploitable potential, a figure lower than the world's average.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that China has made remarkable achievements
in developing its hydropower industry since the founding of New
China in 1949, particularly since the launching of the reform and
opening-up drive in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The total generating capacity and the annual electricity output
have risen from 163,000 kw and 710 million kwh in 1949 to the
present 52.17 million kw and 186.8 billion kwh, respectively. As a
result, China now ranks third in the world in hydropower
generating capacity and production.

<HEADLINE> China Earmarks Funds For Basic Science Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China has earmarked a total of
230 million yuan (27.7 million US dollars) over the past four
years to train people in the basic sciences, according to the
State Natural Science Fund Committee (SNSFC).
</P>
<P>
The funds were used to train those majoring in 83 basic
sciences, six special subjects, and six key science projects at 39
universities across China, said Wang Naiyan, vice director of
SNSFC.
</P>
<P>
The teaching conditions and laboratory facilities were greatly
improved at the funded universities, and money to purchase books
for the universities was ensured.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of outstanding students now want to study
in fields supported by these funds, and several undergraduates
have published papers in academic journals included in the Science
Citation Index (SCI) with the help of the funds.
</P>
<P>
China established the state foundation for training basic
science talent in 1996, and part of the plan is the offer of 300
million yuan from 1996 to 2000 to train students in these fields.
</P>
<P>
Over 91 percent of the funds were used to set up training bases
in the fields of agriculture, medicine, and other sciences, with a
smaller proportion of the funds supporting talent in key science
projects, according to Wang.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand, US to Measure Mountain Growth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Researchers from New Zealand
and the United States are using highly accurate global positioning
system(GPS) equipment to measure how fast the Southern Alps on New
Zealand's South Island are growing in height.
</P>
<P>
A press release of the New Zealand Institute of Geological and
Nuclear Sciences (GNS) said Wednesday that the five-year project,
which gets under way this weekend, is aimed at understanding how
mountains grow and how the Earth's crust is deforming under the
Alps, which mark the boundary of the Australian and Pacific
tectonic plates.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time anywhere in the world that
researchers have attempted to systematically measure the present-
day uplift rate across a major mountain range. The uplift rate of
the Southern Alps,deduced through geological methods, is thought
to be as high as 10 millimeters a year. Researchers want to put
that estimate to the test and
find out the variation in uplift rates from one side of the
mountain range to the other.
</P>
<P>
Over the next two weeks, the researchers will install four
permanent GPS receivers atop rocky Southern Alps peaks that are
not vulnerable to erosion. They will be working near the Copland
Valley,in the Mt. Cook region. The solar-powered receivers will be
able to detect height changes as small as 1 millimeter a year.
</P>
<P>
The instruments will take readings every 30 seconds and send
the data via radio and the Internet to Wellington for analysis by
the New Zealand and U.S. researchers.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Cartoons Urge Birth Control (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This tradition has caused the Chinese population to grow from
60 million in the first century A.D. to the nearly 1.3 billion at
present, and caused conflicts between man and nature, and hindered
economic development while depicting resources.
</P>
<P>
A birth control policy was thus introduced in the 1970s which
demands that an urban family have only one child, and a rural
family two at the maximum.
</P>
<P>
Publicity, which is essential for successful birth control,
worked well in the urban areas but usually failed in the
countryside, where people have a low level of education and are
more conservative, according to Shi Hailong, an official with the
State Family Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that he was "delighted" by the cartoons in Henan
Province, and that tedious publicity should be replaced by more
vivid images, such as cartoons, short plays, and story-telling
that are more suited to farmers.
</P>
<P>
These new methods seem to be working.
</P>
<P>
"If I had had only one son, I could have built the most
gorgeous house in the village," said 63-year old Zhao Xinghong, a
farmer in Beiguodong village.
</P>
<P>
Zhao grasped a brush in his hands which are used to holding a
hoe to paint on a wall. "My fifth son is to get married" is what
Zhao painted.
</P>
<P>
The picture, although clumsy in technique, distinctly depicts
the situation in which Zhao must live in a hutch in order to save
every penny for his youngest son's marriage.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that he drew the picture to encourage fellow
villagers not to make the same mistake.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 9,000 farm couples in the village have decided to have
only one child and have received one-child certificates from the
birth control committee.
</P>
<P>
Over 300 million people would have been added to the nearly 1.3
billion in China in the last three decades if not for the
implementation of the birth control policy. And the world's Day of
Six Billion would have come four years earlier.
</P>
<P>
"Cartoons help make fewer babies -- Chinese wisdom!" said Shi.
"And it is worth trying nationwide."

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Want to find a theme park
whose theme is birth control? Welcome to China's countryside.
</P>
<P>
The most eye-catching scene in Beiguodong Village these days
may be a one-kilometer stretch of street lined with beautiful and
humorous cartoon pictures, all trying to persuade people to have
fewer children.
</P>
<P>
The cartoons depict cocks and hens ardently discussing how many
eggs they should lay. Their decision: the fewer the better --
considering the explosion of the poultry population.
</P>
<P>
And there are more monks, as more and more men rush to temples
after failing to find girlfriends -- a result of the imbalance
between the number of men and women in China.
</P>
<P>
Beiguodong Village in Wuzhi in central China is not unique, as
at least 200 villages in this county in China's most populous
province of Henan have turned themselves into cartoon central, and
some 12,000 pictures have been drawn by farmers with the help of
family planning officials. The cartoon streets have become an open
cafe for the farmers and the cartoons are frequently the topic of
after-dinner conversation.
</P>
<P>
No one remembers who first came up with this idea, but
according to Li Hongkui, a fine-arts teacher at a village middle
school, "cartoons make a heavy topic lighter."
</P>
<P>
She was invited to create cartoons telling villagers how to
practice birth control, how to keep their reproductive organs
healthy, and how to give birth to a healthy baby.
</P>
<P>
"These topics used to be very private and people were just too
embarrassed to discuss them," said Li, surprised by the changes
going on in the villages today, where life is still much more old-
fashioned than in the cities. But cartoons can be accepted by
nearly everyone.
</P>
<P>
Li's works have titles like "Planting more trees and bearing
fewer babies," and "The god of land brings a lawsuit against a
farmer who has too many children." The language is symbolic, but
can be understood by the farmers, many of whom are illiterate, Li
explained.
</P>
<P>
For thousands of years, the most awful curse in China was for a
man to die without sons. As one old Chinese saying puts it, "One
will have more happiness and fortune if one has more children than
others." People wanted more sons because they could rely on them
in old age, and males were needed for labor in the fields, where
almost all farming was done manually.

<HEADLINE> China's Ancient Arcadia Turns into Boomtown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- An ancient, prestigious
arcadia named "Peach Blossom Garden" by the great Chinese writer
Tao Yuanming 1,700 years ago has retained most of its charms and
is attracting tourists to central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
This spot is at the gateway to the rolling mountains in western
part of the Hunan Province, hemmed in by rivers, elegant hills and
beautiful peach blossoms in season, which was a tourist
destination as early as in Song Dynasty some 963 years ago.
</P>
<P>
But when the poet Tao ventured to a nearby reclusive village,
he was considered an alien to local people who knew nothing about
the outside world and lived simple, quiet but harmonious lives.
Even so, Tao was received with hospitality, and he later depicted
the scene there in comely words which became one of China's most
famous prose pieces.
</P>
<P>
Peach Blossom Town remains tranquil most of the year, but in
the springtime it turns into a bustling tourist center greeting
some 400,000 visitors each year who come to appreciate the peach
blossoms scattered hundreds of hectares.
</P>
<P>
Covering more than 4,400 sq km, the county-level city boasts
the highest per-capita arable land acreage in Hunan and is
populated by locals of Hui, Tujia and Miao and 10 other ethnic
minority groups in addition to the majority Han people.
</P>
<P>
To preserve this pristine treasure better still, the city only
approves environmentally-friendly industries in this scenery
region.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Skilled and unskilled Sri
Lankan male workers will get an enhanced opportunity to secure a
large number of jobs in Malaysia during the first half of this
year, press reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Private job agencies have informed the Sri Lanka Bureau of
Foreign Employment (SLBFE), which is the official job supplier,
about the availability of such employment, said the official Daily
News.
</P>
<P>
All job orders will be channeled by private agencies through
the bureau, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The availability of employment opportunities in Malaysia for
Sri Lankans had been negotiated by Labor Minister John Seneviratne
on his visit to Malaysia last October.
</P>
<P>
Most of the employment available for Sri Lankans is in the
plantation sector.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the SLBFE Jayantha Liyanage said a number of
welfare facilities for the workers had been provided and these
included free air tickets.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, family members of workers are provided with free
medical facilities and priority is given to them when applying for
loans from state banks.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1.2 million Sri Lankans working abroad, 80
percent of them female as housemaids. Overseas remittances have
been a major source of revenue which helps sustain the country's
economy.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Tighten Security Against Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is to adopt new
security regulations next month to prevent Tamil rebels' suicide
bombers from infiltrating into the capital of Colombo and other
southern towns from Eastern Province, police sources said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Securities authorities decided at a recent meeting to enforce
the new security measures from February 15, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, an application with a recent
photograph should be made a fortnight before the scheduled date of
travel by residents in Eastern Province to go to other parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations follow investigations which reveal that
almost all Tamil rebels involved in bomb attacks come from
Batticalao in Eastern Province.
</P>
<P>
Suicide bomb attacks have been the trademark of Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels who are fighting for a
separate homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and
east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said the suicide bombers and others from
Batticaloa were involved in all the recent bomb attacks on the
Colombo Town Hall premises, the Prime Minister's Office, the Joint
Operations Command, the Maradana city center and the historic
Temple of the Tooth in Kandy.
</P>
<P>
Even small explosions of transformers, telecom cabinets and
exchanges had been carried out by youths from Porathiu in
Batticalao, the sources said, adding that those youths had
infiltrated the south as jewelry craftsmen.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia's Birth Rate Drops Drastically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The birth rate in Yugoslavia
has dipped drastically to half of that in the 1950s, figures
released Tuesday by the country's statistics bureau show.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the birth rate was 12.4 per thousand in the country,
down 1.71 percentage points from 29.5 per thousand in 1950.
</P>
<P>
These low-birth rate areas are characterized by increasing
aging and high mortality rate, the bureau said, predicting that
the trend is to continue in the following 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The bureau noted that the country's population growth peaked in
the 1950s, during which number of Yugoslav people jumped 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
It went down by 7 percent during the 1980s and by 67 percent
from 1990 to 1997, mainly due to a sharp drop in the birth rate
and steep rise in death rate.

<HEADLINE> More Treasury Bonds Pose no Danger to Economy: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The issue of a certain amount
of treasury bonds each year would pose no danger to the Chinese
economy, Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng said here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks at a press conference sponsored
by the Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
He said his judgment was based on the current scale of the
central government's deficit and balance of the treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
For a foreseeable period, the minister said, a pro-active
fiscal policy would remain an important part of the macro-economy
policy of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
It is only through such a policy that the government's goal of
accelerating the adjustment of the economic structure, the
construction of infrastructure and the development of the western
regions would be realized, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the pro-active policy must be continued in
the near future because the effect of such a policy could not be
seen in one or two years.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, its effect would only be clear after investment,
consumption, import and export recovered to a certain level, the
minister added.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Grandmothers Allowed to Meet Him in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Relatives in the United
States of the Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez agreed on Tuesday to allow
the boy to meet his grandmothers from Cuba the following day, the
U.S. Justice Department announced Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez, the boy's grandmothers
who flew to the United States on Saturday, have demanded a meeting
with the boy and insisted they bring him back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Carole Florman, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said
Elian's relatives agreed to allow the boy to meet his grandmothers
after they are reassured that the meeting would be just a visit
and the boy would not be taken back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting will take place at the time and site selected by
the Immigration (and Naturalization) Service," Florman added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) ordered Elian Gonzalez's relatives in Florida to
allow the boy to meet his grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
The order was made in a letter to the lawyers for the boy's
great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez. The letter asked him to make Elian
available Wednesday for a meeting with his grandmothers at a
neutral site.
</P>
<P>
"In order to ensure that Elian has the chance to spend time
alone with his grandmothers, the INS is obliged to direct Lazaro
Gonzalez to make Elian available for a visit with his grandmothers
on Wednesday at 4:00 p.m. (2100 GMT)," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The letter was signed by Michael A. Pearson, executive
associate immigration commissioner for field operations.
</P>
<P>
The order came after Lazaro refused on Monday to agree to a
meeting at any site other than his own home, Pearson wrote.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the boy's grandmothers also met a group of
congressmen. "He belongs to Cuba. He was born in Cuba and he's a
Cuban citizen," Mariela Quintana, the boy's paternal grandmother
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
As the grandmothers tearfully pleaded for the boy's return to
Cuba, support grew for legislation to grant U.S. citizenship to
the boy.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 after his mother and
stepfather drowned when their boat capsized in the sea near
Florida. They, together with some other people, were trying to
enter the U.S. illegally.
</P>
<P>
The boy's father insists the boy be returned to him in Cuba
while the boy's relatives demand he stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The INS ruled that the boy belongs to his father in Cuba and
the boy should be returned. However, a few of U.S. anti-Cuban
congressmen planned to hold a hearing and vote to give the boy U.S.
citizenship although the boy's father rejected the offer.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the move in Congress, President Clinton told
reporters that he had not decided whether he would veto a
legislation to offer the boy a U.S. citizenship. "I have not
decided what to do, and I wouldn't rule that out. I just haven't
decided what to do."
</P>
<P>
"I'm just trying to minimize the politics of it, because I think
that when you -- if you take this one decision out of context, it'
s not just Cuba and it's not just this little boy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There are likely to be a lot of these things in the future as
immigration flows increase, as upheavals increase elsewhere, and
as we know more and more about what goes on in other countries,"
Clinton added.

<HEADLINE> 67-Year-Old Stock Certificate Found in E. China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NANCHANG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese court official has
discovered a stock certificate which was issued 67 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The 11.7 cm by 8.8 cm coupon, with a face value of 50 cents,
has the pictures of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin on it.
</P>
<P>
Yan Xinlin, an official at the Ruijin People's Court in east
China's Jiangxi Province, found the colorful, moth-eaten
certificate when he was sorting his old family books on January 24.
</P>
<P>
The corners of the stock bear a stamp, a serial number, some
Russian words, and the publishing time November 1933.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the stock was issued by the provinsional central
government of the Chinese Soviet Republic in the 1930s in Ruijin.
A cooperative affiliated with the government issued stocks twice
during the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
Many shareholders returned their stocks to the cooperative
without receiving principal and interests in order to support the
revolution at that time, so these certificates are quite rare.
</P>
<P>
Experts say this certificate is a cultural relic under second-
class state protection, and is valuable for studying China's
commercial and economic history.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Insists on Censuring Japan's Whaling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Helen Clark has showed her country's determination to stick to its
anti-whaling stance.
</P>
<P>
"I think we will continue to deal with Japan on the substance
of the issue and ignore the jibes," The Dominion Wednesday quoted
the prime minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Clark's statement was responding to a strong-worded letter to
New Zealand Fisheries Minister Pete Hodgson from Japanese
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Tokuichiro Tamazawa.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Tamazawa suggested the New Zealand government's
support for Greenpeace's anti-whaling campaign could harm New
Zealand's image in Japan. He said he doubted "the prudence of a
prime minister of a country, who publicly expresses support for
Greenpeace, an international body known to be forcing its tenets
on others by means of violent actions."
</P>
<P>
On January 13, Clark criticized Japanese whalers' mistreatment
of Greenpeace activists who were protesting against Japan's
continued whaling in the Southern Ocean. At her request, New
Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff sent a letter on whaling to his
Japanese counterpart, making strong representations about the
treatment of the Greenpeace protesters.
</P>
<P>
Hitting back at Tamazawa, Clark said, "I'd advise him to stick
to the issues and get the facts right. Greenpeace is not an
organization dedicated to violent protest. On the contrary, it is
an organization dedicated to non-violent action, and it's an
organization which over the years New Zealand governments have had
quite a lot to do with."
</P>
<P>
Clark reiterated her government's opposition to Japanese
killing of minke whales in the Southern Ocean, according to the
Wellington-based newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Panama to Work Out Strategy to Reduce Foreign Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CIUDAD DE PANAMA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The formulation of a
new financial strategy will allow Panama's foreign debt to
decrease by 2.5 billion U.S. dollars, Minister of Economy and
Finance Victor Juliao said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new financial strategy will use funds coming from the
privatization of public companies which amount to 1.3 billion
dollars and from the sale of 49 percent of the state stock of the
multinational telephone company Cables &AMP; Wireless.
</P>
<P>
Juliao said that if the Legislative Assembly authorizes the
use of those resources, Panama will reach an investment level that
will allow it to reduce drastically the total debt of 7.5 billion
dollars to 5 billion dollars by the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
"With this policy the amount assigned every year for the
repayments of foreign debt will be invested to create employment
opportunities and to increase the budget for public investments,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The finance chief also said that in spite of a foreseen
economic prosperity for this year the government will continue
taking strict measures to reduce unnecessary public expenditures.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the government's goal is to reduce
the total debt and to respond to the needs of the most
impoverished sector of society by implementing programs and
projects of social characters.

<HEADLINE> Small Loans Help Reduce Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The government of Sichuan
Province, one of China's leading agricultural bases, has helped
240,000 poor farmers escape poverty by offering them small loans.
</P>
<P>
The system of small loans was introduced to China in the mid-
1990s, and under the system, agricultural banks and branches
directly issue loans to poor farmers rather than to poverty-relief
associations.
</P>
<P>
The method of getting money into the hands of poor farmers is
now being popularized in Guizhou, Henan, Hebei, Sichuan, and
Yunnan provinces. In 1998, the Agriculture Bank of China issued
800 million yuan in small loans to poor farmers in China and
helped 1.3 million people out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
In the five years ending in 1999, Sichuan granted small loans
worth 57 million yuan to 56,000 low-income households in 12
poverty-stricken counties in the province to help them develop
agriculture, raise livestock and produce aquatic products, and
open businesses.
</P>
<P>
Some 96 percent of the loan recipients were successful.
Provincial leaders urged the use of the method in eliminating
poverty at a recent provincial conference.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Babies Born in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1.1 million babies
were born in south China's Guangdong Province in 1999, 70,000
fewer than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Information from a provincial family planning meeting said the
province's population growth was 9.92 per thousand last year.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time Guangdong has brought its population
growth below 10 per thousand, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, the total population of the province was
estimated at 72.7 million.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has seen great economic progress thanks to China's
reform and open-up drive, but it has been lagged behind other
areas of the country in birth control.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, the province has been taking a range of
measures to step up the dissemination of birth control information
among married couples, and punished 84,000 people who were in
violation of family planning regulations.
</P>
<P>
Provincial Governor Lu Ruihua has urged greater efforts for
greater achievements in implementing China's national family
planning policy -- one child per couple in urban areas, and two in
remote rural areas and in special cases.
</P>
<P>
The province has set the goal of keeping Guangdong's population
within 73.5 million this year, 300,000 births less than in 1999.

<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China's textile industry
reversed its losing trend by earning profits one year earlier than
targeted, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
The industry made a profit of 800 million yuan (96.4 million U.
S. dollars) last year, according to figures released Tuesday by
the State Textile Bureau. The profits marked an end to a six- year
losing stretch.
</P>
<P>
The State council had demanded the textile industry bail out
of its loss-making bog in three years' time at the 1997 central
conference on economy.
</P>
<P>
To improve efficiency in the industry, the textile sector also
set a goal of eliminating 10 million outdated spindles and laying
off 1.2 million redundant workers in 1998-2000.
</P>
<P>
More than 9.06 million spindles fell into disuse and 1.16
million workers were laid off by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Elimination of surplus production capacity eased redundant
construction in the industry, said Shi Wanpeng, vice minister of
the State Economic and Trade Commission.

MOSCOW, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Azerbaijan may lose its
membership of world soccer's governing body FIFA after eight top
Azeri clubs broke away from the country's soccer federation (ASF)
on Tuesday and elected the head of a separate ruling body for the
sport, reports said in Baku.
</P>
<P>
FIFA had warned Azeri officials to end their squabbles or face
consequences.
</P>
<P>
"We received a tough letter signed by FIFA secretary-general
Michel Zen-Ruffinen, which said we must end the internal disputes
in our game or we might face severe punishment and even lose our
FIFA membership," an ASF official said.
</P>
<P>
FIFA asked the ASF to set a date for a nationwide conference
around April 1 and offered to send its own officials to supervise
new elections.
</P>
<P>
However, the rebels, led by the powerful presidents of
champions Kepez Ganja and Turan Tavuz, ignored a plea from ASF
chief Fuad Musayev for a peaceful solution and elected Alikper
Mamedov as head of the breakaway soccer body.
</P>
<P>
Azeri soccer has been plagued in recent months by internal
disputes as the game's top officials have accused each other of
corruption and misuse of funds.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 26 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province,
which faces Taiwan across the Taiwan Straits, will make greater
efforts to increase cooperation with Hong Kong and Macao to
promote common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Chen Mingyi, secretary of the Fujian Provincial Committee of
the Communist Party of China, said at a forum here recently that
the return of Hong Kong and Macao to China has brought about many
opportunities for further cooperation between his province and the
two regions.
</P>
<P>
Investors from Hong Kong and Macao are encouraged to engage in
new and high-tech industries and the reform of state-owned
enterprises in Fujian, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation will further be extended from commercial sectors
to such areas as education, science and technology, and culture,
Chen added.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to jointly tapping both international
and domestic markets, especially the market in the central and
western China.
</P>
<P>
Greater attention also will be paid to the actual effect of
cooperation between Fujian and Hong Kong and Macao in the years to
come, Chen stressed.

investment last year, a 20 percent rise over 1998.
</P>
<P>
The province ratified 1,717 new overseas-funded enterprises
1999, which used 3.11 billion US dollars of contractual overseas

<HEADLINE> Beijing Customs Effectively Cracks Down On Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Customs foiled 208
smuggling attempts and retrieved 278 million yuan during its
intensified combat against smuggling last year, according to the
latest customs statistics.
</P>
<P>
The effective crackdown was attributed to closer customs
surveillance of international smuggling channels from overseas and
new sensor equipment at check points.
</P>
<P>
The tighter customs checks of high-tech imports such as
telecommunications equipment and computers also helped, according
to customs sources.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Customs also retrieved more than 50 million yuan in
attempted tax evasion in 1999, and prevented the smuggling of 1,
307 cultural relics and 1,200 endangered wild plants and animals.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Senegal beat Burkina Faso 3-1 in
a group C game of African Nations Cup in Nigeria's northern city
Kano on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ousmane Diop, Senegal's Greece-based striker, kicked in the
first goal only four minutes into action, taking full advantage of
a defensive blunder by the Burkinabe defense.
</P>
<P>
During an attack before the end of the first half, Senegal's
midfielder Assane Ndiaye was brought down as he ran towards the
box, which led to a brilliant long-range free-kick by France-based
Pape Sarr. Burkinabe goalkeeper Seydou Traore was found stranded,
when the ball was swerving into the net.
</P>
<P>
Burkina Faso, who finished fourth at the last edition of the
Cup finals, staged a strong fighting-back in the second half.
Their efforts were justifiably rewarded in the 65th minute when
Ousmane Sanou attacked into the penalty area and made a successful
shot.
</P>
<P>
But Burkina Faso's hope of a possible equalization was
mercilessly shattered when four minutes from time a wicked
deflection from Salif Keita's shot ensured a third goal for
Senegal.
</P>
<P>
Senegal now tops group C with defending champions Egypt, who
beat Zambia 2-0 on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Thomas Haessler Could Return to German National Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- German star midfielder Thomas
Haessler can return to the national team to play the European
Championship this summer in the Netherlands and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Germany's newspaper "Sueddeutsche Zeitung" said the possibility
appears bigger and bigger that the 33-year-old diminutive
midfielder will be recruited into the national team.
</P>
<P>
Haessler, who stands only 1.66 meters, is an expert in the
midfield and has very rich World Cup and European Championships
experience. He was also a member of Germany's winning team in the
1990 World Cup in Italy and the 1996 European Championships in
England.
</P>
<P>
Haessler, who scored 97 goals for the national team, has played
for SC Karlsruhe, Borussia Dortmund and now for Munich 1860.
</P>
<P>
Germany's retired star striker Juergen Klinsmann hoped earlier
that head coach Erich Ribbeck can recall Haessler for
strengthening the midfield of German national side.
</P>
<P>
Oliver Bierhoff, who plays for AC Milan and captains Ribbeck's
team, also hoped that Haessler can be back.
</P>
<P>
Haessler, who separated from his wife Angela before Christmas,
said the separation perhaps will do good to his professional
career.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Expects for UK Bout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- American boxer Mike Tyson
completed his first open training session on Tuesday since his
arrival from America and said that he wanted to fight again in the
UK.
</P>
<P>
"As long as no political movements don't want me here, I'd like
to fight here again," said Tyson after completing a 15-minute
staged workout at his makeshift Grosvenor House Hotel gym.
</P>
<P>
With his fight against British heavyweight Julius Francis four
days away, the razzmatazz surrounding Tyson is increasing still.
</P>
<P>
In the last 10 days Tyson has managed to wheedle his way around
Britain's immigration system and received the freedom of Brixton
police station to address his milling fans from a third-floor
window.
</P>
<P>
He caused chaos and confusion on several shopping trips during
which he has already spent a fair proportion of his 5 million
pounds purse for fighting Francis at Manchester Arena this
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday he allowed the world's media into his first open
training session - but in true Tyson style, not before the press
had cued for the best part of three hours in the hot, sweaty
training room.
</P>
<P>
Two hundred or so packed into Tyson's makeshift gym to be
deafened by a constant beat of `Gangsta Rap' music and the sight
of Tyson sinking punches into a red body bag around the ample
midriff of assistant trainer Stacey McKinley.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, seemingly intrigued by the controversy which has
followed his every step, said he is not yet back to his best but
is well on the way.
</P>
<P>
"I have been working on my balance, my feet, repetition-
beginners' stuff. If you don't remember the little things you don'
t remember the big things.
</P>
<P>
The little things add to the big things. I am on my way.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes I do things better than when I was champion. It's
just a case of focus," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's trainer Tommy Brooks said the former heavyweight
champion was at 80 per cent of his best.
</P>
<P>
And sparring partner Leroy Seals had an ominous message for
Julius Francis.
</P>
<P>
"Mike will get rid of him in three rounds," said Seals, who
first met Tyson as 16-year-olds at the Lake Placid Olympic
training centre in New York.
</P>
<P>
"I've been sparring with him since 1989 and I've boxed hundreds
of rounds. I know what to expect from him.
</P>
<P>
"Julius Francis has no idea what to expect - and he's going to
get a hell of a surprise," he said.

<HEADLINE> Morocco Beats Congo 1-0 in African Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Salaheddine Bassir rescued
Morocco from a disgraceful tie with the no-hoper Congo only five
minutes from time in a Group D game of the 22nd African Nations
Cup here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The winning goal was scored in the 84th minute by Spain-based
Bassir, who had come on just minutes earlier as a substitute.
</P>
<P>
He tapped in from close range after Congo goalkeeper Brice
Samba failed to cut out a cross and Morocco midfielder Mustapha
Hadji headed the ball perfectly into Bassir's path.
</P>
<P>
The Deportivo Coruna player, enjoying a reputation of a scorer
of vital goals, has now scored 23 goals for his country in little
more than three years.
</P>
<P>
Today's game seemed to have made a dent upon Morocco's
demonstrated confidence.
</P>
<P>
"This is no game as far as we're concerned," said Moroccan
midfielder Hassan Kachloul, who plays for English Premiership club
Southampton before the match.
</P>
<P>
"We respect Congo as our opponents but we feel it's three
points in the bag already as our main priority is the clash
against our fellow North Africans, Tunisia, and of course the big
boys Nigeria," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the other unexpected was also a 15-minute power failure
only three minutes after the kick-off at Nigeria's National
Stadium in Lagos, where the match took place.
</P>
<P>
During the blackout, the players gathered in the center of the
pitch, as officials tried to resolve the crisis with the
disappointed fans booing and jeering.
</P>
<P>
It was the first dramatic organizational hiccup in this
tournament being co-hosted by Nigeria and Ghana.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Djibouti Call for Just Peace in the Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Djibouti here on
Wednesday underlined the necessity of a just and comprehensive
peace in the Middle East on the basis of United Nations resolutions
and the land-for-peace principle, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Djibouti President Ismael Omar Guelleh called for Israel's
withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories including the West
Bank, Arab East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights as well as south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders supported the ongoing Palestinian and Syrian
tracks of negotiations with Israel, said the statement, issued at
the end of Guelleh's two-day visit to Egypt on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They called for holding an Arab summit to mend the split within
the Arab world, restore inter-Arab solidarity and achieve a unified
position in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Mubarak and Guelleh exchanged views on
bilateral, regional and international issues of common interest and
voiced determination to strengthen the "distinguished" bilateral
relations between the two countries, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are planning to set up a regular airline
between them.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has agreed to help Djibouti train staffs in the
agricultural sector and offered help to Djibouti's education
development, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The document said Egypt supports a peace plan put forward by
Djibouti on Somalia and that the two countries will cooperate and
coordinate their efforts to restore peace and stability in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Guelleh put forward a proposal earlier the month to help
neighboring Somalia establish a transitional government and
legislative council.
</P>
<P>
Somalia, bordering with Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya, has been
without government since a civil war broke out in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Djibouti leader also pledged support to the initiatives by
Egypt, Libya and the Inter-governmental Authority for Development
(IGAD) aiming at achieving peace in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government forces have been fighting with southern
rebels, led by John Garang, who are seeking increased autonomy for
the predominantly animist and Christian south since 1983 from the
Islamic government in the north.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya put forward early last year a five-point peace
plan calling for an end to Sudan's 16-year-old civil war and the
convocation of the peace conference to be attended by all parties
related to the Sudanese issue to seek national reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Announces Plan to Cut 6,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Coca-Cola Co., the world's
largest soft drink maker, announced Wednesday a major
restructuring plan that involves the elimination of 6,000 jobs,
its biggest employment cutback ever.
</P>
<P>
The cuts will affect 2,500 positions at the company's Atlanta
headquarters, 2,700 overseas, and 800 jobs around the United
States. Coke estimated that the cuts will save 300 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The size of the cuts surprised many analysts who had predicted
Coke would trim 2,000 to 4,000 jobs. The company has 29,000
employees world-wide.
</P>
<P>
It is the latest move by the company to boost its profits since
President Douglas Daft was designated to become chairman and CEO
after its April shareholders' meeting.
</P>
<P>
Daft, who will succeed M. Douglas Ivester in the company's top
posts, called the cuts "painful both for those within the company
who will be directly affected and for those responsible for making
this decision."
</P>
<P>
He said the decision was made after a six-month, comprehensive
review of the company's entire operation and the realization that
Coke needed to restructure its operations.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's announcement came as Coca-Cola reported fourth-
quarter earnings of 31 cents per share in 1999, just above analyst
forecasts of 30 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
For the year, Coke reported income of 2.4 billion dollars, or
98 cents per share. In 1998, Coke earned 3.5 billion dollars, or 1.
42 dollars per share.

<HEADLINE> UK Labor Party Marks 1,000 Days in Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Labor Party celebrated
its 1,000 days in power on Wednesday with a promise to see through
reforms -- but an admission that it still has progress to make,
including modernizing the National Health Service (NHS).
</P>
<P>
While Prime Minister Tony Blair said that he had no plans to
celebrate the date, the party published a dossier setting out what
it said were its achievements since Labor's landslide general
election victory in 1997, the BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a party speech to mark the occasion, Education
Secretary David Blunkett called on the public to judge the
government over the lifetime of the parliament - and not on the
rough ride it had suffered in the previous fortnight.
</P>
<P>
Appealing directly to voters to look at the wider picture,
Blunkett said that Labor was laying the foundations for a more
flexible economy and a society that would provide people with the
right skills for the UK's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Where interest rates had stood at 14.5 percent in 1982, they
now stood 5.75 percent, said Blunkett. Inflation was now currently
running at 2.2 percent compared to 12 percent under Lady Thatcher
and Labor's policies were responsible for the country's falling
levels of unemployment.

<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder expressed his anxiousness Wednesday in Stockholm about
the possibility that the ultra-right Austrian Freedom Party joins
the Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder was referring to 49-year-old Joerg Haider who is the
chairman of the party and the prime minister of state Kaernten at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with the First German Television,
Schroeder said, "In our neighboring country a party whose leader
doesn't keep distance from Adolf Hitler clearly and definitely
will come into power. You ask whether it worries me? I say I have
full respects for the sovereignty of Austria. And there is still
hope that it can be avoided."
</P>
<P>
Schroeder had a talk with Israeli Premier Ehud Barak in the
course of the opening ceremony of the Holocaust Forum in Stockholm.
Barak stressed before the conference that it will be impossible to
have no influence upon the bilateral relation between Israel and
Austria if the leader of the Austrian Freedom Party joins the
Austrian government.

<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 3.10 at 11,032.99,
extending its gain of 21.72 points Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor
's 500 index fell 5.94 at 1,404.09 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
index fell 97.50 at 4,069.91.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index rallied as financial service firms such as J.P.
Morgan reported strong earnings in the final quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
But the Nasdaq composite suffered a lot when investors sold
technology stocks to take profits in fear of rate hike. Traders
expected the Federal Reserve will raise rates at a meeting next
week although the board chairman Alan Greenspan did not give any
signal about rates at a congressional testimony.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve raised rates three times last year in an
effort to ward off inflation.
</P>
<P>
Sales warning from Qualcomm also contributed to the technology
stocks' drop. The cellular phone chipmaker reported its earnings
in the fourth quarter beat the expectations but warned that sales
may be off this quarter.

<HEADLINE> Pastrana Says U.S. Benefits From its Aid to Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Clinton administration announced the
two-year aid package to Colombia to help the country fight drug
smuggling. But the plan needs to be approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the U.S. Conference of Mayors after meeting with
Congressional leaders, Pastrana said he was optimistic about
prospects for the bill after his consultations on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
The aid package will provide Colombia training for special
counternarcotics battalions and 30 Black Hawk and 33 Huey
helicopters for counterdrug activities, radar, aircraft and
airfield upgrades, and improved intelligence gathering.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana told the mayors that the case for helping Colombia in
its struggle "clear and compelling."
</P>
<P>
"It will be important for Congress to hear from America's mayors
in the days and weeks ahead that this initiative is not just in
Colombia's interest but also America's," Pastrana said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the mayors to lobby for the approval of the aid
package. "Your voices will help ensure that this critical
initiative is not sidetracked by other legislative priorities or
doomed by partisanship or politics."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Pastrana met President Bill Clinton, who also
expressed his confidence the aid plan will be approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, acknowledging the threat guerrilla groups and drug
traffickers pose to the Colombian government, predicted bipartisan
congressional support for the aid package.

<P>
LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The UK is one of the lowest
overall taxation rates in the world among the major developed
economies, a survey shows Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey monitors tax levels in 17 different countries, and
on an index of the top marginal rates of principal taxes, the UK
was placed third overall with 109.7, compared with Japan's 123.6,
Germany's 143, and 193.1 for France.
</P>
<P>
The UK and the Republic of Ireland had almost identical scores
for the lowest overall tax regime in Europe, according to the
survey by Ernst &AMP; Young for international business magazine Forbes
Global.
</P>
<P>
Jack Anderson, author of the report, said: "A 50,000-euros-a-
year manager costs a French company 143 percent of that pre-tax
after calculating the employer's share of social security and
other taxes."
</P>
<P>
"Only Italy, Belgium and Sweden come close, compare with 70
percent in the U.S. and 77 percent in the UK," he added.

<HEADLINE> Simitis Pledges Greece's Readiness for Just Solution to Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis Wednesday pledged his country's readiness to work for a
just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem within the
framework of the U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an Athens gathering as two visiting Cypriot
ministers presented cheques in aid of the victims of the September
Athens earthquake, Simitis said that Greece wants a just and
viable solution to the Cyprus problem which will be in accordance
with the decisions of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Greece will work for such a solution, he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the second round of the U.N.-sponsored talks
between the two communities in Cyprus, Simitis noted that during
the talks scheduled to resume on January 31 in Geneva, Greece will
continue to maintain the same line with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Cyprus share common goals and continuous bilateral
cooperation leads to joint efforts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reunite Cyprus have so far failed to yield any
results. A fresh attempt began last December in New York through U.
N.-led proximity talks, which continue in Geneva next Monday.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Pledges to Promote US Economic Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Wednesday that the Fed would
continue to pursue policies which will promote "low and stable
inflation", and prolong the U.S. economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
"Our challenge in monetary policy is to foster, as best we can,
the financial conditions that will allow this economic expansion
and technological revolution to continue as long, and as
vigorously, as possible," Greenspan said in his prepared testimony
for the Senate Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan stressed that the central bank clearly understands
its most important job in supporting the U.S. economy's long
expansion is to fight inflation. He noted experience had shown
that price stability was key to maintaining prosperity and
stability in the booming U.S. economy. "An essential ingredient in
this prosperity ...is low and stable inflation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Effective price stability removes a major source of
uncertainty and distortion that would otherwise interfere with the
spending and saving decisions of households and businesses,"
Greenspan continued.
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining price stability also reduces the likelihood that
imbalances could develop that would ultimately undermine economic
expansion," he added.
</P>
<P>
His appearance comes less than a week before the Fed's next
interest rate meeting, on February 1-2, at which the central bank
is widely expected to nudge up short-term interest rates in an
effort to cool down the booming economy.
</P>
<P>
The 73-year-old Fed chairman was renominated earlier this
month by President Clinton for a fourth term. The nomination is
expected to meet little resistance in the Senate Banking Committee.
After the Committee vote, Greenspan then faces a full Senate vote.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign short-term credit lines
granted to the Peruvian bank registered a decrease of 37.9 percent
in 1999 versus the previous year, according with this country's
Central Reserve Bank.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last December, short-term foreign credits reached
1.787 billion U.S. dollars, whereas by December 1998 they were 2.
879 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bank executives consider it due to the international crisis
which generated "a strong risk feeling among investors with our
economy. To this crisis was added the deterioration of falling
credits from the local bank," according to the bank.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also said that deposits in foreign banks
increased by 35.4 percent from December 1998 to December 1999 from
260 million dollars to 352 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed it to the lack of credit subjects as a
result of the acute recession that affected Peru in the previous
year.

He added that such a force would be rarely used and in most
situations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) would be
expected to "be fully engaged."
</P>
<P>
Officials and experts in the United States fear that the EU's
plan to build such an army would undermine or challenge the U.S.
role in Europe in security. The United States has regarded NATO as
its tool to maintain its dominating role in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Hoon told reporters that some skepticism had been expressed on
Capitol Hill about U.S.-European cooperation in future world
trouble spots.
</P>
<P>
But he said the lead of European readiness for Kosovo "
demonstrated beyond doubt that Europe was not pulling its weight
effectively in defense terms."
</P>
<P>
"We are confident this does not in any way jeopardize our
relationship with the United States through NATO," he affirmed. "
NATO remains the main source of protection for alliance members."
</P>
<P>
Even if a strictly European force were deployed, all NATO
members would be involved in decisions and planning leading to the
deployment, Hoon added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the idea that European countries "hunkered down
together" and responded "secretly and independently" to a crisis
without the United States was not possible nor realistic.

<HEADLINE> Hatch Quits U.S. Presidential Campaign, Endorses Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch
announced his withdrawal from presidential campaign Wednesday and
turned to support Republican front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
"I think Governor Bush is the only person who can get things
done, cut marginal tax rates so that we can keep this economy
going, improve our schools,'' Hatch said at a press conference
here.
</P>
<P>
The Utah Senator quit his presidential campaign after he
finished sixth and last on Monday night in the Republican Iowa
caucuses. He got only one percent of the vote in the caucuses and
had low single-digit support in most public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Hatch, 65, had hoped his nearly quarter-century service in the
Senate would help him in his presidential campaign, but he got
into the race far later than his rivals and few voters seemed
interested.
</P>
<P>
"It is now clear that there will not be time to build
sufficient support for my candidacy," he said. He expressed his
hope that Bush will "unite the party and bring back the White
House to us."
</P>
<P>
He also asked the five Republican presidential contenders to
run fair and positive campaigns, saying Americans are sick of
attack politics.
</P>
<P>
Hatch remains a candidate for re-election to the Senate, where
he has represented Utah State since 1977.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hails Elections Plan in Cote D'Ivoire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Wednesday voiced his welcome to Cote D'Ivoire's
official announcement of a plan to restore the West African
country to civilian rule following the Christmas Eve coup.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in a statement issued via his spokesman, said he "
welcomes the official announcement by the authorities in Cote D'
Ivoire of a program to return the country to constitutional rule."
</P>
<P>
General elections will be held in Cote D'Ivoire by October 31,
said a communique signed by Albert Aggrey, secretary-general of
the interim ruling government in the country. But it did not
mention the exact dates for the parliamentary, presidential and
municipal elections.
</P>
<P>
"The (U.N.) secretary-general reaffirms the readiness of the
United Nations to extend electoral assistance and cooperation to
Cote D'Ivoire, within the framework of existing United Nations
guidelines on electoral matters, aimed at ensuring a credible and
transparent process," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
General Robert Guei took power from President Henri Konan
Bedie on December 24 last year in the first coup in the nation's
history. Guei has promised free and fair elections, but he has
declined to say whether he will run for the presidency.
