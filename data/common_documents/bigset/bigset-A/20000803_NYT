EDITORIAL: SENATOR TORRICELLI RETREATS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Aug. 3:
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best that can be said of Sen. Robert Torricelli's
leap into the icy preliminaries of next year's gubernatorial race
in New Jersey is that he leapt out again so quickly. Three weeks
after declaring plans to run for governor, the ambitious senator
suddenly decided to keep his job in Washington. Many of the state's
most powerful Democrats had refused to desert his rival James
McGreevey, who almost defeated Gov. Christie Whitman in 1997. Their
reasons ranged from fair play to political revenge against
Torricelli to the results of a quick weekend poll that showed
McGreevey more popular.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of his public misstep, Torricelli said he had been
``humbled,'' an added value for any senator in the grand hallways
of Congress. But back in his home state, the senator's intrigues
leave his own wounded political party with a few new fractures. One
of the more telling plots starred Rep. Robert Menendez of Union
City, who has been simmering for months over a broken Torricelli
promise of support in this year's Senate race. Menendez and other
state leaders basically stalled a few public endorsements for
Torricelli while McGreevey lined up enough supporters to ruin the
senator's sudden appetite for one of the most powerful
governorships in the country.
</P>
<P>
   As he backed out of the race, Torricelli refused to endorse
McGreevey while McGreevey sniped that ``The Democratic Party is
greater than any individual's political ambitions,'' meaning
greater than Torricelli's. For Democrats, the only good news is
that this important state election is still more than a year away.

HELLING BOOSTS CHANCES AT ANOTHER 20-WIN SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rick Helling shrugs when the topic turns to
his record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wins and losses, I don't think I have too much control over
it,'' the Rangers' pitcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Helling has a point. If he pitches brilliantly but the team's
offense doesn't score, he can lose. If he pitches poorly but the
offense lights up the scoreboard, he can win.
</P>
<P>
   But Helling's theory doesn't do justice to the way he is
pitching this season.
</P>
<P>
   Helling won his 13th game last night, and is tied with Gil
Heredia of Oakland for second in the American League behind David
Wells' 16. There is nothing fluky about it. His 13-7 record is
evidence that Helling is making the transition from solid starter
to bona fide ace.
</P>
<P>
   Helling allowed two runs in 62/3 innings as the Rangers defeated
the Chicago White Sox, 7-2, last night. It was his sixth
consecutive victory, and the fifth time in his past seven starts
he's allowed two earned runs or less.
</P>
<P>
   High victory totals are nothing new for Helling, who won 20
games in 1998 and 13 last season.
</P>
<P>
   In those seasons he did benefit from a potent offense. He had a
4.41 earned-run average in '98 and a 4.84 ERA last season.
</P>
<P>
   But this season, he's seventh in the AL with a 3.82 ERA. He's
also fourth with a .240 opponents' batting average, and fourth in
innings pitched.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to get better every year,'' Helling said. ``I'm
throwing the slider this year, which is a new pitch. Every year you
have to do that. There's always things you can learn.''
</P>
<P>
   The slider was a key pitch last night. He used that and his
fastball to get ahead of hitters and set them up for his curve.
</P>
<P>
   That was the sequence in the biggest matchup of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Helling breezed through the first three innings, allowing only
one hit, but ran into trouble in the top of the fourth when he gave
up two runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had scored four runs in the bottom of the third, so
he still was in control, but the game almost got away from him in
the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Two walks and a single loaded the bases with two outs and
brought White Sox third baseman Herbert Perry to the plate. Helling
got ahead in the count, then struck Perry out looking at a curve to
end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   He retired the next five batters before walking Jose Valentin
with two out in the seventh, and was pulled after throwing 125
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a decent job of keeping them in check,'' Helling said.
``The key is keeping them off-balance. You can't go with the same
pitch in the same location.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling has about 13 starts remaining this season. There's a
good chance he can win 20 games for the second time in the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what he says about wins and losses, the ERA, the
opponents' batting average and the ability to make the big pitch in
key situations indicate that it's not by accident.

Biggio vows to be as good as ever
<TEXT>
<P>
   With torn knee ligaments, iron man faces major rehab for first
time
</P>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI _ One day after his season had been literally torn apart,
Craig Biggio was trying to find a way to somehow put the pieces
back together and prepare for what most likely will be the biggest
challenge of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Rehabilitating a surgically repaired knee is no easy task for
anyone, let alone a 34-year-old player who never has had to go
through any sort of major rehab.
</P>
<P>
   But if you know anything about Biggio, you know nothing excites
him more than a challenge. He'll no doubt approach surgery and
rehab with the same attitude he approaches a 3-2 fastball: Bring it
on!
</P>
<P>
   ``Bidge has a young body,'' Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell
said. ``Knowing how psycho he is about everything, you know he's
going to come back from this with flying colors. He's not going to
settle for coming back as an average player.''
</P>
<P>
   As a seven-time All-Star and three-time team Most Valuable
Player, Biggio is hardly average. For the better part of the last
13 years, he has been synonymous with Houston baseball, and an aura
of invincibility hovered above him like a guardian angel.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it seemed so surreal Wednesday to see him hobbling
around the visitors' clubhouse at Pro Player Stadium, supported by
a pair of crutches _ the result of torn anterior cruciate and
medial collateral ligaments in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   But as devastated as everyone, including Biggio, is by the
injury, the hard-nosed second baseman refuses to allow himself to
wallow in self-pity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a lot better than I thought I would today,'' said
Biggio, who is on the disabled list for the first time in his
career. ``I really didn't know what to expect. This is new
territory for me. I guarantee you I'll know a lot more about the
knee in the next five months. This whole thing is frustrating and
annoying, but I'm not going to let it get me down. I can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to have a defeatist attitude about this. Sure,
I'd much rather have tendinitis than torn ligaments in my knee, but
there's not much I can do about that. It's going to take a lot of
work to get back to where I need to be, but I'm ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be the same player again; in fact, I'll be better. I'll
be stronger, and I'll be faster. I'm looking forward to the
challenge. I'll be ready. You have to be confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio's injury occurred in the seventh inning of Tuesday's game
when Marlins center fielder Preston Wilson slid into his left leg
while trying to break up a double play. Unfortunately for Biggio,
it came when he was playing his best baseball of the season.
</P>
<P>
   His final 2000 batting numbers will read as follows: .268, eight
homers and 35 RBIs. They're hardly the caliber of statistics you
would associate with Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't having his best season,'' Bagwell said. ``I'm sure
that makes it tougher. But he was starting to swing the bat well,
and I know he was going to come back over the second half and have
the kind of season we're all used to him having.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never want to see something like this happen to anyone,
especially Bidge. Obviously, this is a major blow to this club.
This organization has never been without Craig for the last 13
years. Still, you can't just throw in the towel.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just another in a long line of injuries for the Astros, who
have used the disabled list 12 times this season, including three
times _ for Biggio, Shane Reynolds and Mitch Meluskey _ in August.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio knows what it's like to play without Bagwell for extended
periods of time, considering Bagwell has had disabling injuries,
including a broken hand in three consecutive years. But Bagwell has
no idea what it's like to play with a second baseman other than
Biggio for more than a couple of days at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``People start to take guys for granted after a while,'' Bagwell
said. ``Once you watch what goes on without (Biggio), you're going
to realize how much Craig means to this club. He truly is a special
player. There aren't many people who can do what he does as a
second baseman.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact Biggio played in 1,800 big-league games before he
suffered an injury serious enough to send him to the disabled list
is proof of his toughness. It also means he has played through
injuries that might have disabled others.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was the muscle tear in his shoulder last season, the
torn ligament in his ankle this season, or the aches and pains that
have been more prevalent in his back over the last few years,
Biggio always has managed to stay in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way I was raised,'' Biggio said of his
penchant for playing through injuries. ``You're going to have
things that hurt; you just deal with it. I love this game, and I
respect it. As long as I can go out there and I'm not hurting the
team, I want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his career, that's not possible.

EDITORIAL: AN UGLY MOVE BY BIG TOBACCO 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Aug. 3:
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization has issued a report detailing an
ambitious, often covert effort by the tobacco industry to curb
global anti-smoking initiatives, dating back to the late 1980s. The
campaign's strategy consisted of having ostensibly independent
surrogates attack the credibility of international health
organizations and spin the concern with smoking as a first-world
issue not worthy of the developing world's attention.
</P>
<P>
   The WHO report, written partly by Dr. David Kessler, the former
federal food and drug commissioner, relies on tobacco company
documents that surfaced in recent lawsuits. It accuses the
companies of creating bogus front groups, misrepresenting research,
pitting other international organizations against the WHO, and
lobbying to cut the organization's funding.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most alarming, the report alleges that some consultants
served both the WHO and the tobacco industry. It exhorts
international health organizations, and their member states, to
develop strong safeguards against such conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler and the three international experts who also contributed
to the report were unable to ascertain the extent to which this
industry campaign is still being waged. But Philip Morris, one of
the companies cited, said that the tactics depicted in the report
were the product of a polarized environment in the past and did not
reflect an approach that the company would adopt today. Even so,
the WHO report should be read as a cautionary tale as the health
organization starts negotiations in October to frame an
international tobacco-control treaty. Negotiators must remain alert
lest the beleaguered industry, under assault in the American
market, seek treaty language that would leave consumers unprotected
in less sophisticated markets overseas.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Burning to reclaim the White House after eight
years on the outside, the Republican Party nominated George Walker
Bush for president on Wednesday night and sent forth his running
mate with the most stinging and unabashedly partisan attack of the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney, Bush's No. 2, asserted that the election of Al Gore
would perpetuate what he called the misguided policies of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all a little weary of the Clinton-Gore routine,''
Cheney declared. ``But the wheel has turned.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, appropriating Gore's slogan from the 1992 campaign as his
own, he said, ``It is time for them to go!''
</P>
<P>
   In the ritual roll call, the 22 votes from Cheney's home state
of Wyoming cast at 10:04 p.m. gave Bush more than the 1,034 votes
needed for the nomination. As Latin music blared, the hall erupted
in a prolonged ovation as jubilant delegates, many of them dancing,
were awash in a sea of beach balls, confetti, balloons and banners
that proclaimed, ``Bush-Cheney.'' Former President Bush and his
wife, Barbara, jumped to their feet to join in.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates, who had endured three nights of sunny, even
apolitical speeches, roared in delight as Cheney made full-throated
put-downs of the Democrats. But with Cheney's mild and even-toned
delivery, his well-crafted punch lines did not carry the same
weight on television.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, a secretary of defense under President Bush before
becoming a business executive, said he was lured back into public
service because of his belief in George W. Bush and his fear that
Gore's election would perpetuate everything that he believed was
wrong with Clinton's stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing a contrast with Bush's achievements as governor of
Texas, Cheney contended that the Clinton administration had made no
headway on Social Security, taxes or military readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Casting aside the high-minded oratory that had marked this
convention until now, Cheney portrayed Gore as mean-spirited by
reviving former Sen. Bill Bradley's pungent dismissal of Gore just
six days before the crucial New Hampshire primary: ``A thousand
promises. A thousand attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's address capped Bush's night of triumph that had been
meticulously crafted for weeks, if not months. Even so, it was a
political and emotional peak for the two-term governor, former
baseball team owner and son of a former president who did not
rocket onto the public stage until he first won election as
governor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Just eight years ago, Republicans gathered in Houston to
nominate Bush's father for a second term _ only to have their
president ousted by Bill Clinton. But Wednesday night, after being
introduced by his wife, Lynne, Cheney stood before the 2,066
delegates and told them that the era of Clinton and Gore had been
one of dashed hopes and squandered opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney depicted Gore as intimately connected to an
administration that had been mired in scandal and was clearly
seeking to turn Gore's attacks on Bush's ``risky tax scheme'' back
against the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this election, they will speak endlessly of risk,'' Cheney
said. ``We will speak of progress. They will make accusations. We
will make proposals. They will feed fear. We will appeal to hope.
They will offer more lectures, and legalisms, and carefully worded
denials. We offer another way _ a better way _ and a stiff dose of
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's comments were his harshest thus far against the
Democrats, and left no doubt that despite his mild-mannered
demeanor, the Bush campaign intends to employ him in the somewhat
traditional role of running mate as attacker. In his acceptance
speech four years ago as Bob Dole's No. 2, Jack Kemp was far more
restrained; he mentioned Clinton only once, and his sharpest words
were casting Democrats as ``elitist.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney picked up a mantle that has been carried in the past
by Bob Dole and Gore himself.
</P>
<P>
   The speech by the vice presidential nominee is usually delivered
on the final night of the convention _ and is usually overshadowed
by the one delivered by the head of the ticket. But by giving
Cheney his own night, the campaign was able to showcase Bush's
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   And though Bush had planned the break with tradition well before
Cheney was chosen, the move offered the public an opportunity to
take a measure of a man who has been out of the public eye since
leaving the Pentagon eight years ago after playing a key role in
the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's speech provided delegates with yet another reason to
revel in a quadrennial gathering that has been remarkably devoid of
controversy _ in public at least.
</P>
<P>
   After his defeat to Clinton, former President George Bush had
been shunned at many Republican events. But this week, delegates
expressed supreme confidence that his son was their best hope to
retake the White House.
</P>
<P>
   For the third night in a row, the former president sat through
the convention, logging more time there than many of the delegates.
At the very end of the night, he smiled and sang along as Lee
Greenwood appeared on stage to sing what had been Bush's campaign
anthem, ``I'm Proud to be an American.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night was clearly the most festive of the week on the
convention-hall floor, as delegates tossed beach balls amid blaring
Motown music. The one somber note on the otherwise exuberant mood
was many delegates' preoccupation with the health of former
President Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who had delighted party loyalists on Tuesday night when he
appeared on the floor as part of a tribute to past Republican
presidents, was admitted to a hospital here Wednesday after
suffering at least one minor strokes.
</P>
<P>
   As he delivered the invocation, Steve Young, the former
quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, asked a special blessing
for Ford's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney had been Ford's chief of staff at the White House. From
there, he was elected as a congressman from Wyoming, rising to the
rank of Republican whip.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that Cheney's speech was the most hard-edged
of the convention, Bush's aides insisted that it did not violate
their pledge to keep the discourse from Philadelphia largely
high-minded and positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary's speech sets a new tone,'' said Ari Fleischer,
a spokesman for Bush. ``It draws contrasts with Vice President
Gore, but far more respectfully than typical politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said to expect some barbs aimed at Gore. Yet some
passages in the speech veered closely to the personal _ especially
those that linked Gore to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the man from Hope goes home to New York,'' Cheney said, ``
Gore tries to separate himself from his leader's shadow. But
somehow we will never see on without thinking of the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, he added, ``Does anyone, Republican or Democrat, seriously
believe that under Gore the next four years would be any different
from the last eight?''
</P>
<P>
   In the eight days since Bush named him as his running mate,
Cheney has found himself largely on the defensive, fighting off
attacks by Democrats that his voting record was too conservative
for most voters. They concentrated on his opposition to the Head
Start pre-school education program and his votes against a ban on
armor-piercing bullets.
</P>
<P>
   But in his speech Wednesday night, Cheney did not even allude to
the controversy _ or his own ideology _ and instead took the
opportunity to say glowing things about his former boss, then
President Bush, and about Bush's son.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush, who arrived in Philadelphia Wednesday after a
six-day tour through six states carried by Clinton and Gore in 1992
and 1996, took to the sprawling stage at the convention hall
Wednesday afternoon to run through his acceptance address for
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing, perhaps, Bush's disdain of long-winded addresses _
and perhaps his own self-assuredness _ his aides said that his
acceptance speech might be the shortest in years.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, the campaign's communications director, said that
Bush speech had been completed and that _ allowing for applause
lines _ it would last roughly 38 minutes. In contrast, acceptance
speeches by his father in 1992 and Bob Dole in 1996 each ran 57
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the effort Wednesday night for Cheney to extoll Bush's
virtues, the program was intended as an opportunity for the party
to highlight its signature economic issue: tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But _ as throughout the convention _ the focus was on portraying
the party not as the party of plutocrats, as Democrats have long
sought to label it, but as a party of working people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax cuts matter to every American, especially the working
poor,'' Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia said in his prepared
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   To drive home the point, featured speakers included a Hispanic
small-business owner, Hector Barreto, who spoke of how Bush would
help entrepreneurs by reducing the burden of taxation and
regulation, and Kim Jennings, a single mother, who spoke about how
Bush's tax plan would help her edge toward the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials countered that the Republicans were trying
to distract attention from the fact that Bush's tax cut proposals
would disproportionately benefit the wealthy. And Gore's aides
pressed their case that both the Republican tax cuts passed this
year by Congress and those proposed by Bush would endanger the
nation's newfound fiscal health and the economy's long-term
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The very theme of the evening, ``prosperity with a purpose,''
contained a tacit acknowledgment that the economy is hearty, a fact
that could ultimately be expected to help Gore.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush arrived at the airport here Thursday morning, he was
greeted with a red-carpet welcome, replete with a fife and drum
corps and a replica of the Liberty Bell which he gonged. Then he
was off to the Philadelphia Museum of Art for what was billed as a
Hispanic welcome event. Latin music blared.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was introduced by his Hispanic-American nephew, George P.
Bush, who said, ``Are you excited about electing a president who
represents the diversity of our society?''
</P>
<P>
   The governor and his wife, Laura, then appeared along with Sen.
John McCain and his wife, Cindy. Bush praised his one time bitter
foe _ who offered a tribute to him at the convention on Tuesday _
as a ``living example of duty, honor and country.''
</P>
<P>
   The two couples then stood with a batch of Latino children who
sang what was called a ``Spanglish'' version of America the
Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, Bush was off to a Republican gala lunch that was
expected to raise $10 million for the party. A large, almost life
sized, backdrop of the White House viewed from the South Lawn was
beamed on the stage behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech on Thursday, Bush said, he would ``share with
America how proud I am and how much I love my parents.'' He told
the crowd, ``I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. If
all goes well, if all goes well, you're looking at the next
president of the United States. God bless you.''

OLD HABITS DOOM ANGELS

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ For a team in the midst of a pennant race, the
Y2K Angels on Wednesday looked more like last year's model, losing
5-3 to the Tigers in front of 29,017 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Angels are 13 games ahead of where they were in the
standings at this point last season. And, this year's model has
seen a marked increase in morale and heart compared to last year's
version.
</P>
<P>
   However, to reach the pinnacle of Major League Baseball, they
must avoid pitfalls such as dropping two out of three in a
late-season series to the mediocre Tigers, who improved to 50-56.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Ken Hill (5-7), who hasn't recorded a victory
since July 8, absorbed his third consecutive loss after allowing
seven hits and four earned runs in six innings. He struck out two
and walked three. Brian Moehler (7-7) earned the win for Detroit,
yielding just one run and six hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   An unusually sluggish offense, coupled with an erratic start
from Hill, sunk Anaheim, manager Mike Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get production from our whole lineup,'' he said.
``We didn't execute a couple of times fundamentally and that cost
us a chance to get a couple of early runs that would have changed
the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill's troubles began right away, when he walked Tigers leadoff
batter Damion Easley and gave up a 428-foot home run to Bobby
Higginson, staking the Tigers to a 2-0 lead before many in the
crowd had even taken their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Hill did his best to keep the Angels close, although he got
little help from the offense. The team had just four hits through
four innings and two of those belonged to Tim Salmon, who went 4
for 4 with two doubles and one RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly not counting on one guy to carry us,''
Scioscia said. ``We hope he can continue that kind of hitting into
the rest of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Deivi Cruz led off the fifth inning with a single. He reached
third base when Hill made an errant throw to first on Shane
Halter's sacrifice bunt attempt, allowing Halter to advance to
second. Both runners scored when Easley followed with a single,
pushing Detroit ahead 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   A sacrifice fly by Dean Palmer, scoring Easley, capped Detroit's
three-run fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look around after so many innings and you don't think
Kenny Hill is pitching too badly,'' Scioscia said. ``But somehow
you're down 5-0. We have to tighten up in some areas and obviously
nothing's changed _ we need some starting pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Further evidence of the Angels' shortcomings in their starting
rotation was seen in the sixth inning, which started when Hill
struck Juan Encarnacion in the chest with an 88 mph fastball. He
did, however, manage to get out of the inning without further
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we battled back,'' Scioscia said. ``We had the tying
run at the plate in the ninth inning, which, when you're down 5-0,
that's about all you can really hope to do.'' &QL;

 &HT;    MCCAIN FINDS IT HARD TO MIND HIS MANNERS(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By KEVEN WILLEY(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain put on a good face at the Republican
National Convention here this week and performed all the right acts
of support for the GOP presidential nominee, George W. Bush. He
defended Bush at Arianna Huffington's Shadow Convention, resisted
the temptation to bang the drum for campaign finance reform,
delivered a stirring endorsement of Bush as the convention's
prime-time speaker Tuesday and generally tried to do all the right
things at all the right times.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't been easy. And every now and then, like the Dennis
the Menace who just couldn't control his mischief, McCain let slip
glimpses of the struggle behind the facade.
</P>
<P>
   McCain noted on a Phoenix radio station last week that he
planned to leave the convention midweek so as not to be a
``distraction'' at Bush's party. This left even some of Arizona's
convention delegates, among the most loyal McCain supporters in the
country, wondering if McCain's ego hadn't gotten the better of him
and worrying whether the move would detract from the party's effort
to show full-scale unification behind Bush as the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   McCain hauled out the ``Straight Talk Express'' and conducted a
highly publicized (not to mention ``distracting'') bus trek from
Arlington, Va., to Philadelphia reminiscent of Jesse Jackson's
infamously distracting airport landing at the start of the 1988
Democratic convention in Atlanta. Bush and Michael Dukakis have
little in common except perhaps for the convention heartburn caused
each by their vanquished primary opponents.
</P>
<P>
   While chatting it up with rotating clusters of national
reporters on the Straight Talk Express, McCain couldn't resist
speculating about his own national political future, at one point
going so far as to suggest, that, yes, he might be interested in
running again in 2004. The unspoken assumption in that
extemporaneous meander, of course, is that Bush loses this fall so
as to deprive the GOP of an incumbent seeking re-election in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The first private dinner McCain hosted upon arriving in
Philadelphia wasn't for his dedicated delegates or donors - or even
for anybody remotely connected to Bush - but rather for the
often-fawning national press, including such Big Feet as Dan
Rather, Tim Russert and R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's wife, Cindy, however, was by most accounts nearly
flawless in her demonstration of support for Bush. When a leader of
the Connecticut delegation fought his way over to the Arizona
seating area minutes before the start of the roll-call vote Monday
night to ask Cindy McCain to personally persuade his state's lone
McCain holdout to convert to Bush so the state could go unanimously
for Bush, Cindy McCain was prepared to accommodate.
</P>
<P>
   Time was simply too short, however, and she couldn't make it
across the hot and crowded convention floor prior to the start of
the roll-call, which featured Arizona, alphabetically, near the
front of the tally. Cindy McCain made sure in her nationally
televised roll-call statement to note that Arizona
``enthusiastically and unanimously'' cast its 30 votes for Bush.
Minutes later, a unanimous Connecticut delegation followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, John McCain's support for Bush from the
convention podium was unqualified. The loudest applause came when
McCain noted somberly of Bush: ``I support him. I am grateful to
him. And I am proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   And McCain has let it be known that he plans to stump for Bush
in California later this month and again next month elsewhere in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the starched suit of a supporter will feel more
comfortable by then. But this week, to McCain, it seemed to still
feel a bit stiff.

FLORIDA CHAMP GRABS BERTH IN DIXIE MAJORS FINAL

<P>
   EULESS, Texas _ In the first round of the Dixie Majors World
Series on Saturday, Hernando County, Fla., lost convincingly to
Georgia. Four days and four victories later, the Dixie Boys
Baseball state champion from Florida is in a good position to win
this year's title.
</P>
<P>
   Hernando County won its fourth consecutive game in the
tournament for 17-18-year-olds last night, defeating the previously
undefeated team from Monroe, La., 6-5, in 10 innings at The Parks
at Texas Star.
</P>
<P>
   Hernando County is one of three teams remaining with one loss,
along with Monroe and Lufkin. After the game, Hernando County won a
blind draw to earn a bye into today's title game.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe, La., is scheduled to face Lufkin in today's first game
at 4 p.m., and the winner will play Hernando County at 7 p.m. Both
Monroe and Lufkin will have to win two games to claim the title,
with Monroe forced to play in today's first game because it has
only played four games and the other two teams have played five in
the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Us 18-year-olds have been working for four years to get
here,'' said Chris Way, who was the starting pitcher for Hernando
County and scored the winning run. ``This game was intense from the
first inning. This is just awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernando County won the game in the top of the 10th on a wild
pitch. Louisiana reliever Dustin Griggs walked Chris Cole and Way
to start the inning, then Stephen Blanton singled to right to load
the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Cole was thrown out at home by right fielder James Scalia when
Jason Dunn hit a bloop single to right. One pitch later, though,
the ball got away from Louisiana catcher Daniel Raymond and Way
scored.
</P>
<P>
   Florida reliever Nick Westbrook gave up two hits in the bottom
of the inning, but struck out Griggs to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is just a World Series,'' Florida coach Tim Sims said.
``I don't know what the Rangers and White Sox were doing \Rlast
night\S but we had some good baseball out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Through six innings it looked as if] Hernando County were going
to cruise into the tournament's final day after building a 5-1
lead. But in the bottom of the sixth, Hernando County had two
costly errors.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe scored two runs with the help of the miscues, then cut
the lead to 5-4 when Trey White scored on Stuart Tichenor's
sacrifice fly to center field.
</P>
<P>
   One inning later, Louisiana tied it at five when Philip Steele
misplayed a flyball, scoring Adam Hanks. Neither team scored in the
eighth or ninth, with Way pitching through the eighth and Louisiana
starter Matt Green going seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we would have to win two games to win coming into
\Rlast night\S,'' Louisiana coach Bruce Hanks said. ``And we've
still got to win two games.''

 APPLE SUES OVER WEB POSTINGS
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY HENRY NORR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHRONICLE STAFF WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;   &LR; Opening a new front in its a continuing &LR; 
 &LR; battle to prevent leaks about its future products, Apple Computer
filed suit Wednesday against as many as 25 individuals it accuses
of disclosing its trade secrets on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed with the state Superior Court in Santa Clara,
alleges that someone, so far identified only as ``Doe 1,'' acting
alone or in concert with up to 24 other ``Does,'' began posting
information about unannounced Apple products around February of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the complaint charges, the defendants posted
digital images of a dual-processor Mac G4 on February 16. The
company did not announce that product until July 19. Likewise, the
defendants are alleged to have posted on June 22 a picture of
Apple's new optical mouse, which was also announced in July. .
</P>
<P>
   The suit does not specify where the images were posted, but
MacNN, a Web site dedicated to Mac news, reported yesterday that
the Cupertino computer-maker had issued a subpoena to Yahoo asking
the popular online site to identify the Internet address of a user
who created a site on its Geocities section, where the images were
allegedly posted.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo officials refused to confirm or deny receipt of an Apple
subpoena. Apple also declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   G. Gervaise Davis, an attorney at Davis &AMP; Schroeder in Monterey
who also teaches a course on intellectual-property litigation at
the University of California at Santa Clara's law school, said it
is common for companies to file suits against John Does when they
don't know the identity of individuals involved, especially in
cases involving the Internet. Once such a suit is filed, the
plaintiff can take discovery or issue subpoenas compelling Internet
service providers or Web hosting companies to reveal information
about the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 42 years in this field, that's the only way I know of to
do it'' in such circumstances, Davis said. ``Under federal
procedures and in most states, there's no alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   The Apple brief cites two ways the company suffers when
information about new products leaks prior to a formal
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   First, it says, ``In Apple's experience, public knowledge of
future products often lessens sales of existing Apple products.''
Second, the brief says, advance knowledge of Apple innovations lets
competitors direct their own product development and marketing to
counter the company's plans.
</P>
<P>
   The suit seeks a permanent injunction restraining the defendants
from further misappropriation of information about Apple's future
products as well as unspecified compensatory and ``exemplary''
damages.
</P>
<P>
   The suit apparently represents a new tactic for Apple. Since
co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs regained control of the company in
1997, it has taken aggressive steps, detailed in yesterday's
filing, to prevent the leaks about its products.
</P>
<P>
   But when leaks have occurred, Apple has until now relied on
legal threats against the sites publishing the information, rather
than going after the leakers themselves. Last month, for example, a
popular Web site called MacInTouch.com published a note from a
reader describing products to be announced at July's Macworld Expo
trade show. Apple attorneys e-mailed the site's publisher and its
Internet service provider, demanding that he ``cease and desist
from disseminating the material'' in question. The site complied
with the demand, saying it wanted to avoid further legal costs, but
posted a strong response from its own attorney challenging Apple's
legal arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the law doesn't give ``commercial speech'' the same
strong protections afforded to political or expressive speech, the
courts are traditionally cautious about efforts to restrain
publication of leaked material, according to intellectual-property
expert Davis.

parents expected him to lose; it was his younger brother Jeb who
held the family's confidence. Friends and family members say that
the elder Bushes worried that George W. would be forced to bow
again, as he had several times before, to failure. But that story
had a surprise ending: While Jeb lost, George won. And in the
process, George Walker Bush launched himself, without any grand
plan or intricate forethought, on a trajectory that on Thursday
will place him in the spotlight as the Republican nominee for
president. By Nicholas D. Kristof and Frank Bruni.

individuals who are selling goods in online auctions have little

 BIG DONOR TO DAVIS GOT EXEMPTION FROM NEW EMPLOYEE OVERTIME LAW  &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ After hosting a fund-raiser that netted $76,000 for
Gov. Gray Davis, a ski industry group won a break it sought on
paying overtime to resort employees from a Davis-appointed
commission.
</P>
<P>
   This is the latest in a series of incidents in which actions of
the Davis administration appear to be linked to contributions
received by the Democratic governor.
</P>
<P>
   Both Davis and the California Ski Industry Association, a San
Francisco group, deny any connection between the fund-raiser and
overtime exemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly this group makes a substantial contribution and then
gets a favorable policy product from the governor. It's
distressing, but not surprising,'' said Craig Holman, project
director of the Center for Government Studies in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   At $76,000, the ski industry association was the 11th-largest
contributor to Davis during the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it made no contributions to the Democratic governor _
only three contributions of $900, $1,00 and $500 to lawmakers,
according to StateNet, a contribution tracking service.
</P>
<P>
   The money was generated by a fund-raiser this spring held near
the Sacramento airport at which members of the association were
asked to contribute to Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The most important issue for the group at the time was being
granted an exemption from the Davis administration on the state's
law that workers be paid time and a half for every hour beyond
eight hours in a day or 40 hours in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group made that known to Davis at the
fund-raiser, sources said, during a briefing for the governor about
how the ski industry operates.
</P>
<P>
   About 16,000 people are employed by the 34 resorts represented
by the association. Of those, 14,500 are seasonal employees.
</P>
<P>
   Having to follow the overtime law would cost the resorts
represented by the association $100 million, Bob Roberts, the
association's executive director, told the state's Industrial
Welfare Commission at a May 7 hearing.
</P>
<P>
   With a 5 percent profit margin and $300 million in annual sales,
being subject to the overtime rules ``basically takes out the
profitability of the industry,'' Roberts testified.
</P>
<P>
   The Industrial Welfare Commission, whose members are appointed
by Davis, has the power to grant exemptions to the state's overtime
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Before Davis took office, the ski industry enjoyed an exemption
from paying any daily overtime. Employees did not receive overtime
unless they worked 56 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   That exemption expired last year, and without some accommodation
the resorts would have been subject to the overtime laws governing
most other industries starting July 1 of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Working with members of the governor's staff, the ski group
offered a compromise to the commission:
</P>
<P>
   During the ski season, employees would receive overtime only
after 48 hours a week or 10 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise was offered by Bill Dombrowski, chairman of the
five-member commission, and it was approved on a 3-to-2 vote at a
June 30 meeting of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't see the rationale,'' said Barry Broad, a Sacramento
labor lobbyist and one of two commissioners who voted against the
special treatment for ski resorts. ``Canneries and other seasonal
industries have 40 hour work weeks and overtime after eight
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Dombrowski was traveling outside the state Wednesday and was
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Garry South, the governor's top political consultant, said Davis
favored the exemption long before the fund-raiser. ``To suggest
such a cause-and-effect connection between a ski association event
and action by the commission completely misunderstands the
governor's position, which certainly has not been formed since
March,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, the ski association director, was traveling in Europe
and could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephanie Neff, deputy director of the ski association, said
there was no connection between the fund-raiser and the actions of
the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked with everybody to try and find a compromise that was
fair but allowed for flexibility for employees and employers,' Neff
said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' voracious fund-raising _ he has amassed $21.4 million
since he became governor _ has led to repeated criticism that
special interests groups who contribute to him, get his ear.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a year ago, Davis attended a fund-raiser in
Los Angeles sponsored by some of the state's largest health
maintenance organizations. Press reports said he raised at least
$125,000.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Davis called key lawmakers to his office
asking them to slow the progress of bills pending in the
Legislature that stiffened regulation of HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before the HMO fund-raiser, Davis attended a
reception hosted by Sierra Pacific Industries that included key
timber industry executives.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting coincided with the release by the state Board of
Forestry of draft regulations governing logging practices on
private lands.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations have been criticized by environmentalists as too
generous to timber companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Gov. Davis has placed a higher priority on
fund-raising than any of his predecessors,'' said Jim Knox,
director of California Common Cause. ``What he's doing is
collecting huge IOUs to wealthy interest groups that have a huge
stake in state politics.''
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign for governor, Davis pledged to restore
overtime pay after an eight-hour workday, which had been eliminated
by his GOP predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Davis signed a bill to do so but has used the
commission to grant exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year Davis pushed an exemption for some hourly paid
employees who receive stock options. The commission never acted on
the proposal.

AS OTHER CITIES SWEAT, L.A. MAKES COOL CASH &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIK NELSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With state officials in an uproar over soaring
energy prices and low supplies, the L.A. Department of Water and
Power boasted that it made a $35 million windfall profit last month
selling its surplus electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Long criticized for overbuilding power plants and locking in
fuel supplies at high prices in the 1970s oil crisis, the DWP now
is virtually alone in its energy prosperity in a region facing
doubling of electricity rates and threats of rolling blackouts due
to a heat wave that has sent demand soaring throughout the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles did not go the deregulation route and we're in
great shape,'' said DWP manager S. David Freeman said Wednesday.
``We're not asking people to turn off their power on the hottest
day of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the DWP still controls more than 7,000 megawatts
of generating capacity, and the city rarely uses more than 5,000.
On Wednesday, the city-owned utility reached a peak demand of 4,900
megawatts while selling 1,000 at a floating rate that sometimes
hits a ceiling of $500 per megawatt.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the DWP made about $35 million selling electricity to
the statewide power manager, the California Independent System
Operator, compared with about $20 million the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was far different in much of the rest of the state
as the ISO declared its third straight Stage Two emergency, cutting
power temporarily to some residential air conditioners and
industrial customers in exchange for discounted electric rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I can recall any periods when we've had as
narrow an operating margin as we've had this summer,'' said Ron
Nunnally, Southern California Edison's director of federal
regulations and contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But Nunnally remembered a time when Edison owned and controlled
all of its own power plants. Now it must sell what it does produce
from its remaining hydroelectric and nuclear plants and buy more
power on the commercial market each day.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of calling the first Stage Three alert that would
force rolling blackouts across much of the state remained high as
forecasters predict little relief from the hot weather until this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, customers in San Diego have seen their
electric bills double and stepped-up conservation efforts are being
pushed in areas served by Edison and other utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The power crisis sent off shock waves in Sacramento, where Gov.
Gray Davis issued a series of executive orders, raising questions
about possible price-fixing and questioning the state's decision
four years ago to lead the nation in deregulating utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Bill Lockyer immediately began an
investigation, while others blamed deregulation as the cause of the
short power supplies and rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   Under state-mandated power deregulation, which exempts public
suppliers like the DWP and Burbank and Glendale power authorities,
utilities were forced to sell off generating capacity and instead
buy power from a nonprofit Power Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other utilities are relying on the marketplace and the
suppliers are cleaning up because there's a shortage,'' Freeman
said. ``Right now, we're the island where the light is shining
bright in the valley of despair.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern California Edison, which services the metropolitan area
outside Los Angeles' city limits, including the city of San
Fernando, is grappling with high prices in the face of a rate
freeze that doesn't end until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   While residential customers pay about 5.9 cents per kilowatt
hour for electricity, the Power Exchange rates for power have
averaged about 16 cents per kilowatt hour for the past five weeks,
said Akbar Jazayeri, Edison's manager of pricing and tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   The freeze is a result of Edison being in an earlier phase of
deregulation than San Diego Gas &AMP; Electric, whose customers have
been blindsided with rates as high as 50 cents per kilowatt hour.
</P>
<P>
   Without the freeze, the average Edison customer, who pays about
$58 a month, would now be paying about $110.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the power shortage goes back to the beginnings of
deregulation, Nunnally said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were people who were hesitant to invest in new
generation until they could see what the new rules were going to
be,'' he said. Now, however, there are 26 California plants in some
phase of development, ``so in the next couple years we will work
our way out of that problem.''

<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ It's not exactly a convention they're throwing
in Philadelphia, because at an actual political convention, things
happen.
<P>
   Reader Tyler Hollingsworth is getting close when he identifies
the group activity in progress as an infomercial.
</P>
<P>
   Let's call it the Republican National Infovention.
</P>
<P>
   People are grinning and laughing, people are giddy about the
product, people all agree that the product is a miracle, people are
endorsing the product with every fiber of their straw hats.
</P>
<P>
   Happy-person testimonial: ``You know, I used to vote Democratic.
I was constipated, I had no energy, my social conscience was always
dragging me down, I was constantly broke because I was giving away
my hard-earned inheritance to deadbeats, drunks and orphaned
lepers. But now, gosh!''
</P>
<P>
   And if you call within the next 10 minutes, we'll throw in a
curly-fry maker and John McCain, who weighs only ounces and folds
up conveniently to store under your platform!
</P>
<P>
   MEANWHILE, it's wonderful that the Republicans are so unified,
except shouldn't it raise some flags of alarm  &LR; that all these very
political people from various disparate corners of conservative
political thought all agree completely on
 &UR; everything? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that if all the delegates were to disappear,
they could be replaced by 20,000 of those novelty mounted fish that
wag their plastic tail fins and sing, ``Don't Worry, Be Happy.''
</P>
<P>
   THIS SPACE may be blank.
</P>
<P>
   If it is, do not be alarmed. The Bay Area heat wave has brought
threats of rolling blackouts and necessitated some energy-saving
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving this space white will save printing-press energy and
ease widespread reader strain caused by trying to figure out what
it is I'm trying to say.
</P>
<P>
   The plush Dinah's Garden Hotel in Palo Alto got a call yesterday
from the power people, saying, ``We expect a rolling blackout late
this afternoon. ... You are in Sector 14.''
</P>
<P>
   It's good to know your sector, comrades. If nothing else, it
gives you a couple of more ice-breaking questions for the singles
bar: ``What's your sector?'' and ``Lose your power often?''
</P>
<P>
   IN A PINCH, we've got the barge.
</P>
<P>
   Up from Brazil is steaming the Rio de la Luz (River of Light), a
monstrous generator-on-a-barge that can light up 55,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   I just hope they don't park the barge anywhere near where I
live. When it's cranked up, it probably sounds like a leaf blower
the size of an oil tanker.
</P>
<P>
   I do worry that if we use the Rio de la Luz, which runs on jet
fuel, the barge pilot will ask us all to kick in some gas money.
I'm pretty sure I saw on the side of the barge one of those
hippie-days bumper stickers that warn hitchhikers that they are
expected to contribute to the cause: ``Gas, (sex) or grass _ Nobody
rides for free.''
</P>
<P>
   TIGER WOODS, when he played (and won) the U.S. Open at Pebble
Beach recently, wanted to stay at the same hotel where he stayed on
his previous trip.
</P>
<P>
   But the entire hotel was booked by Bank of America execs. So
Tiger's manager (my sources say) asked the B of A people if they
might spare a room for Tiger, which he would gladly pay for.
</P>
<P>
   The bank people didn't say no and didn't say yes, but did ask if
Tiger would agree to give a little speech to their group. What the
hell, he had nothing better to do that week.
</P>
<P>
   The ``negotiations'' dragged on for about two weeks. Any other
group would have jumped like a tiger at the honor of sharing
quarters with the world's hottest athlete. Apparently the B of A
people saw it the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger stayed at The Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   TRIHACK THE cabbie had a lawyer from the Organized Crime
Division of the Justice Dept. in his cab.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' the mob-buster told Trihack, ``whenever I
mention my line of work to San Francisco cab drivers, they all
start talking about the same two things _ the Russian Mafia and
Willie Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   NOT TO repeat myself again and again, but it's clear that
readers are avid collectors of redundancies.
</P>
<P>
   Some are worth repeating again: Hot-water heater (several
readers) ... Close personal friend (Anon) ... NIT (National
Invitational Tournament) and Giants win  &UR; by a score of  &LR; 10 to 3
(Dan Engler) ... Forever and ever (Don Novello, who says, ``Forever

favorite TV show. Why no partially new episodes? (Mark Frankel) ...
Offsides, before the snap (Al Markel) ... Sitting on your rear end
(Dick Vartanian).
</P>
<P>
   MORE POWER to carry us through energy crunches caused by heat
waves, that's what we need. What to do?
</P>
<P>
   Why not round up all the city's rats and put 'em on a million
hamster wheels wired to storage batteries?
</P>
<P>
   UNCLEAR ON the laws of physics:

 CHENEY LAUNCHES ASSAULT ON CLINTON-GORE ADMINISTRATION  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW and CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Leading a partisan attack that shattered the
Republican National Convention's air of congeniality, newly
nominated vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney launched a
full-fledged assault on the Clinton-Gore administration Wednesday
night, declaring: ``It is time for them to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in together,'' Cheney said. ``Now let us see them
off together.''
</P>
<P>
   The sharp words, which came immediately after the party formally
selected Texas Gov. George W. Bush as its presidential nominee,
punctured the polite tone of the convention's previous two nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all a little weary of the Clinton-Gore routine,'' said
Cheney, who served as President Bush's secretary of Defense after
11 years in the House of Representatives. ``But the wheel has
turned. And it is time. It is time for them to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican faithful gathered in Philadelphia's First Union
Center, who had sat patiently through hours of cordial speeches,
erupted in wild cheers, chanting: ``Time to go. Time to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The barb, which Cheney repeated several times, was a play on
Gore's acceptance speech at the Democratic convention in 1992 that
had been aimed at Bush's father. It climaxed a day in which the
delegates were abuzz about an escalating war of words between the
Bush family and President Clinton, who had belittled their son's
credentials to be president.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bush said on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that she
doubted Gore could return honor to the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very difficult, I think, with some of the things
he's done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, former President Bush responded to Clinton's
derisive comments, saying: ``If he continues that, then I'm going
to tell the nation what I think about him as a human being and a
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Republicans had said their convention would remain
upbeat, and that Cheney would not take on the traditional role of
attack-dog on the campaign trail, he delivered the convention's
most scathing rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the administration of ethical lapses, depleting the
military, failing schoolchildren and offering up ``lectures,
legalisms, and carefully worded denials.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said of Bush: ``On the first hour of the first
day, he will restore decency and integrity to the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he made it clear that Republicans will
campaign against Gore as Clinton's political twin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Gore will try to separate himself from his leader's
shadow,'' he said. ``But somehow, we will never see one without
thinking of the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who arrived in Philadelphia earlier in the day, will
address the delegates in a prime-time speech this evening.
</P>
<P>
   It was delegates from Cheney's home state of Wyoming who put
Bush over the top at 7:03 PST in an action carefully scripted to
coincide with network coverage of the convention. Though Bush's
nomination had been assured since he won the California primary on
March 7, the delegates erupted in cheers, and confetti streamed
from the ceiling of the basketball arena.
</P>
<P>
   The third night of the Republican convention began with a
invocation by former 49ers quarterback Steve Young, whose solemn
prayer was preceded by a yelp from an adoring female fan.
</P>
<P>
   Young was followed by World Wrestling Foundation star ``the
Rock,'' known for his skimpy attire and violent wrestling moves. In
a testament to the GOP's effort to expand his voting base, ``the
Rock,'' aka Dwayne Johnson _ who boasted that he has 16 million
loyal fans _ was then given a seat of honor in front of former
President Bush in the same row where ex-President Gerald Ford had
been the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Ford remained in a hospital a few miles away after suffering two
small strokes. His doctor said Ford, 87, appeared to have suffered
no brain damage or permanent disability, and chances for a full
recovery were good. Convention speakers throughout the night asked
for prayers and extended best wishes to Ford and his wife, Betty.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was buoyant as he arrived at a Philadelphia airport after a
six-day campaign swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all goes well, you're looking at the next president of the
United States,'' he told the crowd that greeted him and his wife
Laura.
</P>
<P>
   Americans ``don't want four more years of Clinton-Gore,'' Bush
said in a series of fast-paced appearances. ``They want somebody to
appeal to our better angels, not our darker impulses.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before a Latino audience, he blended English and
Spanish in brief remarks, concluding, ``Y juntos podremos ganar en
Noviembre (And together we can win in November.)''
</P>
<P>
   He also spoke to a luncheon attended by more than 3,300 donors
that was expected to raise $10 million. He then made a brief visit
to the First Union Arena and went to the podium where he will
deliver his own acceptance speech tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fellow Americans, I accept your nomination,'' he said in a
sound check to an empty hall.
</P>
<P>
   But the evening's most anticipated moment came when Cheney, once
President Ford's chief of staff, was reintroduced the delegates as
the No. 2 man on their ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney attempted to make the case that Republicans would restore
decency to the White House and appeal to Americans' best values.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see in our nominee the qualities of mind and spirit our
nation needs,'' Cheney said. ``You will never see him pointing the
finger of blame for failure... You will only see him sharing credit
for success.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Gore's political rival, Sen. Bill Bradley,
characterized the vice president's campaign as ``a thousand
promises, a thousand attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In this election, they will speak endlessly of risk,'' Cheney
said of the Democrats. ``We will speak of progress. They will feed
fear. We will appeal to hope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton vowed not long ago to hold onto power until the
last hour of the last day,'' Cheney said. ``My friends, that last
hour is coming. That last day is near.''
</P>
<P>
   With Bush characterized by Democrats as challenged as &LR; 
 &LR; inexperienced in foreign policy and national leadership, Cheney
sought to underscore the governor's credentials while saying he
himself has been ``in the company of leaders,'' serving under
presidents Reagan, Ford and Bush. And he attempted to reassure
Republicans that his running mate was their equal in stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad to be back in the arena,'' he said. ``I have been
given an opportunity to serve beside a man who has the courage, and
the vision, and the goodness, to be a great president.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said he had considered retiring to a life of ``fishing
and grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``to serve with this man, in this cause,'' he concluded,
``is a chance I would not miss.''

L.A. MAYOR ADDRESSES CONVENTION DELEGATES &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In an impassioned speech made to delegates at the
Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan called on the community to reach out and make a
difference in the lives of children.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan urged all listening to get involved with their
communities and attempt to cultivate a better environment in which
children can be nurtured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I implore every American to join the giving revolution in the
spirit of Hillel, who asked the questions, `If not now, when? If
not me, who?' The when is right now,'' he said. ``The who is each
and every one of us. Our children are waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   While some called Riordan's Wednesday-night address a
no-nonsense speech hitting the key points of the Bush campaign --
the need for education reform and community involvement at all
levels -- one California delegate said Riordan hasn't committed
himself enough to the education of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave a speech on education but has not taken a public
position in support of the Opportunity Scholarship Initiative,''
said Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich from the
convention. ``If we want to reform education, we can't give $1
million for the Democratic campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan's address via satellite, from the Simon Wiesenthal
Museum of Tolerance, earned him no congratulations from Antonovich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's inappropriate to use the Museum of Tolerance for
a political speech,'' Antonovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Others at the convention, however, praised the content and
delivery of the speech and said Riordan was at his peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spoke from the heart and made some excellent points,'' said
Thomas Kranz, a state delegate who serves on the Board of Civil
Service Commission for the city of Los Angeles. ``It was very well
received.''

MAN CHARGED WITH FATALLY STABBING STUDENT IN BROOKLYN IN 1999 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout) 
(ATTN: Kan.)   (Editors: Antoinne, in 3rd graf, is cq.) 
By SHAILA K. DEWAN and WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a murder case that drew national attention but
seemed to be growing colder by the month, the police on Wednesday
charged a man with fatally stabbing Amy Watkins, a young graduate
student from Kansas, on a Brooklyn street a year and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   The man, David Jamison, 27, admitted to his role in the killing
in a videotaped statement, a senior law enforcement official said.
Jamison had a record of more than half a dozen arrests, mostly for
petty crimes and drugs and once for robbery, the police said. He
was arrested Wednesday morning at his home in the Park Slope
section of Brooklyn, mere blocks from where the stabbing took
place, and was later charged with first-degree murder, first-degree
robbery and possession of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Two other men, Pierre Antoinne, 26, an unemployed house painter,
and Felix Rodriguez, 21, a warehouse worker, were being questioned
by the police, relatives of the men said Wednesday. In his
statement, Jamison said that the two men were present during the
robbery and killing, law enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After the stabbing, on March 9, 1999, the police were left with
a highly publicized crime and few clues. There were no known
witnesses, and the killer had been careful to obscure any
fingerprints by wrapping the murder weapon, a six-inch kitchen
knife, in a white plastic bag before using it.
</P>
<P>
   More than six months after Watkins, who had moved to New York
from Kansas to attend the Hunter College Graduate School of Social
Work, was robbed and killed, investigators reported that despite
thousands of hours of work, their leads had dwindled to zero. Their
only hope was that the killer would turn himself in, commit another
crime in front of witnesses or tell someone about the stabbing. A
$10,000 reward went unclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   The police said hundreds of people had been questioned since the
killing, but Jamison's name had never come up. At various times,
the police theorized that the crime was committed by a homeless man
or a boyfriend of Watkins, according to a senior investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, detectives got a break, an investigator said Wednesday:
in recent days, Jamison talked about the case, and word got back to
detectives through an informant in another part of the city and a
tip to the police Crime Stoppers hot line.
</P>
<P>
   News of Jamison's arrest came as a surprise to Watkins' friends
and family, many of whom said they had given up hope that the
killer would be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if it had all happened again,'' said Lawrence
Watkins, her father, a history teacher at the Dominican Academy in
Manhattan. ``What I'm feeling right now is that old wounds are
being reopened.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Green, Watkins' boyfriend at the time of her death, said he
had moved out of the neighborhood where she was killed. He said he
had thought that the police would never find a suspect. ``A good
part of me hoped it would stay that way,'' he said. ``I was not in
need of a name and a face, because that wasn't going to change
anything for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, who was 26 when she was killed, grew up in Topeka,
Kan., and enrolled at the University of Kansas to become a painter.
But a year and a half into college, she switched her major from art
to social work.
</P>
<P>
   In its brutality and apparent randomness, her killing was the
kind of homicide that had become an increasing rarity in New York
City, with crime declining. For that reason, it drew national
attention and tabloid headlines. Watkins' dedication to helping
others, particularly women who were victims of violence, and the
shock that the killing sent through the gentrified area near
Prospect Park made the story even more compelling.
</P>
<P>
   On that cold March night, Watkins, described by one classmate as
``a soldier of social work,'' was on her way home from the Bronx
Community Center where she worked with battered women. Residents on
the quiet street heard two screams, and found her less than two
blocks from her apartment with a knife in her back, surrounded by
fallen groceries. Her purse was later found nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The police said their initial suspicion, that the motive was
robbery, was borne out Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jamison's statement, investigators said, he and the
two other men were in a neighborhood luncheonette when they saw
Watkins walk by and decided that she would be ``an easy mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamison approached Watkins from behind while, investigators
believe, the two other men were in front of her. After Jamison
stabbed her, the three fled in different directions.
</P>
<P>
   Jamison apparently claimed to police that the stabbing was
unintentional. ``He's got some story that she moved backwards onto
the knife,'' a senior investigator said, ``which is inconsistent
wit the wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie West, the sister of Pierre Antoinne, said the police told
her that they believed that Antoinne and Rodriguez were present
when Jamison is alleged to have killed Watkins.
</P>
<P>
   But West and two other relatives of the suspects who were
waiting in the lobby of a police station house Wednesday night said
the men had nothing to do with the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica Corea, 25, Jamison's sister-in-law and Rodriguez's
sister, acknowledged that Jamison had been in trouble with the law
_ he has prior arrests for robbery, petty larceny and drug dealing
_ but she said he was not violent.
</P>
<P>
   West said her brother was not capable of murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an idiot and a moron, but he wouldn't be able to do
that,'' she said. ``If you knew my brother, he's a real coward. He
doesn't have the heart to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The police said Rodriguez was cooperating with investigators,
but Antoinne was not. Antoinne, a Haitian citizen, began serving a
state prison term for an attempted drug sale in 1995. On Jan. 25,
1996, state records indicate, he was paroled to the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service. A police investigator said
Antoinne might have been deported to Haiti under a special program
and then returned, illegally, to the United States.

CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR ORDERS FAST TRACK ORDERED FOR STATE
POWER  PLANTS
</HEADLINE>
 5STAR   &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a threat of blackouts continued, Gov. Gray Davis Wednesday
ordered California officials to speed approval of new power plants
and created a top-level state energy panel to advise him and
coordinate actions by state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also called on Attorney General Bill Lockyer to
investigate ``possible manipulation in the wholesale electricity
marketplace'' in response to a doubling of average electricity
bills in San Diego, the first city to face the full effects of
state energy deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Davis termed the impact of deregulation ``an
unacceptable situation.''
</P>
<P>
   His new advisory panel, modeled after the National Security
Council, will consist of six top officials from state agencies with
expertise in energy matters.
</P>
<P>
   They include the chairmen of the state Energy Commission, Public
Utilities Commission and Electricity Oversight Board and the heads
of the state Resources Agency, the Environmental Protection Agency
and the governor's Office of Planning and Review.
</P>
<P>
   According to a spokesman for Davis, the panel will be up and
running within two weeks and will be charged with developing a
unified strategy for remedying recent power emergencies and
skyrocketing energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   However, beyond the governor's order for speedier approval of
power plants, his call to action was short on specifics, leaving up
in the air questions about how California will respond to its
current energy mess.
</P>
<P>
   His executive orders came just hours after he received a report
from the president of the state Public Utilities Commission and the
head of the Electricity Oversight Board acknowledging that
deregulation ``is not working for California.''
</P>
<P>
   As The Chronicle reported Wednesday, the report urged the
attorney general to expand his investigation of sky-high
electricity rates in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   So far, neither the governor nor the attorney general has placed
blame for the state's surging power prices on any particular party.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and other major utilities again
interrupted power to hundreds of heavy users Wednesday after a
Stage 2 emergency was declared for the eighth time since May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Under a Stage 2 emergency, electricity reserves fall below 5
percent. A Stage 3 emergency, which has never been called on a
statewide basis, means reserves have been nearly depleted, and
utilities can cut power to all customers in so-called rolling
blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman for the California Independent
System Operator, which oversees most of the state's power grid,
said the danger of a Stage 3 emergency eased Wednesday afternoon
when rain began falling in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reserve picture looks pretty good right now,'' he said.
``But any major contingency puts us in the soup.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling this ``one of the toughest weeks we've ever seen,''
Dorinson said the state's power reserves should increase over
coming days.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term power picture, however, will not improve until
more generating facilities are brought online to meet the state's
ever-growing thirst for juice. No major power plants have been
built in California in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his executive orders, Davis instructed all agencies
involved in licensing new plants to submit their findings within
100 days of receiving a completed application. There is currently
no deadline for application reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electricity prices in a deregulated market are largely the
function of supply and demand, and California agencies should work
faster to increase supply,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   But Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform
Network in San Francisco, said hastening the application process
for new power plants ``raises a red flag.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot and should not build plants that have not been
subject to adequate environmental review,'' she said. ``The
question is: Is it possible to provide adequate review in these
shortened time frames?''
</P>
<P>
   To coordinate statewide efforts to increase the electricity
supply, Davis created an Energy Reliability Task Force that he
described as being modeled on the federal government's National
Security Council. The task force's specific duties were not
detailed.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also directed state agencies to reduce energy
consumption during Stage 2 and 3 power emergencies and to improve
energy efficiency in all state buildings.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had received numerous potential ``action steps'' in
the 40-page report from the PUC and Electricity Oversight Board,
but he did not say which of these steps, if any, he plans to
implement.
</P>
<P>
   Among the report's recommendations are employing computer models
to predict blackouts and hooking up commercial buildings to an
online ``emergency management control system'' that would help
authorities reduce power use during times of peak demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bay Area blackouts, the run-up in prices in the wholesale
electricity markets and the rise in retail electricity prices in
San Diego show that the new system is not working for California,''
the report says.
</P>
<P>
   It adds that ``enough evidence of questionable behavior'' exists
in California's electricity market to warrant an investigation by
the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   PUC President Loretta Lynch said in an interview Wednesday that
this questionable behavior has been displayed by various ``market
participants.'' She declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer activists have charged that power companies are gouging
consumers by jacking up wholesale rates during periods of peak
summertime demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wholesale prices are out of control,'' Lynch said. ``The new
structures don't work.''
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to concede that California's 1996 deregulation of
energy markets is a failure, she acknowledged that ``there were
assumptions that simply haven't proven true.''
</P>
<P>
   With San Diego electricity bills soaring and the threat of
blackouts in the Bay Area persisting, Lynch said that ``by
anybody's measure, we have problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The PUC is slated to take up the matter of San Diego's energy
crisis at its meeting Thursday. Lynch refused to speculate on what
the commission may decide, although it is widely expected to adopt
a measure allowing deregulation to run its course.
</P>
<P>
   She said her report to the governor is intended to initiate a
far-reaching discussion on how to address the state's electricity
woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report is a first attempt to call it like it is,'' Lynch
said. ``We shouldn't be concentrating on whose fault it is. We
should be concentrating on what works.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``It's still too early to tell exactly what direction
we should go.''

ANALYSIS: BUSH SPEECH WILL ARGUE FOR CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  PHILADELPHIA _ Eleven years ago this week, as Sen. Al Gore
worked on arms control issues and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
negotiated with NATO allies, George W. Bush was working on another
sort of deal.
<P>
   As managing partner of the Texas Rangers baseball team, Bush
approved a trade that sent a 20-year-old outfielder to the Chicago
White Sox in exchange for Harold Baines, a reliable veteran.
</P>
<P>
   The young prospect was named Sammy Sosa. Within a decade, he
would surpass Babe Ruth's single-season home run record. Bush calls
it the worst mistake of his professional life.
</P>
<P>
   Bush does not need to explain his flawed baseball calculations
when he addresses the Republican National Convention tonight to
accept his party's presidential nomination. But he will need to
demonstrate why a man who has served just 51/2 years in elected
office, who has never run a national campaign and who just a decade
ago was worrying about runs batted in and strikeouts is fit to
become commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has one fundamental challenge, which is to really raise the
comfort level of the American people and convince them he is really
capable of doing the job,'' said former White House press secretary
Mike McCurry and now a convention correspondent for Grassroots.com.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been working on tonight's address since May and told
reporters Wednesday it's ``ready to go.'' Karen Hughes, his
spokeswoman, said the speech will last about 38 minutes, which
would be considerably shorter than acceptance remarks offered by
nominees in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, Bush must accomplish at least three things: He
must look presidential. He must reach out to moderate and swing
voters. And he must make a case why, in times of economic
prosperity and world peace, the party in control of the White House
should be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's speech, scheduled to begin shortly after 7 p.m.
PST, is Bush's one and only chance during the 2000 campaign to go
on national television with no time constraints. More people will
watch Bush tonight, with the possible expectation of October's
debates, than at any time during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a small thing, but he needs to stand up
straight _ no slouching, no smirking,'' said Jack Pitney, a former
Republican Party official who teaches government at Claremont
McKenna College outside Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more about speaking confidently, boldly, speaking
from the heart about what you've been thinking,'' said McCurry, who
was Clinton's press secretary during the 1996 Democratic
convention. ``He has raised some considerable expectations for his
speech, and he will have to match them in order to claim this
convention as a success.''
</P>
<P>
   Success for most of the 10,000 delegates, supporters and
Republican officials inside the arena would entail a conservative
stem-winder, touching on red-meat Republican issues like tax cuts,
military might, banning abortions and the right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush will be speaking instead to the millions of Americans
in the political center, many of whom will be getting their first
extended look at the man who as a boy fantasized not about being
president, but about being Willie Mays.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made it clear that he intends to reach out to
independents and conservative Democrats, whose support he needs if
he wants to win the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a sentence in the speech that looks in the camera
and says, `I want you!''' Bush told the New York Times just prior
to the opening of the convention. ``But the speech itself should do
that. The speech, if it's done right _ and I think it will be _
will send a broadened message.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a luxury Bush can afford because of his overwhelming
support from conservative and moderate Republicans alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very united base,'' said Jim Nicholson, chairman of
the Republican Party. ``What we will do now is reach out and appeal
to those independent and swing voters and attract them to his
passionate conservative, positive reform agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Bush will touch on the same issues that have been the
basis of his stump speech since he began his campaign a year ago:
improving education, strengthening Social Security, rebuilding the
military, reducing taxes and ``unleashing the power'' of
faith-based and charitable organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult task for Bush may be to convince America that
change is necessary in a time of peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Clinton-Gore ticket successfully argued that change
was needed to jump-start a stagnant economy and to usher in a new
generation of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is staking his claim on the more subtle argument that after
eight years of slick, poll-driven politics, the nation is ready for
a new style in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling America's ready for change,'' Bush said Wednesday
in a preview of his address. ``They're interested in something
different. They want somebody to appeal to our better angels, not
our darker impulses. America is hungry for new leadership, and
that's exactly what Dick Cheney and I are going to give them.''

CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR ORDERS FAST TRACK ORDERED FOR STATE
POWER  PLANTS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a threat of blackouts continued, Gov. Gray Davis Wednesday
ordered California officials to speed approval of new power plants
and created a top-level state energy panel to advise him and
coordinate actions by state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also called on Attorney General Bill Lockyer to
investigate ``possible manipulation in the wholesale electricity
marketplace'' in response to a doubling of average electricity
bills in San Diego, the first city to face the full effects of
state energy deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Davis termed the impact of deregulation ``an
unacceptable situation.''
</P>
<P>
   His new advisory panel, modeled after the National Security
Council, will consist of six top officials from state agencies with
expertise in energy matters.
</P>
<P>
   They include the chairmen of the state Energy Commission, Public
Utilities Commission and Electricity Oversight Board and the heads
of the state Resources Agency, the Environmental Protection Agency
and the governor's Office of Planning and Review.
</P>
<P>
   According to a spokesman for Davis, the panel will be up and
running within two weeks and will be charged with developing a
unified strategy for remedying recent power emergencies and
skyrocketing energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   However, beyond the governor's order for speedier approval of
power plants, his call to action was short on specifics, leaving up
in the air questions about how California will respond to its
current energy mess.
</P>
<P>
   His executive orders came just hours after he received a report
from the president of the state Public Utilities Commission and the
head of the Electricity Oversight Board acknowledging that
deregulation ``is not working for California.''
</P>
<P>
   As The Chronicle reported Wednesday, the report urged the
attorney general to expand his investigation of sky-high
electricity rates in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   So far, neither the governor nor the attorney general has placed
blame for the state's surging power prices on any particular party.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and other major utilities again
interrupted power to hundreds of heavy users Wednesday after a
Stage 2 emergency was declared for the eighth time since May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Under a Stage 2 emergency, electricity reserves fall below 5
percent. A Stage 3 emergency, which has never been called on a
statewide basis, means reserves have been nearly depleted, and
utilities can cut power to all customers in so-called rolling
blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman for the California Independent
System Operator, which oversees most of the state's power grid,
said the danger of a Stage 3 emergency eased Wednesday afternoon
when rain began falling in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reserve picture looks pretty good right now,'' he said.
``But any major contingency puts us in the soup.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling this ``one of the toughest weeks we've ever seen,''
Dorinson said the state's power reserves should increase over
coming days.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term power picture, however, will not improve until
more generating facilities are brought online to meet the state's
ever-growing thirst for juice. No major power plants have been
built in California in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his executive orders, Davis instructed all agencies
involved in licensing new plants to submit their findings within
100 days of receiving a completed application. There is currently
no deadline for application reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electricity prices in a deregulated market are largely the
function of supply and demand, and California agencies should work
faster to increase supply,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   But Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform
Network in San Francisco, said hastening the application process
for new power plants ``raises a red flag.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot and should not build plants that have not been
subject to adequate environmental review,'' she said. ``The
question is: Is it possible to provide adequate review in these
shortened time frames?''
</P>
<P>
   To coordinate statewide efforts to increase the electricity
supply, Davis created an Energy Reliability Task Force that he
described as being modeled on the federal government's National
Security Council. The task force's specific duties were not
detailed.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also directed state agencies to reduce energy
consumption during Stage 2 and 3 power emergencies and to improve
energy efficiency in all state buildings.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had received numerous potential ``action steps'' in
the 40-page report from the PUC and Electricity Oversight Board,
but he did not say which of these steps, if any, he plans to
implement.
</P>
<P>
   Among the report's recommendations are employing computer models
to predict blackouts and hooking up commercial buildings to an
online ``emergency management control system'' that would help
authorities reduce power use during times of peak demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bay Area blackouts, the run-up in prices in the wholesale
electricity markets and the rise in retail electricity prices in
San Diego show that the new system is not working for California,''
the report says.
</P>
<P>
   It adds that ``enough evidence of questionable behavior'' exists
in California's electricity market to warrant an investigation by
the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   PUC President Loretta Lynch said in an interview Wednesday that
this questionable behavior has been displayed by various ``market
participants.'' She declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer activists have charged that power companies are gouging
consumers by jacking up wholesale rates during periods of peak
summertime demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wholesale prices are out of control,'' Lynch said. ``The new
structures don't work.''
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to concede that California's 1996 deregulation of
energy markets is a failure, she acknowledged that ``there were
assumptions that simply haven't proven true.''
</P>
<P>
   With San Diego electricity bills soaring and the threat of
blackouts in the Bay Area persisting, Lynch said that ``by
anybody's measure, we have problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The PUC is slated to take up the matter of San Diego's energy
crisis at its meeting Thursday. Lynch refused to speculate on what
the commission may decide, although it is widely expected to adopt
a measure allowing deregulation to run its course.
</P>
<P>
   She said her report to the governor is intended to initiate a
far-reaching discussion on how to address the state's electricity
woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report is a first attempt to call it like it is,'' Lynch
said. ``We shouldn't be concentrating on whose fault it is. We
should be concentrating on what works.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``It's still too early to tell exactly what direction
we should go.''

MUST-SEE GAME SHOW BOOSTS DISNEY STOCK
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Investors in The Walt Disney Co. may be the
ultimate winners from ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' as the
ratings powerhouse is expected to be largely credited with driving
strong third-quarter earnings released today.
</P>
<P>
   The media giant's theme parks will also propel the company's
continued rebound, analysts predicted, but the most startling
numbers should come from the popular ABC game show.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a consensus of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson
Corp., Burbank-based Disney should report net income of 24 cents
per share for the third quarter ending June 30, an increase of 4
cents a share over the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   For its fiscal year 2000, which ends Sept. 30, analysts expect
Disney to earn 83 cents per share, compared with 66 cents per share
in 1999. Strong earnings are expected to continue in the fourth
quarter, with Merrill Lynch already revising its fourth-quarter
projection from 16 cents per share to 19 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has turned out to be a very good year because of
`Millionaire,' '' said Jessica Reif-Cohen, an analyst with Merrill
Lynch. ``It's what's driving a lot of the upside.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts warn that too much may be riding on ``Millionaire,''
with Merrill Lynch noting that a ratings slowdown for the show was
the ``one material risk'' it saw for Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Disney spokesman Ken Green declined to comment on the estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Disney gained 63 cents, or 1.5 percent, to close at
$40.125 on volume of 4.5 million shares on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Just nine months ago, as Disney was struggling to turn around
its business, its stock hit $24 on a bearish forecast by Chairman
Michael Eisner that profits wouldn't rebound at all this year.
</P>
<P>
   While ad revenue at Disney's ABC network and its
owned-and-operated stations is expected to show remarkable growth
-- up some 80 percent in operating income -- the company's theme
parks will contribute more in terms of total dollars to the bottom
line, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The theme parks are expected to report a 12 percent growth in
operating revenue for the third quarter, up from about $497 million
last year to about $555 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dragging on the company's continued rebound are weakness in its
consumer products and studio business, particularly the home video
division, said Scott Davis of First Union.
</P>
<P>
   The projected earnings exclude losses at Disney's GO.com, the
struggling Internet site that is being revamped for a relaunch in
September. On Wednesday, Disney announced revenue from its Internet
operations increased 39 percent in the third quarter, yet operating
losses reached about $83 million, or 34 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   GO.com lost 6.3 cents to closed at $10.625.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically the strength of the media networks, given the
strength of the advertising market and the rating gains at ABC, are
propelling the company forward,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising boom enjoyed at Disney and across the media is
expected to continue through the next year, said Paine Webber's
Christopher Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more companies are recognizing that to compete in an
accelerating, complex economy, they're going to need to increase
marketing and advertising,'' Dixon said. ``The big question is
whether ABC and `Who Wants to be a Millionaire' can capture and
build momentum as we move into next year.''

ROOKIE WIDEOUT SETS ASIDE HOOP DREAM, CATCHES ON WITH SEAHAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ Darrell Jackson breaks free up the middle and
leaps to meet the pass. He makes one move, then another, and even
throws in a third _ just because he can. As the defender closes
quickly from the side, Jackson ...
</P>
<P>
   Dunks the ball over Isiah Thomas?
</P>
<P>
   We interrupt Seahawks training camp to share Jackson's recurring
dream as a kid growing in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson always wanted to be a professional athlete, but figured
it would be in the NBA _ not the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was never supposed to happen,'' the rookie wide receiver
from Florida said during the players' lunch break at Eastern
Washington University. ``My dream was to play in the NBA. Everybody
always said I'd end up playing in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is Jackson doing here? And why has he been even better
than advertised when the Seahawks drafted him in the third round in
April?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the first question is, getting open and catching
passes. As for the second, it's a combination of outstanding
coaching and even better athletic ability.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson returned to practice Tuesday after missing five days
with a strained hip. After an understandably slow start, he was
making the same kind of plays Wednesday that he made during the
first four days of camp _ displaying the talent that is making
Jackson the favorite to win the third spot behind starters Derrick
Mayes and Sean Dawkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that Darrell was a really good player, and he came in
and was every bit as good as we thought, and more,'' head coach
Mike Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``more'' Holmgren spoke of involves Jackson's route-running
ability. It was apparent during spring minicamps, and it is the
reason Jackson has not only been making catches here, but getting
open even when the ball doesn't come his way _ and not just a
little open, but open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing, really. Some of the things you try to teach
guys, he already knows,'' quarterback Jon Kitna said. ``Some guys
never even fully understand what it means to work the top of your
route and come out of your route.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just does it naturally. Darrell is polished and fluid.''
</P>
<P>
   And a good student.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson credits his position coach at Tampa Catholic High School
_ Carl McGee, who played tight end with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers _
and University of Florida assistant Dwayne Dixon, who also played
three seasons with the Bucs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started me off young and taught me how to run routes _
get the proper depth and sticks and stuff,'' said Jackson, who
didn't begin playing football until his sophomore year in high
school.
</P>
<P>
   McGee and Dixon taught him well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darrell seems to be so complete that the catch is actually the
least of his worries,'' Kitna said.
</P>
<P>
   That's another story _ those hands that are strong, yet supple.
</P>
<P>
   Again, credit Dixon. At Florida, he used the ``Jerry Rice
drill'' to transform the hands of a point guard into the hands of a
wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   In the drill, patterned after the way Rice strengthened his Hall
of Fame-caliber hands by snagging bricks for his father, a mason,
the Florida receivers would catch bricks, one in each hand, 50
times. Drop one _ whether it be the first or the 50th _ and it's
back to one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me concentrate and improved my grip,'' Jackson said.
``It helped me to really focus on the ball because if you drop one
you've got to start all over again, no matter how far you had
gotten. It got me stronger, improved my confidence and really
helped me become a better receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Make that a very good receiver, and a very productive receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Jackson led the Gators with 67 receptions for 1,156
yards and nine touchdowns. When Travis Taylor, the 10th overall
pick by the Baltimore Ravens, was injured, Jackson stepped in and
tied a school record with six consecutive 100-yard games.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Seahawks are counting on Jackson to help fill the
void created by the trade of Joey Galloway to the Dallas Cowboys in
February and the release of Mike Pritchard last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little more every day, I see glimpses of me as a rookie in
Darrell,'' said Derrick Mayes, the Seahawks' leading receiver last
season. ``He wants the challenge. He feels like he can do just as
much as anyone out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's awesome,'' Mayes said. ``You've got to feel that way in
this business. And it's not an attitude. Like I always say, `Don't
be confident. Be convinced.' He has shown a lot of signs of that
early.''
</P>
<P>
   As for those early dreams of playing in the NBA, Jackson had to
abandon them when he got to Florida. But he remains proof that
while you can take the point guard out of the game, it's much more
difficult to take the point guard out of the player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the ball. It comes from my basketball background,''
Jackson said. ``I was a point guard, so I always had the ball, or
was working to get free to get the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   He still is.

 Nineteen innings later, it's back to work for Varitek  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Jason Varitek had a big night Wednesday, catching the
best pitcher in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez was on the hill at Safeco Field for the Red Sox _
the closest thing to a guarantee as you can get in this game.
</P>
<P>
   Cagey, catlike, fierce _ Martinez performs magic on the mound,
unless you are the Mariners, who fizzled Wednesday when the Boston
ace went nine innings to demoralize them, 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   Catching Martinez, Varitek said, is intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man has got such great stuff. It's explosive, so it can
really take off on you in a heartbeat. You have to be sharp,'' said
Varitek, who knows something big happens almost every time Martinez
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Varitek had had a big night the night before last
night.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe it wasn't (BEGIN ITAL) big (END ITAL) so much as it
was
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen innings.
</P>
<P>
   Five hours and 34 minutes _ the longest game in the major
leagues this season.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek was behind the plate for every single pitch thrown by
all seven pitchers used by Boston, from knuckleballer Tim Wakefield
down to Jeff Fassero, who gave up the game-winning homer in the
bottom of the 19th to Mike Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek said it took him a long time to go to sleep after the
game and ``I had a few kinks I had to work out'' upon waking up.
Still, he had no complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never once during the game looked at it like I would have to
play 19 innings, that it would be all mine. You just keep going,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Boston manager Jimy Williams was eager to call
Varitek ``fearless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real warrior. And he (was) in there again (Wednesday
night). I told him if he played again, I'd give him (Wednesday)
off,'' Williams said, joking since the Red Sox have an off day .
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason's done very well since he came over in that trade (from
Seattle). He's gotten an awful lot of big hits for us and behind
the plate, he's extremely durable,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Durability was a big buzz word.
</P>
<P>
   All around the Puget Sound area Wednesday, baseball fans were
separating the wheat from the chaff.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction to be drawn?
</P>
<P>
   Those who had stayed up as Tuesday turned to the wee hours
Wednesday to watch the epic game, and those _ probably not REAL
baseball fans _ who succumbed to heavy eyelids and slinked off to
bed before the Cameron homer.
</P>
<P>
   All day Wednesday, from office water coolers to the clubhouses
of both the Mariners and the Red Sox, people who stuck out the
whole game wore their endurance like a badge of honor.
</P>
<P>
   But no one deserved the badge more than Varitek, not even
Martinez, who said he went back to the team hotel after the 15th
inning and tried to go to bed.
</P>
<P>
   As Martinez tossed and turned in bed, Varitek was still behind
the plate as the clock struck 12:42 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Three summers ago, the Mariners packaged Varitek and Derek Lowe
in a pennant-chase deal and shipped them to Boston for reliever
Heathcliff Slocumb. And while the Mariners have been satisfied with
the superior defensive ability of Dan Wilson, Varitek has proved
more potent and productive with the bat. He has emerged as an
integral part of the AL East contending Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a lot to learn, both as a hitter and a catcher,''
Varitek said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Varitek showed just how durable he is. After
the 19-inning marathon, he came out and hammered a two-run double
in the Red Sox four-run first inning against Freddy Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   But his real thrill, and perhaps the primary reason why Varitek
was the first Red Sox player in the dugout Wednesday afternoon is
because of the work he gets to do with Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Tired or not, Varitek was ready to work with the Red Sox ace,
who has not lost a road game all season, and who Boston believes
will lead them back to the AL Championship Series _ where Martinez
was awesome last October.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Martinez watched from the dugout as his
teammates piled up a 4-0 lead in the first inning _ the kind of
cushion that let Martinez know he was in his control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was over right away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is the picture of precision, in his insightful
commentary and on the mound. He knew he had to go as deep as he
could to bail out his fatigued bullpen. He kept his pitch count to
120, throwing 87 for strikes, and keeping Alex Rodriguez and Edgar
Martinez from touching him.
</P>
<P>
   From where he was sitting, Varitek couldn't help but almost rave
about what it's like to work with Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such an intelligent pitcher. You want to get into a
rhythm with him so he's not shaking off the first 10 signs. It's
fun when you get two mind working together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has sort of evolved how we've been able to come
together out there. I caught about 30 of his starts last year, so
it's gotten to the point where you're a pitcher and a catcher
seeing the same thing together. I've gotten to be like him in that
you're staying one step ahead of the hitter. It's like we're on the
same page.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes an alert, fresh mind and spring in your knees to keep
up with Martinez. Varitek, barely rested after the 19 inning
marathon, found himself inspired to go back to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what he does tonight, enjoy him. It's a wonder
what he does, especially in a time when hitters and teams are doing
what they do. And he does it in the American League where there's a
designated hitter. He's got to get nine hitters.''

NESTLE USA PARES POTATO_PROCESSING UNIT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ Nestle USA Inc. is selling its Food Services
Division's processed potato business to J.R. Simplot Co., a company
spokeswoman confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the purchased assets
have annual sales of more than $300 million. The deal is also
subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close within the
next 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   The three potato processing plants being sold are located in
Nampa and Othello, Idaho, and at Moses Lake, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We viewed the Nestle business and the three plants as an
opportunity to expand our business,'' said J.R. Simplot spokesman
Fred Zerza. ``They have good plants, good people, and quality
customer service.''
</P>
<P>
   Rita Henderson, a Nestle spokeswoman, said after an extensive
evaluation of the potato business the company decided to
concentrate on other sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We determined that future opportunities for our long-term
profitable growth would be greater in other sectors of the food and
beverage categories in which we compete,'' said Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Boise, Idaho, J.R. Simplot has been in the potato
processing business for 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   Zerza said none of the 1,289 employees at the three plants is
expected to lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>

 Nineteen innings later, it's back to work for Varitek  
 (Subs for previous version; edits throughout)

 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Jason Varitek had a big night Wednesday night,
catching the best pitcher in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez was on the hill at Safeco Field for the Red Sox _
the closest thing to a guarantee as you can get in this game.
</P>
<P>
   Cagey, catlike, fierce _ Martinez performs magic on the mound,
unless you are the Mariners, who fizzled Wednesday night when the
Boston ace went nine innings to demoralize them, 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   Catching Martinez, Varitek said, is intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man has got such great stuff. It's explosive, so it can
really take off on you in a heartbeat. You have to be sharp,'' said
Varitek, who knows something big happens almost every time Martinez
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Varitek had had a big night the night before
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe it wasn't (BEGIN ITAL) big (END ITAL) so much as it
was (BEGIN ITAL) long. (END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen innings.
</P>
<P>
   Five hours and 34 minutes _ the longest game in the major
leagues this season.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek was behind the plate for every single pitch thrown by
all seven pitchers used by Boston, from knuckleballer Tim Wakefield
down to Jeff Fassero, who gave up the game-winning homer in the
bottom of the 19th to Mike Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek said it took him a long time to go to sleep after the
game and ``I had a few kinks I had to work out'' upon waking up.
Still, he had no complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never once during the game looked at it like I would have to
play 19 innings, that it would be all mine. You just keep going,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Boston manager Jimy Williams was eager to call
Varitek ``fearless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real warrior. And he (was) in there again (Wednesday
night). I told him if he played again, I'd give him (Thursday)
off,'' Williams said, joking since the Red Sox have an off day .
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason's done very well since he came over in that trade (from
Seattle). He's gotten an awful lot of big hits for us and behind
the plate, he's extremely durable.''
</P>
<P>
   Durability was a big buzz word.
</P>
<P>
   All around the Puget Sound area Wednesday, baseball fans were
separating the wheat from the chaff.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction to be drawn?
</P>
<P>
   Those who had stayed up as Tuesday turned to the wee hours of
Wednesday to watch the epic game, and those _ probably not real
baseball fans _ who succumbed to heavy eyelids and slinked off to
bed before the Cameron homer.
</P>
<P>
   All day Wednesday, from office water coolers to the clubhouses
of both the Mariners and the Red Sox, people who stuck out the
whole game wore their endurance like a badge of honor.
</P>
<P>
   But no one deserved the badge more than Varitek _ not even
Martinez, who said he went back to the team hotel after the 15th
inning and tried to go to bed.
</P>
<P>
   As Martinez tossed and turned in bed, Varitek was still behind
the plate as the clock struck 12:42 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Three summers ago, the Mariners packaged Varitek and Derek Lowe
in a trading-deadling deal and shipped them to Boston for reliever
Heathcliff Slocumb. And while the Mariners have been satisfied with
the superior defensive ability of Dan Wilson, Varitek has proved
more potent and productive with the bat. He has emerged as an
integral part of the playoff-contending Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a lot to learn, both as a hitter and a catcher,''
Varitek said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Varitek showed just how durable he is. After
the 19-inning marathon, he came out and hammered a two-run double
in the Red Sox's four-run first inning against Freddy Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   But his real thrill, and perhaps the primary reason why Varitek
was the first Red Sox player in the dugout Wednesday afternoon, is
because of the work he gets to do with Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Tired or not, Varitek was ready to work with the Red Sox ace,
who has not lost a road game all season, and who Boston believes
will lead them back to the American League Championship Series _
where Martinez was awesome last October.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Martinez watched from the dugout as his
teammates piled up a 4-0 lead in the first inning _ the kind of
cushion that let Martinez know he was in his control.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is the picture of precision, in his insightful
commentary and on the mound. He knew he had to go as deep as he
could to bail out his fatigued bullpen. He kept his pitch count to
120, throwing 87 for strikes, and keeping Alex Rodriguez and Edgar
Martinez from touching him.
</P>
<P>
   From where he was sitting, Varitek couldn't help but almost rave
about what it's like to work with Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such an intelligent pitcher. You want to get into a
rhythm with him so he's not shaking off the first 10 signs. It's
fun when you get two mind working together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has sort of evolved how we've been able to come
together out there. I caught about 30 of his starts last year, so
it's gotten to the point where you're a pitcher and a catcher
seeing the same thing together. I've gotten to be like him in that
you're staying one step ahead of the hitter. It's like we're on the
same page.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes an alert, fresh mind and spring in your knees to keep
up with Martinez. Varitek, barely rested after the 19-inning
marathon, found himself inspired to go back to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what he does tonight, enjoy him,'' Varitek said
before the game. ``It's a wonder what he does, especially in a time
when hitters and teams are doing what they do. And he does it in
the American League where there's a designated hitter. He's got to
get nine hitters.''

 M's no match for Pedro; AL West lead shrinks to two  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ On Tuesday night stretching into Wednesday morning, it
took the Red Sox and the Mariners 111 outs to determine a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, it took just one.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the dominance of Boston starter Pedro Martinez that when
the Red Sox scored four times off Freddy Garcia Wednesday night
before the Seattle starter recorded the game's second out, the game
was effectively over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was over right away,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   No false modesty here.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as they gave up four runs, I knew all I had to do was
throw strikes. They'd be desperate to score runs.''
</P>
<P>
   That they were. The two sides played the final eight innings to
make it official, of course. But there is little doubt as to the
outcome of any game in which Martinez is staked to such a lead. The
Mariners averted a shutout by scoring twice in the eighth inning,
but the Red Sox emerged with a 5-2 victory, their second win of the
three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to come back any time from four runs down,''
Mariners designated hitter Edgar Martinez said. ``Against Pedro,
it's even harder. He's so good, you know you aren't going to get
many shots at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Alex Rodriguez said, ``As a player, it's your dream to
face him. He's a great pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the dream is a nightmare. It always has been for the
Mariners, who have faced Martinez six times since he defected from
Montreal to the Red Sox. He's 6-0 in those games, with a 1.00
earned-run average.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been tough on us every time,'' Edgar Martinez said.
``He's got three great pitches. He can locate all of them all the
time. You only hope to get one rally going. We did, in the eighth,
but he made the pitch he needed to get out of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   After an RBI grounder by Mark McLemore and an RBI single by Al
Martin gave the Mariners the faintest glimmer of hope in the
eighth, Pedro Martinez snuffed it, eliciting a double-play grounder
from Stan Javier.
</P>
<P>
   End of game. Or, as the Boston ace said, ``When you mix up your
three pitches the way I was doing, it doesn't make it any easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the man knows his place on the food chain. And he knows
he hurt, or at least briefly stalled, the Mariners' pennant drive.
The loss, coupled with Oakland's 5-4 win over Toronto earlier in
the day, leaves the Mariners just two games head of the A's in the
AL West. That's Seattle's slimmest lead in the division since July
9, the day before the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   The path ahead doesn't get any easier for the Mariners. They
leave Thursday for a seven-day, eight-game road trip that starts
with a Friday-through-Monday series in New York against the AL
East-leading Yankees, the defending World Series champs.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it's four games in three days in Chicago, including
a Tuesday doubleheader. The AL Central-leading White Sox have the
league's best record (65-42).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be fun,'' manager Lou Piniella said completely
seriously, mindful that his team has the second-best record in the
AL at 62-45. ``We're playing two good teams, and our competition
(second-place Oakland) is playing the same two teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming trip might not have quite as much importance had
the Mariners helped themselves more on the just-completed 13-game
homestand. Seattle owns the best record at home (37-19) in the
majors, but went just 7-6 at Safeco Field in their first series
after the All-Star break, failing to take advantage of 2000's
longest homestand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long stretch, 21 games in a row,'' Rodriguez said.
``We're a little tired. The day off is good for us. Playing 19
innings and then facing Pedro is going to be tough on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is one of those athletes of special qualities, one of
which is to be as well known by his first name as by his last.
Pedro is up there with Reggie, Nolan, Tiger, Shaq and Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro's victory also underscored the importance of Mike
Cameron's game-winning homer at 12:42 a.m. Wednesday morning, a
blast that gave the Mariners a 5-4 win in 19 innings. No game is
impossible to win, of course, but facing Martinez makes a
victorious outcome unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face facts. The Mariners have never beaten Martinez. Not
once. He's won every game he's ever pitched against Seattle. So by
winning Tuesday night, the Mariners were assured of at least one
win in the series.
</P>
<P>
   And by giving up four runs in the first, they were assure of
losing the finale.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella thought Garcia might have psyched himself up too much
for facing Martinez. Garcia disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to worry about him,'' Garcia said. ``I don't have
to hit against him. I have to worry about doing my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, four runs in the first isn't the best part of any
pitcher's day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't like it, but what can you do?'' Garcia said. ``You
try to get them the next inning and stay close.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia did that.
</P>
<P>
   But with Pedro as the opposition, the Red Sox were already too
far away.

 &HT;    SAME OLD GOP PUTS ON A MORE LIKABLE FACE(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By RICARDO PIMENTEL(a)

<TEXT>
<P>
   El que engaqa con aparencia de verdad es impostor(beginitalic).
(enditalic)(He who deceives with a truthful appearance is an
impostor).
</P>
<P>
   An old Mexican saying from a new book on sayings, folktales and
wisdom, It's All in the Frijoles(beginitalic), (enditalic)by
Yolanda Nava
</P>
<P>
   The saying comes to mind as the spectacle that is the Republican
National Convention continues to flit past.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, we've heard such noble notions as compassionate
conservatism and leaving no child behind. We had George P. Bush,
the nominee's Latino nephew, and Colin Powell putting high-profile
faces to the GOP's claims of inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   But, we also had a Texas delegation nearly boycotting a speech
on international trade by Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., because he is
gay. Perhaps a dozen satisfied themselves instead by bowing their
heads in prayer during his speech, demonstrating anew that holier
than thou doesn't have much to do with being more caring or polite.
</P>
<P>
   We had a party platform still out of sync with most of the
nation on abortion and that stated flatly that homosexuality is
incompatible with the military and that gays don't deserve the same
protections in law that the rest of us do.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates, despite the more high-profile members, didn't
much look like us either, though we should all aspire to their
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   I'd be surprised if African-American and Latino representation
broke into low double digits, even including those paraded before
the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   We had Arizona Sen. John McCain - who crusades on campaign
finance reform - putting on a happy face as corporate donors hung
their convention banners to signify kinship to and ownership of the
party.
</P>
<P>
   But, for all the transparency at work at the convention, it just
might work.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Americans could be more interested these days in
simply electing someone they can like.
</P>
<P>
   That is what this GOP convention and campaign-to-be is about -
donning the mantle of likability.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Bush, a likable guy, isn't running against Al Gore,
he's running against Bill Clinton, arguably one of our most
unlikable presidents for character flaws all too fresh in memory.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, as part of the Clinton administration, Gore should
bear some of the criticism stemming from governance over the past
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, however, is that this has been a moderately
successful administration that has presided over what is generally
accepted as boom times (though everyone seems to gloss right over
that widening gap between rich and poor).
</P>
<P>
   It's simply more important under these circumstances to link
Gore more with Clinton-the-man than with the administration's
policies. Really, it's about being more likable than Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Gore has sins of his own (as does Bush), but they pale in
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Take Bush's VP pick, the consummate insider Dick Cheney. His
congressional voting record makes Newt Gingrich look like Mother
Teresa, but Cheney is described as likable and affable (and gives
an aura of substance to a candidate who desperately needs it).
</P>
<P>
   And this is a campaign about likability. It's not that the
Republicans really have any illusions about minorities flocking to
sign up. They just know that swing votes may come from the larger,
fair-minded middle, which has an equally difficult time with a
party viewed as mean-spirited and selfish.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are tired of losing and that means muting sentiments
and philosophy still very much part of the GOP, truth be known.
</P>
<P>
   So, here's another saying: Don't put on a tutu and prance on
your tiptoes and tell me you're a pretty ballerina.

ALLIED DOMECQ HAS A NEW PLAN FOR DUNKIN' DONUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects Allied Domecq; attn.: Calif.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may be a nutritionist's nightmare _ or a trencherman's
delight _ but put doughnuts and $5 sandwiches under one restaurant
roof, and maybe add ice cream, and one restaurant company thinks it
has a winning formula for rapid growth and a menu that will appeal
to consumers all day long.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans are familiar with Dunkin' Donuts. In 1997
Dunkin's British parent, Allied Domecq &UR;  &LR; Plc, acquired the Togo's
sandwich chain, and for the last few years, Allied Domecq's
Randolph, Mass.-based quick-service restaurant division has been
testing ``combo'' formats where Dunkin' Donuts and Togo's share a
location and, often, a parking lot and a drive-through window as
well.
</P>
<P>
   After much experimentation, Allied Domecq &UR;  &LR; thinks it has the
right formula, and if it can line up enough real estate, it hopes
to rapidly expand from about 25 of these combo restaurants to as
many as 400 nationwide by the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Domecq &UR;  &LR; also owns Baskin Robbins, the ice cream chain.
Where enough space is available, some new restaurants could be
``trombos.'' At triple combination sites that sell sinkers, subs,
and sundaes, the hope is that there will be a variety of foods that
appeal to consumers morning, noon, and night.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes called ``multi-branding,'' the combining of two or
more restaurants such as a Dunkin' Donuts and a Togo's into a sort
of mini food court has been around for years but is now gaining
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   The company that owns Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and KFC has toyed
with the idea. And Papa Gino's Holdings Corp. of Dedham, Mass.,
which in 1997 bought D'Angelo sandwich shops, opened its first
``dual unit'' last year in Norwood, Mass. Over the next few months,
plans call for the opening of seven or eight more locations that
combine a Papa Gino's and a D'Angelo.
</P>
<P>
   Multi-branding can be ``a winning strategy'' for quick-service
chains, said executive vice president Dennis Lombardi of Technomic
Inc., a firm that tracks the fast-food industry.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, grouping restaurants together offers more choices
and one-stop convenience. For chains, operating three different
food concepts at one location can mean a lot less overhead expense
than operating three separate restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Multi-branding may be ``the future for individual niche
concepts,'' said Groton restaurant consultant Joyce Faiola.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Allied Domecq's quick-service restaurant division
now seems poised for an aggressive rollout of its combos and
trombos.
</P>
<P>
   On the East Coast, plans call for the Dunkin' Donuts brand to
introduce and promote Togo's to its customers in New England, the
mid-Atlantic region, and some Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Togo's, which got its start in San Jose, Calif., is
expected to play a big role in bulking up Dunkin' Donuts' small
presence on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Dunkin' Donuts eyes a California invasion next year as it looks
to going from a handful of West Coast units to at least one hundred
Dunkin' Donuts-Togo's combos in a brief time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we go, we'll go fast,'' said Mark Richardson, vice
president for multi-branding at Allied Domecq's quick-service
division.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to raise its awareness in New England, Togo's is airing
its first radio and TV ad campaign in Greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   With loving closeups of pastrami and barbecued chicken, ads
extol the virtues of the Togo's sandwich. The tagline for the ads:
``Let us make you one.'' Ads were tied to a promotion in which
Dunkin' Donuts customers received coupons for Togo's sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to expose the Dunkin' Donuts customer to Togo's,''
Richardson said. ``Once we have awareness, Togo's does well.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied Domecq &UR;  &LR; doesn't expect to sell doughnuts, chicken
sandwiches, and ice cream to a single consumer all at the same
time. Rather, it aims to offer consumers different products at
different times of day.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Dunkin' Donuts' 4,100 restaurants reported sales of
$2.14 billion, and consultant Lombardi reckoned a big chunk of
those sales came before noon.
</P>
<P>
   Togo's gets the chain into the lunch business, something Dunkin'
Donuts couldn't do on its own. And Baskin Robbins is generally at
its busiest between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   By combining the three concepts, ``you can appeal to people
throughout a 12-hour period,'' consultant Faiola noted.
</P>
<P>
   With about 300 restaurants and 1999 sales of $167 million,
Togo's is competing in a tough $6.4 billion market for
quick-service sandwiches, in which one of the biggest players is
Subway, a chain with nearly 14,500 units. Privately held Subway of
Milford, Conn., does not report sales.
</P>
<P>
   With ``made-for-you'' sandwiches in the $5 range, Togo's aims to
keep it simple. It doesn't do french fries. It doesn't do pockets
or wraps, said Richardson, who claims that Togo's fare is more
upscale and of a higher quality than Subway's.
</P>
<P>
   Subway spokesman Les Winograd strongly disagreed with that
characterization. Subway, he said, offers a far wider variety of
sandwiches, including gourmet subs, at a range of prices.
</P>
<P>
   At roughly 205 D'Angelo locations, many entrees fall into the $5
range. D'Angelo also offers a line of grilled sandwiches, and its
bread is made daily at a company-owned bakery.
</P>
<P>
   Togo's features ``a lot of sprouts and avocado and West
Coast-type vegetables,'' said Bill Chiccarelli, Papa Gino's
director of marketing. ``D'Angelo is more into mainstream
mom-and-pop vegetables like pickles, onions, and tomatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   After upgrading D'Angelo's systems, Papa Gino's looks to grow
more rapidly. One potential growth vehicle is the ``dual unit''
restaurant, with D'Angelo aiming at a lunch customer and Papa
Gino's going after the dinner trade. The company also has high
hopes for a new D'Angelo format configured for mall food courts.
</P>
<P>
   As chains try to expand, they all face the same problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real estate market is fairly tough right now,''
Chiccarelli said.
</P>
<P>
   A Dunkin' Donuts veteran, Chiccarelli recalled that when
Starbucks Corp. arrived in the Boston area, dire predictions were
made about Starbucks taking business from Dunkin' Donuts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, both chains thrived, in part because consumers began
drinking more coffee. Chiccarelli thinks something similar could
happen with sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible in this era of concern about health, vanity, and
cholesterol that consumers can increase their food intake? Don't
bet against it. In 1999 spending on quick-service pizza and
doughnuts rose nearly 9 percent, according to Technomic.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to health food and diets, said consultant Faiola,
``People talk the talk, but they don't walk the walk.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: An assault on the ``violent'' Bible
 &HT;    For release Aug. 6, 2000
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Germany last week, two lawyers asked the nation's Minister
for the Family and the Elderly to classify the Bible as dangerous
to children, much as some in the United States last month condemned
the latest Harry Potter book as not only violent but anti-Christian
as well.
</P>
<P>
   The latter complaint is based on young Harry's magical powers, a
dominion they believe is God's and God's alone _ not Harry
Potter's, not Superman's, not Batman's, not even Merlin's or Tiger
Woods'.
</P>
<P>
   Book police are everywhere. It was only a matter of time until
they got to the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the religious manuscript is violent, quite violent. It
also includes some segments dealing with sex that you wouldn't want
your children to read, or understand.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to condemn the Bible, or even to take sides as to
whether the book is the true word of the Almighty or a piece of
fiction written decades, maybe centuries, after the periods it
claims to represent. It simply is to point out that no written word
is safe from those who would anoint themselves as censors.
</P>
<P>
   The German lawyers, claiming to represent some parents, appealed
to the German cabinet member on the grounds that passages of the
Bible contain ``a gruesomeness difficult to exceed.'' An example I
would cite: I Samuel 18:27.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks on the written word, Bible included, are not new. They
are documented throughout history, most notoriously during the Nazi
era but also including the present time as evidenced by
organizations calling for _ and often receiving -- bans or
revisions of books that are considered, retrospectively, racist,
anti-God or obscene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huckleberry Finn'' and ``A Catcher in the Rye'' are among
those and, now, some would claim, so are ``Harry Potter and the
Goblet of Fire'' _ and the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know that many have called for the Bible to be
categorized as would a PG or R movie, but pointing out the violent
and fornication elements of, particularly, the Old Testament is old
hat and grist for discussion at a time when other publications are
under fire for their permissiveness or brutality.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most virulent and controversial studies of those
elements of the Bible was the 1926 publication of ``The Bible
Unmasked'' by the then well-known atheist Joseph Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with Genesis and continuing book-by-book,
chapter-by-chapter, verse-by-verse, Lewis cited passages of extreme
violence and what he considered bizarre sexual behavior -- behavior
that many of our present-day fundamentalist leaders would be hard
pressed to defend, or explain. Example: Genesis 16:1-6.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' book never made any best-seller list and was more
strongly condemned by the public than any condemnations he meted
out. But I found a portion of his introduction to be quite
prophetic. ``...What is immoral in one age,'' he wrote in 1926,
``may, at some other time, be considered moral and what we today
may consider moral and acceptable, may at some future date be
condemned as being immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   What could have prompted the German lawyers to seek a likely
unpopular not-for-children classification of the Bible ? Other than
for personal publicity, it must have been on behalf of people who,
pushed to the limit over fundamentalist-imposed restrictive
classification of other reading material, have decided to strike
back.
</P>
<P>
   Had Huck Finn, instead of Rabshakeh, said what she said in my
version of Isaiah 36:12, the censors would taken out their long
knives. Little is expected to come of the German issue. Sadly, the
lesson it likely was planned to teach _ tolerance of expression _
will be lost on the general public in Germany or anywhere. It also
would show that book police don't really protect; they bully
selective targets.
</P>
<P>
   And even the Bible can be one of those targets.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By SARA KENNEDY  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    If competition breeds creativity, then the theme parks in and
around Orlando are a case in point. They have some of the most
imaginative ways for guests to spend their leisure time. Everything
from a roller coaster that shoots its human cargo from the starting
gate with all the subtlety of a missile launcher to a beautiful
carousel based on the art of Dr. Seuss greet visitors to Orlando
theme parks this summer.
 &HT;    Vacationers will also find an entirely new park, SeaWorld's
Discovery Cove, which opened July 1. It features a tropical, beachy
setting populated with 10,000 fish and 300 birds. Guests can play
with dolphins under the supervision of trainers, and enjoy
leisurely swimming, snorkeling and sunning with smaller crowds and
no lines, thanks to a daily limit of 1,000 patrons.
 &HT;    Orlando's theme parks, which last year attracted more than 60
million visitors (up from 48.5 million in 1996), are trying to
handle the crush of crowds better. Discovery Cove's competitors are
trying various ways to cut down waiting lines, a chief complaint of
theme park customers.
 &HT;    Walt Disney World has inaugurated Fastpass, in which guests can
pick up free tickets near its 18 most popular attractions for later
in the day when the lines are shorter. Universal is testing a
similar arrangement called Fast Track. Disney also opens a
different theme park early each day, offering first admittance to
guests at Disney hotels. Until Sept. 4, Universal is rewarding
multiday ticket holders and its hotel guests with early entry to
its two parks, from 7 to 10 a.m. daily.
 &HT;    A spring drought that fueled wildfires and meant watering
restrictions for millions of Floridians seems to have left the
theme parks unscathed. During visits in June, pathways were lined
with bright blooms of bougainvillea and hibiscus, big shade trees
were heavy with foliage, and the acres of perfectly trimmed grass
were as lush as always.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Theme parks aren't the only show in Orlando, believe it or not.
Although the calendar of special events seems to thin out a bit in
summer, diversions exist elsewhere in the city.
 &HT;    This summer, audience members help solve a mystery set in deep
space at the Orlando Science Center's planetarium. Performances,
which run through Aug. 31, feature a planetarium show and a live
actor. It's based on the PBS geographical quiz show ``Where in the
World Is Carmen San Diego,'' and is included with admission to the
center: $14.25, seniors $13.25, ages 3 to 11 $11.
 &HT;    Through Sept. 10, ``Hunters of the Sky'' looks at birds of prey,
with over 70 mounted specimens of falcons, eagles, owls and other
raptors. The center, at 777 East Princeton St., is open daily;
(407) 896-7151.
 &HT;    Through Sept. 3, ``Art of the 20th Century,'' at the Cornell
Fine Arts Museum, on Holt Avenue at Rollins College in Winter Park,
looks at the last 100 years through European and American painting,
sculpture, prints and drawings from the permanent collection. Free
admission; closed Monday. Call (407) 646-2526.
 &HT;    The Orlando Museum of Art, 2416 North Mills Ave. in Loch Haven
Park, will display beadwork, baskets and decorated animal hides
from Kenya, Tanzania and other East African countries. The
exhibition runs through May 27. Admission is $6, seniors and
students $4, ages 4 to 11 $2; closed Monday: (407) 896-4231.
 &HT;    The Orlando-University of Central Florida Shakespeare Festival
begins Sept. 20, with previews of ``The Woman in Black,'' a
Victorian mystery by Stephen Mallatratt, from a book by Susan Hill,
which runs through Oct. 28. Performances are at the Orange County
Historical Museum Theatre in Loch Haven Park, at Princeton and
Mills Avenues in Orlando. Tickets: $7 to $20; (407) 893-4600.
 &HT;    At Disney's Wide World of Sports, adjacent to the theme parks,
the 2000 Junior Olympic Games, the Amateur Athletic Union's top
event, features track and field competition from July 31 through
Aug. 5. The 250-acre complex is off Exit 25B of I-4. Daily general
admission is $9, ages 3 to 9, $7; (407) 939-1505.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    At Discovery Cove, off Exits 27A and 28 of I-4, guests come face
to face with bottlenose dolphins. They can touch the animals, and
trainers allow some patrons to play water games with the dolphins.
The park requires reservations. It employs one staff member for
every five guests to provide supervision for the dolphins, better
service and no waiting lines. Admission is $179 for ages 6 and
older who want to swim with dolphins; ages 3 to 5 and those
skipping a dolphin swim pay $89.
 &HT;    Admission includes a meal outside at the Laguna Grill, use of
snorkeling and beach gear (towels, chairs, hammocks), and a
seven-day pass to the original SeaWorld park nearby, where visitors
can see Shamu and ride the Kraken, a roller coaster that made its
debut last month; (877) 434-7268.
 &HT;    Otherwise, ticket prices are one area where Orlando's theme
parks don't show variety. Prices for a one-day, one-park ticket for
ages 10 and up at Disney World's theme parks are $46; ages 3 to 9,
$37. The Magic Kingdom and Disney-MGM Studios are off Exit 25B;
Epcot and Animal Kingdom, Exit 26B. For all Disney parks
information: (407) 824-4321.
 &HT;    Ticket prices are the same at SeaWorld, at Exits 27A and 28,
(407) 351-3600; and Universal, at Exits 30A and 29B, (407)
363-8000. Various multipark and multiday tickets are also
available.
 &HT;    The theme-park attractions with the highest profile _ in the
physical sense _ are roller coasters, and Orlando boasts a crop of
wild new ones. SeaWorld's Kraken rises 15 stories, then plunges its
screaming passengers toward earth at 65 m.p.h. Riders on the
Incredible Hulk are practically blown out of the starting gate from
what looks like a giant missile launcher at Universal's Islands of
Adventure park, which opened in May 1999.
 &HT;    The Rock 'n' Roller Coaster at Disney-MGM Studios, which opened
a year ago, treats its riders to an equally explosive start,
accelerating from zero to 60 m.p.h. in 2.8 seconds, with the music
of the band Aerosmith pumped through the seats.
 &HT;    A simulator game that pits guests of DisneyQuest, an indoor
interactive playground, against the same motley gang from the
Pirates of the Caribbean ride opened June 21 outside the park in
Downtown Disney. Four players, all wearing three-dimensional
goggles, board a sailing ship under attack (its deck sickeningly
weaves and rolls on springs controlled by computer) and defend
themselves with cannons. Tickets cost $27, ages 3 to 9, $21.
 &HT;    Universal's ``Terminator 2,'' a film that opened in 1996 at
Universal Studios Theme Park, involves three-dimensional thrills
and bizarre special effects, including fog and rain. It's the usual
end-of-the-world scenario, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, complete
with realistic guns booming and screeching pileups.
 &HT;    One of the most elegant new rides is the beautiful interactive
carousel of Dr. Seuss animals _ pull the reins and hair might fly
up or a tongue stick out _ at Islands of Adventure. The bright pink
and blue carousel is based on the art of Dr. Seuss.
 &HT;    One park that has no problem with crowds is Splendid China, a
76-acre park opened in 1993 by a Chinese company to acquaint
Americans with the country's culture. It features nearly deserted
gardens with more than 60 miniature models of historical Chinese
sites.
 &HT;    Sparse crowds usually greet its chief daily theatrical
production, the ``Mysterious Kingdom of the Orient'' _ a pity since
it is a knockout performance of colorful costumes, traditional
Chinese song and dance, acrobatics and martial arts. Follow Route
192 west from I-4 to Exit 25B in Kissimmee (directions and ticket
information from park employees may be incorrect). Admission costs,
which include the show and a terrible meal, are $19.95, and $9.95
ages 5 to 12. Call (407) 396-7111 or (800) 244-6226.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    It's always easier to park your car and stay on the grounds of a
theme park, but hotels and food usually cost more. A moderately
priced choice is Disney's All-Star Resorts, at Exit 26B of I-4,
with a mammoth complex of 5,760 basic rooms with outdoor pools,
bakery, food court and free bus service to Disney attractions.
Rooms are $74 to $104 a night; (407) 934-7639.
 &HT;    Minutes east of the theme parks is the Hampton Inn-Orlando
Convention Center hotel, 8900 Universal Blvd., which opened in
April 1999. The staff is helpful and friendly; there is a heated
outdoor pool; the free Continental breakfast includes cereals,
bagels, yogurt, fruit and waffles; and the 170 spotless rooms, with
maple furniture and decorated in bright, tropical colors, are $69
to $109, depending on the season; (407) 354-4447, fax (407)
354-3031.
 &HT;    Budget: A simple hotel tucked away off Interstate 4, the Comfort
Inn Maingate South is an easy 15-minute ride from most of the theme
parks. It is off I-4 Exit 23, eight miles west of Walt Disney World
at 5510 U.S. Highway 27 North. Its 150 rooms cost $40 to $100, more
on holidays; outdoor pool; (800) 255-4386, fax (863) 424-1723.
 &HT;    Luxury: Elegant, sand-colored Italian marble and huge bouquets
of native orchids give the lobby of the Peabody Orlando, 9801
International Drive, a distinctive Florida feel, and it's fun to
watch the hotel's mascot ducks cavort in the fountain. Its 891
modern rooms are decorated in yellow and moss green; doubles are
$330 a night; outdoor pool and children's pool with waterfall;
(407) 352-4000, fax (407) 351-0073.
 &HT;    The Grand Floridian Resort and Spa, Disney's sprawling
Victorian-style hotel, boasts 900 quaint rooms, decorated with
printed wall coverings, marble-top sinks, ceiling fans and
Victorian woodwork. Big gingerbread porches with climbing roses
overlook a lagoon on theme park grounds with a man-made beach and
two outdoor pools, one for children. Off Exit 25B. Doubles are $304
to $400; (407) 824-3000, fax (407) 824-3186.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    At Universal's CityWalk, a 30-acre dining and entertainment
complex, Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville is (what else?) completely
casual. Try conch fritters dipped in honey-mustard sauce, followed
by Caribbean grilled chicken salad, topped with almonds and
habanero-mango ranch dressing, and key lime pie for dessert. Dinner
for two with margaritas, about $50; (407) 224-2155.
 &HT;    Nearby, also at CityWalk, you'll find Emeril's, the Orlando
branch of a series of restaurants owned by the popular TV chef
Emeril Lagasse. Reservations are recommended. Specialties include
an appetizer of Maine lobster cheesecake; roasted rack of lamb with
a Creole mustard sauce, and fresh Florida orange cake with
strawberry compote. Dinner for two with wine, $125; (407) 224-2424.
 &HT;    Of all the theme parks, SeaWorld serves some of the best food,
and its casual Bimini Bay restaurant, with waiters and waitresses
wearing Hawaiian shirts, is typical. The menu features salads,
pasta and seafood; try the fresh Florida grouper sandwich or
marinated steak on a roll with sauteed onions and peppers. Lunch
for two with beer costs about $40 (you must have a park pass);
(407) 351-3600.
 &HT;    Two sessions of a gospel brunch occur every Sunday morning at
the House of Blues Music Hall, at Downtown Disney (where no park
pass is needed), featuring nationally known and local gospel
performers, and an all-you-can-eat Southern buffet. The meal and
show cost $28; ages 3 to 9, $15. It's a good idea to buy tickets at
least a week in advance at (407) 934-2583, fax (407) 934-2216, or
at the House of Blues box office.
 &HT;    A good family-style restaurant near Walt Disney World is
Pebbles, 12551 State Road 535; (407) 827-1111. It serves a nice mix
of dishes adults enjoy, like the excellent black bean soup ($3.25)
or Mediterranean salad ($7.50), and child-friendly items like the
cheeseburger ($6.95)and white chocolate mousse ($3.95).

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By ANNASUE MCCLEAVE WILSON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It is hard to admit to being a soccer mom. That cliched title is
easier to bear, however, when the games are played on a crescent
moon of a beach in Brazil, where the team kicks up sand as white
and soft as baby powder.
 &HT;    Our family loves soccer, that jogo bonito, ``beautiful game,''
as they call it in Brazil. My son John, 14, has played since
kindergarten, and his coach, Paulo Barreto, is a Brazilian who
played professionally there. His Cincinnati company, Paulo's
Brazilian Soccer Training and Camp, began organizing trips last
year to his hometown, Florianopolis.
 &HT;    The coin toss to see whether my husband, John, or I would
accompany John on a trip there last March was agonizing. Not only
was the trip too expensive for everyone to go, but we would have
had to take our two younger children out of school. I won.
 &HT;    This particular eight-day trip was designed for a team, but not
all of John's team, the Cincinnati Classics, participated, so they
were supplemented by other boys and girls of the same age and
ability from around Cincinnati. Parents were welcome, and of the 17
players, only 5 traveled without a parent, making us a group of 39.
 &HT;    Other camps offer various levels of training and can include
international tournament play for players who hope to play at the
college level and beyond, but this trip offered the right balance
of soccer and vacation for us. Our trip revolved around three
matches with local teams and four morning training sessions, but
equally important was the beachfront hotel and organized afternoon
sightseeing.
 &HT;    Florianopolis, on the island of Santa Catarina, is about 350
miles down the coast from Sao Paulo. Our 24-hour trip was not made
easier by the way we were routed by the travel agency _ through
Detroit, Miami and Sao Paulo _ but the teenagers seemed oblivious
to the inconvenience.
 &HT;    When they weren't giving water to thirsty dogs in travel cages
or bumping into airport police officers on bikes, they managed to
find enough open space at each stopover to kick around a soccer
ball. In Sao Paulo, they sprawled over the floor of the airport
terminal, lounging or sleeping on backpacks.
 &HT;    Several in our group thought the island of Santa Catarina, on
which most of the city of Florianopolis is built, looked like one
of the islands of Hawaii from the air. The hilly countryside is
laden with subtropical flora, and both land and sea are dotted with
ancient black boulders that must have looked like gods to the
Tupi-Guarani Indians who first inhabited the region. The island is
connected to the mainland by two bridges, although one, the
Hercilio Luz, is closed to motor traffic.
 &HT;    Our bright blue hotel, the Ingleses Praia, sat beside a beach
called Praia dos Ingleses, on the northeast shore of the island,
about 22 miles from downtown Florianopolis. The beach was named for
English explorers who poked around there about 1700. Each room had
a balcony, cool tile floors, air-conditioning and surprisingly
spacious bathrooms.
 &HT;    We ate breakfast and occasionally another meal at the hotel,
buffet style. Fruits and juices were fresh and delicious, but all
else paled in the morning before the coffee. It was deeply rich and
black, served with hot milk.
 &HT;    Our first evening at the hotel, the parents in the group were
content to laze wearily on the veranda, drinking caipirinhas, a
lime drink usually made with cachaca, Brazilian sugar-cane liquor.
 &HT;    A few of the boys perused the small strip of beachfront
restaurants and souvenir shops selling T-shirts and crocheted
bikinis and thongs on either side of the hotel (their favorite
souvenirs were fake designer watches, but because the dollar is
strong against the real, almost everything seemed inexpensive).
 &HT;    Afterward, they brought out a ball and began to kick it around
on the beach under the stars. This attracted some local people and
soon a full fledged game was on. Not one Brazilian guy walking
along the beach _ student, vendor or fisherman _ could keep his
foot off the ball if it came near him during our practices, and
their skill was remarkable.
 &HT;    The team's first training session was at the Hotel Fazenda Jomar
on the mainland near Santo Amaro da Imperatriz, a spa town founded
to commemorate an imperial visit in 1845 by Dom Pedro II, emperor
of Brazil. Having traveled inland 18 miles, we were in dense green
mountains, and the group practiced on a field in danger of being
enveloped by the lush vegetation surrounding it.
 &HT;    Afterward, we all took advantage of the resort's amenities. The
team swam in the pool, went rafting in rapids not rapid enough to
be classified, and sank paddle boats in the lake.
 &HT;    On a shaded veranda, an accordionist played German music, a
reminder of the large influx of Germans who emigrated to this part
of Brazil in the 19th century. Several parents joined an ecological
walk around the grounds, which led to a waterfall of rare beauty;
on our way up, we disturbed a lizard the size of a small alligator.
 &HT;    Florianopolis has two professional soccer teams, the Figueirense
Futebol Clube, based on the mainland, and the island's Avai Futebol
Clube, both of which cultivate players from a young age.
 &HT;    After a day of practice and a couple of scrimmages on the beach,
our first match took place against the Figueirense youth team in
the club's stadium in Florianopolis. The Brazilians, who were a
year or two older than John, won, 8-1, which did not seem to
diminish the excitement of playing a challenging opponent.
 &HT;    Our game with the young Avai team two days later took place just
before the professional match between Avai and Caxias (from the
city of Porto Alegre). As the game went on, the stands filled up
with fans who cheered on both teams (we lost, 2-0) but who were
unforgiving of their pro team when it lost.
 &HT;    After the game with Figueirense, our bus took us to the beach at
Joaquina, which is on the east side of the island and is famous for
surfing championships held there each year. After an open-air
lunch, the team wandered the beach, climbing the huge rocks at one
end and examining jellyfish that washed onto the shore.
 &HT;    Behind Praia da Joaquina are massive sand dunes of Saharan
proportion and, even though the wind whipped up the sand so
fiercely it practically blinded them, the team was determined to go
sandboarding. John and the boys happily forged their way up the
dunes over and over again, and dumped their weight in sand onto the
floor of the bus on the way back to the hotel.
 &HT;    The next day, we boarded a schooner and headed for the island of
Anhatomirim, where the team was to practice in the shadow of the
Santa Cruz fort, built in 1744. A Brazilian school group about the
same age as ours happened to be touring the fort, too, and it
wasn't long before another impromptu match was on.
 &HT;    The Brazilian girls watched the American boys with obvious
pleasure, much to the consternation of the Brazilian boys, which
gave the game an edge it might not ordinarily have had.
 &HT;    The Brazilian boys, on the other hand, didn't know what to make
of the four highly skilled girls playing on our team. Only the
parents were in awe of the setting: on one side a centuries-old
fortress and on the other, the magnificent sea.
 &HT;    After morning training another day, the group ventured downtown.
The two bridges to the mainland shadow 19th-century ocher-colored
market buildings along the old waterfront. Across the street from
the Praca 15 de Novembro, the city's main square, John stopped at
the entrance to the pink Cruz e Souza Palace to have his picture
taken beside the guard, who wore an elaborate uniform and held a
rifle with a bayonet.
 &HT;    The team climbed the steps to the bright white Metropolitan
Cathedral, where a Mass was being said, then plopped down
pretending to be exhausted.
 &HT;    Since this day of sightseeing had little appeal for them, the
high point of the excursion was stopping at a shop called Futebol
Mania to buy official Figueirense and Avai jerseys. A few fathers
wandered off to the bus station to find Cuban cigars.
 &HT;    Our meals outside the hotel were in seafood restaurants or in
churrascarias, places serving meat smorgasbords called rodizio (all
you can eat). Seafood lunches were waterside, in open-air
restaurants that served us at long communal tables _ local shrimp
in butter and oil, mussels in salsa, deep-fried whitefish, served
with plates of beets, shredded carrots and tomato, clay pots of
rich black beans, and crisp, deep-fried manioc root.
 &HT;    When Mr. Barreto realized that our ravenous American teen-agers
kept passing on the plates of fish and making faces, he arranged
that they be served chicken with rice and French fries instead.
 &HT;    One evening we were taken to a cafe colonial, a Brazilian-style
high tea inspired by the customs of European immigrants in the 19th
century. On the beach, we snacked on corn on the cob served in the
husk and drank cool milk right from coconuts. The team's favorite
drink was Guarana, sweet green soda with lots of caffeine.
 &HT;    A cultural exchange had been arranged for us the afternoon
before we left at the Colegia Energia, a private school in
Florianopolis that prides itself on its English instruction. When
we arrived, we were met with wild cheers, as if we were a busload
of American movie stars. Our boys were a little stunned at such a
reception and we had to remind them to keep smiling.
 &HT;    The school had prepared a short program and presented each of
our team members with souvenir notebooks. A soccer scrimmage was
held in which our girls soundly beat four Brazilian girls. While
our boys were outclassed on the field, they were mobbed by
Brazilian girls and boys asking for e-mail addresses and
photographs.
 &HT;    Once our team got used to the attention, those who spoke a
little Spanish _ none spoke Portuguese _ tried to talk to the
students, who answered in their halting English.
 &HT;    That evening, we lost our last match, against the Astel Futebol
Clube, but only by a single goal. Once, John collided with an Astel
player, knocking him to the ground. As he would have back home, he
reached down to help the Brazilian to his feet, but was scolded by
Mr. Barreto.
 &HT;    ``Here you leave him alone,'' he said. ``Find him after the game
if you want.''
 &HT;    When we returned to Cincinnati, the team went on to become
division champions, at least partly because of improved soccer
skills. But the trip had also provided the players with a surprise,
the opportunity to represent their country by their actions: How
they played the game did matter.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY SUSAN ALLEN TOTH  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When I have finally opened the mail, unpacked my bags, started
the washing machine, restocked the refrigerator and riffled through
a few newspapers, I am ready to stay home forever.
 &HT;    Yes, I realize, I'm totally exhausted. I stroke our cats,
defrost some homemade soup and soon send my husband, James, to his
office so I can luxuriate in having the house to myself. No, I am
not going to travel again for a long time. Months and months, maybe
longer. Who knows when I'll ever be ready to study another
guidebook or decipher another map?
 &HT;    I am tired of looking at menus. I can't bear to sleep in any
more strange bedrooms. I want to forget all those uneasy searches
for public toilets.
 &HT;    Our friends applaud this decision. They think James and I travel
too much anyway.
 &HT;    ``Of course you have a cold,'' one says. ``Everyone knows you
can't travel on a plane without getting sick.'' Another chimes in:
``How can you complain of not getting any writing done? You're
never home.''
 &HT;    Some urge us to slow down, take it easy. Others suggest getting
back to work, enjoying my garden, volunteering for a local charity.
I'm sure they are right. In fact, as I nod in agreement, I feel
morally invigorated.
 &HT;    Travel is a kind of addiction, I tell myself, and I must simply
let it go for a while. I can. I know I can.
 &HT;    Then something happens. If I could predict it, I might be able
to ward it off. But the travel impulse is sly, mysterious and
dazzlingly sudden.
 &HT;    Last December, glad to be home for the holidays after a hectic
trip to London, I was savoring the prospect of quiet weeks ahead.
Then I opened a Christmas card from a family friend in my Iowa
hometown.
 &HT;    Close to 90 now, cheerful and bright but unable to travel,
Isabel wrote: ``You certainly travel a lot. But do keep it up as
long as you can! I wish I had seen York and Cornwall. But I am so
thankful I didn't miss the Alhambra and the Prado.''
 &HT;    The Alhambra! I thought. The Prado! Why is it we've never been
there? Immediately I began to think of Spain. Why not Portugal too?
Perhaps next fall?
 &HT;    A few days later, on New Year's Eve, I was transfixed by the
televised fantasy of fireworks that lit up the bejeweled Eiffel
Tower. Oh, Paris, beautiful City of Light _ had it really been five
years since we'd walked along the Seine?
 &HT;    I could instantly envision broad boulevards, thin women with
chic silk scarves, and a corner patisserie where I bought a moist
round mouthful of chocolate cake with an indescribably delicious
coffee-flavored icing. Definitely, back to Paris.
 &HT;    Cleaning my desk the following week, I took off the wall an
outdated calendar with large color photographs of waterfalls. I
hadn't really noticed it much. But now I was transfixed by a view
of Upper Yosemite Falls, tumbling down magnificent snow-covered
cliffs.
 &HT;    I hadn't been to Yosemite for more than 30 years, and I barely
remembered my one day there. How could I think of Paris, or Spain,
when I hadn't really experienced Yosemite?
 &HT;    I am helpless against unforeseen assaults on my homebound
intentions. Occasionally, when I am already on a trip, I have a
passing glimpse of a destination that calls to me so seductively I
know I must answer.
 &HT;    One June afternoon, on a fast train from Inverness to London, I
glanced, for only a whizzing moment, far across miles of empty
fields to a tiny village of snug houses clustered around a bay. The
surrounding countryside seemed so undiscovered, the village so
remote.
 &HT;    I studied my map: Alnmouth, Northumberland. Three years later,
we were walking through light rain down its long quiet beach.
 &HT;    On another afternoon, this time in early fall, I sat on a level
rock at the northernmost edge of Scotland and gazed, entranced, at
the distant gray-green shapes of the Orkney Islands half-hidden in
the mist. They seemed as if they belonged to a different world.
``James,'' I said, ``we have to go there.''
 &HT;    James smiled, partly in resignation. ``O.K.,'' he said amiably,
``but why don't we finish this trip first?''
 &HT;    Two Octobers later, we rented a cottage for a week on an Orkney
island called, disarmingly, Mainland.
 &HT;    Sometimes all it takes is a single picture or a few words. We
once spent a week near Cromer, on the north Norfolk coast, because
that was the phrase _ ``the north Norfolk coast'' _ occasionally
appearing in travel guides, that had begun to haunt my imagination.
It sounded so unlike the cozy Cotswolds, or the well-trodden and
prosaically named Lake District, or flowering Kent, the Garden of
England.
 &HT;    Then I read P. D. James' ``Devices and Desires,'' and her
intensely evocative description of that bleak, windswept land made
me determined to see if she was right. And she was.
 &HT;    Although P.D. James first sent me to Norfolk, Arthur Conan Doyle
to Dartmoor and Dylan Thomas to Wales, I am not often struck by the
travel impulse when I read nonfiction travel books. This may seem
odd, since I have indulged in such memoirs myself.
 &HT;    But, after closing a particularly atmospheric or vivid travel
narrative, I tend to think: ``OK. Wonderful. Now I've been there.''
 &HT;    If the author has filled my eyes with his or her personal
vision, I am perversely not moved to explore certain corners of
Provence, or Tuscany, or Patagonia.
 &HT;    If, however, I am swept into a place by reading a novel or
biography, I absorb the landscape sidewise, out of the corner of my
eye. Then I become intrigued.
 &HT;    After finishing Tim Binding's ``Lying With the Enemy,'' a novel
about life in occupied Guernsey during World War II, I asked James,
``Why haven't we ever been to the Channel Islands?'' He looked
blank. I handed him the novel, and the next year, we were off.
 &HT;    My love of Scottish islands began, not with a guidebook, but
with Gavin Maxwell's ``Ring of Bright Water,'' an account of life
with his beloved otters.
 &HT;    I soon tracked Maxwell through his later, much harsher, memoirs,
``The Rocks Remain'' and ``Raven Seek Thy Brother,'' and, after
many years, I eventually looked across the water to the lonely site
of his nearly inaccessible Camusfearna.
 &HT;    As James and I walked parts of the rocky coastline of western
Scotland, and explored Mull and Skye that year, I often thought of
Maxwell's intense, troubled spirit. His love of this land had
brought us there.
 &HT;    Or had it? As a young girl, I used to sit at the piano and play
through ``The Fireside Book of Folk Songs.'' One of my favorites
was ``The Skye Boat Song.'' Its simple, poignant melody had an
unforgettable refrain, especially alluring to an Iowa girl who
lived far from any ocean: ``Carry the lad who was born to be
king/Over the sea to Skye.''
 &HT;    I didn't know the story of Bonnie Prince Charlie, and I had no
idea where Skye was, but I knew loss and regret when I heard it.
Over the sea to Skye: someday perhaps I would know more.
 &HT;    So even a song can start me thinking of travel. After our trip
to Hawaii last winter, James began to play a CD we bought there. He
plays it a lot, especially when it gets really cold outside.
 &HT;    Like James, I had been delighted by our relaxing, balmy week on
Molokai. So when I hear ``Polynesian Love Song'' or ``Lovely Hula
Hands,'' I don't think, ``This is corny.'' No, I want to be back on
our screened lanai, listening to the warm splashing surf a few
yards away.
 &HT;    It doesn't take much. Sometimes I think I should look for an
antidote, but I haven't thought of one yet. Maybe if I muttered
Thoreau's proud boast, ``I have traveled much in Concord''? If I
repeated like a mantra, ``Home is where the heart is''? What about
a CD that played, again and again, ``Home Sweet Home''? I'm not
sure any of it would help.

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The romance of the rails lingers in a handful of deluxe trains
that run on well-orchestrated trips throughout the world.
 &HT;    What's the appeal of such luxury train trips? Vintage rail cars
that have been lavishly restored; itineraries that take passengers
through some of the most beautiful landscapes and cities in the
world; impeccable service; and food that is extraordinary.
 &HT;    For those who can pay the price, here are some elegant journeys
to consider. Prices are per person, based on double occupancy.
 &HT;    The American Spirit (601 Union St., Seattle, WA 98101;
888-533-7245; www.americanspiritrail.com) features 1950s Budd-built
streamliner railcars. The company offers a variety of western
itineraries that include visits to the Glacier, Grand Tetons and
Yellowstone National Parks.
 &HT;    Trips last anywhere from two to nine nights. Accommodations are
in hotels, not on the train, and motorcoaches supplement the rail
service.
 &HT;    A typical itinerary is the ``Montana Rockies Rail Tour,'' which
begins in Post Falls, Idaho, continues on to Missoula, Mont., and
ends in Livingston, Mont. The cost of the two-night trip begins at
$499. Lodging and daily breakfast, as well as transfers from
Spokane Airport, are included.
 &HT;    The American Orient-Express (5100 Main St., Downer's Grove, IL
60515; 888-759-3944; www.americanorientexpress.com) utilizes 15
vintage rail cars on its luxury voyages. The train travels cross
country as well as on shorter trips throughout the West.
 &HT;    For example, the ``Rockies and Yellowstone'' itinerary is a
six-night trip that commences in Denver and visits Arches National
Park, Salt Lake City, Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks.
The cost begins at $2,990.
 &HT;    The best-known name in luxury-train travel is probably
Orient-Express Trains &AMP; Cruises (Sea Containers House, 20 Upper
Ground, London, SE1 9PF, England; 800-524-2420;
www.orient-expresstrains.com or c/o Abercrombie and Kent
International Inc., 1520 Kensington Road, Oak Brook, IL 60523;
800-323-7308; www.abercrombiekent.com). They offer a variety of
rail itineraries for the well-heeled traveler.
 &HT;    The most famous trip is the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express
(VSOE), which features restored period rail cars, lavish service
and fine dining. Sightseeing and meals are included in most
itineraries.
 &HT;    The classic VSOE trip is from London to Paris and Venice, or
vice versa. The cost of this one-night trip starts at $1,970. The
train makes other trips as well, such as from Venice to Florence
and Rome; Venice to Prague, Paris and London; Venice to Lucerne,
Paris and London; and Paris to Budapest, Bucharest and Istanbul.
 &HT;    Orient-Express also offers the Eastern &AMP; Oriental Express, a
luxury train that has three itineraries: Singapore to Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, and Bangkok (and vice versa); Bangkok to Chiang Mai,
Thailand; and Bangkok to Angkor Wat, Cambodia, and Singapore. The
overnight Singapore to Kuala Lumpur itinerary begins at $600.
 &HT;    Among the other Orient-Express trains are the Northern Belle,
which calls itself the ``Orient-Express of the North.'' It offers
day trips and weekend getaways in Britain with departures from
Liverpool, Manchester and York. Again, vintage rail carriages, fine
dining and a high level of service are offered.
 &HT;    Orient Express also operates the Great South Pacific Express in
Australia, a restored luxury train that runs from Brisbane to
Cairns; Brisbane to Sydney; Brisbane to Canberra and Sydney; and
Sydney to Brisbane and Cairns. Contact them for more information.
 &HT;    The Royal Scotsman (c/o Abercrombie and Kent International Inc.
1520 Kensington Road, Oak Brook, IL 60523; 800-323-7308;
www.abercrombiekent.com or www.royalscotsman.com) takes visitors
through the rugged Scottish countryside on some of the beautiful
rails in Britain. The four-night Edinburgh to Edinburgh itinerary
is $4,150.
 &HT;    Beginning in the Scottish capital, the journey takes riders
through the dramatic West Highlands and rolling Perthshire hills
and then to the North East. Two-night trips start at $2,350. Rates
include all meals, wine and alcoholic and beverages as well as
sightseeing visits.
 &HT;    In Canada, the Rocky Mountaineer Railtours (1150 Station St.,
Vancouver, B.C. Canada V6A 2X7; 800-665-7245;
www.rockymountaineer.com) has a variety of trips through the
Canadian Rockies. These trains travel by daylight only, affording
the best views of the mountains. Overnights are spent in hotels.
 &HT;    One of the briefest excursions is the ``Two Day Redleaf Tour,''
a one-night trip through the Canadian Rockies, traveling from

 (Color slide included.) 
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Like anyone living in a popular tourist destination, I developed
a standard tour itinerary years ago for my out-of-town friends who
wish to see all that Reno, Nev., has to offer.
 &HT;    Because Reno is known for gaming, most of my visitors want to
stop at a casino to try their luck at gambling or to see a show.
But it doesn't take long for the area's natural beauty to weave its
magic. Even in midsummer, the snow-dappled Sierra Nevada set
against the clear blue sky is like a magnet for sightseers.
 &HT;    My personal tour starts in Truckee, home of the Donner Memorial
Museum, (530) 582-7892, that tells the heartbreaking story of the
Donner Party who were trapped in the Sierra Nevada during one of
our area's worst winters.
 &HT;    Then it's up Route 89 to Tahoe City for a stop at Fanny Bridge
overlooking the Truckee River. Fanny Bridge gets its name from the
poses people strike as they lean over the bridge to watch the giant
trout swim below.
 &HT;    A driving tour of Carson City, the capital of Nevada, is next.
Then, depending on the mood of the group, we head west to Genoa _
reputedly Nevada's first settlement and home of the state's oldest
saloon _ or east to Virginia City _ where the rich ore deposits of
this lavish boomtown helped finance Union efforts in the Civil War
and buy Nevada early statehood.
 &HT;    A visit to Reno wouldn't be complete without a walk along the
Truckee River and downtown _ usually with a stop at the National
Auto Museum _ and a meal at a Basque hotel, where ethnic fare is
served family-style at long tables.
 &HT;    But beware: If a Basque meal strikes your fancy, be prepared to
eat. A lot. The food is served in a series of seemingly endless
courses, giving diners ample time to visit with table mates who may
hail from other parts of the city, country or world.
 &HT;    A drive to Pyramid Lake, just northeast of Reno and famous for
being the location where Charleton Heston was filmed parting the
Red Sea in the ``The Ten Commandments,'' usually tops off my
official tour.
 &HT;    Recently, when I took a group of out-of-towners on a sightseeing
trip of the city, I realized how outdated my tour route had become.
All the sites I've mentioned are indeed worth visiting, but now
there's so much more to explore.
 &HT;    For example, a trip to Pyramid Lake and Paiute Indian
Reservation's Fish Hatchery, (775) 476-0500, where one can see how
prehistoric cui-ui fish are being saved, now can include a stop at
the new Tribal Museum and a visit to the Bureau of Land
Management's Wild Horse Adoption Center, (775) 475-2222 or
www.blm.gov/whb. Horses from Nevada's vast open spaces are brought
and kept here until people adopt them.
 &HT;    The Truckee River, with its 100-mile ribbon of rapids that lead
from Lake Tahoe down to Pyramid Lake, always has been a vital part
of my tour. Now, it's even more important.
 &HT;    Downtown Reno is where the Truckee River intersects with
Virginia Street, the town's main drag. It's home to many new
developments, including:
 &HT;    _ A walk with promenades for special events, such as ballet and
symphony performances.
 &HT;    _ Riverside paths, a favorite with bikers and hikers.
Eventually, these will run the length of the city once development
is completed.
 &HT;    _ Many unique Riverfront buildings, including the Riverside
Hotel and Casino, which is being converted into lofts and studios;
Christ Scientist Church, which is becoming the Lear Theater; and
McKinley School, which has been restored as an arts-and-cultural
center.
 &HT;    Some developments have new twists, such as the bluff overlooking
the south side of the Truckee River, where Reno's elite built homes
in what is now called the Newlands area. These days, local
residents involved in historic preservation lead tours of the area,
mostly for Elderhostel students, (877) 426-8056 or
www.elderhostel.org. Special group tours can be arranged by calling
the Historic Reno Preservation Society, (775) 322-1638.
 &HT;    At the other end of Virginia Street is the town's signature
landmark, an overhead street sign that proclaims Reno as ``The
Biggest Little City in the World.'' This is the fourth version of
the sign, which during World War II served as a landmark for
veterans heading home from the Pacific.
 &HT;    Two models of the sign adorn downtown. The newest is known to
turn green on St. Patrick's Day or go dark during Christmas carol
sing-alongs, while the other model is mounted outside the National
Auto Museum on Lake Street.
 &HT;    West of Reno, my tour now includes a stop at Chrissie Caughlin
Park beside the Truckee River. It's a place I have walked my
miniature schnauzers for years, but I now know that pioneers
traveling in covered wagons used a large pine tree, roughly four
feet in diameter, as their ``post office'' and stuck notes for
other immigrants on its trunk.
 &HT;    Further west, it's possible to take a look-see at the
still-visible tracks of the Donner Party wagon train on either side
of Dog Valley Road near a small town called Verdi.
 &HT;    Reno is rich in history, from miners searching for quick riches
and pioneers hurrying to reach California, to railroaders laying
the train tracks that would stitch together the North American
continent. For decades, it stood as an oasis for people traveling
to other places.
 &HT;    Now, Reno is no longer just a pass-through town. In fact, the
place that's so dear to my heart has finally become a fascinating
vacation destination in its own right.
 &HT;    For more information Reno, call (800) 367-7366 or visit

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By SARA KENNEDY  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    If competition breeds creativity, then the theme parks in and
around Orlando are a case in point. They have some of the most
imaginative ways for guests to spend their leisure time. Everything
from a roller coaster that shoots its human cargo from the starting
gate with all the subtlety of a missile launcher to a beautiful
carousel based on the art of Dr. Seuss greet visitors to Orlando
theme parks this summer.
 &HT;    Vacationers will also find an entirely new park, SeaWorld's
Discovery Cove, which opened July 1. It features a tropical, beachy
setting populated with 10,000 fish and 300 birds. Guests can play
with dolphins under the supervision of trainers, and enjoy
leisurely swimming, snorkeling and sunning with smaller crowds and
no lines, thanks to a daily limit of 1,000 patrons.
 &HT;    Orlando's theme parks, which last year attracted more than 60
million visitors (up from 48.5 million in 1996), are trying to
handle the crush of crowds better. Discovery Cove's competitors are
trying various ways to cut down waiting lines, a chief complaint of
theme park customers.
 &HT;    Walt Disney World has inaugurated Fastpass, in which guests can
pick up free tickets near its 18 most popular attractions for later
in the day when the lines are shorter. Universal is testing a
similar arrangement called Fast Track. Disney also opens a
different theme park early each day, offering first admittance to
guests at Disney hotels. Until Sept. 4, Universal is rewarding
multiday ticket holders and its hotel guests with early entry to
its two parks, from 7 to 10 a.m. daily.
 &HT;    A spring drought that fueled wildfires and meant watering
restrictions for millions of Floridians seems to have left the
theme parks unscathed. During visits in June, pathways were lined
with bright blooms of bougainvillea and hibiscus, big shade trees
were heavy with foliage, and the acres of perfectly trimmed grass
were as lush as always.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Theme parks aren't the only show in Orlando, believe it or not.
Although the calendar of special events seems to thin out a bit in
summer, diversions exist elsewhere in the city.
 &HT;    This summer, audience members help solve a mystery set in deep
space at the Orlando Science Center's planetarium. Performances,
which run through Aug. 31, feature a planetarium show and a live
actor. It's based on the PBS geographical quiz show ``Where in the
World Is Carmen San Diego,'' and is included with admission to the
center: $14.25, seniors $13.25, ages 3 to 11 $11.
 &HT;    Through Sept. 10, ``Hunters of the Sky'' looks at birds of prey,
with over 70 mounted specimens of falcons, eagles, owls and other
raptors. The center, at 777 East Princeton St., is open daily;
(407) 896-7151.
 &HT;    Through Sept. 3, ``Art of the 20th Century,'' at the Cornell
Fine Arts Museum, on Holt Avenue at Rollins College in Winter Park,
looks at the last 100 years through European and American painting,
sculpture, prints and drawings from the permanent collection. Free
admission; closed Monday. Call (407) 646-2526.
 &HT;    The Orlando Museum of Art, 2416 North Mills Ave. in Loch Haven
Park, will display beadwork, baskets and decorated animal hides
from Kenya, Tanzania and other East African countries. The
exhibition runs through May 27. Admission is $6, seniors and
students $4, ages 4 to 11 $2; closed Monday: (407) 896-4231.
 &HT;    The Orlando-University of Central Florida Shakespeare Festival
begins Sept. 20, with previews of ``The Woman in Black,'' a
Victorian mystery by Stephen Mallatratt, from a book by Susan Hill,
which runs through Oct. 28. Performances are at the Orange County
Historical Museum Theatre in Loch Haven Park, at Princeton and
Mills Avenues in Orlando. Tickets: $7 to $20; (407) 893-4600.
 &HT;    At Disney's Wide World of Sports, adjacent to the theme parks,
the 2000 Junior Olympic Games, the Amateur Athletic Union's top
event, features track and field competition from July 31 through
Aug. 5. The 250-acre complex is off Exit 25B of I-4. Daily general
admission is $9, ages 3 to 9, $7; (407) 939-1505.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    At Discovery Cove, off Exits 27A and 28 of I-4, guests come face
to face with bottlenose dolphins. They can touch the animals, and
trainers allow some patrons to play water games with the dolphins.
The park requires reservations. It employs one staff member for
every five guests to provide supervision for the dolphins, better
service and no waiting lines. Admission is $179 for ages 6 and
older who want to swim with dolphins; ages 3 to 5 and those
skipping a dolphin swim pay $89.
 &HT;    Admission includes a meal outside at the Laguna Grill, use of
snorkeling and beach gear (towels, chairs, hammocks), and a
seven-day pass to the original SeaWorld park nearby, where visitors
can see Shamu and ride the Kraken, a roller coaster that made its
debut last month; (877) 434-7268.
 &HT;    Otherwise, ticket prices are one area where Orlando's theme
parks don't show variety. Prices for a one-day, one-park ticket for
ages 10 and up at Disney World's theme parks are $46; ages 3 to 9,
$37. The Magic Kingdom and Disney-MGM Studios are off Exit 25B;
Epcot and Animal Kingdom, Exit 26B. For all Disney parks
information: (407) 824-4321.
 &HT;    Ticket prices are the same at SeaWorld, at Exits 27A and 28,
(407) 351-3600; and Universal, at Exits 30A and 29B, (407)
363-8000. Various multipark and multiday tickets are also
available.
 &HT;    The theme-park attractions with the highest profile _ in the
physical sense _ are roller coasters, and Orlando boasts a crop of
wild new ones. SeaWorld's Kraken rises 15 stories, then plunges its
screaming passengers toward earth at 65 m.p.h. Riders on the
Incredible Hulk are practically blown out of the starting gate from
what looks like a giant missile launcher at Universal's Islands of
Adventure park, which opened in May 1999.
 &HT;    The Rock 'n' Roller Coaster at Disney-MGM Studios, which opened
a year ago, treats its riders to an equally explosive start,
accelerating from zero to 60 m.p.h. in 2.8 seconds, with the music
of the band Aerosmith pumped through the seats.
 &HT;    A simulator game that pits guests of DisneyQuest, an indoor
interactive playground, against the same motley gang from the
Pirates of the Caribbean ride opened June 21 outside the park in
Downtown Disney. Four players, all wearing three-dimensional
goggles, board a sailing ship under attack (its deck sickeningly
weaves and rolls on springs controlled by computer) and defend
themselves with cannons. Tickets cost $27, ages 3 to 9, $21.
 &HT;    Universal's ``Terminator 2,'' a film that opened in 1996 at
Universal Studios Theme Park, involves three-dimensional thrills
and bizarre special effects, including fog and rain. It's the usual
end-of-the-world scenario, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, complete
with realistic guns booming and screeching pileups.
 &HT;    One of the most elegant new rides is the beautiful interactive
carousel of Dr. Seuss animals _ pull the reins and hair might fly
up or a tongue stick out _ at Islands of Adventure. The bright pink
and blue carousel is based on the art of Dr. Seuss.
 &HT;    One park that has no problem with crowds is Splendid China, a
76-acre park opened in 1993 by a Chinese company to acquaint
Americans with the country's culture. It features nearly deserted
gardens with more than 60 miniature models of historical Chinese
sites.
 &HT;    Sparse crowds usually greet its chief daily theatrical
production, the ``Mysterious Kingdom of the Orient'' _ a pity since
it is a knockout performance of colorful costumes, traditional
Chinese song and dance, acrobatics and martial arts. Follow Route
192 west from I-4 to Exit 25B in Kissimmee (directions and ticket
information from park employees may be incorrect). Admission costs,
which include the show and a terrible meal, are $19.95, and $9.95
ages 5 to 12. Call (407) 396-7111 or (800) 244-6226.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    It's always easier to park your car and stay on the grounds of a
theme park, but hotels and food usually cost more. A moderately
priced choice is Disney's All-Star Resorts, at Exit 26B of I-4,
with a mammoth complex of 5,760 basic rooms with outdoor pools,
bakery, food court and free bus service to Disney attractions.
Rooms are $74 to $104 a night; (407) 934-7639.
 &HT;    Minutes east of the theme parks is the Hampton Inn-Orlando
Convention Center hotel, 8900 Universal Blvd., which opened in
April 1999. The staff is helpful and friendly; there is a heated
outdoor pool; the free Continental breakfast includes cereals,
bagels, yogurt, fruit and waffles; and the 170 spotless rooms, with
maple furniture and decorated in bright, tropical colors, are $69
to $109, depending on the season; (407) 354-4447, fax (407)
354-3031.
 &HT;    Budget: A simple hotel tucked away off Interstate 4, the Comfort
Inn Maingate South is an easy 15-minute ride from most of the theme
parks. It is off I-4 Exit 23, eight miles west of Walt Disney World
at 5510 U.S. Highway 27 North. Its 150 rooms cost $40 to $100, more
on holidays; outdoor pool; (800) 255-4386, fax (863) 424-1723.
 &HT;    Luxury: Elegant, sand-colored Italian marble and huge bouquets
of native orchids give the lobby of the Peabody Orlando, 9801
International Drive, a distinctive Florida feel, and it's fun to
watch the hotel's mascot ducks cavort in the fountain. Its 891
modern rooms are decorated in yellow and moss green; doubles are
$330 a night; outdoor pool and children's pool with waterfall;
(407) 352-4000, fax (407) 351-0073.
 &HT;    The Grand Floridian Resort and Spa, Disney's sprawling
Victorian-style hotel, boasts 900 quaint rooms, decorated with
printed wall coverings, marble-top sinks, ceiling fans and
Victorian woodwork. Big gingerbread porches with climbing roses
overlook a lagoon on theme park grounds with a man-made beach and
two outdoor pools, one for children. Off Exit 25B. Doubles are $304
to $400; (407) 824-3000, fax (407) 824-3186.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    At Universal's CityWalk, a 30-acre dining and entertainment
complex, Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville is (what else?) completely
casual. Try conch fritters dipped in honey-mustard sauce, followed
by Caribbean grilled chicken salad, topped with almonds and
habanero-mango ranch dressing, and key lime pie for dessert. Dinner
for two with margaritas, about $50; (407) 224-2155.
 &HT;    Nearby, also at CityWalk, you'll find Emeril's, the Orlando
branch of a series of restaurants owned by the popular TV chef
Emeril Lagasse. Reservations are recommended. Specialties include
an appetizer of Maine lobster cheesecake; roasted rack of lamb with
a Creole mustard sauce, and fresh Florida orange cake with
strawberry compote. Dinner for two with wine, $125; (407) 224-2424.
 &HT;    Of all the theme parks, SeaWorld serves some of the best food,
and its casual Bimini Bay restaurant, with waiters and waitresses
wearing Hawaiian shirts, is typical. The menu features salads,
pasta and seafood; try the fresh Florida grouper sandwich or
marinated steak on a roll with sauteed onions and peppers. Lunch
for two with beer costs about $40 (you must have a park pass);
(407) 351-3600.
 &HT;    Two sessions of a gospel brunch occur every Sunday morning at
the House of Blues Music Hall, at Downtown Disney (where no park
pass is needed), featuring nationally known and local gospel
performers, and an all-you-can-eat Southern buffet. The meal and
show cost $28; ages 3 to 9, $15. It's a good idea to buy tickets at
least a week in advance at (407) 934-2583, fax (407) 934-2216, or
at the House of Blues box office.
 &HT;    A good family-style restaurant near Walt Disney World is
Pebbles, 12551 State Road 535; (407) 827-1111. It serves a nice mix
of dishes adults enjoy, like the excellent black bean soup ($3.25)
or Mediterranean salad ($7.50), and child-friendly items like the
cheeseburger ($6.95)and white chocolate mousse ($3.95).

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By ANNASUE MCCLEAVE WILSON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It is hard to admit to being a soccer mom. That cliched title is
easier to bear, however, when the games are played on a crescent
moon of a beach in Brazil, where the team kicks up sand as white
and soft as baby powder.
 &HT;    Our family loves soccer, that jogo bonito, ``beautiful game,''
as they call it in Brazil. My son John, 14, has played since
kindergarten, and his coach, Paulo Barreto, is a Brazilian who
played professionally there. His Cincinnati company, Paulo's
Brazilian Soccer Training and Camp, began organizing trips last
year to his hometown, Florianopolis.
 &HT;    The coin toss to see whether my husband, John, or I would
accompany John on a trip there last March was agonizing. Not only
was the trip too expensive for everyone to go, but we would have
had to take our two younger children out of school. I won.
 &HT;    This particular eight-day trip was designed for a team, but not
all of John's team, the Cincinnati Classics, participated, so they
were supplemented by other boys and girls of the same age and
ability from around Cincinnati. Parents were welcome, and of the 17
players, only 5 traveled without a parent, making us a group of 39.
 &HT;    Other camps offer various levels of training and can include
international tournament play for players who hope to play at the
college level and beyond, but this trip offered the right balance
of soccer and vacation for us. Our trip revolved around three
matches with local teams and four morning training sessions, but
equally important was the beachfront hotel and organized afternoon
sightseeing.
 &HT;    Florianopolis, on the island of Santa Catarina, is about 350
miles down the coast from Sao Paulo. Our 24-hour trip was not made
easier by the way we were routed by the travel agency _ through
Detroit, Miami and Sao Paulo _ but the teenagers seemed oblivious
to the inconvenience.
 &HT;    When they weren't giving water to thirsty dogs in travel cages
or bumping into airport police officers on bikes, they managed to
find enough open space at each stopover to kick around a soccer
ball. In Sao Paulo, they sprawled over the floor of the airport
terminal, lounging or sleeping on backpacks.
 &HT;    Several in our group thought the island of Santa Catarina, on
which most of the city of Florianopolis is built, looked like one
of the islands of Hawaii from the air. The hilly countryside is
laden with subtropical flora, and both land and sea are dotted with
ancient black boulders that must have looked like gods to the
Tupi-Guarani Indians who first inhabited the region. The island is
connected to the mainland by two bridges, although one, the
Hercilio Luz, is closed to motor traffic.
 &HT;    Our bright blue hotel, the Ingleses Praia, sat beside a beach
called Praia dos Ingleses, on the northeast shore of the island,
about 22 miles from downtown Florianopolis. The beach was named for
English explorers who poked around there about 1700. Each room had
a balcony, cool tile floors, air-conditioning and surprisingly
spacious bathrooms.
 &HT;    We ate breakfast and occasionally another meal at the hotel,
buffet style. Fruits and juices were fresh and delicious, but all
else paled in the morning before the coffee. It was deeply rich and
black, served with hot milk.
 &HT;    Our first evening at the hotel, the parents in the group were
content to laze wearily on the veranda, drinking caipirinhas, a
lime drink usually made with cachaca, Brazilian sugar-cane liquor.
 &HT;    A few of the boys perused the small strip of beachfront
restaurants and souvenir shops selling T-shirts and crocheted
bikinis and thongs on either side of the hotel (their favorite
souvenirs were fake designer watches, but because the dollar is
strong against the real, almost everything seemed inexpensive).
 &HT;    Afterward, they brought out a ball and began to kick it around
on the beach under the stars. This attracted some local people and
soon a full fledged game was on. Not one Brazilian guy walking
along the beach _ student, vendor or fisherman _ could keep his
foot off the ball if it came near him during our practices, and
their skill was remarkable.
 &HT;    The team's first training session was at the Hotel Fazenda Jomar
on the mainland near Santo Amaro da Imperatriz, a spa town founded
to commemorate an imperial visit in 1845 by Dom Pedro II, emperor
of Brazil. Having traveled inland 18 miles, we were in dense green
mountains, and the group practiced on a field in danger of being
enveloped by the lush vegetation surrounding it.
 &HT;    Afterward, we all took advantage of the resort's amenities. The
team swam in the pool, went rafting in rapids not rapid enough to
be classified, and sank paddle boats in the lake.
 &HT;    On a shaded veranda, an accordionist played German music, a
reminder of the large influx of Germans who emigrated to this part
of Brazil in the 19th century. Several parents joined an ecological
walk around the grounds, which led to a waterfall of rare beauty;
on our way up, we disturbed a lizard the size of a small alligator.
 &HT;    Florianopolis has two professional soccer teams, the Figueirense
Futebol Clube, based on the mainland, and the island's Avai Futebol
Clube, both of which cultivate players from a young age.
 &HT;    After a day of practice and a couple of scrimmages on the beach,
our first match took place against the Figueirense youth team in
the club's stadium in Florianopolis. The Brazilians, who were a
year or two older than John, won, 8-1, which did not seem to
diminish the excitement of playing a challenging opponent.
 &HT;    Our game with the young Avai team two days later took place just
before the professional match between Avai and Caxias (from the
city of Porto Alegre). As the game went on, the stands filled up
with fans who cheered on both teams (we lost, 2-0) but who were
unforgiving of their pro team when it lost.
 &HT;    After the game with Figueirense, our bus took us to the beach at
Joaquina, which is on the east side of the island and is famous for
surfing championships held there each year. After an open-air
lunch, the team wandered the beach, climbing the huge rocks at one
end and examining jellyfish that washed onto the shore.
 &HT;    Behind Praia da Joaquina are massive sand dunes of Saharan
proportion and, even though the wind whipped up the sand so
fiercely it practically blinded them, the team was determined to go
sandboarding. John and the boys happily forged their way up the
dunes over and over again, and dumped their weight in sand onto the
floor of the bus on the way back to the hotel.
 &HT;    The next day, we boarded a schooner and headed for the island of
Anhatomirim, where the team was to practice in the shadow of the
Santa Cruz fort, built in 1744. A Brazilian school group about the
same age as ours happened to be touring the fort, too, and it
wasn't long before another impromptu match was on.
 &HT;    The Brazilian girls watched the American boys with obvious
pleasure, much to the consternation of the Brazilian boys, which
gave the game an edge it might not ordinarily have had.
 &HT;    The Brazilian boys, on the other hand, didn't know what to make
of the four highly skilled girls playing on our team. Only the
parents were in awe of the setting: on one side a centuries-old
fortress and on the other, the magnificent sea.
 &HT;    After morning training another day, the group ventured downtown.
The two bridges to the mainland shadow 19th-century ocher-colored
market buildings along the old waterfront. Across the street from
the Praca 15 de Novembro, the city's main square, John stopped at
the entrance to the pink Cruz e Souza Palace to have his picture
taken beside the guard, who wore an elaborate uniform and held a
rifle with a bayonet.
 &HT;    The team climbed the steps to the bright white Metropolitan
Cathedral, where a Mass was being said, then plopped down
pretending to be exhausted.
 &HT;    Since this day of sightseeing had little appeal for them, the
high point of the excursion was stopping at a shop called Futebol
Mania to buy official Figueirense and Avai jerseys. A few fathers
wandered off to the bus station to find Cuban cigars.
 &HT;    Our meals outside the hotel were in seafood restaurants or in
churrascarias, places serving meat smorgasbords called rodizio (all
you can eat). Seafood lunches were waterside, in open-air
restaurants that served us at long communal tables _ local shrimp
in butter and oil, mussels in salsa, deep-fried whitefish, served
with plates of beets, shredded carrots and tomato, clay pots of
rich black beans, and crisp, deep-fried manioc root.
 &HT;    When Mr. Barreto realized that our ravenous American teen-agers
kept passing on the plates of fish and making faces, he arranged
that they be served chicken with rice and French fries instead.
 &HT;    One evening we were taken to a cafe colonial, a Brazilian-style
high tea inspired by the customs of European immigrants in the 19th
century. On the beach, we snacked on corn on the cob served in the
husk and drank cool milk right from coconuts. The team's favorite
drink was Guarana, sweet green soda with lots of caffeine.
 &HT;    A cultural exchange had been arranged for us the afternoon
before we left at the Colegia Energia, a private school in
Florianopolis that prides itself on its English instruction. When
we arrived, we were met with wild cheers, as if we were a busload
of American movie stars. Our boys were a little stunned at such a
reception and we had to remind them to keep smiling.
 &HT;    The school had prepared a short program and presented each of
our team members with souvenir notebooks. A soccer scrimmage was
held in which our girls soundly beat four Brazilian girls. While
our boys were outclassed on the field, they were mobbed by
Brazilian girls and boys asking for e-mail addresses and
photographs.
 &HT;    Once our team got used to the attention, those who spoke a
little Spanish _ none spoke Portuguese _ tried to talk to the
students, who answered in their halting English.
 &HT;    That evening, we lost our last match, against the Astel Futebol
Clube, but only by a single goal. Once, John collided with an Astel
player, knocking him to the ground. As he would have back home, he
reached down to help the Brazilian to his feet, but was scolded by
Mr. Barreto.
 &HT;    ``Here you leave him alone,'' he said. ``Find him after the game
if you want.''
 &HT;    When we returned to Cincinnati, the team went on to become
division champions, at least partly because of improved soccer
skills. But the trip had also provided the players with a surprise,
the opportunity to represent their country by their actions: How
they played the game did matter.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY SUSAN ALLEN TOTH  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When I have finally opened the mail, unpacked my bags, started
the washing machine, restocked the refrigerator and riffled through
a few newspapers, I am ready to stay home forever.
 &HT;    Yes, I realize, I'm totally exhausted. I stroke our cats,
defrost some homemade soup and soon send my husband, James, to his
office so I can luxuriate in having the house to myself. No, I am
not going to travel again for a long time. Months and months, maybe
longer. Who knows when I'll ever be ready to study another
guidebook or decipher another map?
 &HT;    I am tired of looking at menus. I can't bear to sleep in any
more strange bedrooms. I want to forget all those uneasy searches
for public toilets.
 &HT;    Our friends applaud this decision. They think James and I travel
too much anyway.
 &HT;    ``Of course you have a cold,'' one says. ``Everyone knows you
can't travel on a plane without getting sick.'' Another chimes in:
``How can you complain of not getting any writing done? You're
never home.''
 &HT;    Some urge us to slow down, take it easy. Others suggest getting
back to work, enjoying my garden, volunteering for a local charity.
I'm sure they are right. In fact, as I nod in agreement, I feel
morally invigorated.
 &HT;    Travel is a kind of addiction, I tell myself, and I must simply
let it go for a while. I can. I know I can.
 &HT;    Then something happens. If I could predict it, I might be able
to ward it off. But the travel impulse is sly, mysterious and
dazzlingly sudden.
 &HT;    Last December, glad to be home for the holidays after a hectic
trip to London, I was savoring the prospect of quiet weeks ahead.
Then I opened a Christmas card from a family friend in my Iowa
hometown.
 &HT;    Close to 90 now, cheerful and bright but unable to travel,
Isabel wrote: ``You certainly travel a lot. But do keep it up as
long as you can! I wish I had seen York and Cornwall. But I am so
thankful I didn't miss the Alhambra and the Prado.''
 &HT;    The Alhambra! I thought. The Prado! Why is it we've never been
there? Immediately I began to think of Spain. Why not Portugal too?
Perhaps next fall?
 &HT;    A few days later, on New Year's Eve, I was transfixed by the
televised fantasy of fireworks that lit up the bejeweled Eiffel
Tower. Oh, Paris, beautiful City of Light _ had it really been five
years since we'd walked along the Seine?
 &HT;    I could instantly envision broad boulevards, thin women with
chic silk scarves, and a corner patisserie where I bought a moist
round mouthful of chocolate cake with an indescribably delicious
coffee-flavored icing. Definitely, back to Paris.
 &HT;    Cleaning my desk the following week, I took off the wall an
outdated calendar with large color photographs of waterfalls. I
hadn't really noticed it much. But now I was transfixed by a view
of Upper Yosemite Falls, tumbling down magnificent snow-covered
cliffs.
 &HT;    I hadn't been to Yosemite for more than 30 years, and I barely
remembered my one day there. How could I think of Paris, or Spain,
when I hadn't really experienced Yosemite?
 &HT;    I am helpless against unforeseen assaults on my homebound
intentions. Occasionally, when I am already on a trip, I have a
passing glimpse of a destination that calls to me so seductively I
know I must answer.
 &HT;    One June afternoon, on a fast train from Inverness to London, I
glanced, for only a whizzing moment, far across miles of empty
fields to a tiny village of snug houses clustered around a bay. The
surrounding countryside seemed so undiscovered, the village so
remote.
 &HT;    I studied my map: Alnmouth, Northumberland. Three years later,
we were walking through light rain down its long quiet beach.
 &HT;    On another afternoon, this time in early fall, I sat on a level
rock at the northernmost edge of Scotland and gazed, entranced, at
the distant gray-green shapes of the Orkney Islands half-hidden in
the mist. They seemed as if they belonged to a different world.
``James,'' I said, ``we have to go there.''
 &HT;    James smiled, partly in resignation. ``O.K.,'' he said amiably,
``but why don't we finish this trip first?''
 &HT;    Two Octobers later, we rented a cottage for a week on an Orkney
island called, disarmingly, Mainland.
 &HT;    Sometimes all it takes is a single picture or a few words. We
once spent a week near Cromer, on the north Norfolk coast, because
that was the phrase _ ``the north Norfolk coast'' _ occasionally
appearing in travel guides, that had begun to haunt my imagination.
It sounded so unlike the cozy Cotswolds, or the well-trodden and
prosaically named Lake District, or flowering Kent, the Garden of
England.
 &HT;    Then I read P. D. James' ``Devices and Desires,'' and her
intensely evocative description of that bleak, windswept land made
me determined to see if she was right. And she was.
 &HT;    Although P.D. James first sent me to Norfolk, Arthur Conan Doyle
to Dartmoor and Dylan Thomas to Wales, I am not often struck by the
travel impulse when I read nonfiction travel books. This may seem
odd, since I have indulged in such memoirs myself.
 &HT;    But, after closing a particularly atmospheric or vivid travel
narrative, I tend to think: ``OK. Wonderful. Now I've been there.''
 &HT;    If the author has filled my eyes with his or her personal
vision, I am perversely not moved to explore certain corners of
Provence, or Tuscany, or Patagonia.
 &HT;    If, however, I am swept into a place by reading a novel or
biography, I absorb the landscape sidewise, out of the corner of my
eye. Then I become intrigued.
 &HT;    After finishing Tim Binding's ``Lying With the Enemy,'' a novel
about life in occupied Guernsey during World War II, I asked James,
``Why haven't we ever been to the Channel Islands?'' He looked
blank. I handed him the novel, and the next year, we were off.
 &HT;    My love of Scottish islands began, not with a guidebook, but
with Gavin Maxwell's ``Ring of Bright Water,'' an account of life
with his beloved otters.
 &HT;    I soon tracked Maxwell through his later, much harsher, memoirs,
``The Rocks Remain'' and ``Raven Seek Thy Brother,'' and, after
many years, I eventually looked across the water to the lonely site
of his nearly inaccessible Camusfearna.
 &HT;    As James and I walked parts of the rocky coastline of western
Scotland, and explored Mull and Skye that year, I often thought of
Maxwell's intense, troubled spirit. His love of this land had
brought us there.
 &HT;    Or had it? As a young girl, I used to sit at the piano and play
through ``The Fireside Book of Folk Songs.'' One of my favorites
was ``The Skye Boat Song.'' Its simple, poignant melody had an
unforgettable refrain, especially alluring to an Iowa girl who
lived far from any ocean: ``Carry the lad who was born to be
king/Over the sea to Skye.''
 &HT;    I didn't know the story of Bonnie Prince Charlie, and I had no
idea where Skye was, but I knew loss and regret when I heard it.
Over the sea to Skye: someday perhaps I would know more.
 &HT;    So even a song can start me thinking of travel. After our trip
to Hawaii last winter, James began to play a CD we bought there. He
plays it a lot, especially when it gets really cold outside.
 &HT;    Like James, I had been delighted by our relaxing, balmy week on
Molokai. So when I hear ``Polynesian Love Song'' or ``Lovely Hula
Hands,'' I don't think, ``This is corny.'' No, I want to be back on
our screened lanai, listening to the warm splashing surf a few
yards away.
 &HT;    It doesn't take much. Sometimes I think I should look for an
antidote, but I haven't thought of one yet. Maybe if I muttered
Thoreau's proud boast, ``I have traveled much in Concord''? If I
repeated like a mantra, ``Home is where the heart is''? What about
a CD that played, again and again, ``Home Sweet Home''? I'm not
sure any of it would help.

 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  My husband wants adventure, I want a spa with a spiritual
nature and our kids don't fit into either category. Help! Know of a
vacation destination that will meet everyone's needs?
 &HT;     A:  The Enchantment Resort in Sedona, Ariz., and its new
destination spa, Mii Amo, will surely please all. Nestled within a
truly enchanting red-rock canyon, Enchantment offers scenic
relaxation and adventure, as well as Camp Coyote, ranked one of the
best kids programs in the world.
 &HT;    One of Enchantment's treasures is Uqualla, the shaman and former
chief of the Havasupai tribe, who acts as spiritual ambassador for
the resort. While children play and learn about the local cultures,
guests can be pampered by healing oils that are blessed each
morning. Spiritual consultations are available, and the staff
offers an array of innovative spa treatments.
 &HT;    The Enchantment concierge can arrange a variety of hiking and
rock-climbing tours for the adventurous or the mere stroller.
 &HT;    Your family should save an afternoon to fly by helicopter with
Uqualla to his tribe's village at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.
There you can enjoy a swim and picnic at the nearby falls.
 &HT;    At the end of the day, whether your crew is rested or exhausted,
Enchantment's restaurants offer an eclectic selection of spa
cuisine and hearty southwestern fare, as well as an excellent wine
list.
 &HT;    Book now for the holidays to reserve an Enchantment casita or
one of Mii Amo's 16 rooms and suites. Room rates begin at $195 per
night. For more information, call (800) 826-4180 or visit
www.enchantmentresort.com.
 &HT;     Q:  I've always been intrigued by the mystique of Harvard, but
the two times I visited Cambridge I felt like such an outsider. How
can I get a better feel for the place?
 &HT;     A:2 Home to Harvard, MIT and the JFK School of Government,
Cambridge may well be the premiere locale for intellectuals in this
country. Most visiting lecturers and dignitaries stay at the
Charles Hotel on Harvard Square.
 &HT;    Not only is it within walking distance, at times the Charles
Hotel seems like an extension of the Harvard campus. Relax in the
foyer library and watch the comings and goings _ or better yet, ask
the concierge to arrange a private tour of Harvard with a recent
graduate. Often the guide runs into buddies, conversations ensue
and the scene opens before you.
 &HT;    I would suggest arriving early for breakfast at the Charles'
lively Henrietta's Table, where writer David Mamet or Cambridge's
dot.com elite might just be doing business.
 &HT;    Lunch would be a good idea at a popular joint called Bartley's
Burger Cottage (1246 Massachusetts Ave.), but Casablanca (40
Brattle St.), with its fusion Mediterranean cuisine, is a more
original mainstay of Cambridge _ especially in the evening at the
bar.
 &HT;    Room rates at the Charles Hotel begin at $250 per night.
Facilities include a day spa and three-story health-and-fitness
center. For more information, call (800) 882-1818, or visit
www.charleshotel.com.
 &HT;     Q:  I have played on golf courses around the world and really
enjoy when courses throw a unique spin into the golfing experience.
Can you suggest a course that offers a bit of originality?
 &HT;     A:  The new ``Heli-Golf Package,'' offered by Rosewood Hotels &AMP;
Resorts in Little Dix Bay in the Virgin Islands, provides the
originality that adventurous golfers look for. This heli-golf
experience features a scenic helicopter flight to St. Croix, where
golfers are deposited right onto the green and are then processed
through customs and immigrations with minimal hassle.
 &HT;    Described as ``the Caribbean's most exclusive golf getaway,''
Little Dix Bay's Heli-Golf Package includes three nights'
accommodation for two; greens fees, cart and golf escort; daily
breakfast and dinner; and complimentary water activities. Rates are
based on double occupancy, with deluxe accommodations starting at
$3,500 and suite accommodations starting at $5,000.
 &HT;    Laurance Rockefeller founded exclusive Little Dix Bay in 1964.
These low-key yet upscale accommodations are set in a 500-acre
garden paradise and a pristine private beach. For more information,
call (888) ROSEWOOD.
 &HT;     Q:  I am a single female who enjoys traveling alone, but
occasionally I feel left out of certain social activities because I
am not part of a couple. Do other independent travelers ever feel
this way?
 &HT;     A:  Some people do _ and, unfortunately, it's usually women.
Because of this, Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines now feature their popular
gentlemen hosts aboard every cruise. With their gracious social
skills and dancing ability, these men are well-known for making
single female passengers feel at ease in all social activities.
 &HT;    Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines offers exhilarating cruises throughout
Africa, the Caribbean, Europe and South America. For more
information and reservations, visit www.eurocruises.com, or call
(800) 688-3876.
 &HT;     Q:  Over the years, I have noticed that some hotels are more
in-tune with the needs of female business travelers than others.
Can you recommend a good hotel that focuses on this segment of the
population?
 &HT;     A:  The Pan Pacific San Francisco recently surveyed female
guests _ focusing on those with business needs _ and has made
several adjustments.
 &HT;    The women who were surveyed reported that females appreciate
softer, more personal touches. For example, minibars are now
stocked with wines by the glass. There are lighter menu choices
available on the 24-hour room-service menu, personal butlers can be
provided and the staff is available to escort female guests to
their rooms. This is just a handful of the amenities that are part
of the hotel's signature luxury service.
 &HT;    For business travelers, the Pan Pacific has added a virtual
office to many rooms. Copy capabilities are now part of the in-room
fax machine, and all guest rooms will soon be wired for high-speed
Internet access. The hotel has also acquired a number of laptop
computers.
 &HT;    The Pan Pacific San Francisco is located just one block from
Union Square and is a cable-car ride away from the city's theater
district, fine restaurants and other tourist attractions. For more
information and reservations, call (800) 533-6465, or visit the web

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The romance of the rails lingers in a handful of deluxe trains
that run on well-orchestrated trips throughout the world.
 &HT;    What's the appeal of such luxury train trips? Vintage rail cars
that have been lavishly restored; itineraries that take passengers
through some of the most beautiful landscapes and cities in the
world; impeccable service; and food that is extraordinary.
 &HT;    For those who can pay the price, here are some elegant journeys
to consider. Prices are per person, based on double occupancy.
 &HT;    The American Spirit (601 Union St., Seattle, WA 98101;
888-533-7245; www.americanspiritrail.com) features 1950s Budd-built
streamliner railcars. The company offers a variety of western
itineraries that include visits to the Glacier, Grand Tetons and
Yellowstone National Parks.
 &HT;    Trips last anywhere from two to nine nights. Accommodations are
in hotels, not on the train, and motorcoaches supplement the rail
service.
 &HT;    A typical itinerary is the ``Montana Rockies Rail Tour,'' which
begins in Post Falls, Idaho, continues on to Missoula, Mont., and
ends in Livingston, Mont. The cost of the two-night trip begins at
$499. Lodging and daily breakfast, as well as transfers from
Spokane Airport, are included.
 &HT;    The American Orient-Express (5100 Main St., Downer's Grove, IL
60515; 888-759-3944; www.americanorientexpress.com) utilizes 15
vintage rail cars on its luxury voyages. The train travels cross
country as well as on shorter trips throughout the West.
 &HT;    For example, the ``Rockies and Yellowstone'' itinerary is a
six-night trip that commences in Denver and visits Arches National
Park, Salt Lake City, Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks.
The cost begins at $2,990.
 &HT;    The best-known name in luxury-train travel is probably
Orient-Express Trains &AMP; Cruises (Sea Containers House, 20 Upper
Ground, London, SE1 9PF, England; 800-524-2420;
www.orient-expresstrains.com or c/o Abercrombie and Kent
International Inc., 1520 Kensington Road, Oak Brook, IL 60523;
800-323-7308; www.abercrombiekent.com). They offer a variety of
rail itineraries for the well-heeled traveler.
 &HT;    The most famous trip is the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express
(VSOE), which features restored period rail cars, lavish service
and fine dining. Sightseeing and meals are included in most
itineraries.
 &HT;    The classic VSOE trip is from London to Paris and Venice, or
vice versa. The cost of this one-night trip starts at $1,970. The
train makes other trips as well, such as from Venice to Florence
and Rome; Venice to Prague, Paris and London; Venice to Lucerne,
Paris and London; and Paris to Budapest, Bucharest and Istanbul.
 &HT;    Orient-Express also offers the Eastern &AMP; Oriental Express, a
luxury train that has three itineraries: Singapore to Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, and Bangkok (and vice versa); Bangkok to Chiang Mai,
Thailand; and Bangkok to Angkor Wat, Cambodia, and Singapore. The
overnight Singapore to Kuala Lumpur itinerary begins at $600.
 &HT;    Among the other Orient-Express trains are the Northern Belle,
which calls itself the ``Orient-Express of the North.'' It offers
day trips and weekend getaways in Britain with departures from
Liverpool, Manchester and York. Again, vintage rail carriages, fine
dining and a high level of service are offered.
 &HT;    Orient Express also operates the Great South Pacific Express in
Australia, a restored luxury train that runs from Brisbane to
Cairns; Brisbane to Sydney; Brisbane to Canberra and Sydney; and
Sydney to Brisbane and Cairns. Contact them for more information.
 &HT;    The Royal Scotsman (c/o Abercrombie and Kent International Inc.
1520 Kensington Road, Oak Brook, IL 60523; 800-323-7308;
www.abercrombiekent.com or www.royalscotsman.com) takes visitors
through the rugged Scottish countryside on some of the beautiful
rails in Britain. The four-night Edinburgh to Edinburgh itinerary
is $4,150.
 &HT;    Beginning in the Scottish capital, the journey takes riders
through the dramatic West Highlands and rolling Perthshire hills
and then to the North East. Two-night trips start at $2,350. Rates
include all meals, wine and alcoholic and beverages as well as
sightseeing visits.
 &HT;    In Canada, the Rocky Mountaineer Railtours (1150 Station St.,
Vancouver, B.C. Canada V6A 2X7; 800-665-7245;
www.rockymountaineer.com) has a variety of trips through the
Canadian Rockies. These trains travel by daylight only, affording
the best views of the mountains. Overnights are spent in hotels.
 &HT;    One of the briefest excursions is the ``Two Day Redleaf Tour,''
a one-night trip through the Canadian Rockies, traveling from
Vancouver to either Jasper, Alberta, or Calgary, Alberta, with an
overnight hotel stay in Kamloops, Alberta. Prices start at $358 per
person and include the overnight stay and some meals.
 &HT;    Premier Selections (342 Madison Ave., Suite 916, New York, N.Y.
10173; 800-234-4000; www.premierselections.com) is the sales agent
for a number of great train journeys, including the Al Andalus
Express, the Royal Scottsman and the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express.
Rates start at $1,512 and include five nights on the train, one in
a hotel, most meals and sightseeing.
 &HT;    Premier also has a variety of other luxury trains, including the
Blue Train in South Africa. This train runs from Capetown to
Pretoria, with an overnight in Johannesburg. The price of this
five-night train/tour package _ which includes four hotel nights,
one night on the train itself and some meals _ starts at $1,946.
 &HT;    Finally, Copper Canyon's Sierra Madre Express runs from Tuscon,
Ariz., down into Mexico's fabled Copper Canyon region. The
seven-night trip, which includes hotel and train accommodation, as
well as most meals, begins at $2,545.

 (Color slide included.) 
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Like anyone living in a popular tourist destination, I developed
a standard tour itinerary years ago for my out-of-town friends who
wish to see all that Reno, Nev., has to offer.
 &HT;    Because Reno is known for gaming, most of my visitors want to
stop at a casino to try their luck at gambling or to see a show.
But it doesn't take long for the area's natural beauty to weave its
magic. Even in midsummer, the snow-dappled Sierra Nevada set
against the clear blue sky is like a magnet for sightseers.
 &HT;    My personal tour starts in Truckee, home of the Donner Memorial
Museum, (530) 582-7892, that tells the heartbreaking story of the
Donner Party who were trapped in the Sierra Nevada during one of
our area's worst winters.
 &HT;    Then it's up Route 89 to Tahoe City for a stop at Fanny Bridge
overlooking the Truckee River. Fanny Bridge gets its name from the
poses people strike as they lean over the bridge to watch the giant
trout swim below.
 &HT;    A driving tour of Carson City, the capital of Nevada, is next.
Then, depending on the mood of the group, we head west to Genoa _
reputedly Nevada's first settlement and home of the state's oldest
saloon _ or east to Virginia City _ where the rich ore deposits of
this lavish boomtown helped finance Union efforts in the Civil War
and buy Nevada early statehood.
 &HT;    A visit to Reno wouldn't be complete without a walk along the
Truckee River and downtown _ usually with a stop at the National
Auto Museum _ and a meal at a Basque hotel, where ethnic fare is
served family-style at long tables.
 &HT;    But beware: If a Basque meal strikes your fancy, be prepared to
eat. A lot. The food is served in a series of seemingly endless
courses, giving diners ample time to visit with table mates who may
hail from other parts of the city, country or world.
 &HT;    A drive to Pyramid Lake, just northeast of Reno and famous for
being the location where Charleton Heston was filmed parting the
Red Sea in the ``The Ten Commandments,'' usually tops off my
official tour.
 &HT;    Recently, when I took a group of out-of-towners on a sightseeing
trip of the city, I realized how outdated my tour route had become.
All the sites I've mentioned are indeed worth visiting, but now
there's so much more to explore.
 &HT;    For example, a trip to Pyramid Lake and Paiute Indian
Reservation's Fish Hatchery, (775) 476-0500, where one can see how
prehistoric cui-ui fish are being saved, now can include a stop at
the new Tribal Museum and a visit to the Bureau of Land
Management's Wild Horse Adoption Center, (775) 475-2222 or
www.blm.gov/whb. Horses from Nevada's vast open spaces are brought
and kept here until people adopt them.
 &HT;    The Truckee River, with its 100-mile ribbon of rapids that lead
from Lake Tahoe down to Pyramid Lake, always has been a vital part
of my tour. Now, it's even more important.
 &HT;    Downtown Reno is where the Truckee River intersects with
Virginia Street, the town's main drag. It's home to many new
developments, including:
 &HT;    _ A walk with promenades for special events, such as ballet and
symphony performances.
 &HT;    _ Riverside paths, a favorite with bikers and hikers.
Eventually, these will run the length of the city once development
is completed.
 &HT;    _ Many unique Riverfront buildings, including the Riverside
Hotel and Casino, which is being converted into lofts and studios;
Christ Scientist Church, which is becoming the Lear Theater; and
McKinley School, which has been restored as an arts-and-cultural
center.
 &HT;    Some developments have new twists, such as the bluff overlooking
the south side of the Truckee River, where Reno's elite built homes
in what is now called the Newlands area. These days, local
residents involved in historic preservation lead tours of the area,
mostly for Elderhostel students, (877) 426-8056 or
www.elderhostel.org. Special group tours can be arranged by calling
the Historic Reno Preservation Society, (775) 322-1638.
 &HT;    At the other end of Virginia Street is the town's signature
landmark, an overhead street sign that proclaims Reno as ``The
Biggest Little City in the World.'' This is the fourth version of
the sign, which during World War II served as a landmark for
veterans heading home from the Pacific.
 &HT;    Two models of the sign adorn downtown. The newest is known to
turn green on St. Patrick's Day or go dark during Christmas carol
sing-alongs, while the other model is mounted outside the National
Auto Museum on Lake Street.
 &HT;    West of Reno, my tour now includes a stop at Chrissie Caughlin
Park beside the Truckee River. It's a place I have walked my
miniature schnauzers for years, but I now know that pioneers
traveling in covered wagons used a large pine tree, roughly four
feet in diameter, as their ``post office'' and stuck notes for
other immigrants on its trunk.
 &HT;    Further west, it's possible to take a look-see at the
still-visible tracks of the Donner Party wagon train on either side
of Dog Valley Road near a small town called Verdi.
 &HT;    Reno is rich in history, from miners searching for quick riches
and pioneers hurrying to reach California, to railroaders laying
the train tracks that would stitch together the North American
continent. For decades, it stood as an oasis for people traveling
to other places.
 &HT;    Now, Reno is no longer just a pass-through town. In fact, the
place that's so dear to my heart has finally become a fascinating
vacation destination in its own right.
 &HT;    For more information Reno, call (800) 367-7366 or visit
www.renolaketahoe.com on the Web.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By SARA KENNEDY  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    If competition breeds creativity, then the theme parks in and
around Orlando are a case in point. They have some of the most
imaginative ways for guests to spend their leisure time. Everything
from a roller coaster that shoots its human cargo from the starting
gate with all the subtlety of a missile launcher to a beautiful
carousel based on the art of Dr. Seuss greet visitors to Orlando
theme parks this summer.
 &HT;    Vacationers will also find an entirely new park, SeaWorld's
Discovery Cove, which opened July 1. It features a tropical, beachy
setting populated with 10,000 fish and 300 birds. Guests can play
with dolphins under the supervision of trainers, and enjoy
leisurely swimming, snorkeling and sunning with smaller crowds and
no lines, thanks to a daily limit of 1,000 patrons.
 &HT;    Orlando's theme parks, which last year attracted more than 60
million visitors (up from 48.5 million in 1996), are trying to
handle the crush of crowds better. Discovery Cove's competitors are
trying various ways to cut down waiting lines, a chief complaint of
theme park customers.
 &HT;    Walt Disney World has inaugurated Fastpass, in which guests can
pick up free tickets near its 18 most popular attractions for later
in the day when the lines are shorter. Universal is testing a
similar arrangement called Fast Track. Disney also opens a
different theme park early each day, offering first admittance to
guests at Disney hotels. Until Sept. 4, Universal is rewarding
multiday ticket holders and its hotel guests with early entry to
its two parks, from 7 to 10 a.m. daily.
 &HT;    A spring drought that fueled wildfires and meant watering
restrictions for millions of Floridians seems to have left the
theme parks unscathed. During visits in June, pathways were lined
with bright blooms of bougainvillea and hibiscus, big shade trees
were heavy with foliage, and the acres of perfectly trimmed grass
were as lush as always.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Theme parks aren't the only show in Orlando, believe it or not.
Although the calendar of special events seems to thin out a bit in
summer, diversions exist elsewhere in the city.
 &HT;    This summer, audience members help solve a mystery set in deep
space at the Orlando Science Center's planetarium. Performances,
which run through Aug. 31, feature a planetarium show and a live
actor. It's based on the PBS geographical quiz show ``Where in the
World Is Carmen San Diego,'' and is included with admission to the
center: $14.25, seniors $13.25, ages 3 to 11 $11.
 &HT;    Through Sept. 10, ``Hunters of the Sky'' looks at birds of prey,
with over 70 mounted specimens of falcons, eagles, owls and other
raptors. The center, at 777 East Princeton St., is open daily;
(407) 896-7151.
 &HT;    Through Sept. 3, ``Art of the 20th Century,'' at the Cornell
Fine Arts Museum, on Holt Avenue at Rollins College in Winter Park,
looks at the last 100 years through European and American painting,
sculpture, prints and drawings from the permanent collection. Free
admission; closed Monday. Call (407) 646-2526.
 &HT;    The Orlando Museum of Art, 2416 North Mills Ave. in Loch Haven
Park, will display beadwork, baskets and decorated animal hides
from Kenya, Tanzania and other East African countries. The
exhibition runs through May 27. Admission is $6, seniors and
students $4, ages 4 to 11 $2; closed Monday: (407) 896-4231.
 &HT;    The Orlando-University of Central Florida Shakespeare Festival
begins Sept. 20, with previews of ``The Woman in Black,'' a
Victorian mystery by Stephen Mallatratt, from a book by Susan Hill,
which runs through Oct. 28. Performances are at the Orange County
Historical Museum Theatre in Loch Haven Park, at Princeton and
Mills Avenues in Orlando. Tickets: $7 to $20; (407) 893-4600.
 &HT;    At Disney's Wide World of Sports, adjacent to the theme parks,
the 2000 Junior Olympic Games, the Amateur Athletic Union's top
event, features track and field competition from July 31 through
Aug. 5. The 250-acre complex is off Exit 25B of I-4. Daily general
admission is $9, ages 3 to 9, $7; (407) 939-1505.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    At Discovery Cove, off Exits 27A and 28 of I-4, guests come face
to face with bottlenose dolphins. They can touch the animals, and
trainers allow some patrons to play water games with the dolphins.
The park requires reservations. It employs one staff member for
every five guests to provide supervision for the dolphins, better
service and no waiting lines. Admission is $179 for ages 6 and
older who want to swim with dolphins; ages 3 to 5 and those
skipping a dolphin swim pay $89.
 &HT;    Admission includes a meal outside at the Laguna Grill, use of
snorkeling and beach gear (towels, chairs, hammocks), and a
seven-day pass to the original SeaWorld park nearby, where visitors
can see Shamu and ride the Kraken, a roller coaster that made its
debut last month; (877) 434-7268.
 &HT;    Otherwise, ticket prices are one area where Orlando's theme
parks don't show variety. Prices for a one-day, one-park ticket for
ages 10 and up at Disney World's theme parks are $46; ages 3 to 9,
$37. The Magic Kingdom and Disney-MGM Studios are off Exit 25B;
Epcot and Animal Kingdom, Exit 26B. For all Disney parks
information: (407) 824-4321.
 &HT;    Ticket prices are the same at SeaWorld, at Exits 27A and 28,
(407) 351-3600; and Universal, at Exits 30A and 29B, (407)
363-8000. Various multipark and multiday tickets are also
available.
 &HT;    The theme-park attractions with the highest profile _ in the
physical sense _ are roller coasters, and Orlando boasts a crop of
wild new ones. SeaWorld's Kraken rises 15 stories, then plunges its
screaming passengers toward earth at 65 m.p.h. Riders on the
Incredible Hulk are practically blown out of the starting gate from
what looks like a giant missile launcher at Universal's Islands of
Adventure park, which opened in May 1999.
 &HT;    The Rock 'n' Roller Coaster at Disney-MGM Studios, which opened
a year ago, treats its riders to an equally explosive start,
accelerating from zero to 60 m.p.h. in 2.8 seconds, with the music
of the band Aerosmith pumped through the seats.
 &HT;    A simulator game that pits guests of DisneyQuest, an indoor
interactive playground, against the same motley gang from the
Pirates of the Caribbean ride opened June 21 outside the park in
Downtown Disney. Four players, all wearing three-dimensional
goggles, board a sailing ship under attack (its deck sickeningly
weaves and rolls on springs controlled by computer) and defend
themselves with cannons. Tickets cost $27, ages 3 to 9, $21.
 &HT;    Universal's ``Terminator 2,'' a film that opened in 1996 at
Universal Studios Theme Park, involves three-dimensional thrills
and bizarre special effects, including fog and rain. It's the usual
end-of-the-world scenario, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, complete
with realistic guns booming and screeching pileups.
 &HT;    One of the most elegant new rides is the beautiful interactive
carousel of Dr. Seuss animals _ pull the reins and hair might fly
up or a tongue stick out _ at Islands of Adventure. The bright pink
and blue carousel is based on the art of Dr. Seuss.
 &HT;    One park that has no problem with crowds is Splendid China, a
76-acre park opened in 1993 by a Chinese company to acquaint
Americans with the country's culture. It features nearly deserted
gardens with more than 60 miniature models of historical Chinese
sites.
 &HT;    Sparse crowds usually greet its chief daily theatrical
production, the ``Mysterious Kingdom of the Orient'' _ a pity since
it is a knockout performance of colorful costumes, traditional
Chinese song and dance, acrobatics and martial arts. Follow Route
192 west from I-4 to Exit 25B in Kissimmee (directions and ticket
information from park employees may be incorrect). Admission costs,
which include the show and a terrible meal, are $19.95, and $9.95
ages 5 to 12. Call (407) 396-7111 or (800) 244-6226.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    It's always easier to park your car and stay on the grounds of a
theme park, but hotels and food usually cost more. A moderately
priced choice is Disney's All-Star Resorts, at Exit 26B of I-4,
with a mammoth complex of 5,760 basic rooms with outdoor pools,
bakery, food court and free bus service to Disney attractions.
Rooms are $74 to $104 a night; (407) 934-7639.
 &HT;    Minutes east of the theme parks is the Hampton Inn-Orlando
Convention Center hotel, 8900 Universal Blvd., which opened in
April 1999. The staff is helpful and friendly; there is a heated
outdoor pool; the free Continental breakfast includes cereals,
bagels, yogurt, fruit and waffles; and the 170 spotless rooms, with
maple furniture and decorated in bright, tropical colors, are $69
to $109, depending on the season; (407) 354-4447, fax (407)
354-3031.
 &HT;    Budget: A simple hotel tucked away off Interstate 4, the Comfort
Inn Maingate South is an easy 15-minute ride from most of the theme
parks. It is off I-4 Exit 23, eight miles west of Walt Disney World
at 5510 U.S. Highway 27 North. Its 150 rooms cost $40 to $100, more
on holidays; outdoor pool; (800) 255-4386, fax (863) 424-1723.
 &HT;    Luxury: Elegant, sand-colored Italian marble and huge bouquets
of native orchids give the lobby of the Peabody Orlando, 9801
International Drive, a distinctive Florida feel, and it's fun to
watch the hotel's mascot ducks cavort in the fountain. Its 891
modern rooms are decorated in yellow and moss green; doubles are
$330 a night; outdoor pool and children's pool with waterfall;
(407) 352-4000, fax (407) 351-0073.
 &HT;    The Grand Floridian Resort and Spa, Disney's sprawling
Victorian-style hotel, boasts 900 quaint rooms, decorated with
printed wall coverings, marble-top sinks, ceiling fans and
Victorian woodwork. Big gingerbread porches with climbing roses
overlook a lagoon on theme park grounds with a man-made beach and
two outdoor pools, one for children. Off Exit 25B. Doubles are $304
to $400; (407) 824-3000, fax (407) 824-3186.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    At Universal's CityWalk, a 30-acre dining and entertainment
complex, Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville is (what else?) completely
casual. Try conch fritters dipped in honey-mustard sauce, followed
by Caribbean grilled chicken salad, topped with almonds and
habanero-mango ranch dressing, and key lime pie for dessert. Dinner
for two with margaritas, about $50; (407) 224-2155.
 &HT;    Nearby, also at CityWalk, you'll find Emeril's, the Orlando
branch of a series of restaurants owned by the popular TV chef
Emeril Lagasse. Reservations are recommended. Specialties include
an appetizer of Maine lobster cheesecake; roasted rack of lamb with
a Creole mustard sauce, and fresh Florida orange cake with
strawberry compote. Dinner for two with wine, $125; (407) 224-2424.
 &HT;    Of all the theme parks, SeaWorld serves some of the best food,
and its casual Bimini Bay restaurant, with waiters and waitresses
wearing Hawaiian shirts, is typical. The menu features salads,
pasta and seafood; try the fresh Florida grouper sandwich or
marinated steak on a roll with sauteed onions and peppers. Lunch
for two with beer costs about $40 (you must have a park pass);
(407) 351-3600.
 &HT;    Two sessions of a gospel brunch occur every Sunday morning at
the House of Blues Music Hall, at Downtown Disney (where no park
pass is needed), featuring nationally known and local gospel
performers, and an all-you-can-eat Southern buffet. The meal and
show cost $28; ages 3 to 9, $15. It's a good idea to buy tickets at
least a week in advance at (407) 934-2583, fax (407) 934-2216, or
at the House of Blues box office.
 &HT;    A good family-style restaurant near Walt Disney World is
Pebbles, 12551 State Road 535; (407) 827-1111. It serves a nice mix
of dishes adults enjoy, like the excellent black bean soup ($3.25)
or Mediterranean salad ($7.50), and child-friendly items like the
cheeseburger ($6.95)and white chocolate mousse ($3.95).

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By ANNASUE MCCLEAVE WILSON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It is hard to admit to being a soccer mom. That cliched title is
easier to bear, however, when the games are played on a crescent
moon of a beach in Brazil, where the team kicks up sand as white
and soft as baby powder.
 &HT;    Our family loves soccer, that jogo bonito, ``beautiful game,''
as they call it in Brazil. My son John, 14, has played since
kindergarten, and his coach, Paulo Barreto, is a Brazilian who
played professionally there. His Cincinnati company, Paulo's
Brazilian Soccer Training and Camp, began organizing trips last
year to his hometown, Florianopolis.
 &HT;    The coin toss to see whether my husband, John, or I would
accompany John on a trip there last March was agonizing. Not only
was the trip too expensive for everyone to go, but we would have
had to take our two younger children out of school. I won.
 &HT;    This particular eight-day trip was designed for a team, but not
all of John's team, the Cincinnati Classics, participated, so they
were supplemented by other boys and girls of the same age and
ability from around Cincinnati. Parents were welcome, and of the 17
players, only 5 traveled without a parent, making us a group of 39.
 &HT;    Other camps offer various levels of training and can include
international tournament play for players who hope to play at the
college level and beyond, but this trip offered the right balance
of soccer and vacation for us. Our trip revolved around three
matches with local teams and four morning training sessions, but
equally important was the beachfront hotel and organized afternoon
sightseeing.
 &HT;    Florianopolis, on the island of Santa Catarina, is about 350
miles down the coast from Sao Paulo. Our 24-hour trip was not made
easier by the way we were routed by the travel agency _ through
Detroit, Miami and Sao Paulo _ but the teenagers seemed oblivious
to the inconvenience.
 &HT;    When they weren't giving water to thirsty dogs in travel cages
or bumping into airport police officers on bikes, they managed to
find enough open space at each stopover to kick around a soccer
ball. In Sao Paulo, they sprawled over the floor of the airport
terminal, lounging or sleeping on backpacks.
 &HT;    Several in our group thought the island of Santa Catarina, on
which most of the city of Florianopolis is built, looked like one
of the islands of Hawaii from the air. The hilly countryside is
laden with subtropical flora, and both land and sea are dotted with
ancient black boulders that must have looked like gods to the
Tupi-Guarani Indians who first inhabited the region. The island is
connected to the mainland by two bridges, although one, the
Hercilio Luz, is closed to motor traffic.
 &HT;    Our bright blue hotel, the Ingleses Praia, sat beside a beach
called Praia dos Ingleses, on the northeast shore of the island,
about 22 miles from downtown Florianopolis. The beach was named for
English explorers who poked around there about 1700. Each room had
a balcony, cool tile floors, air-conditioning and surprisingly
spacious bathrooms.
 &HT;    We ate breakfast and occasionally another meal at the hotel,
buffet style. Fruits and juices were fresh and delicious, but all
else paled in the morning before the coffee. It was deeply rich and
black, served with hot milk.
 &HT;    Our first evening at the hotel, the parents in the group were
content to laze wearily on the veranda, drinking caipirinhas, a
lime drink usually made with cachaca, Brazilian sugar-cane liquor.
 &HT;    A few of the boys perused the small strip of beachfront
restaurants and souvenir shops selling T-shirts and crocheted
bikinis and thongs on either side of the hotel (their favorite
souvenirs were fake designer watches, but because the dollar is
strong against the real, almost everything seemed inexpensive).
 &HT;    Afterward, they brought out a ball and began to kick it around
on the beach under the stars. This attracted some local people and
soon a full fledged game was on. Not one Brazilian guy walking
along the beach _ student, vendor or fisherman _ could keep his
foot off the ball if it came near him during our practices, and
their skill was remarkable.
 &HT;    The team's first training session was at the Hotel Fazenda Jomar
on the mainland near Santo Amaro da Imperatriz, a spa town founded
to commemorate an imperial visit in 1845 by Dom Pedro II, emperor
of Brazil. Having traveled inland 18 miles, we were in dense green
mountains, and the group practiced on a field in danger of being
enveloped by the lush vegetation surrounding it.
 &HT;    Afterward, we all took advantage of the resort's amenities. The
team swam in the pool, went rafting in rapids not rapid enough to
be classified, and sank paddle boats in the lake.
 &HT;    On a shaded veranda, an accordionist played German music, a
reminder of the large influx of Germans who emigrated to this part
of Brazil in the 19th century. Several parents joined an ecological
walk around the grounds, which led to a waterfall of rare beauty;
on our way up, we disturbed a lizard the size of a small alligator.
 &HT;    Florianopolis has two professional soccer teams, the Figueirense
Futebol Clube, based on the mainland, and the island's Avai Futebol
Clube, both of which cultivate players from a young age.
 &HT;    After a day of practice and a couple of scrimmages on the beach,
our first match took place against the Figueirense youth team in
the club's stadium in Florianopolis. The Brazilians, who were a
year or two older than John, won, 8-1, which did not seem to
diminish the excitement of playing a challenging opponent.
 &HT;    Our game with the young Avai team two days later took place just
before the professional match between Avai and Caxias (from the
city of Porto Alegre). As the game went on, the stands filled up
with fans who cheered on both teams (we lost, 2-0) but who were
unforgiving of their pro team when it lost.
 &HT;    After the game with Figueirense, our bus took us to the beach at
Joaquina, which is on the east side of the island and is famous for
surfing championships held there each year. After an open-air
lunch, the team wandered the beach, climbing the huge rocks at one
end and examining jellyfish that washed onto the shore.
 &HT;    Behind Praia da Joaquina are massive sand dunes of Saharan
proportion and, even though the wind whipped up the sand so
fiercely it practically blinded them, the team was determined to go
sandboarding. John and the boys happily forged their way up the
dunes over and over again, and dumped their weight in sand onto the
floor of the bus on the way back to the hotel.
 &HT;    The next day, we boarded a schooner and headed for the island of
Anhatomirim, where the team was to practice in the shadow of the
Santa Cruz fort, built in 1744. A Brazilian school group about the
same age as ours happened to be touring the fort, too, and it
wasn't long before another impromptu match was on.
 &HT;    The Brazilian girls watched the American boys with obvious
pleasure, much to the consternation of the Brazilian boys, which
gave the game an edge it might not ordinarily have had.
 &HT;    The Brazilian boys, on the other hand, didn't know what to make
of the four highly skilled girls playing on our team. Only the
parents were in awe of the setting: on one side a centuries-old
fortress and on the other, the magnificent sea.
 &HT;    After morning training another day, the group ventured downtown.
The two bridges to the mainland shadow 19th-century ocher-colored
market buildings along the old waterfront. Across the street from
the Praca 15 de Novembro, the city's main square, John stopped at
the entrance to the pink Cruz e Souza Palace to have his picture
taken beside the guard, who wore an elaborate uniform and held a
rifle with a bayonet.
 &HT;    The team climbed the steps to the bright white Metropolitan
Cathedral, where a Mass was being said, then plopped down
pretending to be exhausted.
 &HT;    Since this day of sightseeing had little appeal for them, the
high point of the excursion was stopping at a shop called Futebol
Mania to buy official Figueirense and Avai jerseys. A few fathers
wandered off to the bus station to find Cuban cigars.
 &HT;    Our meals outside the hotel were in seafood restaurants or in
churrascarias, places serving meat smorgasbords called rodizio (all
you can eat). Seafood lunches were waterside, in open-air
restaurants that served us at long communal tables _ local shrimp
in butter and oil, mussels in salsa, deep-fried whitefish, served
with plates of beets, shredded carrots and tomato, clay pots of
rich black beans, and crisp, deep-fried manioc root.
 &HT;    When Mr. Barreto realized that our ravenous American teen-agers
kept passing on the plates of fish and making faces, he arranged
that they be served chicken with rice and French fries instead.
 &HT;    One evening we were taken to a cafe colonial, a Brazilian-style
high tea inspired by the customs of European immigrants in the 19th
century. On the beach, we snacked on corn on the cob served in the
husk and drank cool milk right from coconuts. The team's favorite
drink was Guarana, sweet green soda with lots of caffeine.
 &HT;    A cultural exchange had been arranged for us the afternoon
before we left at the Colegia Energia, a private school in
Florianopolis that prides itself on its English instruction. When
we arrived, we were met with wild cheers, as if we were a busload
of American movie stars. Our boys were a little stunned at such a
reception and we had to remind them to keep smiling.
 &HT;    The school had prepared a short program and presented each of
our team members with souvenir notebooks. A soccer scrimmage was
held in which our girls soundly beat four Brazilian girls. While
our boys were outclassed on the field, they were mobbed by
Brazilian girls and boys asking for e-mail addresses and
photographs.
 &HT;    Once our team got used to the attention, those who spoke a
little Spanish _ none spoke Portuguese _ tried to talk to the
students, who answered in their halting English.
 &HT;    That evening, we lost our last match, against the Astel Futebol
Clube, but only by a single goal. Once, John collided with an Astel
player, knocking him to the ground. As he would have back home, he
reached down to help the Brazilian to his feet, but was scolded by
Mr. Barreto.
 &HT;    ``Here you leave him alone,'' he said. ``Find him after the game
if you want.''
 &HT;    When we returned to Cincinnati, the team went on to become
division champions, at least partly because of improved soccer
skills. But the trip had also provided the players with a surprise,
the opportunity to represent their country by their actions: How
they played the game did matter.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY SUSAN ALLEN TOTH  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When I have finally opened the mail, unpacked my bags, started
the washing machine, restocked the refrigerator and riffled through
a few newspapers, I am ready to stay home forever.
 &HT;    Yes, I realize, I'm totally exhausted. I stroke our cats,
defrost some homemade soup and soon send my husband, James, to his
office so I can luxuriate in having the house to myself. No, I am
not going to travel again for a long time. Months and months, maybe
longer. Who knows when I'll ever be ready to study another
guidebook or decipher another map?
 &HT;    I am tired of looking at menus. I can't bear to sleep in any
more strange bedrooms. I want to forget all those uneasy searches
for public toilets.
 &HT;    Our friends applaud this decision. They think James and I travel
too much anyway.
 &HT;    ``Of course you have a cold,'' one says. ``Everyone knows you
can't travel on a plane without getting sick.'' Another chimes in:
``How can you complain of not getting any writing done? You're
never home.''
 &HT;    Some urge us to slow down, take it easy. Others suggest getting
back to work, enjoying my garden, volunteering for a local charity.
I'm sure they are right. In fact, as I nod in agreement, I feel
morally invigorated.
 &HT;    Travel is a kind of addiction, I tell myself, and I must simply
let it go for a while. I can. I know I can.
 &HT;    Then something happens. If I could predict it, I might be able
to ward it off. But the travel impulse is sly, mysterious and
dazzlingly sudden.
 &HT;    Last December, glad to be home for the holidays after a hectic
trip to London, I was savoring the prospect of quiet weeks ahead.
Then I opened a Christmas card from a family friend in my Iowa
hometown.
 &HT;    Close to 90 now, cheerful and bright but unable to travel,
Isabel wrote: ``You certainly travel a lot. But do keep it up as
long as you can! I wish I had seen York and Cornwall. But I am so
thankful I didn't miss the Alhambra and the Prado.''
 &HT;    The Alhambra! I thought. The Prado! Why is it we've never been
there? Immediately I began to think of Spain. Why not Portugal too?
Perhaps next fall?
 &HT;    A few days later, on New Year's Eve, I was transfixed by the
televised fantasy of fireworks that lit up the bejeweled Eiffel
Tower. Oh, Paris, beautiful City of Light _ had it really been five
years since we'd walked along the Seine?
 &HT;    I could instantly envision broad boulevards, thin women with
chic silk scarves, and a corner patisserie where I bought a moist
round mouthful of chocolate cake with an indescribably delicious
coffee-flavored icing. Definitely, back to Paris.
 &HT;    Cleaning my desk the following week, I took off the wall an
outdated calendar with large color photographs of waterfalls. I
hadn't really noticed it much. But now I was transfixed by a view
of Upper Yosemite Falls, tumbling down magnificent snow-covered
cliffs.
 &HT;    I hadn't been to Yosemite for more than 30 years, and I barely
remembered my one day there. How could I think of Paris, or Spain,
when I hadn't really experienced Yosemite?
 &HT;    I am helpless against unforeseen assaults on my homebound
intentions. Occasionally, when I am already on a trip, I have a
passing glimpse of a destination that calls to me so seductively I
know I must answer.
 &HT;    One June afternoon, on a fast train from Inverness to London, I
glanced, for only a whizzing moment, far across miles of empty
fields to a tiny village of snug houses clustered around a bay. The
surrounding countryside seemed so undiscovered, the village so
remote.
 &HT;    I studied my map: Alnmouth, Northumberland. Three years later,
we were walking through light rain down its long quiet beach.
 &HT;    On another afternoon, this time in early fall, I sat on a level
rock at the northernmost edge of Scotland and gazed, entranced, at
the distant gray-green shapes of the Orkney Islands half-hidden in
the mist. They seemed as if they belonged to a different world.
``James,'' I said, ``we have to go there.''
 &HT;    James smiled, partly in resignation. ``O.K.,'' he said amiably,
``but why don't we finish this trip first?''
 &HT;    Two Octobers later, we rented a cottage for a week on an Orkney
island called, disarmingly, Mainland.
 &HT;    Sometimes all it takes is a single picture or a few words. We
once spent a week near Cromer, on the north Norfolk coast, because
that was the phrase _ ``the north Norfolk coast'' _ occasionally
appearing in travel guides, that had begun to haunt my imagination.
It sounded so unlike the cozy Cotswolds, or the well-trodden and
prosaically named Lake District, or flowering Kent, the Garden of
England.
 &HT;    Then I read P. D. James' ``Devices and Desires,'' and her
intensely evocative description of that bleak, windswept land made
me determined to see if she was right. And she was.
 &HT;    Although P.D. James first sent me to Norfolk, Arthur Conan Doyle
to Dartmoor and Dylan Thomas to Wales, I am not often struck by the
travel impulse when I read nonfiction travel books. This may seem
odd, since I have indulged in such memoirs myself.
 &HT;    But, after closing a particularly atmospheric or vivid travel
narrative, I tend to think: ``OK. Wonderful. Now I've been there.''
 &HT;    If the author has filled my eyes with his or her personal
vision, I am perversely not moved to explore certain corners of
Provence, or Tuscany, or Patagonia.
 &HT;    If, however, I am swept into a place by reading a novel or
biography, I absorb the landscape sidewise, out of the corner of my
eye. Then I become intrigued.
 &HT;    After finishing Tim Binding's ``Lying With the Enemy,'' a novel
about life in occupied Guernsey during World War II, I asked James,
``Why haven't we ever been to the Channel Islands?'' He looked
blank. I handed him the novel, and the next year, we were off.
 &HT;    My love of Scottish islands began, not with a guidebook, but
with Gavin Maxwell's ``Ring of Bright Water,'' an account of life
with his beloved otters.
 &HT;    I soon tracked Maxwell through his later, much harsher, memoirs,
``The Rocks Remain'' and ``Raven Seek Thy Brother,'' and, after
many years, I eventually looked across the water to the lonely site
of his nearly inaccessible Camusfearna.
 &HT;    As James and I walked parts of the rocky coastline of western
Scotland, and explored Mull and Skye that year, I often thought of
Maxwell's intense, troubled spirit. His love of this land had
brought us there.
 &HT;    Or had it? As a young girl, I used to sit at the piano and play
through ``The Fireside Book of Folk Songs.'' One of my favorites
was ``The Skye Boat Song.'' Its simple, poignant melody had an
unforgettable refrain, especially alluring to an Iowa girl who
lived far from any ocean: ``Carry the lad who was born to be
king/Over the sea to Skye.''
 &HT;    I didn't know the story of Bonnie Prince Charlie, and I had no
idea where Skye was, but I knew loss and regret when I heard it.
Over the sea to Skye: someday perhaps I would know more.
 &HT;    So even a song can start me thinking of travel. After our trip
to Hawaii last winter, James began to play a CD we bought there. He
plays it a lot, especially when it gets really cold outside.
 &HT;    Like James, I had been delighted by our relaxing, balmy week on
Molokai. So when I hear ``Polynesian Love Song'' or ``Lovely Hula
Hands,'' I don't think, ``This is corny.'' No, I want to be back on
our screened lanai, listening to the warm splashing surf a few
yards away.
 &HT;    It doesn't take much. Sometimes I think I should look for an
antidote, but I haven't thought of one yet. Maybe if I muttered
Thoreau's proud boast, ``I have traveled much in Concord''? If I
repeated like a mantra, ``Home is where the heart is''? What about
a CD that played, again and again, ``Home Sweet Home''? I'm not
sure any of it would help.

 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  My husband wants adventure, I want a spa with a spiritual
nature and our kids don't fit into either category. Help! Know of a
vacation destination that will meet everyone's needs?
 &HT;     A:  The Enchantment Resort in Sedona, Ariz., and its new
destination spa, Mii Amo, will surely please all. Nestled within a
truly enchanting red-rock canyon, Enchantment offers scenic
relaxation and adventure, as well as Camp Coyote, ranked one of the
best kids programs in the world.
 &HT;    One of Enchantment's treasures is Uqualla, the shaman and former
chief of the Havasupai tribe, who acts as spiritual ambassador for
the resort. While children play and learn about the local cultures,
guests can be pampered by healing oils that are blessed each
morning. Spiritual consultations are available, and the staff
offers an array of innovative spa treatments.
 &HT;    The Enchantment concierge can arrange a variety of hiking and
rock-climbing tours for the adventurous or the mere stroller.
 &HT;    Your family should save an afternoon to fly by helicopter with
Uqualla to his tribe's village at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.
There you can enjoy a swim and picnic at the nearby falls.
 &HT;    At the end of the day, whether your crew is rested or exhausted,
Enchantment's restaurants offer an eclectic selection of spa
cuisine and hearty southwestern fare, as well as an excellent wine
list.
 &HT;    Book now for the holidays to reserve an Enchantment casita or
one of Mii Amo's 16 rooms and suites. Room rates begin at $195 per
night. For more information, call (800) 826-4180 or visit
www.enchantmentresort.com.
 &HT;     Q:  I've always been intrigued by the mystique of Harvard, but
the two times I visited Cambridge I felt like such an outsider. How
can I get a better feel for the place?
 &HT;     A:2 Home to Harvard, MIT and the JFK School of Government,
Cambridge may well be the premiere locale for intellectuals in this
country. Most visiting lecturers and dignitaries stay at the
Charles Hotel on Harvard Square.
 &HT;    Not only is it within walking distance, at times the Charles
Hotel seems like an extension of the Harvard campus. Relax in the
foyer library and watch the comings and goings _ or better yet, ask
the concierge to arrange a private tour of Harvard with a recent
graduate. Often the guide runs into buddies, conversations ensue
and the scene opens before you.
 &HT;    I would suggest arriving early for breakfast at the Charles'
lively Henrietta's Table, where writer David Mamet or Cambridge's
dot.com elite might just be doing business.
 &HT;    Lunch would be a good idea at a popular joint called Bartley's
Burger Cottage (1246 Massachusetts Ave.), but Casablanca (40
Brattle St.), with its fusion Mediterranean cuisine, is a more
original mainstay of Cambridge _ especially in the evening at the
bar.
 &HT;    Room rates at the Charles Hotel begin at $250 per night.
Facilities include a day spa and three-story health-and-fitness
center. For more information, call (800) 882-1818, or visit
www.charleshotel.com.
 &HT;     Q:  I have played on golf courses around the world and really
enjoy when courses throw a unique spin into the golfing experience.
Can you suggest a course that offers a bit of originality?
 &HT;     A:  The new ``Heli-Golf Package,'' offered by Rosewood Hotels &AMP;
Resorts in Little Dix Bay in the Virgin Islands, provides the
originality that adventurous golfers look for. This heli-golf
experience features a scenic helicopter flight to St. Croix, where
golfers are deposited right onto the green and are then processed
through customs and immigrations with minimal hassle.
 &HT;    Described as ``the Caribbean's most exclusive golf getaway,''
Little Dix Bay's Heli-Golf Package includes three nights'
accommodation for two; greens fees, cart and golf escort; daily
breakfast and dinner; and complimentary water activities. Rates are
based on double occupancy, with deluxe accommodations starting at
$3,500 and suite accommodations starting at $5,000.
 &HT;    Laurance Rockefeller founded exclusive Little Dix Bay in 1964.
These low-key yet upscale accommodations are set in a 500-acre
garden paradise and a pristine private beach. For more information,
call (888) ROSEWOOD.
 &HT;     Q:  I am a single female who enjoys traveling alone, but
occasionally I feel left out of certain social activities because I
am not part of a couple. Do other independent travelers ever feel
this way?
 &HT;     A:  Some people do _ and, unfortunately, it's usually women.
Because of this, Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines now feature their popular
gentlemen hosts aboard every cruise. With their gracious social
skills and dancing ability, these men are well-known for making
single female passengers feel at ease in all social activities.
 &HT;    Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines offers exhilarating cruises throughout
Africa, the Caribbean, Europe and South America. For more
information and reservations, visit www.eurocruises.com, or call
(800) 688-3876.
 &HT;     Q:  Over the years, I have noticed that some hotels are more
in-tune with the needs of female business travelers than others.
Can you recommend a good hotel that focuses on this segment of the
population?
 &HT;     A:  The Pan Pacific San Francisco recently surveyed female
guests _ focusing on those with business needs _ and has made
several adjustments.
 &HT;    The women who were surveyed reported that females appreciate
softer, more personal touches. For example, minibars are now
stocked with wines by the glass. There are lighter menu choices
available on the 24-hour room-service menu, personal butlers can be
provided and the staff is available to escort female guests to
their rooms. This is just a handful of the amenities that are part
of the hotel's signature luxury service.
 &HT;    For business travelers, the Pan Pacific has added a virtual
office to many rooms. Copy capabilities are now part of the in-room
fax machine, and all guest rooms will soon be wired for high-speed
Internet access. The hotel has also acquired a number of laptop
computers.
 &HT;    The Pan Pacific San Francisco is located just one block from
Union Square and is a cable-car ride away from the city's theater
district, fine restaurants and other tourist attractions. For more
information and reservations, call (800) 533-6465, or visit the web
at www.panpac.com.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the
publisher of ENTREE, a travel newsletter.

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The romance of the rails lingers in a handful of deluxe trains
that run on well-orchestrated trips throughout the world.
 &HT;    What's the appeal of such luxury train trips? Vintage rail cars
that have been lavishly restored; itineraries that take passengers
through some of the most beautiful landscapes and cities in the
world; impeccable service; and food that is extraordinary.
 &HT;    For those who can pay the price, here are some elegant journeys
to consider. Prices are per person, based on double occupancy.
 &HT;    The American Spirit (601 Union St., Seattle, WA 98101;
888-533-7245; www.americanspiritrail.com) features 1950s Budd-built
streamliner railcars. The company offers a variety of western
itineraries that include visits to the Glacier, Grand Tetons and
Yellowstone National Parks.
 &HT;    Trips last anywhere from two to nine nights. Accommodations are
in hotels, not on the train, and motorcoaches supplement the rail
service.
 &HT;    A typical itinerary is the ``Montana Rockies Rail Tour,'' which
begins in Post Falls, Idaho, continues on to Missoula, Mont., and
ends in Livingston, Mont. The cost of the two-night trip begins at
$499. Lodging and daily breakfast, as well as transfers from
Spokane Airport, are included.
 &HT;    The American Orient-Express (5100 Main St., Downer's Grove, IL
60515; 888-759-3944; www.americanorientexpress.com) utilizes 15
vintage rail cars on its luxury voyages. The train travels cross
country as well as on shorter trips throughout the West.
 &HT;    For example, the ``Rockies and Yellowstone'' itinerary is a
six-night trip that commences in Denver and visits Arches National
Park, Salt Lake City, Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks.
The cost begins at $2,990.
 &HT;    The best-known name in luxury-train travel is probably
Orient-Express Trains &AMP; Cruises (Sea Containers House, 20 Upper
Ground, London, SE1 9PF, England; 800-524-2420;
www.orient-expresstrains.com or c/o Abercrombie and Kent
International Inc., 1520 Kensington Road, Oak Brook, IL 60523;
800-323-7308; www.abercrombiekent.com). They offer a variety of
rail itineraries for the well-heeled traveler.
 &HT;    The most famous trip is the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express
(VSOE), which features restored period rail cars, lavish service
and fine dining. Sightseeing and meals are included in most
itineraries.
 &HT;    The classic VSOE trip is from London to Paris and Venice, or
vice versa. The cost of this one-night trip starts at $1,970. The
train makes other trips as well, such as from Venice to Florence
and Rome; Venice to Prague, Paris and London; Venice to Lucerne,
Paris and London; and Paris to Budapest, Bucharest and Istanbul.
 &HT;    Orient-Express also offers the Eastern &AMP; Oriental Express, a
luxury train that has three itineraries: Singapore to Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, and Bangkok (and vice versa); Bangkok to Chiang Mai,
Thailand; and Bangkok to Angkor Wat, Cambodia, and Singapore. The
overnight Singapore to Kuala Lumpur itinerary begins at $600.
 &HT;    Among the other Orient-Express trains are the Northern Belle,
which calls itself the ``Orient-Express of the North.'' It offers
day trips and weekend getaways in Britain with departures from
Liverpool, Manchester and York. Again, vintage rail carriages, fine
dining and a high level of service are offered.
 &HT;    Orient Express also operates the Great South Pacific Express in
Australia, a restored luxury train that runs from Brisbane to
Cairns; Brisbane to Sydney; Brisbane to Canberra and Sydney; and
Sydney to Brisbane and Cairns. Contact them for more information.
 &HT;    The Royal Scotsman (c/o Abercrombie and Kent International Inc.
1520 Kensington Road, Oak Brook, IL 60523; 800-323-7308;
www.abercrombiekent.com or www.royalscotsman.com) takes visitors
through the rugged Scottish countryside on some of the beautiful
rails in Britain. The four-night Edinburgh to Edinburgh itinerary
is $4,150.
 &HT;    Beginning in the Scottish capital, the journey takes riders
through the dramatic West Highlands and rolling Perthshire hills
and then to the North East. Two-night trips start at $2,350. Rates
include all meals, wine and alcoholic and beverages as well as
sightseeing visits.
 &HT;    In Canada, the Rocky Mountaineer Railtours (1150 Station St.,
Vancouver, B.C. Canada V6A 2X7; 800-665-7245;
www.rockymountaineer.com) has a variety of trips through the
Canadian Rockies. These trains travel by daylight only, affording
the best views of the mountains. Overnights are spent in hotels.
 &HT;    One of the briefest excursions is the ``Two Day Redleaf Tour,''
a one-night trip through the Canadian Rockies, traveling from
Vancouver to either Jasper, Alberta, or Calgary, Alberta, with an
overnight hotel stay in Kamloops, Alberta. Prices start at $358 per
person and include the overnight stay and some meals.
 &HT;    Premier Selections (342 Madison Ave., Suite 916, New York, N.Y.
10173; 800-234-4000; www.premierselections.com) is the sales agent
for a number of great train journeys, including the Al Andalus
Express, the Royal Scottsman and the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express.
Rates start at $1,512 and include five nights on the train, one in
a hotel, most meals and sightseeing.
 &HT;    Premier also has a variety of other luxury trains, including the
Blue Train in South Africa. This train runs from Capetown to
Pretoria, with an overnight in Johannesburg. The price of this
five-night train/tour package _ which includes four hotel nights,
one night on the train itself and some meals _ starts at $1,946.
 &HT;    Finally, Copper Canyon's Sierra Madre Express runs from Tuscon,
Ariz., down into Mexico's fabled Copper Canyon region. The
seven-night trip, which includes hotel and train accommodation, as
well as most meals, begins at $2,545.

 (Color slide included.) 
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Like anyone living in a popular tourist destination, I developed
a standard tour itinerary years ago for my out-of-town friends who
wish to see all that Reno, Nev., has to offer.
 &HT;    Because Reno is known for gaming, most of my visitors want to
stop at a casino to try their luck at gambling or to see a show.
But it doesn't take long for the area's natural beauty to weave its
magic. Even in midsummer, the snow-dappled Sierra Nevada set
against the clear blue sky is like a magnet for sightseers.
 &HT;    My personal tour starts in Truckee, home of the Donner Memorial
Museum, (530) 582-7892, that tells the heartbreaking story of the
Donner Party who were trapped in the Sierra Nevada during one of
our area's worst winters.
 &HT;    Then it's up Route 89 to Tahoe City for a stop at Fanny Bridge
overlooking the Truckee River. Fanny Bridge gets its name from the
poses people strike as they lean over the bridge to watch the giant
trout swim below.
 &HT;    A driving tour of Carson City, the capital of Nevada, is next.
Then, depending on the mood of the group, we head west to Genoa _
reputedly Nevada's first settlement and home of the state's oldest
saloon _ or east to Virginia City _ where the rich ore deposits of
this lavish boomtown helped finance Union efforts in the Civil War
and buy Nevada early statehood.
 &HT;    A visit to Reno wouldn't be complete without a walk along the
Truckee River and downtown _ usually with a stop at the National
Auto Museum _ and a meal at a Basque hotel, where ethnic fare is
served family-style at long tables.
 &HT;    But beware: If a Basque meal strikes your fancy, be prepared to
eat. A lot. The food is served in a series of seemingly endless
courses, giving diners ample time to visit with table mates who may
hail from other parts of the city, country or world.
 &HT;    A drive to Pyramid Lake, just northeast of Reno and famous for
being the location where Charleton Heston was filmed parting the
Red Sea in the ``The Ten Commandments,'' usually tops off my
official tour.
 &HT;    Recently, when I took a group of out-of-towners on a sightseeing
trip of the city, I realized how outdated my tour route had become.
All the sites I've mentioned are indeed worth visiting, but now
there's so much more to explore.
 &HT;    For example, a trip to Pyramid Lake and Paiute Indian
Reservation's Fish Hatchery, (775) 476-0500, where one can see how
prehistoric cui-ui fish are being saved, now can include a stop at
the new Tribal Museum and a visit to the Bureau of Land
Management's Wild Horse Adoption Center, (775) 475-2222 or
www.blm.gov/whb. Horses from Nevada's vast open spaces are brought
and kept here until people adopt them.
 &HT;    The Truckee River, with its 100-mile ribbon of rapids that lead
from Lake Tahoe down to Pyramid Lake, always has been a vital part
of my tour. Now, it's even more important.
 &HT;    Downtown Reno is where the Truckee River intersects with
Virginia Street, the town's main drag. It's home to many new
developments, including:
 &HT;    _ A walk with promenades for special events, such as ballet and
symphony performances.
 &HT;    _ Riverside paths, a favorite with bikers and hikers.
Eventually, these will run the length of the city once development
is completed.
 &HT;    _ Many unique Riverfront buildings, including the Riverside
Hotel and Casino, which is being converted into lofts and studios;
Christ Scientist Church, which is becoming the Lear Theater; and
McKinley School, which has been restored as an arts-and-cultural
center.
 &HT;    Some developments have new twists, such as the bluff overlooking
the south side of the Truckee River, where Reno's elite built homes
in what is now called the Newlands area. These days, local
residents involved in historic preservation lead tours of the area,
mostly for Elderhostel students, (877) 426-8056 or
www.elderhostel.org. Special group tours can be arranged by calling
the Historic Reno Preservation Society, (775) 322-1638.
 &HT;    At the other end of Virginia Street is the town's signature
landmark, an overhead street sign that proclaims Reno as ``The
Biggest Little City in the World.'' This is the fourth version of
the sign, which during World War II served as a landmark for
veterans heading home from the Pacific.
 &HT;    Two models of the sign adorn downtown. The newest is known to
turn green on St. Patrick's Day or go dark during Christmas carol
sing-alongs, while the other model is mounted outside the National
Auto Museum on Lake Street.
 &HT;    West of Reno, my tour now includes a stop at Chrissie Caughlin
Park beside the Truckee River. It's a place I have walked my
miniature schnauzers for years, but I now know that pioneers
traveling in covered wagons used a large pine tree, roughly four
feet in diameter, as their ``post office'' and stuck notes for
other immigrants on its trunk.
 &HT;    Further west, it's possible to take a look-see at the
still-visible tracks of the Donner Party wagon train on either side
of Dog Valley Road near a small town called Verdi.
 &HT;    Reno is rich in history, from miners searching for quick riches
and pioneers hurrying to reach California, to railroaders laying
the train tracks that would stitch together the North American
continent. For decades, it stood as an oasis for people traveling
to other places.
 &HT;    Now, Reno is no longer just a pass-through town. In fact, the
place that's so dear to my heart has finally become a fascinating
vacation destination in its own right.
 &HT;    For more information Reno, call (800) 367-7366 or visit

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By SARA KENNEDY  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    If competition breeds creativity, then the theme parks in and
around Orlando are a case in point. They have some of the most
imaginative ways for guests to spend their leisure time. Everything
from a roller coaster that shoots its human cargo from the starting
gate with all the subtlety of a missile launcher to a beautiful
carousel based on the art of Dr. Seuss greet visitors to Orlando
theme parks this summer.
 &HT;    Vacationers will also find an entirely new park, SeaWorld's
Discovery Cove, which opened July 1. It features a tropical, beachy
setting populated with 10,000 fish and 300 birds. Guests can play
with dolphins under the supervision of trainers, and enjoy
leisurely swimming, snorkeling and sunning with smaller crowds and
no lines, thanks to a daily limit of 1,000 patrons.
 &HT;    Orlando's theme parks, which last year attracted more than 60
million visitors (up from 48.5 million in 1996), are trying to
handle the crush of crowds better. Discovery Cove's competitors are
trying various ways to cut down waiting lines, a chief complaint of
theme park customers.
 &HT;    Walt Disney World has inaugurated Fastpass, in which guests can
pick up free tickets near its 18 most popular attractions for later
in the day when the lines are shorter. Universal is testing a
similar arrangement called Fast Track. Disney also opens a
different theme park early each day, offering first admittance to
guests at Disney hotels. Until Sept. 4, Universal is rewarding
multiday ticket holders and its hotel guests with early entry to
its two parks, from 7 to 10 a.m. daily.
 &HT;    A spring drought that fueled wildfires and meant watering
restrictions for millions of Floridians seems to have left the
theme parks unscathed. During visits in June, pathways were lined
with bright blooms of bougainvillea and hibiscus, big shade trees
were heavy with foliage, and the acres of perfectly trimmed grass
were as lush as always.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Theme parks aren't the only show in Orlando, believe it or not.
Although the calendar of special events seems to thin out a bit in
summer, diversions exist elsewhere in the city.
 &HT;    This summer, audience members help solve a mystery set in deep
space at the Orlando Science Center's planetarium. Performances,
which run through Aug. 31, feature a planetarium show and a live
actor. It's based on the PBS geographical quiz show ``Where in the
World Is Carmen San Diego,'' and is included with admission to the
center: $14.25, seniors $13.25, ages 3 to 11 $11.
 &HT;    Through Sept. 10, ``Hunters of the Sky'' looks at birds of prey,
with over 70 mounted specimens of falcons, eagles, owls and other
raptors. The center, at 777 East Princeton St., is open daily;
(407) 896-7151.
 &HT;    Through Sept. 3, ``Art of the 20th Century,'' at the Cornell
Fine Arts Museum, on Holt Avenue at Rollins College in Winter Park,
looks at the last 100 years through European and American painting,
sculpture, prints and drawings from the permanent collection. Free
admission; closed Monday. Call (407) 646-2526.
 &HT;    The Orlando Museum of Art, 2416 North Mills Ave. in Loch Haven
Park, will display beadwork, baskets and decorated animal hides
from Kenya, Tanzania and other East African countries. The
exhibition runs through May 27. Admission is $6, seniors and
students $4, ages 4 to 11 $2; closed Monday: (407) 896-4231.
 &HT;    The Orlando-University of Central Florida Shakespeare Festival
begins Sept. 20, with previews of ``The Woman in Black,'' a
Victorian mystery by Stephen Mallatratt, from a book by Susan Hill,
which runs through Oct. 28. Performances are at the Orange County
Historical Museum Theatre in Loch Haven Park, at Princeton and
Mills Avenues in Orlando. Tickets: $7 to $20; (407) 893-4600.
 &HT;    At Disney's Wide World of Sports, adjacent to the theme parks,
the 2000 Junior Olympic Games, the Amateur Athletic Union's top
event, features track and field competition from July 31 through
Aug. 5. The 250-acre complex is off Exit 25B of I-4. Daily general
admission is $9, ages 3 to 9, $7; (407) 939-1505.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    At Discovery Cove, off Exits 27A and 28 of I-4, guests come face
to face with bottlenose dolphins. They can touch the animals, and
trainers allow some patrons to play water games with the dolphins.
The park requires reservations. It employs one staff member for
every five guests to provide supervision for the dolphins, better
service and no waiting lines. Admission is $179 for ages 6 and
older who want to swim with dolphins; ages 3 to 5 and those
skipping a dolphin swim pay $89.
 &HT;    Admission includes a meal outside at the Laguna Grill, use of
snorkeling and beach gear (towels, chairs, hammocks), and a
seven-day pass to the original SeaWorld park nearby, where visitors
can see Shamu and ride the Kraken, a roller coaster that made its
debut last month; (877) 434-7268.
 &HT;    Otherwise, ticket prices are one area where Orlando's theme
parks don't show variety. Prices for a one-day, one-park ticket for
ages 10 and up at Disney World's theme parks are $46; ages 3 to 9,
$37. The Magic Kingdom and Disney-MGM Studios are off Exit 25B;
Epcot and Animal Kingdom, Exit 26B. For all Disney parks
information: (407) 824-4321.
 &HT;    Ticket prices are the same at SeaWorld, at Exits 27A and 28,
(407) 351-3600; and Universal, at Exits 30A and 29B, (407)
363-8000. Various multipark and multiday tickets are also
available.
 &HT;    The theme-park attractions with the highest profile _ in the
physical sense _ are roller coasters, and Orlando boasts a crop of
wild new ones. SeaWorld's Kraken rises 15 stories, then plunges its
screaming passengers toward earth at 65 m.p.h. Riders on the
Incredible Hulk are practically blown out of the starting gate from
what looks like a giant missile launcher at Universal's Islands of
Adventure park, which opened in May 1999.
 &HT;    The Rock 'n' Roller Coaster at Disney-MGM Studios, which opened
a year ago, treats its riders to an equally explosive start,
accelerating from zero to 60 m.p.h. in 2.8 seconds, with the music
of the band Aerosmith pumped through the seats.
 &HT;    A simulator game that pits guests of DisneyQuest, an indoor
interactive playground, against the same motley gang from the
Pirates of the Caribbean ride opened June 21 outside the park in
Downtown Disney. Four players, all wearing three-dimensional
goggles, board a sailing ship under attack (its deck sickeningly
weaves and rolls on springs controlled by computer) and defend
themselves with cannons. Tickets cost $27, ages 3 to 9, $21.
 &HT;    Universal's ``Terminator 2,'' a film that opened in 1996 at
Universal Studios Theme Park, involves three-dimensional thrills
and bizarre special effects, including fog and rain. It's the usual
end-of-the-world scenario, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, complete
with realistic guns booming and screeching pileups.
 &HT;    One of the most elegant new rides is the beautiful interactive
carousel of Dr. Seuss animals _ pull the reins and hair might fly
up or a tongue stick out _ at Islands of Adventure. The bright pink
and blue carousel is based on the art of Dr. Seuss.
 &HT;    One park that has no problem with crowds is Splendid China, a
76-acre park opened in 1993 by a Chinese company to acquaint
Americans with the country's culture. It features nearly deserted
gardens with more than 60 miniature models of historical Chinese
sites.
 &HT;    Sparse crowds usually greet its chief daily theatrical
production, the ``Mysterious Kingdom of the Orient'' _ a pity since
it is a knockout performance of colorful costumes, traditional
Chinese song and dance, acrobatics and martial arts. Follow Route
192 west from I-4 to Exit 25B in Kissimmee (directions and ticket
information from park employees may be incorrect). Admission costs,
which include the show and a terrible meal, are $19.95, and $9.95
ages 5 to 12. Call (407) 396-7111 or (800) 244-6226.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    It's always easier to park your car and stay on the grounds of a
theme park, but hotels and food usually cost more. A moderately
priced choice is Disney's All-Star Resorts, at Exit 26B of I-4,
with a mammoth complex of 5,760 basic rooms with outdoor pools,
bakery, food court and free bus service to Disney attractions.
Rooms are $74 to $104 a night; (407) 934-7639.
 &HT;    Minutes east of the theme parks is the Hampton Inn-Orlando
Convention Center hotel, 8900 Universal Blvd., which opened in
April 1999. The staff is helpful and friendly; there is a heated
outdoor pool; the free Continental breakfast includes cereals,
bagels, yogurt, fruit and waffles; and the 170 spotless rooms, with
maple furniture and decorated in bright, tropical colors, are $69
to $109, depending on the season; (407) 354-4447, fax (407)
354-3031.
 &HT;    Budget: A simple hotel tucked away off Interstate 4, the Comfort
Inn Maingate South is an easy 15-minute ride from most of the theme
parks. It is off I-4 Exit 23, eight miles west of Walt Disney World
at 5510 U.S. Highway 27 North. Its 150 rooms cost $40 to $100, more
on holidays; outdoor pool; (800) 255-4386, fax (863) 424-1723.
 &HT;    Luxury: Elegant, sand-colored Italian marble and huge bouquets
of native orchids give the lobby of the Peabody Orlando, 9801
International Drive, a distinctive Florida feel, and it's fun to
watch the hotel's mascot ducks cavort in the fountain. Its 891
modern rooms are decorated in yellow and moss green; doubles are
$330 a night; outdoor pool and children's pool with waterfall;
(407) 352-4000, fax (407) 351-0073.
 &HT;    The Grand Floridian Resort and Spa, Disney's sprawling
Victorian-style hotel, boasts 900 quaint rooms, decorated with
printed wall coverings, marble-top sinks, ceiling fans and
Victorian woodwork. Big gingerbread porches with climbing roses
overlook a lagoon on theme park grounds with a man-made beach and
two outdoor pools, one for children. Off Exit 25B. Doubles are $304
to $400; (407) 824-3000, fax (407) 824-3186.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    At Universal's CityWalk, a 30-acre dining and entertainment
complex, Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville is (what else?) completely
casual. Try conch fritters dipped in honey-mustard sauce, followed
by Caribbean grilled chicken salad, topped with almonds and
habanero-mango ranch dressing, and key lime pie for dessert. Dinner
for two with margaritas, about $50; (407) 224-2155.
 &HT;    Nearby, also at CityWalk, you'll find Emeril's, the Orlando
branch of a series of restaurants owned by the popular TV chef
Emeril Lagasse. Reservations are recommended. Specialties include
an appetizer of Maine lobster cheesecake; roasted rack of lamb with
a Creole mustard sauce, and fresh Florida orange cake with
strawberry compote. Dinner for two with wine, $125; (407) 224-2424.
 &HT;    Of all the theme parks, SeaWorld serves some of the best food,
and its casual Bimini Bay restaurant, with waiters and waitresses
wearing Hawaiian shirts, is typical. The menu features salads,
pasta and seafood; try the fresh Florida grouper sandwich or
marinated steak on a roll with sauteed onions and peppers. Lunch
for two with beer costs about $40 (you must have a park pass);
(407) 351-3600.
 &HT;    Two sessions of a gospel brunch occur every Sunday morning at
the House of Blues Music Hall, at Downtown Disney (where no park
pass is needed), featuring nationally known and local gospel
performers, and an all-you-can-eat Southern buffet. The meal and
show cost $28; ages 3 to 9, $15. It's a good idea to buy tickets at
least a week in advance at (407) 934-2583, fax (407) 934-2216, or
at the House of Blues box office.
 &HT;    A good family-style restaurant near Walt Disney World is
Pebbles, 12551 State Road 535; (407) 827-1111. It serves a nice mix
of dishes adults enjoy, like the excellent black bean soup ($3.25)
or Mediterranean salad ($7.50), and child-friendly items like the
cheeseburger ($6.95)and white chocolate mousse ($3.95).

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By ANNASUE MCCLEAVE WILSON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It is hard to admit to being a soccer mom. That cliched title is
easier to bear, however, when the games are played on a crescent
moon of a beach in Brazil, where the team kicks up sand as white
and soft as baby powder.
 &HT;    Our family loves soccer, that jogo bonito, ``beautiful game,''
as they call it in Brazil. My son John, 14, has played since
kindergarten, and his coach, Paulo Barreto, is a Brazilian who
played professionally there. His Cincinnati company, Paulo's
Brazilian Soccer Training and Camp, began organizing trips last
year to his hometown, Florianopolis.
 &HT;    The coin toss to see whether my husband, John, or I would
accompany John on a trip there last March was agonizing. Not only
was the trip too expensive for everyone to go, but we would have
had to take our two younger children out of school. I won.
 &HT;    This particular eight-day trip was designed for a team, but not
all of John's team, the Cincinnati Classics, participated, so they
were supplemented by other boys and girls of the same age and
ability from around Cincinnati. Parents were welcome, and of the 17
players, only 5 traveled without a parent, making us a group of 39.
 &HT;    Other camps offer various levels of training and can include
international tournament play for players who hope to play at the
college level and beyond, but this trip offered the right balance
of soccer and vacation for us. Our trip revolved around three
matches with local teams and four morning training sessions, but
equally important was the beachfront hotel and organized afternoon
sightseeing.
 &HT;    Florianopolis, on the island of Santa Catarina, is about 350
miles down the coast from Sao Paulo. Our 24-hour trip was not made
easier by the way we were routed by the travel agency _ through
Detroit, Miami and Sao Paulo _ but the teenagers seemed oblivious
to the inconvenience.
 &HT;    When they weren't giving water to thirsty dogs in travel cages
or bumping into airport police officers on bikes, they managed to
find enough open space at each stopover to kick around a soccer
ball. In Sao Paulo, they sprawled over the floor of the airport
terminal, lounging or sleeping on backpacks.
 &HT;    Several in our group thought the island of Santa Catarina, on
which most of the city of Florianopolis is built, looked like one
of the islands of Hawaii from the air. The hilly countryside is
laden with subtropical flora, and both land and sea are dotted with
ancient black boulders that must have looked like gods to the
Tupi-Guarani Indians who first inhabited the region. The island is
connected to the mainland by two bridges, although one, the
Hercilio Luz, is closed to motor traffic.
 &HT;    Our bright blue hotel, the Ingleses Praia, sat beside a beach
called Praia dos Ingleses, on the northeast shore of the island,
about 22 miles from downtown Florianopolis. The beach was named for
English explorers who poked around there about 1700. Each room had
a balcony, cool tile floors, air-conditioning and surprisingly
spacious bathrooms.
 &HT;    We ate breakfast and occasionally another meal at the hotel,
buffet style. Fruits and juices were fresh and delicious, but all
else paled in the morning before the coffee. It was deeply rich and
black, served with hot milk.
 &HT;    Our first evening at the hotel, the parents in the group were
content to laze wearily on the veranda, drinking caipirinhas, a
lime drink usually made with cachaca, Brazilian sugar-cane liquor.
 &HT;    A few of the boys perused the small strip of beachfront
restaurants and souvenir shops selling T-shirts and crocheted
bikinis and thongs on either side of the hotel (their favorite
souvenirs were fake designer watches, but because the dollar is
strong against the real, almost everything seemed inexpensive).
 &HT;    Afterward, they brought out a ball and began to kick it around
on the beach under the stars. This attracted some local people and
soon a full fledged game was on. Not one Brazilian guy walking
along the beach _ student, vendor or fisherman _ could keep his
foot off the ball if it came near him during our practices, and
their skill was remarkable.
 &HT;    The team's first training session was at the Hotel Fazenda Jomar
on the mainland near Santo Amaro da Imperatriz, a spa town founded
to commemorate an imperial visit in 1845 by Dom Pedro II, emperor
of Brazil. Having traveled inland 18 miles, we were in dense green
mountains, and the group practiced on a field in danger of being
enveloped by the lush vegetation surrounding it.
 &HT;    Afterward, we all took advantage of the resort's amenities. The
team swam in the pool, went rafting in rapids not rapid enough to
be classified, and sank paddle boats in the lake.
 &HT;    On a shaded veranda, an accordionist played German music, a
reminder of the large influx of Germans who emigrated to this part
of Brazil in the 19th century. Several parents joined an ecological
walk around the grounds, which led to a waterfall of rare beauty;
on our way up, we disturbed a lizard the size of a small alligator.
 &HT;    Florianopolis has two professional soccer teams, the Figueirense
Futebol Clube, based on the mainland, and the island's Avai Futebol
Clube, both of which cultivate players from a young age.
 &HT;    After a day of practice and a couple of scrimmages on the beach,
our first match took place against the Figueirense youth team in
the club's stadium in Florianopolis. The Brazilians, who were a
year or two older than John, won, 8-1, which did not seem to
diminish the excitement of playing a challenging opponent.
 &HT;    Our game with the young Avai team two days later took place just
before the professional match between Avai and Caxias (from the
city of Porto Alegre). As the game went on, the stands filled up
with fans who cheered on both teams (we lost, 2-0) but who were
unforgiving of their pro team when it lost.
 &HT;    After the game with Figueirense, our bus took us to the beach at
Joaquina, which is on the east side of the island and is famous for
surfing championships held there each year. After an open-air
lunch, the team wandered the beach, climbing the huge rocks at one
end and examining jellyfish that washed onto the shore.
 &HT;    Behind Praia da Joaquina are massive sand dunes of Saharan
proportion and, even though the wind whipped up the sand so
fiercely it practically blinded them, the team was determined to go
sandboarding. John and the boys happily forged their way up the
dunes over and over again, and dumped their weight in sand onto the
floor of the bus on the way back to the hotel.
 &HT;    The next day, we boarded a schooner and headed for the island of
Anhatomirim, where the team was to practice in the shadow of the
Santa Cruz fort, built in 1744. A Brazilian school group about the
same age as ours happened to be touring the fort, too, and it
wasn't long before another impromptu match was on.
 &HT;    The Brazilian girls watched the American boys with obvious
pleasure, much to the consternation of the Brazilian boys, which
gave the game an edge it might not ordinarily have had.
 &HT;    The Brazilian boys, on the other hand, didn't know what to make
of the four highly skilled girls playing on our team. Only the
parents were in awe of the setting: on one side a centuries-old
fortress and on the other, the magnificent sea.
 &HT;    After morning training another day, the group ventured downtown.
The two bridges to the mainland shadow 19th-century ocher-colored
market buildings along the old waterfront. Across the street from
the Praca 15 de Novembro, the city's main square, John stopped at
the entrance to the pink Cruz e Souza Palace to have his picture
taken beside the guard, who wore an elaborate uniform and held a
rifle with a bayonet.
 &HT;    The team climbed the steps to the bright white Metropolitan
Cathedral, where a Mass was being said, then plopped down
pretending to be exhausted.
 &HT;    Since this day of sightseeing had little appeal for them, the
high point of the excursion was stopping at a shop called Futebol
Mania to buy official Figueirense and Avai jerseys. A few fathers
wandered off to the bus station to find Cuban cigars.
 &HT;    Our meals outside the hotel were in seafood restaurants or in
churrascarias, places serving meat smorgasbords called rodizio (all
you can eat). Seafood lunches were waterside, in open-air
restaurants that served us at long communal tables _ local shrimp
in butter and oil, mussels in salsa, deep-fried whitefish, served
with plates of beets, shredded carrots and tomato, clay pots of
rich black beans, and crisp, deep-fried manioc root.
 &HT;    When Mr. Barreto realized that our ravenous American teen-agers
kept passing on the plates of fish and making faces, he arranged
that they be served chicken with rice and French fries instead.
 &HT;    One evening we were taken to a cafe colonial, a Brazilian-style
high tea inspired by the customs of European immigrants in the 19th
century. On the beach, we snacked on corn on the cob served in the
husk and drank cool milk right from coconuts. The team's favorite
drink was Guarana, sweet green soda with lots of caffeine.
 &HT;    A cultural exchange had been arranged for us the afternoon
before we left at the Colegia Energia, a private school in
Florianopolis that prides itself on its English instruction. When
we arrived, we were met with wild cheers, as if we were a busload
of American movie stars. Our boys were a little stunned at such a
reception and we had to remind them to keep smiling.
 &HT;    The school had prepared a short program and presented each of
our team members with souvenir notebooks. A soccer scrimmage was
held in which our girls soundly beat four Brazilian girls. While
our boys were outclassed on the field, they were mobbed by
Brazilian girls and boys asking for e-mail addresses and
photographs.
 &HT;    Once our team got used to the attention, those who spoke a
little Spanish _ none spoke Portuguese _ tried to talk to the
students, who answered in their halting English.
 &HT;    That evening, we lost our last match, against the Astel Futebol
Clube, but only by a single goal. Once, John collided with an Astel
player, knocking him to the ground. As he would have back home, he
reached down to help the Brazilian to his feet, but was scolded by
Mr. Barreto.
 &HT;    ``Here you leave him alone,'' he said. ``Find him after the game
if you want.''
 &HT;    When we returned to Cincinnati, the team went on to become
division champions, at least partly because of improved soccer
skills. But the trip had also provided the players with a surprise,
the opportunity to represent their country by their actions: How
they played the game did matter.
 &HT;    -----

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY SUSAN ALLEN TOTH  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When I have finally opened the mail, unpacked my bags, started
the washing machine, restocked the refrigerator and riffled through
a few newspapers, I am ready to stay home forever.
 &HT;    Yes, I realize, I'm totally exhausted. I stroke our cats,
defrost some homemade soup and soon send my husband, James, to his
office so I can luxuriate in having the house to myself. No, I am
not going to travel again for a long time. Months and months, maybe
longer. Who knows when I'll ever be ready to study another
guidebook or decipher another map?
 &HT;    I am tired of looking at menus. I can't bear to sleep in any
more strange bedrooms. I want to forget all those uneasy searches
for public toilets.
 &HT;    Our friends applaud this decision. They think James and I travel
too much anyway.
 &HT;    ``Of course you have a cold,'' one says. ``Everyone knows you
can't travel on a plane without getting sick.'' Another chimes in:
``How can you complain of not getting any writing done? You're
never home.''
 &HT;    Some urge us to slow down, take it easy. Others suggest getting
back to work, enjoying my garden, volunteering for a local charity.
I'm sure they are right. In fact, as I nod in agreement, I feel
morally invigorated.
 &HT;    Travel is a kind of addiction, I tell myself, and I must simply
let it go for a while. I can. I know I can.
 &HT;    Then something happens. If I could predict it, I might be able
to ward it off. But the travel impulse is sly, mysterious and
dazzlingly sudden.
 &HT;    Last December, glad to be home for the holidays after a hectic
trip to London, I was savoring the prospect of quiet weeks ahead.
Then I opened a Christmas card from a family friend in my Iowa
hometown.
 &HT;    Close to 90 now, cheerful and bright but unable to travel,
Isabel wrote: ``You certainly travel a lot. But do keep it up as
long as you can! I wish I had seen York and Cornwall. But I am so
thankful I didn't miss the Alhambra and the Prado.''
 &HT;    The Alhambra! I thought. The Prado! Why is it we've never been
there? Immediately I began to think of Spain. Why not Portugal too?
Perhaps next fall?
 &HT;    A few days later, on New Year's Eve, I was transfixed by the
televised fantasy of fireworks that lit up the bejeweled Eiffel
Tower. Oh, Paris, beautiful City of Light _ had it really been five
years since we'd walked along the Seine?
 &HT;    I could instantly envision broad boulevards, thin women with
chic silk scarves, and a corner patisserie where I bought a moist
round mouthful of chocolate cake with an indescribably delicious
coffee-flavored icing. Definitely, back to Paris.
 &HT;    Cleaning my desk the following week, I took off the wall an
outdated calendar with large color photographs of waterfalls. I
hadn't really noticed it much. But now I was transfixed by a view
of Upper Yosemite Falls, tumbling down magnificent snow-covered
cliffs.
 &HT;    I hadn't been to Yosemite for more than 30 years, and I barely
remembered my one day there. How could I think of Paris, or Spain,
when I hadn't really experienced Yosemite?
 &HT;    I am helpless against unforeseen assaults on my homebound
intentions. Occasionally, when I am already on a trip, I have a
passing glimpse of a destination that calls to me so seductively I
know I must answer.
 &HT;    One June afternoon, on a fast train from Inverness to London, I
glanced, for only a whizzing moment, far across miles of empty
fields to a tiny village of snug houses clustered around a bay. The
surrounding countryside seemed so undiscovered, the village so
remote.
 &HT;    I studied my map: Alnmouth, Northumberland. Three years later,
we were walking through light rain down its long quiet beach.
 &HT;    On another afternoon, this time in early fall, I sat on a level
rock at the northernmost edge of Scotland and gazed, entranced, at
the distant gray-green shapes of the Orkney Islands half-hidden in
the mist. They seemed as if they belonged to a different world.
``James,'' I said, ``we have to go there.''
 &HT;    James smiled, partly in resignation. ``O.K.,'' he said amiably,
``but why don't we finish this trip first?''
 &HT;    Two Octobers later, we rented a cottage for a week on an Orkney
island called, disarmingly, Mainland.
 &HT;    Sometimes all it takes is a single picture or a few words. We
once spent a week near Cromer, on the north Norfolk coast, because
that was the phrase _ ``the north Norfolk coast'' _ occasionally
appearing in travel guides, that had begun to haunt my imagination.
It sounded so unlike the cozy Cotswolds, or the well-trodden and
prosaically named Lake District, or flowering Kent, the Garden of
England.
 &HT;    Then I read P. D. James' ``Devices and Desires,'' and her
intensely evocative description of that bleak, windswept land made
me determined to see if she was right. And she was.
 &HT;    Although P.D. James first sent me to Norfolk, Arthur Conan Doyle
to Dartmoor and Dylan Thomas to Wales, I am not often struck by the
travel impulse when I read nonfiction travel books. This may seem
odd, since I have indulged in such memoirs myself.
 &HT;    But, after closing a particularly atmospheric or vivid travel
narrative, I tend to think: ``OK. Wonderful. Now I've been there.''
 &HT;    If the author has filled my eyes with his or her personal
vision, I am perversely not moved to explore certain corners of
Provence, or Tuscany, or Patagonia.
 &HT;    If, however, I am swept into a place by reading a novel or
biography, I absorb the landscape sidewise, out of the corner of my
eye. Then I become intrigued.
 &HT;    After finishing Tim Binding's ``Lying With the Enemy,'' a novel
about life in occupied Guernsey during World War II, I asked James,
``Why haven't we ever been to the Channel Islands?'' He looked
blank. I handed him the novel, and the next year, we were off.
 &HT;    My love of Scottish islands began, not with a guidebook, but
with Gavin Maxwell's ``Ring of Bright Water,'' an account of life
with his beloved otters.
 &HT;    I soon tracked Maxwell through his later, much harsher, memoirs,
``The Rocks Remain'' and ``Raven Seek Thy Brother,'' and, after
many years, I eventually looked across the water to the lonely site
of his nearly inaccessible Camusfearna.
 &HT;    As James and I walked parts of the rocky coastline of western
Scotland, and explored Mull and Skye that year, I often thought of
Maxwell's intense, troubled spirit. His love of this land had
brought us there.
 &HT;    Or had it? As a young girl, I used to sit at the piano and play
through ``The Fireside Book of Folk Songs.'' One of my favorites
was ``The Skye Boat Song.'' Its simple, poignant melody had an
unforgettable refrain, especially alluring to an Iowa girl who
lived far from any ocean: ``Carry the lad who was born to be
king/Over the sea to Skye.''
 &HT;    I didn't know the story of Bonnie Prince Charlie, and I had no
idea where Skye was, but I knew loss and regret when I heard it.
Over the sea to Skye: someday perhaps I would know more.
 &HT;    So even a song can start me thinking of travel. After our trip
to Hawaii last winter, James began to play a CD we bought there. He
plays it a lot, especially when it gets really cold outside.
 &HT;    Like James, I had been delighted by our relaxing, balmy week on
Molokai. So when I hear ``Polynesian Love Song'' or ``Lovely Hula
Hands,'' I don't think, ``This is corny.'' No, I want to be back on
our screened lanai, listening to the warm splashing surf a few
yards away.
 &HT;    It doesn't take much. Sometimes I think I should look for an
antidote, but I haven't thought of one yet. Maybe if I muttered
Thoreau's proud boast, ``I have traveled much in Concord''? If I
repeated like a mantra, ``Home is where the heart is''? What about
a CD that played, again and again, ``Home Sweet Home''? I'm not
sure any of it would help.

 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  My husband wants adventure, I want a spa with a spiritual
nature and our kids don't fit into either category. Help! Know of a
vacation destination that will meet everyone's needs?
 &HT;     A:  The Enchantment Resort in Sedona, Ariz., and its new
destination spa, Mii Amo, will surely please all. Nestled within a
truly enchanting red-rock canyon, Enchantment offers scenic
relaxation and adventure, as well as Camp Coyote, ranked one of the
best kids programs in the world.
 &HT;    One of Enchantment's treasures is Uqualla, the shaman and former
chief of the Havasupai tribe, who acts as spiritual ambassador for
the resort. While children play and learn about the local cultures,
guests can be pampered by healing oils that are blessed each
morning. Spiritual consultations are available, and the staff
offers an array of innovative spa treatments.
 &HT;    The Enchantment concierge can arrange a variety of hiking and
rock-climbing tours for the adventurous or the mere stroller.
 &HT;    Your family should save an afternoon to fly by helicopter with
Uqualla to his tribe's village at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.
There you can enjoy a swim and picnic at the nearby falls.
 &HT;    At the end of the day, whether your crew is rested or exhausted,
Enchantment's restaurants offer an eclectic selection of spa
cuisine and hearty southwestern fare, as well as an excellent wine
list.
 &HT;    Book now for the holidays to reserve an Enchantment casita or
one of Mii Amo's 16 rooms and suites. Room rates begin at $195 per
night. For more information, call (800) 826-4180 or visit
www.enchantmentresort.com.
 &HT;     Q:  I've always been intrigued by the mystique of Harvard, but
the two times I visited Cambridge I felt like such an outsider. How
can I get a better feel for the place?
 &HT;     A:2 Home to Harvard, MIT and the JFK School of Government,
Cambridge may well be the premiere locale for intellectuals in this
country. Most visiting lecturers and dignitaries stay at the
Charles Hotel on Harvard Square.
 &HT;    Not only is it within walking distance, at times the Charles
Hotel seems like an extension of the Harvard campus. Relax in the
foyer library and watch the comings and goings _ or better yet, ask
the concierge to arrange a private tour of Harvard with a recent
graduate. Often the guide runs into buddies, conversations ensue
and the scene opens before you.
 &HT;    I would suggest arriving early for breakfast at the Charles'
lively Henrietta's Table, where writer David Mamet or Cambridge's
dot.com elite might just be doing business.
 &HT;    Lunch would be a good idea at a popular joint called Bartley's
Burger Cottage (1246 Massachusetts Ave.), but Casablanca (40
Brattle St.), with its fusion Mediterranean cuisine, is a more
original mainstay of Cambridge _ especially in the evening at the
bar.
 &HT;    Room rates at the Charles Hotel begin at $250 per night.
Facilities include a day spa and three-story health-and-fitness
center. For more information, call (800) 882-1818, or visit
www.charleshotel.com.
 &HT;     Q:  I have played on golf courses around the world and really
enjoy when courses throw a unique spin into the golfing experience.
Can you suggest a course that offers a bit of originality?
 &HT;     A:  The new ``Heli-Golf Package,'' offered by Rosewood Hotels &AMP;
Resorts in Little Dix Bay in the Virgin Islands, provides the
originality that adventurous golfers look for. This heli-golf
experience features a scenic helicopter flight to St. Croix, where
golfers are deposited right onto the green and are then processed
through customs and immigrations with minimal hassle.
 &HT;    Described as ``the Caribbean's most exclusive golf getaway,''
Little Dix Bay's Heli-Golf Package includes three nights'
accommodation for two; greens fees, cart and golf escort; daily
breakfast and dinner; and complimentary water activities. Rates are
based on double occupancy, with deluxe accommodations starting at
$3,500 and suite accommodations starting at $5,000.
 &HT;    Laurance Rockefeller founded exclusive Little Dix Bay in 1964.
These low-key yet upscale accommodations are set in a 500-acre
garden paradise and a pristine private beach. For more information,
call (888) ROSEWOOD.
 &HT;     Q:  I am a single female who enjoys traveling alone, but
occasionally I feel left out of certain social activities because I
am not part of a couple. Do other independent travelers ever feel
this way?
 &HT;     A:  Some people do _ and, unfortunately, it's usually women.
Because of this, Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines now feature their popular
gentlemen hosts aboard every cruise. With their gracious social
skills and dancing ability, these men are well-known for making
single female passengers feel at ease in all social activities.
 &HT;    Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines offers exhilarating cruises throughout
Africa, the Caribbean, Europe and South America. For more
information and reservations, visit www.eurocruises.com, or call
(800) 688-3876.
 &HT;     Q:  Over the years, I have noticed that some hotels are more
in-tune with the needs of female business travelers than others.
Can you recommend a good hotel that focuses on this segment of the
population?
 &HT;     A:  The Pan Pacific San Francisco recently surveyed female
guests _ focusing on those with business needs _ and has made
several adjustments.
 &HT;    The women who were surveyed reported that females appreciate
softer, more personal touches. For example, minibars are now
stocked with wines by the glass. There are lighter menu choices
available on the 24-hour room-service menu, personal butlers can be
provided and the staff is available to escort female guests to
their rooms. This is just a handful of the amenities that are part
of the hotel's signature luxury service.
 &HT;    For business travelers, the Pan Pacific has added a virtual
office to many rooms. Copy capabilities are now part of the in-room
fax machine, and all guest rooms will soon be wired for high-speed
Internet access. The hotel has also acquired a number of laptop
computers.
 &HT;    The Pan Pacific San Francisco is located just one block from
Union Square and is a cable-car ride away from the city's theater
district, fine restaurants and other tourist attractions. For more
information and reservations, call (800) 533-6465, or visit the web
at www.panpac.com.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the
publisher of ENTREE, a travel newsletter.

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The romance of the rails lingers in a handful of deluxe trains
that run on well-orchestrated trips throughout the world.
 &HT;    What's the appeal of such luxury train trips? Vintage rail cars
that have been lavishly restored; itineraries that take passengers
through some of the most beautiful landscapes and cities in the
world; impeccable service; and food that is extraordinary.
 &HT;    For those who can pay the price, here are some elegant journeys
to consider. Prices are per person, based on double occupancy.
 &HT;    The American Spirit (601 Union St., Seattle, WA 98101;
888-533-7245; www.americanspiritrail.com) features 1950s Budd-built
streamliner railcars. The company offers a variety of western
itineraries that include visits to the Glacier, Grand Tetons and
Yellowstone National Parks.
 &HT;    Trips last anywhere from two to nine nights. Accommodations are
in hotels, not on the train, and motorcoaches supplement the rail
service.
 &HT;    A typical itinerary is the ``Montana Rockies Rail Tour,'' which
begins in Post Falls, Idaho, continues on to Missoula, Mont., and
ends in Livingston, Mont. The cost of the two-night trip begins at
$499. Lodging and daily breakfast, as well as transfers from
Spokane Airport, are included.
 &HT;    The American Orient-Express (5100 Main St., Downer's Grove, IL
60515; 888-759-3944; www.americanorientexpress.com) utilizes 15
vintage rail cars on its luxury voyages. The train travels cross
country as well as on shorter trips throughout the West.
 &HT;    For example, the ``Rockies and Yellowstone'' itinerary is a
six-night trip that commences in Denver and visits Arches National
Park, Salt Lake City, Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks.
The cost begins at $2,990.
 &HT;    The best-known name in luxury-train travel is probably
Orient-Express Trains &AMP; Cruises (Sea Containers House, 20 Upper
Ground, London, SE1 9PF, England; 800-524-2420;
www.orient-expresstrains.com or c/o Abercrombie and Kent
International Inc., 1520 Kensington Road, Oak Brook, IL 60523;
800-323-7308; www.abercrombiekent.com). They offer a variety of
rail itineraries for the well-heeled traveler.
 &HT;    The most famous trip is the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express
(VSOE), which features restored period rail cars, lavish service
and fine dining. Sightseeing and meals are included in most
itineraries.
 &HT;    The classic VSOE trip is from London to Paris and Venice, or
vice versa. The cost of this one-night trip starts at $1,970. The
train makes other trips as well, such as from Venice to Florence
and Rome; Venice to Prague, Paris and London; Venice to Lucerne,
Paris and London; and Paris to Budapest, Bucharest and Istanbul.
 &HT;    Orient-Express also offers the Eastern &AMP; Oriental Express, a
luxury train that has three itineraries: Singapore to Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, and Bangkok (and vice versa); Bangkok to Chiang Mai,
Thailand; and Bangkok to Angkor Wat, Cambodia, and Singapore. The
overnight Singapore to Kuala Lumpur itinerary begins at $600.
 &HT;    Among the other Orient-Express trains are the Northern Belle,
which calls itself the ``Orient-Express of the North.'' It offers
day trips and weekend getaways in Britain with departures from
Liverpool, Manchester and York. Again, vintage rail carriages, fine
dining and a high level of service are offered.
 &HT;    Orient Express also operates the Great South Pacific Express in
Australia, a restored luxury train that runs from Brisbane to
Cairns; Brisbane to Sydney; Brisbane to Canberra and Sydney; and
Sydney to Brisbane and Cairns. Contact them for more information.
 &HT;    The Royal Scotsman (c/o Abercrombie and Kent International Inc.
1520 Kensington Road, Oak Brook, IL 60523; 800-323-7308;
www.abercrombiekent.com or www.royalscotsman.com) takes visitors
through the rugged Scottish countryside on some of the beautiful
rails in Britain. The four-night Edinburgh to Edinburgh itinerary
is $4,150.
 &HT;    Beginning in the Scottish capital, the journey takes riders
through the dramatic West Highlands and rolling Perthshire hills
and then to the North East. Two-night trips start at $2,350. Rates
include all meals, wine and alcoholic and beverages as well as
sightseeing visits.
 &HT;    In Canada, the Rocky Mountaineer Railtours (1150 Station St.,
Vancouver, B.C. Canada V6A 2X7; 800-665-7245;
www.rockymountaineer.com) has a variety of trips through the
Canadian Rockies. These trains travel by daylight only, affording
the best views of the mountains. Overnights are spent in hotels.
 &HT;    One of the briefest excursions is the ``Two Day Redleaf Tour,''
a one-night trip through the Canadian Rockies, traveling from
Vancouver to either Jasper, Alberta, or Calgary, Alberta, with an
overnight hotel stay in Kamloops, Alberta. Prices start at $358 per
person and include the overnight stay and some meals.
 &HT;    Premier Selections (342 Madison Ave., Suite 916, New York, N.Y.
10173; 800-234-4000; www.premierselections.com) is the sales agent
for a number of great train journeys, including the Al Andalus
Express, the Royal Scottsman and the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express.
Rates start at $1,512 and include five nights on the train, one in
a hotel, most meals and sightseeing.
 &HT;    Premier also has a variety of other luxury trains, including the
Blue Train in South Africa. This train runs from Capetown to
Pretoria, with an overnight in Johannesburg. The price of this
five-night train/tour package _ which includes four hotel nights,
one night on the train itself and some meals _ starts at $1,946.
 &HT;    Finally, Copper Canyon's Sierra Madre Express runs from Tuscon,
Ariz., down into Mexico's fabled Copper Canyon region. The
seven-night trip, which includes hotel and train accommodation, as
well as most meals, begins at $2,545.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Like anyone living in a popular tourist destination, I developed
a standard tour itinerary years ago for my out-of-town friends who
wish to see all that Reno, Nev., has to offer.
 &HT;    Because Reno is known for gaming, most of my visitors want to
stop at a casino to try their luck at gambling or to see a show.
But it doesn't take long for the area's natural beauty to weave its
magic. Even in midsummer, the snow-dappled Sierra Nevada set
against the clear blue sky is like a magnet for sightseers.
 &HT;    My personal tour starts in Truckee, home of the Donner Memorial
Museum, (530) 582-7892, that tells the heartbreaking story of the
Donner Party who were trapped in the Sierra Nevada during one of
our area's worst winters.
 &HT;    Then it's up Route 89 to Tahoe City for a stop at Fanny Bridge
overlooking the Truckee River. Fanny Bridge gets its name from the
poses people strike as they lean over the bridge to watch the giant
trout swim below.
 &HT;    A driving tour of Carson City, the capital of Nevada, is next.
Then, depending on the mood of the group, we head west to Genoa _
reputedly Nevada's first settlement and home of the state's oldest
saloon _ or east to Virginia City _ where the rich ore deposits of
this lavish boomtown helped finance Union efforts in the Civil War
and buy Nevada early statehood.
 &HT;    A visit to Reno wouldn't be complete without a walk along the
Truckee River and downtown _ usually with a stop at the National
Auto Museum _ and a meal at a Basque hotel, where ethnic fare is
served family-style at long tables.
 &HT;    But beware: If a Basque meal strikes your fancy, be prepared to
eat. A lot. The food is served in a series of seemingly endless
courses, giving diners ample time to visit with table mates who may
hail from other parts of the city, country or world.
 &HT;    A drive to Pyramid Lake, just northeast of Reno and famous for
being the location where Charleton Heston was filmed parting the
Red Sea in the ``The Ten Commandments,'' usually tops off my
official tour.
 &HT;    Recently, when I took a group of out-of-towners on a sightseeing
trip of the city, I realized how outdated my tour route had become.
All the sites I've mentioned are indeed worth visiting, but now
there's so much more to explore.
 &HT;    For example, a trip to Pyramid Lake and Paiute Indian
Reservation's Fish Hatchery, (775) 476-0500, where one can see how
prehistoric cui-ui fish are being saved, now can include a stop at
the new Tribal Museum and a visit to the Bureau of Land
Management's Wild Horse Adoption Center, (775) 475-2222 or
www.blm.gov/whb. Horses from Nevada's vast open spaces are brought
and kept here until people adopt them.
 &HT;    The Truckee River, with its 100-mile ribbon of rapids that lead
from Lake Tahoe down to Pyramid Lake, always has been a vital part
of my tour. Now, it's even more important.
 &HT;    Downtown Reno is where the Truckee River intersects with
Virginia Street, the town's main drag. It's home to many new
developments, including:
 &HT;    _ A walk with promenades for special events, such as ballet and
symphony performances.
 &HT;    _ Riverside paths, a favorite with bikers and hikers.
Eventually, these will run the length of the city once development
is completed.
 &HT;    _ Many unique Riverfront buildings, including the Riverside
Hotel and Casino, which is being converted into lofts and studios;
Christ Scientist Church, which is becoming the Lear Theater; and
McKinley School, which has been restored as an arts-and-cultural
center.
 &HT;    Some developments have new twists, such as the bluff overlooking
the south side of the Truckee River, where Reno's elite built homes
in what is now called the Newlands area. These days, local
residents involved in historic preservation lead tours of the area,
mostly for Elderhostel students, (877) 426-8056 or
www.elderhostel.org. Special group tours can be arranged by calling
the Historic Reno Preservation Society, (775) 322-1638.
 &HT;    At the other end of Virginia Street is the town's signature
landmark, an overhead street sign that proclaims Reno as ``The
Biggest Little City in the World.'' This is the fourth version of
the sign, which during World War II served as a landmark for
veterans heading home from the Pacific.
 &HT;    Two models of the sign adorn downtown. The newest is known to
turn green on St. Patrick's Day or go dark during Christmas carol
sing-alongs, while the other model is mounted outside the National
Auto Museum on Lake Street.
 &HT;    West of Reno, my tour now includes a stop at Chrissie Caughlin
Park beside the Truckee River. It's a place I have walked my
miniature schnauzers for years, but I now know that pioneers
traveling in covered wagons used a large pine tree, roughly four
feet in diameter, as their ``post office'' and stuck notes for
other immigrants on its trunk.
 &HT;    Further west, it's possible to take a look-see at the
still-visible tracks of the Donner Party wagon train on either side
of Dog Valley Road near a small town called Verdi.
 &HT;    Reno is rich in history, from miners searching for quick riches
and pioneers hurrying to reach California, to railroaders laying
the train tracks that would stitch together the North American
continent. For decades, it stood as an oasis for people traveling
to other places.
 &HT;    Now, Reno is no longer just a pass-through town. In fact, the
place that's so dear to my heart has finally become a fascinating
vacation destination in its own right.

``FIVE SENSES'' PACKED WITH SMALL MOMENTS
<TEXT>
<P>
   By LOUIS B. PARKS
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Watching ``The Five Senses'' feels like reading a good book of
interrelated character stories tied together by a loose plot.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the best Canadian film award at the Toronto Film
Festival last year, ``The Five Senses'' also was shot in that city.
</P>
<P>
   Several people living or working in the same upscale apartment
building progress through modestly eventful days of their lives,
many of them interacting with each other directly or obliquely.
</P>
<P>
   The film gets its title from the senses of touch, smell, taste,
sight and hearing. These play a significant role in the lives of
several characters. It sounds like a gimmick but isn't used that
way.
</P>
<P>
   One of the characters, an optometrist, is losing his hearing.
Because of it, he's losing what he cares about most: opera. Another
character, a masseuse, is out of touch with her daughter. And so
on. The senses merely are the starting point from which director
and writer Jeremy Podeswa started thinking about his film. If he
had named it ``The Ten People,'' we would not even notice that the
senses were represented.
</P>
<P>
   Podeswa has been compared to fellow Canadian (and friend) Atom
Egoyan, partly because they are fellow countrymen. Though ``The
Five Senses'' does have a lyrical quality, it feels more grounded
in daily reality than Egoyan's almost surreal naturalism (``The
Sweet Hereafter'').
</P>
<P>
   They do share, however, an interest in the minutiae of average
people.
</P>
<P>
   Podeswa gathered an excellent cast, and the ensemble acting is
superb. The only name well-known to American audiences is
Mary-Louise Parker (``Fried Green Tomatoes''), who plays Rona, a
baker whose amazingly constructed special-occasion cakes are
inedible.
</P>
<P>
   Rona, whose love life is flaky, has a house guest, a passionate
Italian (who (beginital)can (endital) cook) she met in Italy.
Roberto (Marco Leonardi of ``Cinema Paradiso'' and ``Like Water for
Chocolate'') doesn't speak English, and Rona doesn't speak Italian.
She wonders if he's using her to get a work permit to stay in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Molly Parker (``Sunshine'') plays a mother who takes her small
daughter on a visit to the masseuse, Ruth (Gabrielle Rose of ``The
Sweet Hereafter''). Ruth sends her strange, troubled teen-age
daughter Rachel to the nearby city park with the little girl. While
Rachel is busy spying on some lovers, the child disappears.
</P>
<P>
   The search for the child (we know how she disappeared, but not
what's happened since, so there is some suspense) becomes an
ongoing news story and the closest thing to a dramatic plot this
film has.
</P>
<P>
   Other stories involve Rachel and an equally strange boy she
meets in the park working out identity problems; a bisexual
professional house cleaner (Daniel MacIvor of ``Beefcake'') with a
strong sense of smell who calls upon all his old lovers, hoping to
tell by scent if one really loves him; and the optometrist who is
seeking solace from a prostitute, Gail, who offers him something
much more important than sex.
</P>
<P>
   The film has no big moments but is packed with countless small,
quiet ones, some exquisitely done: a meeting between the mother of
the lost child and the mother of the teen who let her get away; the
house cleaner smelling, in wonder, a bottled fragrance after a
night of unexpected, loveless sex; Gail showing the opera fan how
to (begin ital) feel (end ital) music.
</P>
<P>
   One probably can't have a movie that tries to capture so many
tiny but profound moments of emotion, transition and connection
without sometimes stepping over that infinitely thin line where
insight and balance become the obvious and contrived. For some,
this movie may cross over several times. I was usually willing to
grant Podeswa his sincerity and go with him.
</P>
<P>
   Podeswa and his cast work in perfect harmony to capture a
melancholy mood and perfectly measured pace. Yet the movie is not
sad. While it's not exactly right to say the movie ends in an
upbeat way _ after all, each story has its own end (or non-end) _
Podeswa certainly doesn't intend to send us away bummed out.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TROITSA, Russia _ So much for a quiet weekend in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Radio reports starting at noon on Friday catalog miles-long
traffic backups on every thoroughfare leaving Moscow. Boxy, rusting
Soviet-era Lada cars filled with stressed-out families vie on the
roads with air-conditioned sport utility vehicles driven by
cellphone-wielding stockbrokers and their girlfriends. They're all
trying, if only for two days, to get away from it all.
</P>
<P>
   For millions of Russians that getaway is their dacha, a country
house that until recently, has been synonymous with time-honored
traditions of honest work on the land, work that in Soviet times
was not only idealized, but that equalized all.
</P>
<P>
   However, in today's raucously capitalistic Russia, this
tradition has changed, and weekend pursuits at the dacha highlight
the widening gap between rich and poor. As wealthy Russians add
Jacuzzis and sunrooms to their country homes in an orgy of
keeping-up-with-the-Ivanovs acquisitiveness, the poverty-stricken
rely more and more on their homegrown food just to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The change leaves many lamenting the bygone days.
</P>
<P>
   ``My weekends are forever ruined,'' said 50-year-old Andrei
Kazakov, who has owned a dacha here in the village of Troitsa, 50
miles northwest of Moscow, for the past 10 years. ``Instead of two
days to relax, I spend hours siting in traffic and then putting up
with the noise from the neighbors' hammers as they build a new
home. People are adding this and that, trying to outdo each other.
The neighborhood has definitely changed.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s, when the Soviet Union was gripped by famine,
the government relaxed land laws, allowing an individual to buy
what Russians call ``Shchest Sotki,'' or 6/100s of a hectare, a
small plot roughly equivalent to 1,200 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Rules strictly governed what could be built on allotted land _
until 1991, for example, owners were forbidden to build a two-story
house because the Communist Party viewed it as an excessive sign of
wealth. But buying a dacha was not a bid for a genteel weekend
home; they wanted a plot of land to grow vegetables and a
less-polluted spot to take their kids in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Those Soviet rules seem quaint now, as it's de rigueur to flaunt
one's wealth _ if you have it.
</P>
<P>
   In the countryside, tumbledown wooden huts now lie in the
shadows of massive brick and cement mansions built by New Russians,
the country's newly rich businessmen. On the income scale, the top
10 percent of Russians own 35 percent of the country's wealth,
while the lowest 10 percent control only 2 percent, according to
government statistics released last week.
</P>
<P>
   For Gocha Alibayev, who owns his own interior design company in
Moscow, these wealthy few, who are disparaged by most of society as
cruel and gaudy, are a godsend.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them, its nothing to order $15,000 worth of work, and when
it's done decide they've changed their mind and tell us they'll
give another $10,000 to start again,'' Alibayev said. ``I wouldn't
be in business without them.''
</P>
<P>
   In an otherwise lackluster economy, the New Russians' dacha
excesses have fueled their own spurt of consumerism, from Home
Depot-style warehouse stores, where one can buy plastic lawn chairs
for $100 a piece and weed-whackers to a host of Russian-language
magazines about gardening.
</P>
<P>
   In Pokolnoyoe Gora, Moscow's most elite dacha community where
politicians hobnob with movie stars, a real estate agent can help
find a five-bedroom ``cottage'' with swimming pool for only $5,000
per month, plus commission _ more than 50 times the average annual
salary in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   All this leaves Kazakov, and his long-time neighbor Igor
Kabanov, nostalgic for the Soviet days when a family without a
dacha could go to any village in the vicinity of Moscow and make a
deal with a dacha owner to pay 100 rubles (less than US$4) for a
month's rent.
</P>
<P>
   Kabanov, a 72-year-old retired navy officer and his wife Irina
spend their weekends at the dacha from the start of spring until
the first snow, usually in early October. They travel to suburbs
like Pokolnoyoe Gora and sit by the side of the highway to sell a
bushel of potatoes and flowers they've grown because Kabanov's
pension, the couple's only source of income, isn't even enough to
buy his heart medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can earn about 15 percent more, because those fools have
money to throw away,'' Kabanov said of the New Russian communities.
``But anyway, our (produce) is worth it. We've been gardening all
our lives, and we know all the tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   On summer evenings, Irina will pickle and can their fruits and
vegetables to store through the winter. On weekends, though, even
she takes a break to visit with the dwindling number of old timers
in the village, friends they've known their whole lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world might change around us, and new folks may move next
door, but we always have our memories,'' Kabanov said.

 &HT;    My daughter's first film: 'Is This Thing On?'
 &HT;    By Gary Borders

<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ My youngest daughter has it all figured
out. She just turned 19, has a year of college under her belt, is
still in relatively good graces with the powers-that-be at the
University of Texas, and now knows for sure what she wants to do
for a living.
</P>
<P>
   She wants to be a film director. The Stanley Kubrick of the Pine
Curtain, or maybe the Steven Spielberg of the Sabine. She already
has her first short film planned and is busily polishing the
screenplay. The location has been chosen, a coal mine up north of
here. I pointed out that the owners of the coal mine probably
wouldn't look kindly to her filming a movie amidst their mountains
of black gold, and she blithely informed me she planned to sneak
in. I told her to call her mother for bail money.
</P>

   Originally, Goose planned to major in journalism but now says
it's not creative enough for her, we ink-stained scribes having to
attempt to adhere to the truth and all that. So she has switched to
radio-television-film, RTF for short, in one of the better programs
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   My approach to parental guidance when it comes to a child's
college career is simple. You can take whatever classes you like,
change your major every full moon if you wish, but know one
unassailable verity. I pay for four years, no more. At the end of
four years, the child is down-sized off the payroll and is
perfectly free to attend school until she is 35 as long as it's on
her nickel.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem harsh, but, hey, it's a tough world.
</P>
<P>
   Being the supportive sort, all her parents _ and she has a full
thermonuclear family what with divorces, remarryings and all _
chipped in and bought her a video camera for her birthday. It's
nothing fancy, just a step up from the cheapest you can buy, but
she was thrilled. That's one of Goose's strong points: she's easily
pleased. For the few days she was here, she busily recorded many
special moments, such as me staring dumbly at the camera while she
implored me to do or say something _ anything _ along with her
boyfriend, her step-brother, and step-mom, all of whom reacted by
saying, ``Would you please turn that thing off?''
</P>
<P>
   I don't see a lot of commercial potential in the footage
gathered so far, but who could have predicted the success of the
``Blair Witch Project?''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, that movie is a major point of contention
between Goose and me. I am no ultimate arbiter of good taste, but
that movie sucked eggs. She begs to differ, maintaining this is a
classic of modern cinematography. My wife has extended _ and blurry
_ home-video footage of her carpet when she didn't realize the
camera was on that reminds me of some of the more compelling
moments in ``Blair Witch Project.''
</P>
<P>
   The most common expression you will hear on the audio portion of
a video camera operated by us common folk is, ``Is this thing on?''
which is the non-lethal equivalent of that other cherished East
Texas expression, ``Is this gun loaded?''
</P>
<P>
   But I'm confident my daughter will overcome her genetic
shortcomings and succeed in whatever career she chooses to pursue.
And Lord knows she is the Queen of Movie Trivia. Darned few movies
make it to the big screen or even straight to video without passing
before her eyes. She knows not only the names of the actors and
actresses, directors and producers, but the key grips. And exactly
what is a key grip, anyhow?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe in a few years, she will be the new hot director on the
cinema scene. And I, along with the rest of her parents, can
proudly take credit for having had some small role in her success.
</P>
<P>
   I figure her first film will be entitled, ``Is This Thing On?''
Look for it in theaters near you.

 &HT;    Former Democrat next in line for Texas governorshipBy Dave
McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ That guy on the famous steps here, getting his
picture taken, was Ricky, not Rocky.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least that's what his momma calls him. Rick Perry, the
lieutenant governor of Texas who will become governor if his buddy
George W. Bush beats Al Gore on Nov. 7, was on the Philadelphia
Museum of Art steps featured in Sylvester Stallone's ``Rocky''
movie Wednesday, waiting for Bush to arrive at a rally.
</P>
<P>
   With his black hair slicked back and aide Eric Bearse holding
his coat, Perry joked with folks in the crowd _ and took pictures
with his own camera, like any other tourist. He asked the
plainclothes Pennsylvania state trooper escorting him to take his
picture with state Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, along for the
ride.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Perry had to leave before Bush made his
entrance, to speak at a National Federation of Independent Business
gathering.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush dominates this convention, Perry, who could be
Texas's next governor, has begun to show evidence in Philadelphia
this week that he is moving out of Bush's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   While he continues to cheer on Bush's candidacy, this former
Democrat is becoming better acquainted with the rank and file of
the Texas Republican Party as head of the state delegation.
</P>
<P>
   He has shown them a personable, quick-witted man whose quiet
leadership ability is credited for helping prevent a disastrous
display by Bush's home state, when he convinced many not to walk
out during a policy speech by an openly gay Congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, chosen at the Republican State Convention to lead the
Texas delegation here, has left most of the details of to State
Chairman Susan Weddington and her staff. But the humor he often
uses while presiding over the Texas Senate to lighten and liven
things is in evidence here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The waffles today are offered by Al Gore,'' he joked at the
delegation's breakfast Wednesday. In introducing a spokesman for
Union Pacific, which was paying for Wednesday's breakfast, Perry, a
former Texas Aggie yell leader, led an Aggie-style yell for the
speaker's alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   When talk circulated Monday that some Texas delegates might walk
out during a speech on foreign affairs by a gay congressman, Perry
let it be known he'd be staying right in his chair.
</P>
<P>
   And when Perry was asked about some Texas delegates bowing their
heads in prayer during the congressman's speech, Perry said he
hadn't noticed because he was on the front row. ``I guess anytime's
a good time for prayer,'' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   The former Air Force captain talks about dropping the
``lieutenant'' in front of his title only when asked. Even then,
Perry, 50, says he's more concerned about smoothly handing off the
powerful lieutenant governor's job to the senator chosen by his or
her colleagues to succeed him than running the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Perry points out that he's often been acting governor, when Bush
is out of the state campaigning as he's been for the last 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our staffs are very closely coordinated,'' Perry says.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of which job he's in when the Legislature meets in
January, he'll be focusing on restructuring the state's higher
education system, and high-tech matters, including privacy, Perry
said.
</P>
<P>
   To delegates and other groups, Perry says he'll be proud to
point to the occupant of the White House as a role model if Bush
moves in, and that Bush with former defense secretary Dick Cheney
would restore emphasis for a strong military.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a regular guy _ a regular guy with a vision,'' Perry
says. ``I tell (people) that he's somebody that you could go
fishing with. . . . They obviously haven't sat next to him at a
Texas Rangers baseball game and listened to him banter with the
players, and talk to the fans, and be the regular guy at the
ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all of those stories and interactions that we've had for
a decade,'' Perry said. ``And this guy's fixing to be president of
the United States, on Air Force One. The personal part of this is
pretty overpowering on me.''

 &HT;    When you think Texas and power and politics, think oil
 &HT;    By Mary Alice Davis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the new Texas, as in the old, when you talk about power and
money, you always end up talking about oil.
</P>
<P>
   As high tech, silicon-savvy and info-hip as we believe ourselves
to be, here in the world's 11th-largest economy, the well-being of
the oil biz is never far from our thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   So when the national Republican Party tops its ticket with ``two
Texas oilmen,'' as it plans to do this week, that sounds normal.
From childhood we've seen that while oil and water don't mix, oil
and politics do.
</P>
<P>
   When Texans elected George W. Bush as governor in 1994, what we
mainly knew of him was that his dad was ex-President Bush, a nice
man who called Houston home. The state embraced W. as an amiable
and fabulously successful sports investor with a lovely family.
</P>
<P>
   But it certainly didn't hurt his image that he had found his
adult identity and the seeds of a considerable fortune as that
mythic creature, the Texas oil man. Twice in recent decades, the
state had picked as governor another of that ilk, the gruff Bill
Clements, who once suggested that a good hurricane would tidy up
oil-spill damage his company had done in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was a footloose Yalie who had embraced the rough and tumble
of Midland by creating a drilling startup in 1977. The company
faltered and was absorbed by other oil outfits. Bush wound up as a
director of Harken Energy Corp., then as a phenomenally productive
short-term investor (returns of more than 2,000 percent) in pro
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   As stockholder Bush was leaving Harken, the company pulled off
what is recalled wondrously in the oil world as ``the Bahrain
deal.'' With no overseas experience to speak of, Harken won a
contract to explore for oil and gas in the Persian Gulf. The Wall
Street Journal, in an editorial page analysis, referred to this
Persian Gulf business coup as ``a piece of exceptional luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, the elder Bush's secretary of defense, spent most of his
life in government service before finding a niche directing a
Texas-based oil conglomerate. Since 1995, he has run the global
operations of Halliburton Co., an oil-field services and
construction company with headquarters in Dallas. He recently sold
about half his Halliburton stock for an estimated $5.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the new globalized economy, the oil business and politics are
pretty much the same thing, as they traditionally have been in
Texas. Cheney, as head of Halliburton, lobbied hard against U.S.
sanctions against countries such as Iran, on the grounds that it's
not good for business. The Gulf War was to a major extent, a war
about the oil business and fueling SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Bush is often photographed with black or brown
schoolkids, plugging away on the theme of education. But this week,
it seemed far more natural to see him again at the side of a
wealthy, pink-cheeked oil executive such as Cheney _ much like the
ones who have run Texas for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is struck from the mold of Bush's greatest mentors. Texas
oil millionaires (old think) and billionaires (new think) loom
large in the Bush history. Notable among them is Richard Rainwater,
a Fort Worth oilman and sports investor and former Bush business
partner who has contributed generously to his friend's political
life.
</P>
<P>
   Scrappy wildcatters such as Jett Rink of ``Giant'' may be scarce
in today's Texas, but gushers still come in. The New York Times
recently reported that major oil companies are expecting earnings
for the latest quarter to be double what they were a year ago.
Exploration and production companies were expected to report profit
increases averaging 371 percent. Refinery profits could double or
triple.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, here in the industry's spiritual homeland, oil
chieftains speak darkly of hard times and the urgent need to repeal
the severance tax _ the tax our income-tax-free state levies on
those who extract minerals from the land.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the state's three railroad commissioners (who, oddly,
regulate oil and gas, not railroads) recently said that might be a
good idea. Another Bush point man, Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo,
said the tax should, at the very least, be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Poignant stories of oil-patch hardship were a key feature of the
1999 legislative session. While oil industry tax breaks didn't get
a mention in Bush's opening address to lawmakers, they topped his
legislative priorities. Bush declared as a legislative emergency
the granting of an oil-industry ``hard times'' tax break of up to
$45 million. The bill passed easily, despite Democra

 &HT;    Now it's our turn to take care of them
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one asked Joe Levinson if he could afford to serve in three
wars. These days, however, Levinson is being told that the country
he defended in World War II, Korea and Vietnam can't quite follow
through on its promise to provide him free medical care for the
rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   That was part of the deal Levinson and millions like him made
with the government: 20 years or more of their lives in exchange
for, among other things, free medical care for life, assuming they
survived to collect it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they should have read the small print. That's free medical
care for life at military hospitals and then only after active duty
personnel were treated. Even so, that wasn't a really bad deal
before the end of the cold war brought on a round of base closings.

 &HT;    Lawmakers should look into lax notification about sex offenders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In theory, the United States has an ironclad system of keeping
tabs of sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Howard Thompson. He's not a theory. He's a sex offender who
moved into Waco, Texas while on probation in Georgia, and resumed
his heinous activities.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, it couldn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Only when he was convicted last month of three counts of
aggravated sexual assault of a child and one count of indecency
with a child _ these being children he and his wife baby-sat at a
Waco motel _ did local officials find out they should have been
watching him.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson nine years ago was convicted on three counts of child
molestation in Brunswick, Ga., and given 10 years unsupervised
probation. Effectively, Brunswick washed its hands of him, ordered
him to get out of a five-county judicial circuit and stay away for
10 years. Presto: No longer Brunswick's problem. Change-o: Now
others' problem.
</P>
<P>
   Since policies would have required notification, it is unclear
why Georgia failed to tell Texas about Thompson's relocation. It is
the least that a state could do.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is serving a 20-year prison term in Texas now after he
and his wife Mary Lou were convicted separately. She was sentenced
to three years in prison on a count of indecency with a child.
</P>
<P>
   Had McLennan County officials been notified about Thompson's
previous conviction, his comfort zone would have been diminished
considerably. He might even have steered clear of young people
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Probation officials in Georgia say the problem behind Thompson's
under-the-radar cross-county trip wasn't one of a too-lenient
sentence but the fact that procedures which should have applied _
requiring notification of any new state in which the sex offender
were to reside _ weren't followed.
</P>
<P>
   It seems, however, that at least one jurisdiction thought it
could resolve a terrible problem by sweeping one bad dude out its
door.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, Texas and all states have a compact to notify each
other about convicted sex offenders changing address. In this case
it didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Texas Interstate Compact for the Supervision
of Probationers and Parolees, which handles these matters, say it
happens far too often _ sex offenders taking up residence out of
the state in which they were convicted without their new neighbors
knowing about it.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it happens after a probationer gets a travel permit
and decides not to return home.
</P>
<P>
   This should concern everyone, certainly elected officials at the
state and federal levels. A convicted sex offender on probation
should not have the run of the country. Florida essentially
prohibits someone like Thompson from leaving the state.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's compact administrators are writing new policies to
tighten up procedures and better enforce policies about
notification. This will require the cooperation of participating
legislatures, and possibly Congress' leaning on all the players to
get their acts together.
</P>
<P>
   This also will require measures to get judges' attention about
their responsibilities in keeping track of sex offenders like
Thompson, or to blunt the dumping of offenders onto other states.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, he evaded the best-laid plans. In reality, the system
was full of holes, resulting in the worst-case scenario: Convicted
sex offender Howard Thompson was back in business once he crossed
the Texas state line.

</P>
<P>
   It is the senselessness of these accidents that make them
inexcusable. They happened because someone consciously made a
decision to circumvent the rules and as a result, inflicted bodily
harm on others.
</P>
<P>
   Understandable? Sadly true. You only have to take one trip
around metro Atlanta to see enough outrageous behavior on our
roadways to last you a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   I can remember commenting on my first trip to New York City that
the city wasted all the money it spent on the paint for lane
markers because no one pays any attention to them. That comment has
come home to haunt me.
</P>
<P>
   Many, if not most, Atlanta drivers are now guilty of the same
thing. How many times have you been stopped at an intersection,
only to have the vehicle behind you pull around you on the shoulder
of the road? Heaven forbid they might have to wait a few seconds to
continue their progress.
</P>
<P>
   Will making left-hand turns from the far right lane, like New
York taxi drivers, become accepted practice? Circumventing
intersections through shopping center parking lots seems to have
become standard procedure.
</P>
<P>
   It is appalling that drivers are out of control. Road rage,
people passing in the emergency lane _ where will it all end? Or,
more importantly, how do we try to resolve this situation?
</P>
<P>
   The simple answer would be the police.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, I don't see that as the complete solution. First, there
just aren't enough law enforcement officers available to react to
the volume of offending drivers. When I see incidents like the guy
driving alone in the HOV lane recently and passing a police officer
who couldn't have cared less, I realize that law enforcement has
now become a prioritized situation.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line, they are going to put out big fires before little
fires. Or they are going to engage in traffic enforcement that
produces the most revenue first. These outrageous and senseless
acts that can potentially lead to the loss of innocent people's
lives need to carry a more substantial penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Would you think more seriously about driving in the HOV lane
alone if the fine were $1,000? What about passing in the emergency
lane? Is $1,000 enough, or should it be more?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we are now back to how we enforce these laws. Perhaps
we need to look at a new level of police, traffic police. These
officers would not work burglary or homicide; their only domain
would be watching our roadways.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that if we enacted fines that really got the
public's attention, it wouldn't take long before not only could we
potentially curtail much of this out-of-control behavior but also
produce a tidy little revenue source?

   ATLANTA _ Tragic and senseless. Understandable, but inexcusable.
</P>
<P>
   I am referring to two recent events: the tragic death of a
rookie Atlanta policeman who was mowed down by a driver while in
the act of doing his job and the teenage driver and Transportation
Department personnel who were hit by a driver using the emergency
lane as a passing lane.
</P>
<P>
   Tragic goes without explanation. Senseless is also simple. None
of these deaths needed to happen. Had the drivers of the other
vehicles been acting in a responsible and legal manner, they would
not.

   It is the senselessness of these accidents that make them
inexcusable. They happened because someone consciously made a

 &HT;    `Lungs' of vehicles work hard to save yours
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Last week, a student asked me what I thought was the
single most important pollution control device on any passenger
vehicle. Without hesitation, I mentioned the catalytic converter.
</P>
<P>
   I elaborated on my statement with a little history about the
whys and wherefores that have brought the internal combustion
engine to its current ``almost emission-friendly'' condition.
</P>
<P>
   Since my indoctrination into the automotive repair profession, I
have seen many pollution control devices come and go, giving way to
more sophisticated systems. The catalytic converter, with only one
improvement to its initial concept, has remained a steadfast
component of the exhaust system for over a quarter of a century.
</P>
<P>
   Long before complex computer controls, fuel injection and
electronic ignition systems, the cat was working its little heart
out to clean up exhaust byproducts produced by the engine. And for
all of its hard work, what kind of appreciation does it get? It's
frequently blamed for poor performance, putrid smells, melted
carpets, grass fires and just about anything else from transmission
slippage to poor mileage.
</P>
<P>
   The catalytic converter is really a marvelous creature. It has
the ability and the capacity (about three football fields worth of
active surface area) to breathe in exhaust gases from the engine,
chemically change or ``catalyze'' the nitrous oxides (or NOx),
hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, and breathe out carbon dioxide
and water.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there are two kinds of cats, but both work on the
principle of absorbing, storing and releasing gases. The single-bed
converter, which dates to the beginning, controls hydrocarbons and
carbon monoxide, rendering a much lower amount of those gases along
with harmful NOx and harmless carbon dioxide and water. The
development of the three-way converter enabled the reduction of NOx
by incorporating a separate front chamber of different material.
</P>
<P>
   Usually both the reduction and the oxidation chambers are housed
inside one shell. However, some vehicle manufacturers use a small,
separate NOx reduction cat mounted before the oxidation cat. Either
way, they work the same. The exhaust gas first undergoes a cooling
NOx reduction before the hot oxidation. Oxygen is absorbed and
stored in the catalyst's membrane, then released as needed to
complete the chemical process.
</P>
<P>
   When not subjected to prolonged engine abnormalities such as
misfires, excessive or insufficient fuel quantities, coolant or oil
contamination, the cat can function efficiently for years. But if
it is abused, often giving a warning by way of an illuminated light
on the dash, it will suffocate and die.
</P>
<P>
   At best, the vehicle will continue to run OK, but the cat will
be unable to convert and clean up the exhaust gasses. At worst, the
inside of the cat will break apart, melt or plug up, causing an
exhaust restriction. In fact, 1996-and-newer vehicles have an
onboard diagnostic system that monitors catalytic converter
efficiency. If the computer ``sees'' that the cat is being damaged,
it will turn on the malfunction indicator light on the dash.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not a medical person, but it seems to me that a catalytic
converter works a lot like our lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Breathe in. What is happening? Oxygen is going into your lungs.
It is being stored to be used by your body. Breathe out. You are
exhaling carbon dioxide and water. What happens when this process
is contaminated by the inhalation of abnormal air, not containing
enough oxygen? Inhaling chemical fumes, smoke and pollution can
cause lung damage.
</P>
<P>
   The length of time and amount of toxins consumed equate to the
severity of the injury to your respiratory system. Are your lungs
the cause or the victim of mistreatment? Don't blame your cat. It's
only trying to clean up what is delivered to it.

 &HT;    GOP's white-cell count barely masked by convention charade
 &HT;    By JOHN YOUNG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's times like these when those blessed with cable options give
thanks for A&AMP;E, the Discovery Channel and Animal Planet.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, for instance. She surfed upon a scene of African
children in grass skirts scampering across a stage. Jabbing the
remote, she bolted before realizing it was actually about Africans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' she said, ``I thought it was the Republican National
Convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy mistake, thanks to a unique seating arrangement at the
Philadelphia convention: everyone with white skin in a delegate's
chair, everyone non-white on stage in a speaking role, except for
those in janitorial roles.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will about the Democrats and a president stalked by
the definition of ``is.'' At least when the Dems get together they
convey diversity without hiring the Broadway cast of ``Porgy and
Bess.''
</P>
<P>
   There are lies and there are damned lies. This portrait of
diversity is the damnedest lie. Covering the 1992 GOP convention in
Houston, I wrenched my neck on the case of the missing black
Republicans. The party-controlled big screens at the Astrodome kept
on showing blacks waving banners and wearing silly hats. But none
could be found by my eye. Finally I spotted two. I realized that
the camera wasn't showing a lot of black Republicans, just the same
ones over and over.
</P>
<P>
   They were like the Japanese pilot whose actual cockpit footage
got him shown over and over in World War II movies, always
spiraling into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Black-white photos
</P>
<P>
   Has anybody seen J.C. Watts lately? Dumb question.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to photo opportunities, the black Oklahoma
congressman is the Republicans' most valuable player. At Oklahoma
U. he played QB. Now, aside from congressman, he plays DB whenever
possible, DB for designated black.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, watch how often George Bush will have a
black individual positioned behind him on a stage when cameras
click. In Texas, the black most likely to appear will be Michael
Williams, a Bush pal from Midland who got an administration job in
Washington and then got appointed to the Texas Railroad Commission.
Williams shows that George W. is not the only one who owes a
political career to knowing just the right people.
</P>
<P>
   More than transparent
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Bush gets credit for trying to put on a show of diversity
that reflects the nation he seeks to govern. The alarming fact
remains, however, that this major political party, at its base,
reflects bare tokens of a nation's cultural richness.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made modest inroads of support among Hispanics in
Texas, but nationwide he has to buck a party history that has mined
anti-immigrant passions and used ``English-only'' as a wedge issue.
</P>
<P>
   Education? The party line still seeks to demonize inner-city
public schools. With school vouchers, it reflects a white-flight
mentality which says to minorities, ``Come, flee with me.''
</P>
<P>
   All is added, in minorities' eyes, to a history of opposing
civil rights legislation and now making affirmative action a
villain, rather than acknowledging the disparities that remain in
every strata of business and governance. These disparities are self
evident at such a national convention.
</P>
<P>
   That is why a lingering image from a past GOP convention, for
me, comes from aboard a bus of all-white conventioneers returning
to their hotel. Up beside them momentarily pulled a city bus filled
with all the kinds of people who had cooked the meals, vacuumed the
rooms and made the beds.
</P>
<P>
   Then the buses split up, one bound for the expressway, one for
dark street corners down the line. The regulars and the hired help
had done their part for one more national made-for-TV event.

   EDITORIAL-CHILD-MOLESTATION _ Howard Thompson nine years ago was
convicted on three counts of child molestation in Brunswick, Ga.,
and given 10 years unsupervised probation. Effectively, Brunswick
washed its hands of him, ordered him to get out of a five-county

what she wants to do for a living. She wants to be a film director.

   DAVIS-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Cheney is struck from the mold of
Bush's greatest mentors. Texas oil millionaires (old think) and
billionaires (new think) loom large in the Bush history. Notable
among them is Richard Rainwater, a Fort Worth oilman and sports
investor and former Bush business partner who has contributed

   GARCIA-COLUMN _ His warrior days are long gone, but Joe
Levinson, 76, and others like him _ an estimated estimates are that

grows. (Garcia, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Forget what they say on the

than in the American. (Lane, Daytona News-Journal) MOVED

Or at least that's what his momma calls him. Rick Perry, the
lieutenant governor of Texas who will become governor if his buddy
George W. Bush beats Al Gore on Nov. 7, was on the Philadelphia

   EDITORIAL-CHILD-MOLESTATION _ Howard Thompson nine years ago was
convicted on three counts of child molestation in Brunswick, Ga.,
and given 10 years unsupervised probation. Effectively, Brunswick
washed its hands of him, ordered him to get out of a five-county
judicial circuit and stay away for 10 years. Presto: No longer
Brunswick's problem. Change-o: Now others' problem. (Waco

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ My youngest daughter has
it all figured out. She just turned 19, has a year of college under
her belt, is still in relatively good graces with the
powers-that-be at the University of Texas, and now knows for sure
what she wants to do for a living. She wants to be a film director.
(Gary Borders is editor and publisher of the Nacogdoches Daily
Sentinel.) EMBARGOED for Sunday. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   DAVIS-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Cheney is struck from the mold of
Bush's greatest mentors. Texas oil millionaires (old think) and
billionaires (new think) loom large in the Bush history. Notable
among them is Richard Rainwater, a Fort Worth oilman and sports
investor and former Bush business partner who has contributed
generously to his friend's political life. (Davis, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   GARCIA-COLUMN _ His warrior days are long gone, but Joe
Levinson, 76, and others like him _ an estimated estimates are that
there 1.4 million military retirees are in the country today _ have
seen their access to health care shrink even as their need for it
grows. (Garcia, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Forget what they say on the
Sunday morning news shows. The key to understanding this year's
elections is The Boredom Factor. This is a strange year. For the
first time there was more suspense in the Mexican presidential race
than in the American. (Lane, Daytona News-Journal) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   MCNEELY-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ PHILADELPHIA _ That guy on the
famous steps here, getting his picture taken, was Ricky, not Rocky.
Or at least that's what his momma calls him. Rick Perry, the
lieutenant governor of Texas who will become governor if his buddy
George W. Bush beats Al Gore on Nov. 7, was on the Philadelphia
Museum of Art steps featured in Sylvester Stallone's ``Rocky''
movie Wednesday, waiting for Bush to arrive at a rally. (McNeely,
Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas - It's times like these when those
blessed with cable options give thanks for A&AMP;E, the Discovery
Channel and Animal Planet. My wife, for instance. She surfed upon a
scene of African children in grass skirts scampering across a
stage. Jabbing the remote, she bolted before realizing it was
actually about Africans. ``Sorry,'' she said, ``I thought it was
the Republican National Convention.'' (John Young is opinion page
editor of the Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TROITSA, Russia _ So much for a quiet weekend in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Radio reports starting at noon on Friday catalog miles-long
traffic backups on every thoroughfare leaving Moscow. Boxy, rusting
Soviet-era Lada cars filled with stressed-out families vie on the
roads with air-conditioned sport utility vehicles driven by
cellphone-wielding stockbrokers and their girlfriends. They're all
trying, if only for two days, to get away from it all.
</P>
<P>
   For millions of Russians that getaway is their dacha, a country
house that until recently, has been synonymous with time-honored
traditions of honest work on the land, work that in Soviet times
was not only idealized, but that equalized all.
</P>
<P>
   However, in today's raucously capitalistic Russia, this
tradition has changed, and weekend pursuits at the dacha highlight
the widening gap between rich and poor. As wealthy Russians add
Jacuzzis and sunrooms to their country homes in an orgy of
keeping-up-with-the-Ivanovs acquisitiveness, the poverty-stricken
rely more and more on their homegrown food just to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The change leaves many lamenting the bygone days.
</P>
<P>
   ``My weekends are forever ruined,'' said 50-year-old Andrei
Kazakov, who has owned a dacha here in the village of Troitsa, 50
miles northwest of Moscow, for the past 10 years. ``Instead of two
days to relax, I spend hours siting in traffic and then putting up
with the noise from the neighbors' hammers as they build a new
home. People are adding this and that, trying to outdo each other.
The neighborhood has definitely changed.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s, when the Soviet Union was gripped by famine,
the government relaxed land laws, allowing an individual to buy
what Russians call ``Shchest Sotki,'' or 6/100s of a hectare, a
small plot roughly equivalent to 1,200 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Rules strictly governed what could be built on allotted land _
until 1991, for example, owners were forbidden to build a two-story
house because the Communist Party viewed it as an excessive sign of
wealth. But buying a dacha was not a bid for a genteel weekend
home; they wanted a plot of land to grow vegetables and a
less-polluted spot to take their kids in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Those Soviet rules seem quaint now, as it's de rigueur to flaunt
one's wealth _ if you have it.
</P>
<P>
   In the countryside, tumbledown wooden huts now lie in the
shadows of massive brick and cement mansions built by New Russians,
the country's newly rich businessmen. On the income scale, the top
10 percent of Russians own 35 percent of the country's wealth,
while the lowest 10 percent control only 2 percent, according to
government statistics released last week.
</P>
<P>
   For Gocha Alibayev, who owns his own interior design company in
Moscow, these wealthy few, who are disparaged by most of society as
cruel and gaudy, are a godsend.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them, its nothing to order $15,000 worth of work, and when
it's done decide they've changed their mind and tell us they'll
give another $10,000 to start again,'' Alibayev said. ``I wouldn't
be in business without them.''
</P>
<P>
   In an otherwise lackluster economy, the New Russians' dacha
excesses have fueled their own spurt of consumerism, from Home
Depot-style warehouse stores, where one can buy plastic lawn chairs
for $100 a piece and weed-whackers to a host of Russian-language
magazines about gardening.
</P>
<P>
   In Pokolnoyoe Gora, Moscow's most elite dacha community where
politicians hobnob with movie stars, a real estate agent can help
find a five-bedroom ``cottage'' with swimming pool for only $5,000
per month, plus commission _ more than 50 times the average annual
salary in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   All this leaves Kazakov, and his long-time neighbor Igor
Kabanov, nostalgic for the Soviet days when a family without a
dacha could go to any village in the vicinity of Moscow and make a
deal with a dacha owner to pay 100 rubles (less than US$4) for a
month's rent.
</P>
<P>
   Kabanov, a 72-year-old retired navy officer and his wife Irina
spend their weekends at the dacha from the start of spring until
the first snow, usually in early October. They travel to suburbs
like Pokolnoyoe Gora and sit by the side of the highway to sell a
bushel of potatoes and flowers they've grown because Kabanov's
pension, the couple's only source of income, isn't even enough to
buy his heart medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can earn about 15 percent more, because those fools have
money to throw away,'' Kabanov said of the New Russian communities.
``But anyway, our (produce) is worth it. We've been gardening all
our lives, and we know all the tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   On summer evenings, Irina will pickle and can their fruits and
vegetables to store through the winter. On weekends, though, even
she takes a break to visit with the dwindling number of old timers
in the village, friends they've known their whole lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world might change around us, and new folks may move next
door, but we always have our memories,'' Kabanov said.

&HT;     LASORDA LOOKS FORWARD TO LEADING U.S. OLYMPIC BASEBALL SQUAD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVID KING  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The jerseys will say ```USA'' on them, but make no
mistake _ this year's U.S. Olympic baseball squad will be Tommy
Lasorda's team.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball USA, the governing body for the sport, knew what it was
getting
</P>
<P>
   when it chose the Hall of Famer as its manager. His colorful
personality
</P>
<P>
   will overwhelm those of his players, who will be chosen from
retired
</P>
<P>
   major-leaguers and current minor-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest thing I will ever do,'' Lasorda said soon
after
</P>
<P>
   getting his new assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bigger than the Dodgers. It's bigger than the World
Series. It's
</P>
<P>
   bigger than any playoff game, and I've managed in 63 playoff
games. This
</P>
<P>
   is a chance to do something for my country.''
</P>
<P>
   Big talk from a man who bleeds Dodger blue, even after a heart
ailment
</P>
<P>
   forced him to retire as the team's manager in 1996. Lasorda, a
senior vice
</P>
<P>
   president of the club, has been affiliated with the Dodgers as a
player,
</P>
<P>
   coach, manager or executive for 51 years.
</P>
<P>
   With Lasorda in the dugout, Los Angeles won two world
championships,
</P>
<P>
   four National League pennants and eight division titles. His
teams won
</P>
<P>
   1,599 games. And, as with everything else he does, Lasorda will
approach
</P>
<P>
   the Olympics with passion and more than a fair amount of
bluster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we're not planning on going 6,000 miles to lose,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His job won't be easy. This is the first Olympics that will
allow
</P>
<P>
   professional baseball players to compete, but no major-league
players will
</P>
<P>
   be leaving their teams in the final weeks of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Former baseball executives Bob Watson and Bill Bavasi, along
with
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda, will choose a team from a pool of 533 minor-leaguers
and retired big-leaguers. And in just about a month's time, Lasorda
will have
</P>
<P>
   to turn the group into a team. An announcement on the squad will
be made
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans will convene in San Diego on Sept. 1 and leave for
a
</P>
<P>
   series of exhibitions and workouts in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda's team will be taking on the best from around the world.
The
</P>
<P>
   Japan League is suspending its season to allow its best players
to take
</P>
<P>
   part in the Olympics, and Cuba is building another strong team
after
</P>
<P>
   struggling in recent international competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have played a part in developing another challenger,
</P>
<P>
   Australia. Los Angeles has been in the forefront of signing and
developing
</P>
<P>
   players from the host country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba is going to be tough; Japan is going to be tough,''
Lasorda said.
</P>
<P>
   Players must pass stringent Olympics chemical testing. Along
with
</P>
<P>
   performance-enhancing drugs, the International Olympic Committee
also bans
</P>
<P>
   a number of substances contained in over-the-counter sinus
remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda said he did not have any reservations about taking on
</P>
<P>
   the job, no matter the circumstances. Since leaving the Dodgers'
dugout, he has spent the last four years traveling _ he makes more
than 100 speeches a year,
</P>
<P>
   scouts and evaluates Dodgers minor-leaguers and circles the
world
</P>
<P>
   spreading the gospel of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new challenge for me,'' he said of the Olympic job.
``I was
</P>
<P>
   enjoying what I was doing, but I'm looking forward to this, too
I've still got that fire in my belly, too. You give me players with
any kind of ability, and I'll do my best with 'em.''

RANDOM HOUSE TO ESTABLISH EXCLUSIVELY DIGITAL WING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stepping up the race to stake out territory in the new world of
digital books, Random House, the largest U.S. trade publisher,
plans Sunday to announce the creation of a new purely digital
imprint.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in January, the house will publish under the name
AtRandom a list of about 20 purely digital books, by authors
ranging from the editor of Harper's magazine to a downtown
dominatrix. All will be sold online as electronic books or in
single copies printed on demand, but they will not be shipped to
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Random House becomes the second major house to begin a digital
imprint, following Time Warner Trade Publishing, which this spring
created a digital imprint of its own, iPublish.com.
</P>
<P>
   All the biggest New York publishing houses are now moving
quickly to prepare for the possibility that digital books will soon
take off. Over lunches at Michael's, the Four Seasons and other
industry hubs, editors are quietly courting agents and authors,
trying to sign deals for the digital rights to their new and
previously published books.
</P>
<P>
   As they acquire new titles, they are beginning to establish the
rules of digital publishing, from authors' royalties to the prices
consumers will pay. In many cases, especially for brand name
authors and older contracts, authors' agents have retained digital
rights. For publishers, that means there is a vast pool of
potentially profitable literary properties waiting to be claimed,
sometimes from another house's list. Time Warner, for example, will
publish the electronic versions of several books by the science
writer, James Gleick, previously published in hardcover by Random
House's Pantheon imprint.
</P>
<P>
   Both Random House and Time Warner are hoping to build their
reputations as desirable places for authors to publish digitally,
much the way places like Random House's sister imprint Vintage are
prestigious names to appear under in paperback.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the book business wonder why the rush. Even Ann Godoff,
president and publisher of Random House Trade Group and creator of
the digital imprint, admitted that she had not yet managed to enjoy
reading a book off a screen, or read a whole electronic book.
Neither has almost anyone else in the industry. Many others,
meanwhile, worry that online copyright protection is open to
question.
</P>
<P>
   Print-on-demand books, though roughly comparable in appearance
to trade paperbacks, remain expensive to produce. Lightning Source,
a company that provides the service to publishers, charges a
publisher $4.80 to produce a single copy of a 300-page book, which
is more expensive than traditional printing except in handling
titles that sell fewer than 1,000 copies a year.
</P>
<P>
   But many publishers have high expectations for the profits from
the new digital books. Laurence Kirshbaum, chairman of Time Warner
Trade Publishing, says selling electronic books will boost the
industry's annual growth rate from single to double digits.
Microsoft Corp. will release a new version of its electronic book
reader next week, the first version for reading on desktop and
laptop computers as well as on expensive hand-held devices.
Publishers say the company has estimated that 2 million people will
download free copies in the first two weeks. Dick Brass,
Microsoft's vice president of technology development, believes that
the market for electronic books will exceed $1 billion in five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the brave new world we want to see,'' said Godoff at
Random House. ``No printing, no paper and binding, no need for a
sales conference or printed catalog _ we don't know the size of the
market, but it could be potentially very profitable for us.'' She
has particularly high hopes for print-on-demand technology, because
it enables publishers to profitably publish low-selling new and old
titles with narrow readerships, and it obviates the risk of holding
inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Karp, vice president and senior editor at the Random
House Trade Group, will head the new imprint. He said he began this
spring approaching authors and agents about signing all-electronic
contracts for new books, swearing each one to secrecy and revealing
none of the other writers' names. Many have verbal agreements but
no formal contracts yet.
</P>
<P>
   Karp said he acquired the rights to projects he thought suited
the medium. ``The Quest to End Baldness'' by the New York Post
columnist, Gersh Kuntzman, and ``Mistress Ruby Ties It Together''
by Robin Shamburg, a dominatrix who also writes a column for
NYPress, may work better in electronic form because they can be
bought and read in private without the embarrassment of taking them
to a cashier. Others will be collections of previously published
magazine articles by Harper's editor, Lewis Lapham, and the writers
Tad Friend and Donald Katz. Such collections do not sell many
copies in paper, but the low volumes make sense in electronic form,
and new material might be added to the collections over time. Some
will be as short as the equivalent of about 150 pages; others, such
as the collections, as long as 300-page books.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of Random House's new electronic titles is a
full-length novel, ``Because She is Beautiful,'' by Cameron Dougan,
a first-time author. ``I couldn't be more flattered,'' he said.
``It doesn't matter if it is hardcover or paperback or downloaded
if it's getting attention and people are recommending it to their
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Other titles include ``The Secret of Life,'' a book of advice
from Elizabeth Wurtzel, author of ``Prozac Nation,'' and ``Walking
On Ice,'' a biography of the hockey player Mark Messier by Meredith
Berkman, a magazine writer.
</P>
<P>
   Random House will sell its digital books through online
booksellers and other organizations' Web sites. The house plans to
sell the books for about the price of a typical trade paperback,
for a little less in electronic form and a little more in
print-on-demand. It will pay authors royalties on electronic books
of about 15 percent of the price _ about the same as a hardcover
royalty rate. On print-on-demand titles, authors will receive 7.5
percent of the price, about the same as on a trade paperback.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Random House also plans to publish digitally a
hundred titles from its Modern Library imprint of classic titles.
Some sets of several books, like the volumes of Marcel Proust's
``In Search of Lost Time'' or the complete works of Jane Austen,
will be sold together as single bundles.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Random House, Time Warner, which includes Little, Brown
and Warner Books, will sell its electronic books from its own Web
site as well as through online bookstores. Most of its new print
books will also appear in electronic editions, as well as a handful
of new digital books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our digital business will allow us to expand beyond the
best-seller focus of the major chains,'' said Gregory Voynow,
general manager of iPublish.com, explaining that in chains titles
that sell in high-volumes are likely to get the most attention.
``This will allow us to have more control over our own destiny,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, both publishers said, will allow the marketing of
books directly to likely readers on Web sites that reflect their
interests, and letting them download an electronic book with a
click.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner also plans initially to discount its electronic
books aggressively, charging about $7 or less for electronic
versions of some books. Time Warner will also offer its authors a
potentially higher royalty rate, about 25 percent of the
publisher's net revenue, including income from any licensing or
other deals.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers and agents involved agree that the ultimate digital
royalty rates and book prices remain to be seen, along with the
extent of demand for electronic books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, sure, a 15 percent royalty rate, but it can't be
precedent-setting,'' said Amanda Urban, agent for Tad Friend. ``The
publicity attendant on this will compensate for the low advance,
and collections of reprinted journalism are hard to get published
today anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   But other agents are already putting up a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``These publishers are trying to divide up the new digital world
before we have even mapped it out,'' said Robert Gottlieb, an agent
at the William Morris Agency. ``It is like Antarctica. They have
landed and they are saying it's theirs. There is a tremendous
reduction in overhead from printing, distribution and all of that,
and authors aren't enjoying the benefits of the increased
profitability.''

&HT;     CONVENTIONAL WISDOM ISN'T 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend noted that the chairs and the walls at the Republican
National
</P>
<P>
   Convention are red and blue. He said, ``I guess the delegates
provide the white.''
</P>
<P>
   I had to take his word for it, although having been to
Republican
</P>
<P>
   conventions before, I'm pretty sure he was right about the white
part.
</P>
<P>
   All I've seen of this year's convention is five minutes of Tom
Brokaw
</P>
<P>
   opening the NBC evening news by saying, essentially, that the
convention
</P>
<P>
   is a tightly stage-managed non-news event where absolutely
nothing would
</P>
<P>
   happen. NBC had no prime-time coverage of this non-news.
</P>
<P>
   Then why were Brokaw and 15,000 other journalists in
Philadelphia? Why
</P>
<P>
   was the convention the lead story? Why should anyone pay any
attention at
</P>
<P>
   all?
</P>
<P>
   Like most Americans, I haven't watched any of what little
coverage
</P>
<P>
   there has been of the convention during ABC's and CBS' grudging
7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   convention hours. There are real things to watch, like
``Frasier''reruns
</P>
<P>
   and ``Entertainment Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Many conventions ago, political managers decided to take all the
</P>
<P>
   messiness out of conventions so they'd look good on TV. Thus
conventions
</P>
<P>
   became as interesting as one of those videos of a fireplace,
without the
</P>
<P>
   fire.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, I did watch something real about the fake convention, a
few
</P>
<P>
   minutes of ``Politically Incorrect,''a show which tries to find
pointed
</P>
<P>
   humor in pointless and unfunny modern conventions. Host Bill
Maher
</P>
<P>
   expressed amazement at all the African Americans the Republicans
managed
</P>
<P>
   to find to put on stage Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The headline in The San Francisco Examiner was funnier than
Maher, saying, ``GOP puts on new face.'' Two words: Al Jolson.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was inclusion night, in which the Republicans (whose
delegates
</P>
<P>
   are 83 percent white and 20 percent millionaires) brought on
Colin Powell
</P>
<P>
   and the Temptations to convince the nation that the GOP is the
party of
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln and not the party of the Lincoln Town Car.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's theme was military readiness, but I wasn't ready to
listen
</P>
<P>
   to speeches about the need to spend billions on anti-missile
systems to
</P>
<P>
   stop an ICBM fired by some Dr. No from his rogue island.
</P>
<P>
   The History Channel had a special on the U.S. Mint, which would
have to
</P>
<P>
   work overtime to keep up with Republican military proposals. So
I watched
</P>
<P>
   that instead.
</P>
<P>
   Where's that fireplace video?
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope the Republicans' military experts are better at
targeting
</P>
<P>
   missiles than audiences. I'm a member of the target audience for
the
</P>
<P>
   Republican convention and they've completely missed me.
</P>
<P>
   I'm unhappy with the Clinton-Gore administration and would like
to see
</P>
<P>
   a more compassionate Republicanism. I'm highly likely to vote
and I'm a
</P>
<P>
   political junkie. So how come I'm not watching their show?
</P>
<P>
   Because you can watch the same ``Frasier'' episode over and over
again.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to be handcuffed to a chair to get through more
than five
</P>
<P>
   minutes of convention coverage. There hasn't been a good
convention since
</P>
<P>
   1972, when they were brawls.
</P>
<P>
   The best in my memory was in 1968, when there were riots outside
and
</P>
<P>
   inside the convention hall. The whole world was watching because
it had a
</P>
<P>
   reason to watch.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, protesters and police in Philadelphia finally got it
</P>
<P>
   together to create some telegenic action. Protesters blocked
streets and
</P>
<P>
   police raided a puppet factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come out, with all of your tiny little hands up.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, that I'd watch, but I found my fireplace video.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a political junkie, but political conventions as presented
on and for
</P>
<P>
   TV are very low-quality junk. Even junkies have standards.
</P>
<P>
   How do I get my information? I read newspapers, a medium often
called
</P>
<P>
   obsolete, but still not rivaled in its ability to be skimmed.
When I see a
</P>
<P>
   picture of some delegates in hats trying to boogie on the
convention
</P>
<P>
   floor, I can quickly flip to the comics before the onset of
nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators criticized the major networks for their
incomplete
</P>
<P>
   coverage of the convention. Tom Shales, the TV critic for the
Washington
</P>
<P>
   Post, said networks ``displayed bad citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean they'd be good citizens if they showed every bit
of
</P>
<P>
   bunting, every filmed tribute and every contrived speech on
strength,
</P>
<P>
   compassion and doing it for the children?
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, the modern convention is a sham meant to deceive the
public. If
</P>
<P>
   networks were good citizens, they wouldn't show conventions at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the public isn't watching.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans aren't the only ones who produce infomercials
and call
</P>
<P>
   them conventions. They're just better at it than the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   You can't tell me that Barbara is going to boost the ratings of
Al and
</P>
<P>
   Tipper. The only thing that might work is that the West Coast
has better
</P>
<P>
   rioters than the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason I'll watch the Democratic convention is because
I'll be
</P>
<P>
   there, and it'll be unavoidable. Fortunately, 14,999 other
journalists
</P>
<P>
   will be there, too.
</P>
<P>
   That's the real convention, getting together to eat, drink and
complain
</P>
<P>
   about how bad conventions have become.

IBM CHIEF RECALLS DIFFICULT DAYS  
 ALLTEL EXPANDS TO LOUISIANA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In hindsight, success tends to look easy, even predictable.
That's as true in business as it is in sports, politics or other
fields.
</P>
<P>
   Yet things often look decidedly more unnerving from the vantage
point of the executive on the firing line. The company might just
as easily perish as prosper.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy interview last week, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the
chairman of IBM, talked mostly about a management reorganization
that the company announced on Monday. But Gerstner, who is often
portrayed as blunt, gruff and seemingly arrogant, also candidly
described his early, uncertain days at IBM _ when he arrived as an
outsider suddenly in charge of a corporation that was both an
American icon and a business in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   After he took over in 1993, Gerstner ran the company for over a
year in a style he called ``survival mode.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to cut $9 billion a year in expenses. We had to bring
the company back, literally, from the brink of death. We had to
deal with cultural and personal tragedies that resulted. And we had
to reassert that we were for real in the marketplace. That was a
very centralized, personalized leadership and organizational style.
It was focused on the short term, and it was very intuitive. There
wasn't a lot of time to study things. There was not a lot of time
to debate things.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it was a benevolent dictatorship with me as the dictator
and hoping _ just hoping _ that I was getting some good advice from
my colleagues who knew a heck of a lot more about IBM and this
industry than I would ever know.''

   Alltel Expands to Louisiana
</P>
<P>
   Alltel Corp., the United States' fifth-largest wireless
communications carrier, is expected to announce Monday the
acquisition of wireless operations in Louisiana from SBC
Communications for about $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Alltel, which is based in Little Rock,
Ark., expects to gain about 165,000 wireless customers and 300,000
paging customers in New Orleans and Baton Rouge. The transaction
also includes rural services in Iberville, St. James and
Plaquemines parishes.
</P>
<P>
   SBC is selling the properties to eliminate overlap resulting
from the linking of its wireless operations with BellSouth's.
Alltel, which already has about 6 million wireless subscribers in
22 states, is trying to expand its presence along the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike some other companies in this industry we're interested
in buying and not being bought,'' Joe Ford, Alltel's chief
executive, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the wireless industry in the United States has been
gripped by acquisition fever, most recently with Deutsche Telekom's
planned acquisition of VoiceStream Wireless Corp. for over $50
billion, which was announced last week. But Alltel, larger than
VoiceStream though still a relatively small wireless player, has
been strangely absent from the speculative talk on which wireless
companies will be the next takeover targets.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, companies like Nextel Communications, of Reston, Va., a
provider of wireless services for corporate customers, and
Powertel, a consumer-oriented wireless company based in Statesboro,
Ga., have been mentioned as likelier consolidation candidates.
</P>
<P>
   That may reflect the low profile of Alltel, which has made more
than 250 landline and wireless acquisitions since it began as a
local telephone company in Arkansas in 1947. The company has
typically focused on rural areas and relatively small metropolitan
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world is looking at wireless now, but we've been in
this business for a long time now,'' said Ford. ``We're happy to
keep blending together other companies into our own because that's
just what we do.''

E-COMMERCE: DOT-COM EMPLOYEES GROWING IN NUMBER AND BECOMING MORE 
SELECTIVE

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If executives of e-commerce companies thought they were having a
hard time finding employees last year, this year's Summer of the
Dot-Com Shakeout has brought even more misery to the group.
</P>
<P>
   The number of available workers has grown, but as employees jump
off sinking ships or swim away from ones already capsized, they are
being much more selective about where they dock next. Gone are the
days when Internet retailers could dangle 10,000-share stock
options, utter a few words about revolutionizing the process of
buying gravel, say, and then get a prospective employee to sign on
for a galley slave's salary and 16-hour days in close quarters with
24-year-olds and their Labradors.
</P>
<P>
   Now the words ``stock options'' and ``revolutionize'' are more
likely to set a job applicant's eyes to rolling. Recruiters and
executives say employees now want two things from prospective
employers: a good salary and, perhaps more important, good
prospects for corporate longevity. In the short term, at least,
that means that traditional companies with Internet divisions could
have a substantial advantage in the recruiting wars, thereby
putting additional pressure on their dot-com competitors.
</P>
<P>
   One company that has benefited greatly from the consolidation
among Internet merchants is BlueLight.com, Kmart's online store.
The company successfully recruited employees from Petstore.com, an
online retailer that was recently purchased by Pets.com, as well
the Internet Shopping Network, which merged with Styleclick.com
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least 50 resumes per week are pouring in from Reel.com,
Homewarehouse.com and other dot-coms that have either failed or are
failing,'' said David Karraker, a BlueLight spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Homewarehouse.com, an online retailer of home improvement goods,
shut down operations earlier this summer, while Reel.com recently
stopped selling DVDs, videos and other goods on its site and scaled
back to an information site about the movie industry.
</P>
<P>
   Pippa Manley, BlueLight's director of human resources, said the
shifting fortunes of Internet companies had saved BlueLight money,
because she now relies less on pricey corporate recruiters to fill
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very inexpensive hires for me, because if I find
them, I don't have to pay 25 percent of a person's salary to a
headhunter,'' Manley said.
</P>
<P>
   As for their demands, Manley said people were less eager to
discuss stock options as part of their compensation, even though
BlueLight's business is structured so that it could eventually sell
its shares to the public. ``A lot of people are saying, `I don't
care about the options _ let's talk salary,''' she said. ``So
there's been more negotiations on that point.
</P>
<P>
   Manley said such negotiations were frustrating, because she
still saw good potential for BlueLight to have successful stock
offerings someday. ``But then again,'' she said, ``I haven't been
through what they've been through, so it's easy for me to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Lyons, BlueLight's manager of marketing partnerships,
joined the company in June from Xoom.com, a unit of NBCi, NBC's
Internet division. ``Options weren't a big priority at all because
of what happened at NBC,'' Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that the NBCi stock reached $85 on its first day of
trading last November, but has plummeted since. (The shares closed
at $22 on Friday.) ``So I was more aggressive on salary,'' Lyons
said. ``Other companies I interviewed with were still giving low
salaries and trying to compensate with umpteen options, which was
so unappealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Compensation aside, Kmart's online operation had its own appeal,
Lyons said: ``I also knew that by coming here, I'd be getting
offline experience, which is important. And I'd be exposed to more
than a desk made out of a door, or bagel Fridays, so that was very
attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Spike Anderson, a principal with Monday Technology Solutions, an
executive recruitment firm in San Francisco, said he, too, had
recently been hearing job seekers express a preference for Internet
sites that are affiliated with traditional companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're hedging their bets,'' he said. ``They might not get as
many stock options, but the chances are they'll at least be worth
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, such sentiments would make it more difficult for
Internet-only companies to compete, because they cannot afford to
increase their salaries to match those offered by traditional
companies. William Chen, chief executive of OnePage.com, an
Internet-only company that allows users to assemble several sites
on one screen, said such a prospect was more theory than fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, there may be a decline in what pure plays can
afford to pay,'' he said. ``But for now, it's still a race to pay
whatever we can, especially to the top people.''
</P>
<P>
   If the emphasis continues to be placed on salary _ and
bricks-and-mortar pedigree _ instead of equity, Chen said, ``we
might have to spend more to hire better people, but then just not
hire as many people to do all the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Myteam.com, an information and commerce site for people involved
in youth sports programs, recently bought air time on a Boston-area
radio station to advertise open positions.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot Katzman, the company's chief executive, said Myteam, too,
had recently seen an increase in the number of candidates who
stressed salary over stock options. But he said that change could
be attributed to the Internet labor shortage, which has been so
protracted that recruiters are more actively lobbying workers at
traditional companies, where people are less prone to jump at
equity-heavy compensation packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we've had to have more conversations about salary lately,''
Katzman said. ``But it still has to work in the context of the
company, and this is a start-up, so you have to be very careful
about how you spend money.''
</P>
<P>
   Compensation packages with stock options also motivate workers
``to build the company's value,'' Katzman said. ``Everyone's got to
have some skin in the game for this to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, traditional companies with Web operations are
enjoying the fact that dot-com executives are asking to work for
them, rather than raiding them. ``We take some consolation in
knowing we've populated the dot-coms,'' said Christopher McCormick,
senior vice president of L.L. Bean, which has lost senior-level
executives to Send.com, Diamonds.com, Dell.com and eToys, among
others. ``But I've got to tell you, it hurt morale for people to
see folks leave for stock packages worth a zillion dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the tide has turned, McCormick said, noting for
instance that the company's vice president for operations, Mike
Perkins, recently joined L.L. Bean from Amazon.com. ``And we've
gotten dozens of resumes from people at dot-coms who want out
because their stock is under water, and they see Bean's staying
power and the quality of life here in Maine,'' McCormick said. ``I

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was perhaps the most arcane statement in all the
hours of acronym-filled testimony, one that came on the last day of
the six-day trial. But it may have been a turning point in an
important battle over the limits of a new copyright law, a
potential landmark case that ended its trial phase last week in
Manhattan and now awaits a verdict by the judge.
</P>
<P>
   More news coverage may have been devoted to the recent legal
wranglings over Napster, the Web service that the recording
industry has accused of abetting widespread music piracy. But the
Manhattan case, involving the copying of DVD movie disks, may have
more far-reaching effects _ both on the way cultural products are
consumed and on whether computer code is deemed to be speech
deserving of First Amendment protection.
</P>
<P>
   From the witness stand last Tuesday, David S. Touretzky, a
professor and computer scientist at Carnegie-Mellon University,
paged through a series of exhibits that included lines of software
source code in the C computer language, an English-language
description of the code, long strings of ones and zeros known as
object code and a picture of a T-shirt with the object code printed
on it.
</P>
<P>
   All of the exhibits pertained to the subject of the trial: a
software program that enables a user to decode the scrambling
technology meant to prevent DVD movie disks from unauthorized
copying. Touretzky, an expert witness for the defense, told the
judge that if he saw fit to ban any one depiction of the
DVD-unscrambling software he would have to ban them all, because
they all communicate the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as having a chilling effect on my ability as a
computer scientist to express myself,'' Touretzky said. He was
referring to the court's preliminary injunction that barred a Web
site from posting the underlying, or source, code for the cracking
program. ``If the court upholds this injunction, what would happen
is that certain uses of computer language _ my preferred means of
expression _ would be illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Until that moment in the trial, U.S. District Judge Lewis A.
Kaplan had appeared to have little doubt about the copyright law's
constitutionality. In ordering the injunction, he had noted that
the First Amendment does not shield copyright infringement, and
that computer code was essentially ``no more expressive than an
automobile ignition key.''
</P>
<P>
   But in light of the professor's testimony, Kaplan said, he would
reconsider his constitutional analysis. It would be hard to make a
case ``that computer code of any kind has no expressive content,''
the judge said. ``Which then gets you to the question of how then
do you deal with it under the First Amendment?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a significant statement to many legal experts, who see
the DVD case pitting Hollywood's right to retain copyright control
in the digital age against the right of individuals to exercise
First Amendment free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the DVD case does not center on traditional
copyright issues, like how much of a given work may be freely
copied, or how many copies may be legally made, or even _ as in the
Napster case _ who can be held liable for enabling someone else to
make illegal copies.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the DVD trial is the first test of a 1998 federal law
that made it a crime to manufacture or ``offer to the public'' a
way to gain unauthorized access to any copyright-protected work
that has been secured by a technology like encryption. It may sound
like a hair-splitting distinction, but some people in the debate
see it as a fundamental change _ as if the law now made it illegal
not only to photocopy and sell a copyrighted book, but also to
simply tell someone how to open and read that book without the
publisher's authorization.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called anti-circumvention provision is part of the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Congress' attempt to update
copyright law at a time when digital technology has made copying
words, sounds and images far easier and less expensive than ever.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the law in its current form worry that it goes
far beyond the specific copyright challenges of the digital age to
give copyright holders broad new powers over how the public uses
their material. They worry that even time-honored ``fair use''
privileges like quoting from a novel in an essay of literary
criticism or showing a movie snippet on a televised review could
become illegal or even technically impossible since devising a way
to do so would be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fundamentally change the face of copyright law if we say
none of the limitations and defenses to copying apply if the
copyright owner was smart enough to encrypt,'' said Mark Lemley, a
law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who is not
involved in the case. ``Can you reverse-engineer software? Can you
make parodies of someone's work? Can you make educational copies?
All of that may be irrelevant if the mere act of getting access to
the content for these purposes turns out to be illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the DVD case, eight Hollywood studios are suing the publisher
of 2600, a hacker magazine, for publishing computer code on his Web
site that enables someone to break the encryption system on DVD
movie disks. Studio executives say they are depending on the new
law to prevent the sort of mass copying of movies over the Internet
that is already happening with music. Without the guarantee of that
protection, a Warner Bros. executive testified in court, the
industry would never have begun releasing movies in digital format.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the magazine publisher, Eric Corley, argue that
the law may violate the First Amendment, and that the same
principle of ``fair use'' of copyrighted material that is built
into traditional copyright law should be applied to controlling
access to digital works.
</P>
<P>
   The defense argues that there is a legitimate use for the code
that Corley published on his Web site at the end of last year. They
say that the code is a crucial part of a legal reverse-engineering
process that enables DVD owners to view the disks on computers
running the Linux operating system, something that is otherwise not
currently possible.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome depends on Kaplan, who presided over of testimony
with obvious technological savvy. He has made clear his position
that Congress did not build the notion of ``fair use'' into the
restriction on circumventing encryption.
</P>
<P>
   Corley's defense team, led by the prominent First Amendment
lawyer Martin Garbus, and financially backed by the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, a free-speech group, have not been optimistic
about winning the trial and have said all along that their main
goal is to lay the groundwork for an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But neither side is willing to predict how the judge may now
rule. Kaplan has indicated that he planned to release his decision
shortly after lawyers submit closing briefs on Aug. 8. The wild
card may be Touretzky's testimony, which Jackson said was
``extremely persuasive.''
</P>
<P>
   The events that prompted the Motion Picture Association of
America, a trade group representing eight leading movie studios, to
sue Corley, 40, began last fall in Larvik, Norway. There, Jon
Johansen, a skinny, self-confident 15-year-old, decided he was
tired of dedicating an entire computer to Microsoft's Windows
operating system just so he could watch DVD movies on a PC. All of
his other computer activities were on machines running either the
Linux operating system or FreeBSD, another alternative to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   According to his testimony in the Manhattan trial, Johansen and
two people he knew via the Internet agreed to try to make something
that did not yet exist: a software program that would play DVD's on
computers running Linux. They knew that would mean cracking the DVD
encryption system, Johansen said, but their purpose was not to make
illegal copies.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the DVD encryption, known as CSS for Content
Scramble System, was not difficult to decode. In a matter of weeks
Johansen had sewn together a decryption program he called DeCSS
(pronounced DEE-C-S-S). He posted the DeCSS source code _ its
recipe, in effect _ to an Internet list of people working on a
Linux DVD software player program.
</P>
<P>
   The code was later incorporated into a program that is currently
available on the Web in a test format.
</P>
<P>
   To no one's surprise, the source code for DeCSS had been widely
disseminated across the Internet. In response, the licensing
organization for CSS _ made up in part of the major film studios
and consumer electronics companies _ has, under a California law,
charged some 500 Web site operators with violating its trade
secrets by posting the code. A preliminary injunction against the
defendants is under appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Johansen, now 16, was recently named in the California case.
Norwegian authorities, who seized his computer and held him for
questioning last January, have also charged him under Norwegian
laws for contributing to copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, offers have starting surfacing in Internet chat
rooms to trade DVD movies over the Internet that have apparently
been decoded with DeCSS or other programs. The movies would be sent
over the Web with new data-compressing software known as Divx. The
technique is similar to the way MP3 music files are transmitted via
Napster and other music services, except that video files are much
larger and encrypted and typically take many hours longer to travel
across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Just how widespread such copying is, and to what extent DeCSS is
used in such activities, was a matter of some debate at the trial.
In fact, the studios conceded that they had no evidence of an
individual who had actually used DeCSS for piracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to prove it,'' said Leon Gold, a lawyer with the
New York firm Proskauer Rose LLP, who is the studios' lead lawyer.
``The point is, we're trying to prevent it.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, the eight studios filed suit under the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act against Corley and two other New York
defendants, who have been dropped from the case. The studios are
seeking an order that would permanently bar Corley from publishing
DeCSS, in addition to a declaration that his conduct was unlawful,
but the judge has expressed doubts about whether the power of an
injunction should be invoked in a situation where he may well
conclude that ``the horse is clearly already out of the barn.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue, too, is whether the judge will grant the studios'
request that he forbid Corley from posting links to other Web sites
where DeCSS is available. Such a move would also raise First
Amendment issues.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of Garbus, one of Corley's lawyers, The New York
Times submitted an affidavit in the case stating that an article on
the Times' Web site last April provided a link to the 2600 site's
list of links to other sites that were publishing the DeCSS code.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the eventual outcome of the case, legal experts expect
it to lay the groundwork for future battles over the new copyright
act. Corley is being tried for making unscrambling code available
to the public. But there is another key provision to the law, a
portion that Congress suspended when it passed the act in the fall
of 1998. That portion would make it a crime for anyone to
circumvent encryption to gain access to a digital work _ in effect,
to open and read a digital book without the publisher's
authorization.
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress has been asked to issue a
recommendation, due in October, about what groups of people or
classes of works, if any, should be exempted from the statute.
Depending on the outcome, it could be a crime for anyone to use a
program like DeCSS.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the only way you got material is basically in an encrypted
form subject to a contract that says, `You may not copy any of
this,' how do you make fair use?''' said Marybeth Peters, the head
of the U.S. Copyright Office. Peters has been holding hearings on
the matter for two years and must make her own recommendation soon
to the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Peters has been weighing arguments by copyright holders who
contend they will have no incentive to produce digital material
without the assurance of such protection, and by educational and
civil liberties groups who argue that society will suffer if access
to the products of mass culture is curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   On many days ``I'm ready to tear my hair out,'' she said. ``The
issues are really complicated, the legislation is less than clear,
the interests are many and varied and we have very little guidance
because the language is ambiguous and the stakes are very high.''

NEW ECONOMY: AOL'S RIVALS CALL FOR ACCESS TO ITS INSTANT MESSAGING
SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To hear some rivals of America Online talk about it, the case
for opening up its instant messaging service _ or IM, as it is
known in the trenches _ is a struggle between the forces of
democracy and those of autocratic rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Case, on behalf of the IM industry and users everywhere,
tear down this wall!'' Ross Bagully, chief executive of Tribal
Voice, said in testimony before the Federal Communications
Commission last Thursday, after a speech by AOL's chairman, Steve
Case. ``Users of IM, like users of e-mail and the telephone,''
Bagully said, ``deserve the right to free and open communication.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the FCC building a handful of protesters marched with
signs that read, ``Free IM!''
</P>
<P>
   The ``wall'' that Bagully referred to is the partition that
keeps AOL's instant messaging service a closed system _ one that
prevents users of other companies' instant messaging services from
exchanging messages with users of AOL's service. Instant messaging
enables people to send messages over the Internet that pop up on a
recipient's screen almost instantly, allowing people to communicate
in ``real time.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual twist, the Microsoft Corp. is among a dozen or so
smaller players in the IM market that decry what they consider to
be AOL's market-dominating behavior in instant messaging, and they
are demanding that it step up efforts to make its system interact
with theirs. Among the other companies that share the 10 percent of
the IM market not occupied by AOL are Yahoo, Odigo, iCast and
Tribal Voice.
</P>
<P>
   It was the outcry by competitors that landed instant messaging
on the agenda of the FCC's hearing, along with other issues _ most
notably the question of equal access to Time Warner's giant cable
network _ as the commission reviews the pending merger of AOL and
Time Warner. As far as instant messaging is concerned, competitors
contend that AOL's closed network stifles innovation and stymies
growth in their industry.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 180 million registered users so far, IM is
particularly popular with teens and families. But analysts predict
that within a few years business people will account for nearly
half of all IM users.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to note that the debate is not about whether the
various IM systems will ever work together, but about when and how.
Even AOL does not dispute the need for an interconnection standard.
But like most market leaders, the company would prefer to control
the standard.
</P>
<P>
   At last week's FCC hearing, Barry Schuler, president of AOL
Interactive Services, said that the development and testing of an
instant messaging standard would take over a year. AOL has
continually insisted it needs this much time to ensure the privacy
and security of its customers, particularly against spammers _
people or advertisers that blast unsolicited messages to hundreds
or thousands of recipients. But AOL's critics accuse the company of
stalling in order to better solidify its market position.
</P>
<P>
   Schuler said AOL's competitors in instant messaging did not
understand _ or have sufficient sympathy for _ the scope of the
spam problem and how it might impact instant messaging. ``Nobody
else has 23 million people paying them to provide an environment
that's monitored,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the company said, it has already ``opened'' its
network through royalty-free licensing agreements that allow
Internet service providers and Web companies to use AOL Instant
Messenger technology to create their own messaging software.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL's competitors see the spamming and security argument as
a smoke screen. ``They've been saying that the last few months, but
they've never backed it up with facts,'' said Avner Ronen, chairman
of Odigo, which is based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, when AOL submitted its proposal for an IM
specification to the Internet Engineering Task Force, the industry
committee whose job it is to create a technical standard,
competitors criticized its plan as unacceptably vague _ and a
further sign of foot dragging.
</P>
<P>
   A year can seem an eternity on the Internet. So last week, a few
days before the FCC hearing, IM companies formed a new group to
hasten the arrival of a standard, even if only a temporary one. The
group, which calls itself IMUnified and is led by Microsoft, plans
to release a temporary specification next month that would permit
IM systems to talk to one another while a long-term solution is
developed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ronen said, ``We hope AOL will come to its senses and
cooperate.''
</P>
<P>
   The IM dispute has been fraught with nastiness and distrust from
the outset. Starting last year, Microsoft and other AOL rivals
began using technical loopholes to interact with AOL's IM users.
Each time, AOL technicians have quickly patched the holes. Odigo, a
small IM provider with about a million users, says that it found a
way to connect its customers to AOL's on 17 recent occasions and
that each time AOL blocked it.
</P>
<P>
   AOL considers these efforts ``attacks'' on its system and vows
to defend itself against security breaches; its competitors contend
their IM customers deserve to be able to freely exchange instant
messages with users of other services.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the AOL-Time Warner merger probably does not hinge
on resolution of the instant messaging dispute. Certainly of
greater concern to the FCC last week seemed to be whether the
merged company would make good on its promise to give all Internet
content providers open access to its cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL's critics fear that open IM access will arrive even more
slowly if it does not happen before the world's largest Internet
service provider becomes part of the nation's largest Internet and
media company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know from history,'' Bagully said, ``that those who
unfairly exploit a market dominance don't get nicer as they get
bigger.''

 &HT;    Daring vacationer enjoys initial experience with Webvan
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I'm on vacation this week. As a high-profile sort of a
guy, my vacations are probably different from yours. It goes with
the territory of being a public figure and living in the fast lane.
</P>
<P>
   This year for vacation I bought some tires for my 1991 Nissan.
But I didn't stop there. I also tried something new. After all,
vacations are the time to step outside the usual.
</P>
<P>
   So I tried Webvan. I used the online service that lets you order
groceries over the Web and then have them delivered to your door.
</P>
<P>
   I'll pause for a second and let your thumping heart get its
rhythm back and then tell you what that was like.
</P>
<P>
   My friends and co-workers will tell you that I am not wildly
experimental (I still find ATMs slightly frightening, but I believe
they will catch on) and _ maybe because I've worked for newspapers
for many years _ I can be a little cynical.
</P>
<P>
   So despite all the glowing press reports about the service and
even the praise I'd heard from some friends, I did not go into this
with a glad heart.
</P>
<P>
   But I was determined to try it, so I logged on at www.webvan
.com to set up an account. It was actually pretty easy, but I
figured that the real test would be in the ordering.
</P>
<P>
   The whole notion of Webvan makes me dizzy. Here you have a
company that sells groceries for about the same price as you'd pay
at the store, throws in free delivery and also gives you (for now
at least) $15 off on your first order.
</P>
<P>
   It either has to be run by the tooth fairy or a bunch of guys
with black shirts and white ties. So I was looking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, I didn't find any. Ordering was fairly easy, and I'm
pretty sure it will get easier in the future now that I understand
more about how it works. You use a series of menus to find your
items. The menus start with broad categories. For instance, there's
one called produce, another for meat and seafood, still another for
prepared food _ and they get progressively more specific. For
instance, if you click on the meat and seafood category, you get
new categories that include beef, ham, pork, etc. Click on those
subcategories, and things get even more specific.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, as is my habit, I'd get confused and search for an
item in the wrong category. (Hey, I'm a guy.) That's when the
search feature came in handy. You can type in a specific product _
say garlic _ and find it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Once you find your item, you simply indicate how many of the
item you want and continue shopping. I finished ordering $100 worth
of groceries in about 10 minutes. Then I proceeded to check out.
Unlike at the regular grocery, I did not have to stand in line and
wait while the cashier told the customer ahead of me about the
first three decades of her life. Instead, you give a credit card
number and select a delivery time.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike scheduling the time for the cable guy to come to your
house, these are scheduled in 30-minute increments and _ both in my
experience and that of my friends _ that's when the Webvan folks
actually show up.
</P>
<P>
   My groceries arrived right on time the next day. The vegetables
and fruit looked like they should be on the cover of a food
catalog. The steaks were terrific. And it all _ including the
20-pound bag of cat litter _ was carried right into my kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Ain't technology grand?
</P>
<P>
   What a terrific vacation. Maybe next year I'll do something
really wild and get the carpets steam-cleaned.

 &HT;    Photo e-mail isn't difficult
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   Can you tell me how to e-mail a photo? I can get the photo on my
monitor, but the recipient can't call it up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tom Sholtis, Jupiter, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You scanned the photo onto your hard drive. Half the battle
is won. Check some things before sending. First is file type. Some
photo file types include JPEG, TIFF, and EPSF. We suggest JPEG,
which compresses your photo.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Next is file size. Make sure it isn't huge. Some e-mail
systems don't accept large files (depends on the ISP), or your
e-mail system may strip a large file as it leaves the mail server.
It's best to use a compression program before sending. PC users can
use PKWare's PKZip or WinZip. For Mac users, DropStuff. Find the
shareware programs at www.zdnet.com.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Once you check file type and file size, you're ready to
send. Start an e-mail message. Pop in the recipient's address.
Depending on your e-mail program, you should have an attachment
button on the message interface. If not, look for the word
``Attach'' under one of the pull-down menus. A window will pop up
asking where the item is you want to attach. Navigate to your photo
and double-click. The photo attaches to the e-mail. Write a message
and click Send.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I plan to buy a Zip drive. I can't decide if I should buy an
external or internal model. Help.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ronald Harrison, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: You obviously need more storage space, a backup strategy
or a way to transfer data. Maybe all three. Ask the question, ``Is
portability important?''
</P>
<P>
   Sue: If it is, an external Zip storage drive is attractive
because it's easy to tote around, slick and easy to install.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Zip drives are popular, and they've been around.
Compatibility won't be an issue. You shouldn't have trouble
swapping disks for work or play.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Find out how your computer would interface with an external
storage drive. Like everything now, drives come in all flavors.
Interface terms such as USB, SCSI and parallel port may sound like
a string of Greek, but they are important. A tool called zip
configurator at www.iomega.com/zip/configurator/index.html can help
you match your computer with a compatible drive.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Also, think about what and how much you'll be storing.
Are you interested in a 100-MB drive? A 250-MB drive?
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Costs for external Zip drives range from $87 to $135 at
CNet Shopper (shopper.cnet.com/).
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: If drive portability isn't an issue, then an internal Zip
may fit the bill. At www.dealtime.com you'll see internal Zip
drives for $85 to $180. If you're not a do-it-your-selfer, plan on
an installation fee.

 &HT;    Can't live without 'em
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some people are in love with their pets. Others spend
hours lovingly attending to their cars or boats. And then there are
those special people who are deeply attached to technology.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a Palm Pilot or the latest in paging or e-mail
gadgets, these Internet executives, come heaven or high water,
won't leave home without them.
</P>
<P>
   Erika Jolly, EarthLink's vice president of portal product
management, doesn't go anywhere without her PalmV hand-held
personal digital assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I got hooked on my Palm is because I am on the road
so much, and I can see my schedule at a quick glance,'' she says.
``I'm always on my phone if I'm not in meetings, and I can get my
contacts whether they are advertisers, content partners or members
of my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolly commutes between EarthLink's offices in Atlanta and
Pasadena, Calif., at least every other week. The Palm helps her
keep track of where she's going and what she's doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many features on the Palm that are so cool, like
the MapQuest feature, which lets you download maps,'' she says.
``It's so much better than having a pile of paper to drag around
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolly uses the PalmV. ``It's the latest one,'' she says, ``and
it's got all the mega-stuff. I did try the PalmVII, and I went back
to the PalmV. The VII was too big, and it didn't fit into the
pocket of my Tumi backpack real well.''
</P>
<P>
   (Jolly bought the Tumi backpack because it had a special
compartment to hold her Palm Pilot. ``It's so cool,'' she says.)
</P>
<P>
   However, Jolly says her love affair with the Palm may soon be at
an end.
</P>
<P>
   She just bought a new silver Motorola Timeport cellular phone
from Sprint PCS. (Sprint PCS has a relationship with EarthLink.)
</P>
<P>
   She's waiting for a clip-on mobile organizer add-on for her cell
phone that her boss got her hooked on. ``The basic idea is it fits
right on the back of your phone. It has a touch-screen user
interface, so you can scroll through your address book, find the
person you want to call, then your phone calls that person. It's
got an address book, a calendar and a to-do list,'' she says. ``How
cool is that? I ask you, how cool is that? I just have to have
it.''
</P>
<P>
   INSTANT COMMUNICATION
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lanzone, co-founder and marketing vice president of eTour
(www.etour.com) doesn't go anywhere without his Blackberry Rim.
</P>
<P>
   a reason to carry that big thing around with me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As much fun as the Blackberry can be, it's also a useful tool
for staying in touch with co-workers strewn around town and around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Lanzone estimates he gets between 200 and 300 e-mails a day.
With his heavy travel schedule, having the Blackberry with him
means he can respond to important messages without having to lug
his laptop computer around and wait until he had someplace to plug
in to check messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to talk to me, or they have to show me a document
right away,'' he says, ``And I can get all of that, and I can get
it real time. When I'm not at my desk, it's the easiest way to
reach me. It's one of the essential tools.'' He uses it regularly
to communicate instantly with his ad agency, public relations firm
and radio media buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also has curbed my cell phone use drastically. I used to
have by far the highest cell phone bills in the company. It was
almost absurd. Now it's about a quarter of what I used to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanzone's wife, Shannon, is also learning to live with her
husband's passion for his Blackberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife loves it and she hates it,'' he says, laughing. ``My
dad named this thing the bumble, because it buzzes when it goes
off. Everyone loves to tease me about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanzone says another great feature of the Blackberry is that you
can be a computer geek without anyone ever knowing. ``I wear it in
the office. But when I step out into the real world, I put it in my
pocket so I won't be laughed at in the street by small children.''
</P>
<P>
   PAGES, PAGES EVERYWHERE
</P>
<P>
   The halls of BellSouth are unusually quiet, but it's not because
the people are unfriendly. In the halls, the offices and even in
the elevator, nearly everyone is in his or her own private world,
busily typing away on BellSouth Interactive pagers.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Yeatts, vice president of Internet portal services for
BellSouth.net, was one of the first to have his own pager. When he
got it, he was working in another department and used it to stay in
touch with his very busy boss. ``We'd see each other in person
about once a month, and this was a great way to stay in touch.''
</P>
<P>
   The BellSouth pager can do a variety of things. Each user has a
specific pager Internet address, so it's also possible to use a PC
to send e-mail directly to the pager. Pager users can also send
e-mail to other pager owners and other computers, or even send a
message that can be delivered by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cool thing about this is that it's always on,'' Yeatts
says. ``You get immediate feedback. You know when the message is
sent. You know when it's been read. With our BellSouth crowd, the
only reason somebody didn't get the message is if their battery
died or they are on an airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   The always-on pager also came in handy during a big meeting with
corporate officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a new person in the meeting, and someb' '' Yeatts
says his wife also uses the PC to send e-mail that appears almost
instantly on his pager.
</P>
<P>
   However, Yeatts knows even the silent act of sending an e-mail
under a restaurant table can be a little annoying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that a lot of people are irritated by this stuff.
... It's a subtler version of the cell phone problem. You try not
to answer the page when someone is in the middle of a very
interesting conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeatts says he has macros set on his pager that let the sender
know he's busy and he'll get back to them later. If something is
urgent, he tells them to send it again and mark it urgent and he
will read it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about it is you can always stay connected,''
he says. ``It's about real-time, wireless communication.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 &HT;    Oxygen.com a halfway fresh concept
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Oxygen cable channel for women never lets you
forget for a minute that there is also an Oxygen Web site.
</P>
<P>
   A black strip with Web site addresses runs continuously across
the Oxygen channel. While it's not as annoying or depressing as the
CNBC all-day Nasdaq ticker, it does bring a new dimension to
television viewing.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has seen the Oxygen channel knows there's not a whole
lot to see. Typically it's nothing more than several very hip, very
trendy ``Sex and the City'' wannabes sitting around in sweater sets
and stilettos talking about nothing much deeper than how they like
their boyfriends to dress or asking makeup experts whether it's all
right to wear blue eye shadow to board meetings. (Just so you know,
it's not.)
</P>
<P>
   PBS this is not, and the average female viewer probably has
deeper and more interesting conversations with the counter help at
Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   But while the hosts babble on about the topic of the day, keep a
close eye on the Web sites running across the bottom of the screen.
Get a pen and notepad and keep them on the coffee table. You might
find some nifty stuff here. During a segment about buying art
online, several interesting Web sites popped up that offered great
resources for buying prints as well as tips on getting exactly what
you pay for. Last week, a segment on cowgirl chic featured all
kinds of links to Web sites for real cowgirls as well as a neat
board game with a cowgirl theme.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you think you can remember this endless swirl of Web
sites, guess again.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Web site is flashed on the screen over and over
again, as is the Web site for advertiser Kraft (www
</P>
<P>
   .kraftfoods.com), remembering which Web site had the tips for
planning a hiking trip or those neat art-deco clocks they were
showing is tough.
</P>
<P>
   If you have Web access, as Oxygen is betting you do, you can log
onto the Web site www.oxygen.com and find a list of links featured
on the latest installment of whatever ``show'' you were watching.
Even though it looks as if it's just people sitting around talking,
these shows really do have titles.
</P>
<P>
   When you head to the Oxygen Web site, you'll be in for a
pleasant surprise and great disappointment. It's a rare Web site
that can be both brilliant and awful at the same time, but somehow
Oxygen seems to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the Oxygen site hoping to find the same list of
sites they saw on TV or to find out some other information related
to the cable network get the added bonus of wandering through some
of Oxygen's online content. The content is a lot richer in depth
and intelligence than its TV counterpart. (Its recent salute to
novelist Judy Blume was beautifully designed and had lots of
intelligent input from Oxygen readers.)
</P>
<P>
   However, when you leave the interesting and beautiful original
content area and head for the TV tie-in area, you will be reminded
of leaving democratic West Berlin and crossing over to Communist
East Berlin before the wall came down. There's a distinct
difference, and that's a real shame.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to find the cowgirl game was an impossible mission. The
``She-Commerce'' area listed six Web sites related to ``cowgirl
fashion.'' I am positive many more sites flashed across the bottom
of the screen than the paltry few listed on the site. And the
cowgirl-themed board game that looked like so much fun when the
hosts were playing it on the air was nowhere to be found. It was a
miserable letdown and at least one online sale lost.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxygen Web site works when it does its own thing. It falls
to pieces when it tries to mesh with the cable channel. To really
separate Oxygen from the pack of still obscure cable channels and
so-called women's Web sites, Oxygen.com needs to pay more attention
to its poor relation, the cable channel, and make the tie-in as
interesting to visit and as easy to navigate as the rest of the
site. There's no doubt the staff at Oxygen.com is up to the task,
and making the Web site more interesting than the cable channel
certainly won't take that much work.

 &HT;    Freeware program SoomSoom a unique way to keep track of files
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Behold SoomSoom.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not another panda, nor is it a menu item at your local
Thai pad.
</P>
<P>
   What it is, is software. Free software.
</P>
<P>
   Free software is often more expensive than the price would
indicate, but SoomSoom does a little better than that. It has an
interesting premise and fulfills it fairly well, although not as
magically as its advance notice would have you think.
</P>
<P>
   SoomSoom's publicity billed it as the ``first-ever
name-recognition software,'' whatever that might mean, but it
doesn't recognize anything without instructions.
</P>
<P>
   It's intended for those of us who are forever losing files,
forgetting what we called them, unable even to remember a single
unusual word in them for which to search.
</P>
<P>
   SoomSoom serves as an interface between the user and Microsoft
Word, NotePad, WordPad Excel and other major applications installed
in the computer, as well as the Internet. It has its own e-mail
program and a Web browser based on Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   It's also an address book, which one uses to make sure SoomSoom
can locate files. Let's say you correspond with a fellow named
Otto. First thing you do is set up an address book page for Otto.
It can be quite extensive, but all it really needs is his name.
</P>
<P>
   When you want to write a letter to him or write something about
him, you select the New Document from the menu bar. This gives you
a dialogue box from which you choose the program you'll use to
create the file, name the file and put down the subject, which in
this case would be ``Otto.''
</P>
<P>
   Then whatever program you have selected comes up full screen,
you complete the document and save it wherever you wish. Returning
to SoomSoom's screen, you'll see the document listed when you
select Otto.
</P>
<P>
   One could, of course, accomplish the same thing in other ways,
such as creating a separate subdirectory named Otto. But that's so
pedestSoomSoom's mail program runs well enough, although it's not
nearly as fast at bringing in the mail as Eudora Pro.
</P>
<P>
   Considering its price, SoomSoom works well. It has the silly
rough edges that seem almost obligatory in freeware _ aggravating
misspellings on its screen, awkward phrases or usages that bespeak
an origin outside English and little mechanical things that don't
work as expected.
</P>
<P>
   In the e-mail program, for instance, you cannot delete an entire
batch of messages; it has to be done one at a time. When you get a
couple of hundred a day, that's not an option.
</P>
<P>
   The instructions are all on-board, festooned with exclamation
marks and not at all extensive.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, what's this SoomSoom name? Knowing that inquiring
minds would want to know, I asked. The answer was that SoomSoom is
the result of ``name-oriented computing, in which everything begins
and ends with a name.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. You can go to www.soomsoom.com, download the program
and try it out for yourself.

&HT;     ACTIVISTS FOR PROSTITUTES WANT BETTER SOCIAL SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;     By PETER HARTLAUB  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Activists defending prostitutes have taken their
concerns about violence to San Francisco's City Hall, hoping for
changes that will make sex workers safer on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   They are suggesting that less money should be spent fighting
prostitution and more money going to social services to help the
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see on a daily basis violence, whether it's verbal or
physical violence,'' said Betty Traynor, who lives near Capp Street
in the Mission. `` think what the city is doing now is not
working.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Supervisor Tom Ammiano suggested the entire Board
of Supervisors could eventually act.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the talk focused on the Jack Bokin case. Bokin was
sentenced in January to 231 years to life for a string of violent
attacks on prostitutes _at least one of which occurred while Bokin
was out on bail.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that Bokin, a Mission District plumbing
contractor, chose prostitutes as his victims because he thought
police would not believe them, and court authorities would consider
them unreliable witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Activists read several statements from working prostitutes, who
claimed they are harassed by police and are not always taken
seriously when complaints are made.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Schneider, who said she is a prostitute, showed up at
hearing this week, telling the committee, ``We have rights just as
anyone else who has a working job in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the San Francisco Police Department and district
attorney's office defended themselves, saying they are doing what
they can, but need
</P>
<P>
   more funding.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Linda Klee said her office is
willing to prosecute violent acts against prostitutes, but many
prostitutes are not willing to testify, or disappear before their
cases go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major, major problem,'' Klee said.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Police Department created the Crimes Against
Prostitutes unit last year. Police spokesman Inspector Sherman
Ackerson said prostitutes who report crimes will not be arrested
for prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do everything we can to encourage prostitutes to
come forward when they are victims of crime,'' Ackerson said. ``The
department will investigate crimes against prostitutes as
vigorously as crimes against anybody else.''

 &HT;    Home version of `Millionaire' takes leap from computer to TV
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sony has brought the video game ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' back to the living room.
</P>
<P>
   The first version, modeled after the wildly popular ABC-TV game
show, was for computers only. It sold more than 1.7 million copies,
becoming one of the most popular PC games in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: 2nd Edition'' is for the Sony
PlayStation console. It allows buyers of the game to play it
together with family and friends on the living room TV screen
rather than huddled in front of a computer.
</P>
<P>
   You can now play this $39.95 game in the group environment, like
non-video games such as ``Pictionary'' and ``Trivial Pursuit.''
Divide into the teams and put the PlayStation control in the hands
of your smartest teammate.
</P>
<P>
   A virtual Regis Philbin is your host, complete with his charming
wit and sometimes bratty attitude. The two-player game starts off
with the ``fastest finger'' mode, in which you have to put four
items in chronological order quicker than your opponent to earn the
right to play for money.
</P>
<P>
   The questions in the ``fastest finger'' round can sometimes be
ridiculously hard, forcing both teams to guess repeatedly. It can
test Philbin's temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we have a bunch of Mensa candidates in there,''
Philbin says sarcastically. ``I guess you know I'm just kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   Another stinger from Philbin: ``Hey, hey _ what's the IQ in this
room? I'm getting concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   If both teams fail every attempt, then the game starts over. But
not without some final words from our host.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, guys, how many times can we do this?'' Philbin says.
``You are pathetic. The game is over. I'm getting out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you're in the money seat, ``Millionaire'' becomes much more
enjoyable. Just like on TV, you have access to three lifelines:
phone a friend, ask the audience and 50/50.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nothing in the PlayStation game is more impressive than
the phone-a-friend option. It is an available option for each of
the 600 questions. Choose the phone alternative, and you have
access to one of the virtual game show host's wacky friends,
ranging from a snooty doctor to a person with ESP who leaves advice
on the greetings of his answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   With a limited number of questions, you will start seeing
repeats as early as the 10th time you play. But it doesn't
necessarily make it much easier.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: 2nd Edition,'' the $100
question can be just as challenging as the one for $8,000. Or they
can be exactly the same, just 15 to 20 games apart.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the assistance of friends, it is tough to make it to
the $64,000 mark. If you are able to win $1 million, then you are
either very intelligent or have a superb photographic memory. Just
remember, it's only a virtual $1 million.

Web site will tell you the best time to run outside, look to the

in some Earthbound circles, Vastly Expensive Space Pork of Dubious
Utility. The site was developed by NASA's Marshall Space Flight
Center in Huntsville, Ala., and generates its data based on
information provided by the North American Aerospace Defense

coordinates, and, shazam, you're tracking like a big Sirius.
(''Hey, what's that Bob's Big Boy statue doing out there?'') Should
you, for some reason, not know your exact longitude and latitude
coordinates - what are you, lost? - the calculator also works with
ZIP codes. And if the Space Station doesn't turn you on, the site
also tracks Mir and space shuttle missions.

WHY IS THE OUTLOOK FOR INTERACTIVE TV SO FUZZY? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first interactive TV show debuted back in the 1950s, long
before anyone had ever dreamed of the Internet. It was a cartoon
called ``Winky Dink,'' which allowed the boys and girls at home to
participate by drawing onto a sheet of plastic attached to the set.
The only problem was, you had to have the ``Winky Dink'' kit, which
cost50 cents; more than a few youngsters ended up coloring directly
on the screen, which didn't endear the show to Mom and Dad.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the concept died a fast death.
</P>
<P>
   But now, nearly a half-century later, interactive television is
the talk of the industry. This month, America Online is launching
AOLTV, a service that enables users to send instant messages and
conduct real-time chats on their television screens while watching
their favorite programs. Likewise, Microsoft has announced plans to
update its existing WebTV service to include such functions as
instant replay in addition to its combined television programming
and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial possibilities alone are enough to make the folks
on Madison Avenue salivate. If interactive television fulfills its
potential, viewers could click on a character's sweater, for
instance, and purchase it online. Sports fans could shift the
camera angles of the game or order pizza without having to pick up
the phone. Viewers of an educational documentary about, say,
African elephants could put the program on hold while they surfed
the Net for more information on a particular game preserve. The
ultimate application would be video on demand, signaling the end of
``appointment television.''
</P>
<P>
   All those futuristic features aside, the consensus is this:
Interactive television is an interesting experiment, and it's going
to fail, at least in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Simply put, we like to watch. Period. Over the years,
viewers have developed a seductively passive relationship with the
small screen. They're couch potatoes for a reason; they sit, they
click, they veg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television was the ultimate relationship,'' says Robert
Thompson, professor of film and television at Syracuse University.
``It gave and gave and gave and asked nothing in return.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the folks behind WebTV admit that getting viewers to
abandon such pleasant passivity has been a difficult challenge.
Launched in 1996, the service was touted as the wave of the future;
in four years, just more than 1 million units have been sold,
hardly a critical mass. ``The average American household watches
television seven and a half hours a day, and it's a big challenge
to get them to change their habits,'' says Joe Poletto, vice
president of Microsoft's network media group. ``The biggest change
people have made is to move the refrigerator closer to the couch.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, every experiment with interactivity since the early
days of ``Winky Dink'' has failed or fizzled. In the mid-'90s, Time
Warner Inc. launched something called the Full Service Network in
Orlando, Fla., an ambitious attempt to offer video on demand,
online shopping, and games via a set-top box. The service flopped.
Likewise, other attempts at so-called ``convergence'' of the
Internet and the television have been less than spectacular.
``Homicide'' offered a Web site that complemented the on-air story
line, a clever application but hardly groundbreaking. ``The Drew
Carey Show'' enhanced one episode with a ``live'' Webcast that was
little more than a marketing gimmick. &QL; 
Trying, trying again
</P>
<P>
   So why does AOL think it can succeed where others have failed?
``You simply can't discount our 23 million members,'' says Carlos
Silva, vice president of AOL's product studio.
</P>
<P>
   The new television service, which is being offered in a handful
of pilot markets including Phoenix, Sacramento, and Baltimore (but
not Boston), is part of the company's ``AOL Anywhere'' strategy.
Some of the features are pretty nifty _ particularly for
15-year-olds accustomed to talking on the telephone while drooling
over the latest episode of ``Dawson's Creek.'' Viewers can reduce
the television program to a small window on one side of the screen
while sending e-mail, participating in online chats, or surfing the
Web. AOL members have access to their Internet mail accounts and
buddy lists on the television set. Unlike WebTV, which has a
keyboard with commands that are not all that intuitive, AOLTV is
easy to navigate, with simple pull-down menus that fade away when
they are not being used.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging, of course, is the big draw. But is it enough
to justify the cost? ``Can you imagine a teenager going to a parent
and saying, `I want you to pay $14.95 a month, plus $249 for the
box, so that I can tie up a phone line and chat during my favorite
television program'?'' asks Josh Bernoff, a senior analyst with the
Cambridge-based Forrester Research Inc. ``I don't think the
parent's response would be printable in a family newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for those prices, you ought to be offering more than
that cheerful fellow proclaiming, ``Welcome, you've got mail.''
Both AOLTV and WebTV have a paucity of original content. Granted,
WebTV users can play along with ``Jeopardy'' or ``Wheel of
Fortune,'' but that's pretty much the whole enchilada. And AOLTV
has its own unique channels, but there didn't seem to be much on
them, at least during a recent demonstration at the company's
headquarters in Dulles, Va. The service currently offers
personalized programming from the Weather Channel, enabling viewers
to check the forecast in their own backyard, but that same service
is already available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the chicken-and-egg dilemma. Why should the
networks and cable stations produce expensive interactive
programming for a service that has yet to capture an audience?
WebTV's Silva insists that deals are in the works. ``We are in the
midst of doing all of the brainstorming with our broadcast partners
and coming up with the ideas for the fall,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But think about it. One episode of a half-hour sitcom can cost
more than $10 million to produce; an enhanced version would cost
significantly more, for an uncertain payback and a small potential
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, AOL and Microsoft (along with most major cable
companies) are betting that interactive television will replace the
tube as we know it someday. The current offerings _ the Web sites
that do little more than sell coffee mugs and T-shirts _ are hardly
reinventing the medium, but then again, television originally
mimicked radio before it evolved into a new genre. ``When they
invented television, they literally filmed radio broadcasts, and it
was horrible,'' notes David Card, a senior analyst with Jupiter
Research in New York. ``Milton Berle invented the new form. Well,
we are waiting around for interactive television's Milton Berle.'' &QL; 
Coming to a screen near you
</P>
<P>
   Despite the almost universal criticism of current services, some
analysts predict that the wait won't be that long. According to
Forrester Research, consumers will be spending $9 billion to $10
billion on digital and interactive television services by 2004. And
Jupiter Communications predicts that 15 percent of all US
households will have access to some sort of interactive television
by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But just what form that interactive television will take is
still uncertain; it will probably be some hybrid that combines
video on demand with selective Internet access as well as the same
kind of passive programming available today. ``There is going to be
a middle ground between the futuristic utopia and the reality of
what people want from their leisure time,'' says Thompson. ``I
don't want to be a Luddite and say we're all going to sit around
and watch reruns of `Mr. Ed.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, who is going to fork out the money to be the
guinea pigs for Microsoft, AOL, and the cable companies? To begin,
there are the gadget geeks, the early adopters who simply have to
have every new electronics device that comes on the market. The
irony with AOLTV, though, is that the service is designed for the
company's middle-of-the-road users; it's not sophisticated enough
to satisfy the folks who now own better global positioning systems
than the federal government does.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the company has a vested interest in improving
the product. When its planned merger with Time Warner goes through,
the communications conglomerate will own the pipes that bring both
the Internet and cable television into millions of households. It
makes sense for the two services to merge.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the folks at AOL are crowing about a feature called
``You've Got Pictures,'' which allows users to run a personal slide
show on their television set. That hardly qualifies as a
revolutionary innovation, and it sure isn't worth $14.95 a month
for existing AOL members (or $24.95 a month for nonmembers).
</P>
<P>
   Back in the day, low-tech interactive programs such as ``Winky
Dink'' had a simple set of challenges; the producers simply had to
get the kids to buy the kits. Today, AOL and other companies have
to overcome long-entrenched beliefs about the medium itself. At the
same time, AOL has a distinct advantage that cannot be ignored _
its enormous user base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Videophones were tough because you had to buy two,'' says
Silva. ``If you only bought one, there was no one to talk to. But
if we sell one AOLTV box, there are 23 million people to talk to. I
can't stress that enough.''

MICROSOFT: CASTING A BROAD .NET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The largest software company on earth has launched its largest
new-product initiative ever.
</P>
<P>
   It's called Microsoft.NET, and though technology companies have
a bad habit of abusing capital letters, this time the odd spelling
makes sense. .NET is big _ perhaps as big as the antitrust ruling
that could dismantle Microsoft in a year or two. The company says
it'll spend $4.4 billion in research and development on the project
in this fiscal year alone. Microsoft chairman Bill Gates calls it
``a bet-the-company thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the best evidence of .NET's massive scope is the
fact that it's so difficult to describe. .NET isn't one thing _ a
new operating system or a new programming language. It's nothing
less than a complete rethink of Microsoft's basic business model.
</P>
<P>
   A company grown fat on selling separate chunks of software to
users of desktop computers has come to realize that this won't work
any more. Computers now come in all shapes and sizes, from laptops
to palmtops. More important, they're all learning how to talk to
each other, using the free, open communications standards found on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In a world of smart networked devices, almost every part of
Microsoft's business has to change. The .NET program is Microsoft's
remodeling blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   Sanjay Parthasarathy, a software development vice president at
Microsoft, used to manage Microsoft's corporate Web site, one of
the world's largest.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was running Microsoft.com, I had a kind of epiphany,''
he says. On a browser, ``what you see are pictures of information.
You don't have the real information.''
</P>
<P>
   You can cut and paste text from a Web page to a word processor
or spreadsheet on your own machine. But users would have a lot more
power if they could work directly on the data in the Web page
itself.
</P>
<P>
   .NET aims to make this possible by means of ``Web services,''
chunks of active code running on remote Internet servers but
available to people all over the network. A financial Web site
could use a service that would cause customer financial data to
appear inside a full-featured spreadsheet program. The customer
would be able to enter new data, run what-if financial scenarios,
and even save the results to the hard drive of his own machine.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing new about the idea of having a program running
remotely, but .NET aims to make the process seamless and nearly
invisible to the user. For instance, the spreadsheet wouldn't pop
up in a separate window, but would be built right into the
financial company's Web page, a concept that Microsoft calls the
``universal canvas.''
</P>
<P>
   To make the system work, Microsoft has been forced to abandon,
at least in part, its traditional affection for ``secret sauce'' _
fancy features based on private Microsoft technology that can't be
emulated by other companies. The world's computer networks are
built around openly published software standards; to be taken
seriously, Microsoft.NET has to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   So the system relies on XML, a network language that's much more
powerful than the HTML language that's generally used to create Web
pages. XML is an international open standard, controlled by the
World Wide Web Consortium in Cambridge. Microsoft can use it, but
it can't control it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart and soul of .Net . . . is XML,'' says Parthasarathy.
``If you cut us around here, these days, we bleed XML.''
</P>
<P>
   The language is vital because it makes it easy to separate the
content of a document from the form in which a computer displays
it. That means that the same XML-coded information can be displayed
easily on many different types of electronic devices. Nowadays, Web
pages must be painstakingly modified to fit on pocket-size Web
phones. But in a .NET world, XML-based sites will automatically
format themselves to fit a PC, a cell phone, or any other viewing
system.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Microsoft developed a new communications protocol
called SOAP that allows its new Web services to work. But in a
break from Microsoft tradition, the company has released SOAP as an
open standard, allowing any software developer or Web designer to
use it.
</P>
<P>
   With XML, SOAP and Microsoft's universal canvas, Web designers
will be able to add powerful new features to their sites simply by
subscribing to them. Microsoft itself plans to offer a number of
Web services that it expects will be especially popular.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the company already has a service called Passport
that lets you log into multiple Microsoft Web sites by entering a
password just once. Your personal information is then made
available to all other Passport sites, eliminating the need to sign
up for each one separately.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft figures there'll be considerable demand for such
services. It will offer a Web-identity service that will identify
users instantly to any site they choose. Other Web services will
include search engines, a calendar, and online data storage. A Web
site designer would simply subscribe to these services, and they'd
appear as integral parts of his Web page.
</P>
<P>
   And they won't have to buy from Microsoft. Using .NET
programming tools, other companies can create their own Web
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It enables a whole new level of competition on the Web,'' says
William Zachmann, vice president of the Meta Group, an industry
analysis firm.
</P>
<P>
   Web services won't just be relatively lightweight applications.
Microsoft is going to deliver its entire office software suite this
way, in a service called Office.NET. Rather than buy Office
outright and install it on a home computer, a subscriber will be
able to pay a monthly fee for the right to use, say, the Excel
spreadsheet as a Web service.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft isn't just counting on software rental revenues to
turn a profit on the .NET initiative. If it's successful, the
company stands to sell lots of .NET-enabled versions of its Windows
operating system. Even if other companies embrace the .NET approach
and make their products compatible with it, Microsoft could give
itself a headstart so large that rivals could never catch up.
</P>
<P>
   The .NET strategy is also a direct assault on one of Microsoft's
most bitter rivals, Sun Microsystems Inc. Sun has garnered an
international following for its Java computer language. Programmers
like Java because the same piece of code written in Java can run on
many different kinds of computers with minimal changes. Instead of
writing software that'll only run on Microsoft's dominant Windows
platform, Java programmers know that their code can run on many
other kinds of computers as well.
</P>
<P>
   But only if you write in the Java language. That means throwing
away billions of lines of programming code already written, not to
mention the challenge of learning a new language.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says .NET offers a better way. The company will offer
new software development tools that'll make traditional computer
languages work more like Java. Already it's introduced C(NU), a new
version of the venerable C operating system that's intended to be
more Java-like. And the company is working to .NET-enable other
computer languages as well. The idea is for Microsoft to sell lots
of software development products, but also to encourage the fastest
possible rollout of .NET-compatible services.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive Software Engineering Inc. in Santa Barbara, Calif.,
makes a computer language called Eiffel that's used by banks and
financial institutions. The company has worked with Microsoft to
.NET-enable Eiffel by adding a feature called a ``common language
runtime,'' which is similar to the ``virtual machine'' that lets
Java programs run on many different kinds of computers.
</P>
<P>
   Bertrand Meyer, the company's president, says that with common
language runtime, .NET programmers will be able to write in any
language they like _ Visual Basic, C, COBOL, or Eiffel _ and get
the same kind of versatility now offered by Java. For example, five
programmers working on a large project might each write in a
different language, but their finished code would interact without
a hitch. ``It is in very much contrast to the Sun approach which
says, `Use Java or you are lost,' '' says Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Lowe, a programmer at ARINC Inc., an aerospace software
company in South Carolina, says the Microsoft approach is
well-suited to the way he works.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common language runtime on the .NET platform . . . makes
our lives easier because we can now use one language to write
components, program SQL Server (a popular database program), and
develop Web pages.''
</P>
<P>
   But Java boosters are less than awed by Microsoft's approach.
Sun spokesman David Harrah says that the common runtime would only
work for people using a forthcoming new version of the Windows
operating system, Windows.NET, which is due out next year. Besides,
he notes that unlike .NET, Java has something of a track record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's five years old and it has a great deal of substance to
it, and 2 1/2 to 3 million developers,'' says Harrah.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Ross, president of the Java Lobby, an organization of Java
programmers, is even more blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for me to believe that C(NU) and .NET isn't
just another way to dress the wolf up,'' Ross says. ``Just a
different color of sheep's clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Microsoft's reputation for harsh tactics used against
rivals and business partners alike, many a developer may hesitate
to stake his company's survival on the future of .NET. But
Microsoft has already done just that.

GLIMPSES OF A MORE VIVID ENTERTAINMENT FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Fred Tepper grew increasingly voluble as he
described the wonders of Project: Messiah, the character animation
software that he was promoting at Siggraph, the leading annual
conclave for specialists in computer graphics, virtual reality and
interactive technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the beginning of time in computer animation, people have
been looking for more realistic characters,'' Tepper said. ``And
we're finally getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first convention for the company behind Project:
Messiah, pmG _ basically a bunch of friends and colleagues with
backgrounds in computer animation. And here they were at Siggraph,
with their own booth, their own line of products _ right in there
with the big guys .
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really have a company headquarters yet,'' Tepper
said. ``Basically, at the moment, we're kind of all working out of
our houses.''
</P>
<P>
   As computer graphics become increasingly important in the
production and distribution of popular entertainment in America _
whether it's three-dimensional animation or photo-realistic special
effects _ an argument can be made that the best way to see into the
culture's future is not to take in the latest Off Broadway
sensation or study the works of the current darling of the Iowa
Writers' Workshop, but to stroll around at Siggraph, ground zero in
the digital entertainment explosion.
</P>
<P>
   What would rapidly become apparent on such a stroll is that
several converging forces are at work that in the very near future
are likely to result in more plentiful, vivid and immersive
entertainment, whether it's in a movie theater, in front of a
computer screen or seated at a video game console.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving into a period of what I call lean-forward
entertainment, as oppose to lean-back entertainment,'' said Fred
Angelopoulos, chief executive of Pulse Entertainment. ``I am
talking about entertainment that doesn't allow you to sit back,
that pulls you right into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Using software that has just arrived on the market, animators
will be able to work more quickly and much, much more cheaply. Home
hobbyists and aspiring filmmakers will be able to create, on
personal computers no more powerful than the ones they probably
already have in their homes, special effects and animations of
astonishing sophistication. In addition, new methods in what is
called image-based rendering are emerging to make it easier to
create animation from photographs and other digital images scanned
into a computer.
</P>
<P>
   On the World Wide Web, three-dimensional animation will become
increasingly the norm, for shopping, for gaming, for attracting
people to Internet sites and keeping them there. New affiliations
like those just announced between Intel and Macromedia and between
Real Networks and Pulse Entertainment indicate that the science of
compressing huge volumes of data may finally make it possible to
stream complex three-dimensional images into personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Technologies like haptics, which makes virtual objects on a
computer or game screen ``feel'' as though they are real by adding
tension and vibrations to a mouse or joystick, will intensify the
online experience. And with a new generation of powerful video-game
machines like Sony's Power Station 2 and Microsoft's X-box, the
richness and realism of game animations will take a quantum leap
forward.
</P>

   ``The biggest difference we will see in the coming months is in
the realism,'' said Roger D. Chandler, product marketing manager
for Intel's Internet Media Initiative. ``For a long time, we
weren't getting that realism because the processing power wasn't
there on people's desktops. But now the hardware is there. And the
software is becoming available to utilize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Siggraph was founded by the Association for Computer Machinery
and stands for Special Interest Group _ Graphics, a name given to
the show three decades ago, when the field was dominated by those
providing computer-enhanced applications for the military and
industry. Gradually, those innovations made their way into
commercial use and then into popular entertainment. Now, Hollywood
and computer games are the dominant flavor at the annual event.
</P>
<P>
   The trade floor, where the latest high-tech gizmos are unveiled,
is as big as the deck of an aircraft carrier, a labyrinthine grid
of blinking lights, overhead screens, twirling logos and
cacophonous pitches. Many companies use the event to introduce
their latest products, like Sony's Gscube, a video graphics
equalizer that allows animators to create complex scenes in real
time. (Until recently, animators had to punch in volumes of
computer code _ for characters, for textures, for movements _ and
then let it process for hours, or even overnight, before seeing how
the result looked.)
</P>
<P>
   Since Hollywood has become so central to the computer graphics
industry, Siggraph is held every other year in Los Angeles, where
it has attracted around 45,000 people in recent years. In the
alternate years, the conclave shifts to places like Orlando,
Washington and, this year, New Orleans, and the crowds are
generally smaller, around 25,000 to 35,000.
</P>
<P>
   The event is the largest get-together of the year for those
involved in the field, a time when college friendships are renewed
and resumes are passed around with zeal. Job seekers formed long
lines to apply to the leading animation companies _ Disney, Pixar
Animation (creators of ``Toy Story''), Pacific Data Images
(``Antz''), Sony Imageworks (``Stuart Little''), Blue Sky
Productions (making the forthcoming ``Ice Age''), Square Films
(making ``Final Fantasy'') _ and the top effects houses, like
Industrial Light and Magic, Digital Domain, Mantex and Rhythm and
Hues.
</P>
<P>
   It is a young field, and the bulk of those attending the event
are also young _ certainly under 40, many of them fresh out of
college. And, as might be expected when so many young people are
gathered together, there is a certain party atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Bulletin boards set up around the convention center were
festooned with graffiti (``I Love New Orleans!'') promoting parties
and Web sites and all-night raves. Each evening offered an array of
company-sponsored parties at French Quarter nightclubs and uptown
mansions, many of which lasted until near dawn and brought a
certain bleary aspect to the early morning reading of technical
papers.
</P>
<P>
   Siggraph also has a high-art component, a digital art gallery,
at which serious artists can display work built upon
computer-created images or effects. The results this year ranged
from the eerily beautiful to the perplexing and the whimsical.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Free Range Appliances,'' a corral full of toasters,
eggbeaters and other small household items, all mounted on wheels,
would spring to life when flashlights were shined on them.
</P>
<P>
   In a piece called ``Nosce Te Ipsum'' by a University of Michigan
artist named Tiffany Holmes, viewers were asked to walk along a
path toward a screen displaying a collage of images. As the viewer
got closer to the screen, pieces of it were torn away, to the
amplified sound of ripping paper, until finally a video image of
the viewer appeared on the screen, gaping back at himself.
</P>
<P>
   In a nearby room called the Studio, visitors could create their
own paintings and sculptures using the kind of high-end equipment
and software most of them never have a chance to use. And upstairs
in the convention center, in dozens of meetings room, classes in
computer techniques and theory ran throughout the five-day
gathering. Four auditoriums showed a rotating program of 135 pieces
of computer animation, chosen from more than 600 submitted from all
over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everywhere, the talk was about breaking through
boundaries to make the entertainment experience more vivid, and
about how inexpensive the whole field is becoming.
</P>
<P>
   Project: Messiah began as a plug-in to one of the dominant
animation packages, a common first step for animation software. A
studio will equip its staff with an animation package _ Maya,
Softimage and Houdini are among the bigger names _ and then buy
individual plug-ins that enhance a particular feature. Such a
plug-in might, for example, offer heightened facial animation
capabilities or a range of arcane textures.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, many of the plug-in companies move beyond that stage
and offer a stand-alone version, a soup-to-nuts animation package,
which is what Messiah was doing this year. The first Project:
Messiah stand-alone was selling for $395 at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge home hobby thing going on right now,'' Tepper
said. ``I can remember when I was in high school and wanted to make
movies, I got a Super-8 camera. Well, this is sort of the Super-8
camera of the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   And Messiah was far from alone; more than a dozen software
companies were offering animation packages and plug-ins that cost
well under $1,000 and promised sophisticated results, even on a
home computer.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Riley, the vice president for marketing and business
development at Face2Face, said that his company's software, which
turns flat images into three-dimensional ones, is aimed at creating
more sophisticated facial animation. At the moment, the company is
offering the product to animation studios, estimating it will save
25 percent in time and costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, we are hoping to move into animation in the
house,'' he said. ``Maybe creating the next generation of greeting
cards, where people can scan images of themselves into their
computer and then create animated versions of themselves to send
over the Internet as Christmas or birthday cards.''
</P>
<P>
   The savings were not limited to at-home animation. Scott Ross,
chairman of Digital Domain, said he had seen the cost of equipping
one of his company's effects animators plummet from his early days
in the business, when he created effects for films like ``The
Abyss'' (1986).
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to geek out on you,'' he said, ``but back in 1986 a
standard work station cost $65,000, plus $34,000 for the software.
So you were looking at a cost of about $100,000 per seat. Now, you
can get 10 times the power in a $7,000 computer.''
</P>
<P>
   In the convention's technical areas, where academic researchers
offered technical papers on the latest developments in the field,
much of the talk was about moving beyond the current vogue in
ultra-realistic animation.
</P>
<P>
   David Salesin, a University of Washington professor who won the
convention's top prize for technical achievement, has written
extensively on ways to create watercolorlike effects on the
computer and to imitate the brushstrokes and the feel of
impressionist paintings, moving computer animation away from the
kind of rock-hard accuracy that sometimes made it feel cold and
emotionless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a good job with photo-realism,'' Salesin said.
``Now is the time to look at more expressive forms of drawing.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Internet has given a platform to death-row inmates
and other American prisoners to plead their cases and seek pen
pals, sparking outrage among many families of victims and creating
a new debate about the rights of the growing number of prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   While no American prison allows inmates to have access to the
Internet, prisoners use third-party services, usually for a fee, to
reach out to a potentially huge audience.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, dozens of inmates like Michael Blue, who is on death
row, appear on Web sites saying they were wrongly convicted of
murder. On one Web site, Blue is described as ``a little shy,
honest, caring, loving.''
</P>
<P>
   A California inmate, Askia Ashanti, appears on a Web site
looking for ``a pro bono attorney or $5,000 to $10,000 in funds to
hire an attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   And Beau Greene, who is imprisoned in Arizona, appears on a Web
site in a picture, cradling a fluffy cat and asking for pen pals.
Greene is described as ``bored and lonely with a surplus of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene, 32, does not mention that he was convicted in 1996 of
killing a slender, 58-year-old musician, Roy Johnson, by bashing
the man's head against rocks.
</P>
<P>
   When the victim's daughter, Jennifer Johnson Lopez, discovered
the Web site, she said she was horrified that the killer was able
to use the Internet to escape his feeling of confinement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disgusted,'' Johnson Lopez said. ``He said he missed
companionship. I thought, `Serves you right.'''
</P>
<P>
   Victims' rights groups complain that it is humiliating for
victims and their families to see prisoners popping up on Web
sites. The groups also complain that people browsing the Internet
might begin correspondence with violent criminals or believe their
stories without knowing the real details of their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such criticism, officials in New York and Arizona
have enacted policies or laws that forbid prisoners from using
third-party Internet service providers. Washington and other states
have debated similar measures.
</P>
<P>
   But in the view of many civil libertarians, these measures
infringe on the First Amendment rights of inmates. Eleanor
Eisenberg, the executive director of the Arizona chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union, said her group was considering
filing a lawsuit against the Arizona measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It clearly impinges on an inmate's First Amendment right to
communicate,'' Eisenberg said. ``It also chills the rights of third
parties who have committed no crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials, however, say they are frustrated by the Web
sites, and they say the Internet has allowed prisoners to have
soapboxes and to to prey on the innocent and softhearted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has given these criminals worldwide access and
the ability to raise huge amounts of money,'' said Gary Phelps, the
chief of staff for the Arizona Department of Corrections. ``Besides
that, we've got women coming from Australia, Belgium, England _ all
wanting to see these men they've met on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has also become a tool in championing the causes of
individual inmates, such as Mumia Abu-Jamal, who defenders contend
was wrongly convicted of killing a police officer in Philadelphia
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen Web sites carry details about the case and
history of Abu-Jamal. One of the largest sites, operated by a
private anti-death-penalty group in New York called Refuse and
Resist, describes the inmate as ``a prominent radio journalist''
being punished because he ``allowed the angry and anguished voices
of the oppressed onto the airwaves.''
</P>
<P>
   It features a photograph of Abu-Jamal, smiling and raising a
clenched fist.
</P>
<P>
   A page on the Web site, under a headline reading ``The
Frame-Up,'' calls the police account absurd and says that witnesses
in Abu-Jamal's defense were harassed by law enforcement
authorities. The site invites people to join marches around the
country on Abu-Jamal's behalf. It also encourages Web site visitors
to print and distribute the posting to other potential supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Jamal's lawyer, Leonard Weinglass, said the Internet had
allowed people around the world to closely follow Jamal's case.
``If something happens in court, it's important that our friends in
France, Germany and Denmark be informed,'' Weinglass said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, American prison authorities have long read inmates'
mail, except for legal correspondence and letters to elected
officials. But in recent years, prisons have made it more difficult
for inmates to have contact with people on the outside, said Steve
Bright, the director of the Southern Center For Human Rights, an
advocacy group for inmates' rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be viewed as a positive to stay in touch with the
outside world, since the idea was that people would be
rehabilitated and then returned to society,'' Bright said. ``Now
the attitude is to make the prisons as punitive as possible and
make the prisoners as miserable as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, he said, the courts have almost always sided with
prison authorities in clamping down on the ability of inmates to
communicate with outsiders, especially reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, while inmates are forbidden to receive mail from
third-party services, they can send mail to these services, as long
as they disclose that they are prison inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in truth in inmate advertising,'' said James
Flateau, a spokesman for the New York Department of Correctional
Services. ``We want people to know who they're writing to.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other state prison systems, the New York correctional
department posts an ``inmate look-up'' on the Internet so the
potential pen pals can learn about a prisoner's record, Flateau
said, ``and decide for themselves if that's someone they want to
write to.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest third-party Internet services for inmates is
run by the Rev. Rene Mulkey, who operates in rural Missouri and has
a client list of about 1,500 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   For $10, a fee that Mulkey says is used to defray mailing costs,
inmates can have a biographical sketch posted on her Web site,
usually with a photograph, a first name and an identification
number. When people send messages to individual prisoners, she
forwards them through the United States Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the guys are asking for romance, or friends, or just
plain encouragement,'' Mulkey said.
</P>
<P>
   She said her empathy for inmates stemmed, in part, from what she
described as a ``false arrest record'' that had haunted her late
husband. ``Things are not always what they seem to be,'' she said.
``The press makes these guys out to be animals, but they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jane McGrath, a Republican state legislator who sponsored
the bill prohibiting inmates from using third-party Internet
services, said it galled the families of victims to see the smiling
faces of criminals who describe themselves as decent people.
</P>
<P>
   ````The Internet allows these people to distort history. It's a
way of further victimizing the victim,'' McGrath said.

WALL-TO-WALL WIRING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ALEX PHAM   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Coming soon to a housing development near
you: wall-to-wall Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Touting it as the best invention since indoor plumbing, Cisco
Systems Inc. and real estate developer Playa Vista have teamed up
to introduce the next-generation, ultra-wired homes.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine having instant, high-speed Internet access from any
phone jack in the house. Refrigerators, televisions, ovens, lights,
alarm systems would all be connected to the Web. That, of course,
means being able to control these appliances from any Internet
browser in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Playa Vista is building 14,000 of these high-wired homes in West
Los Angeles using Cisco's ``gateway'' technology to provide
ubiquitous Internet connections. The first of these ``smart homes''
is scheduled to be completed in April.
</P>
<P>
   What new capabilities will they offer?
</P>
<P>
   Residents will be able to preheat their oven on their way home
from work from a personal digital assistant that is connected to
the Internet. They can turn on the home security system from their
cell phone at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   When they're away from the house, they can monitor their
children through a Web cam. Defective appliances theoretically have
the ability to automatically self-diagnose and send an e-mail to
the manufacturer to dispatch a repair crew.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this is already available in bits and pieces. Many
personal computers now have high-speed Internet connections. And
with some effort, consumers can network several devices together to
share Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   What's new, Cisco executives say, is the ability for all devices
in the home to easily share a single Internet connection through
its gateway, a notebook-size black box that distributes Internet
access throughout a house. To get access, consumers would only need
to plug a device into any phone jack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet will become a utility, like water and
electricity,'' said A. Jared Headley, consumer solutions manager
for Cisco, which opened a model ``home'' on its corporate campus in
San Jose last week.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco plans to sell its gateway devices to housing developers
across the country, but also seeks to reach consumers who are
looking to wire existing homes.
</P>
<P>
   The devices, expected to be on the market in about six months,
will cost $500 each. That would not include the monthly fee charged
for the Internet service itself. Nor would it include the cost of
installing high-speed wires, which would add another $1,500 for an
existing home. Adding custom appliances, home entertainment
systems, and security devices could jack up the price tag by
$50,000 to $100,000.

TELECOM: OUTWARD BOUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PETER J. HOWE   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the hotter trends in telecommunications today is unified
messaging, with dozens of firms offering new services to collect
all your voice mails, e-mails, and faxes in one digital mailbox to
save you time and hassle.
</P>
<P>
   Now the action is beginning to heat up on the flip side of
unified messaging _ ``outbound'' services that let you create a
message that is delivered simultaneously to dozens or hundreds of
people as an e-mail, a message on a cell phone or pager, a fax, and
even as a synthesized voice call.
</P>
<P>
   EnvoyWorldWide, known for its MessageBlaster service, is
introducing a new service with Bidder's Edge, a Web Burlington,
Mass. site that collects information about 170 Internet auction
sites and notifies subscribers when new bids have come in or
auctions are about to close.
</P>
<P>
   Two-year-old Bidder's Edge is using MessageBlaster to power a
service called PingMe that lets people track auctions and get a
message in any format they want.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of chaining yourself to the computer to follow the
auction for that 1969 Phil Esposito hockey card you're dying to
get, you can arrange to have any type of message sent to you
whenever there is a development in the bidding.
</P>
<P>
   In one version of the Bidder's Edge service, you could arrange
to get a phone call from a speech synthesizer that would tell you
of a development in a bid, then let you use your phone keypad to
dial in a new bid.
</P>
<P>
   The deal represents a new market for EnvoyWorldWide, a
Billerica, Mass. company whose system has been purchased by
businesses that want to be sure they get crucial information to
employees and executives through whatever communications device
they might be using.
</P>
<P>
   One recent client is Myteam.com, which uses MessageBlaster to
inform soccer-league parents and coaches when a game has been
canceled or a practice rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Envoy president Alain Daste said he sees a host of potential
markets, including trucking businesses wanting to get job
information to drivers and corporations wanting to alert employees
when the latest virus begins infecting e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  Susie in San Francisco might be delighted to get a long
voice mail from you, but before you pick up the phone to call
Schatzie in Stuttgart you might want to send a fax instead.
</P>
<P>
   That suggestion comes from a survey by Pitney Bowes of Stamford,
Conn., which looked at the messaging preferences of people in North
America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, while 97 percent of white-collar workers in the United
States say they use voice mail several times a week or daily, only
35 percent in Germany do, and less than 75 percent in France and
the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Germany ranked highest in frequent usage of faxes, at 93
percent, ahead of the United States at 80 percent. And perhaps
reflecting the more laid-back approach to work on the Continent, 5
percent or fewer of British, French, and German workers carry
pagers _ compared to 25 percent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Study author Meredith Fischer, a Pitney Bowes vice president,
said people should be aware of ``marked cultural tendencies.''
While many Americans are fine with trading voice mails, Europeans
find long voice mails ``irritating and somewhat of a personal
imposition,'' and Germans and French workers greatly prefer
traditional paper communication, she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  EarthLink, the Atlanta Internet service provider, has added
Boston to markets where it is offering a self-installation plan for
getting high-speed digital subscriber line Net access. Verizon
Communications offers a similar plan, but it can sometimes be hard
to find stores that sell its DSL modems.
</P>
<P>
   Earthlink's service does not completely eliminate waiting to get
DSL. You have to call EarthLink to order the service; then the
company tells you when you can expect to have your DSL line
activated and ships you the necessary modem, filter, and software
to plug in yourself.
</P>
<P>
   For now, EarthLink only promises to reduce installation times by
up to 50 percent _ which may mean waiting two weeks instead of
four, but saves you waiting around the house for an installation
guy to show up. Genuity of Burlington, the former GTE
Internetworking, is partnering with EarthLink to offer the service.

WHERE YOUR ENEMY ALSO IS YOUR FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ALEX PHAM   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ With enemies like Jim Clark, who needs
friends?
</P>
<P>
   Clark has become the talk of Silicon Valley this past week after
disclosing that he recently purchased 1 million shares of Microsoft
Corp., despite having helped the federal government in its
antitrust case against the software company.
</P>
<P>
   Most folks know the erstwhile Microsoft basher as one of the
founders of Netscape Communications, the firm whose Web browser
went toe to toe with Microsoft's Internet Explorer product and
lost. Clark got his revenge when he played a key role in the US
Department of Justice's successful bid to nail Microsoft for trying
to put Netscape out of business.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Shortly after a federal judge ruled in favor of
the government and ordered the breakup of Microsoft, Clark quietly
bought the company's stock, which at the time traded between $65
and $73 a share. Microsoft shares inched up 31.25 cents Friday to
$69.6875 on the Nasdaq exchange. At around the same time, Clark
sold about 95 percent of his shares in America Online, the company
that purchased Netscape last year.
</P>
<P>
   Why the switch?
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to diversify,'' Clark quipped to an incredulous
audience who gathered here last week to hear him speak. Clark also
disclosed that he has started using Microsoft's Internet Explorer
browser.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is rich gossip for the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But is it shocking? Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   There's a notion in the technology industry called
``coopetition.'' It's a ruthlessly pragmatic approach to doing
business, where companies can be ferocious competitors in one
market and cheerful partners in another.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Andreessen, who started Netscape with Clark and once
referred to Microsoft as ``Godzilla,'' agreed weeks ago to do
business with his former foe. Loudcloud, Andreessen's new Silicon
Valley venture, will team up with the Redmond, Wash., giant to
jointly market, sell, and license software.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems Inc. and Nortel Networks Corp. are brutal
competitors in the market for Internet switches and routers, but
the two are working together to come up with the Web's
next-generation infrastructure in a project called Internet2.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard Corp. and EMC Corp. compete in the market for
data storage devices. But when it comes to developing the software
to connect EMC machines with Hewlett-Packard's, the two companies
closely collaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle Corp. in Redwood Shores, Calif., and SAP AG in Frankfurt,
Germany, try to clobber each other when it comes to the database
software market. Both, however, work together to sell Oracle
hardware coupled with SAP software. Larry Ellison, Oracle's CEO,
recently acknowledged that SAP is ``both a competitor and a
supplier. We see no conflict there.''
</P>
<P>
   Other strange bedfellows are Apple Computer Corp. and Microsoft,
whose operating systems are direct competitors. Nevermind that
Microsoft is an investor in Apple and one of the biggest developers
of software for Apple's Macintosh computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``One the one hand, Microsoft is in a zero-sum game with
Macintosh,'' in selling operating systems, said Guy Kawasaki,
former chief evangelist for Apple and now chief executive of
Garage.com, an investor in early-stage start-ups. ``On the other
hand, Microsoft makes some of the best software for Macintosh. It
really gets complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Or mercenary.
</P>
<P>
   John Doerr, a prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist with
Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, recently contrasted
``missionaries'' and ``mercenaries'' in the Valley, using Clark as
an example of the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's anything wrong with a mercenary approach. Many
companies simply look at it as survival. ``If you have to get in
with an enemy, well, that's life,'' said Judith Hurwitz, CEO of the
Hurwitz Group in Boston. ``That's how this industry has grown up.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Clark, the entrepreneur's relationship with his old
nemesis, Microsoft, has another twist. When Clark, who founded
medical Web site Healtheon, found out Microsoft would be investing
in rival WebMD, he decided to join Microsoft _ literally _ by
merging Healtheon with WebMD. Microsoft subsequently invested $250
million in Clark's company.
</P>
<P>
   What's Clark learned from his dealings with Microsoft?
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got overwhelming power,'' Clark told his audience of
800 last week. ``It's good to be in alliance with them . . . unless
they're in the same exact business you're in.''

MAJOR RECORD LABELS MOVE TO OFFER THEIR MUSIC ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At least three major record labels plan to begin
selling songs over the Internet in a subscription format by the end
of the year, enabling users to listen to or download a range of
tracks for a flat fee, a move which may fundamentally change the
way recorded music is packaged.
</P>
<P>
   An executive from EMI Recorded Music said on Tuesday that the
label expects to have a subscription service available by the end
of September. Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment
should have a similar service in place by the end of the year, said
Bruce Hack, vice chairman at Universal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be getting in with a subscription model by the end of
the year,'' Hack said.
</P>
<P>
   The executives' statements came on the same day Universal
announced it will begin selling individual songs online for
downloading. Starting later this week, the label will make 60 songs
available on a dozen affiliate Web sites for $1.99, a price that
includes the song, images of the artists and text of the lyrics.
The songs are sold in an encrypted format that Universal says will
prevent anyone but the purchaser from listening to them.
</P>
<P>
   Other major labels are involved in similar trials, including
EMI, which recently began selling 100 albums for downloading on
July 18 from music retail sites. But critics of the industry
consider the efforts an insufficient, desperate scramble to catch
up with an underground Internet music economy they say threatens to
pass the record labels by.
</P>
<P>
   The labels, critics point out, are selling a handful of titles
online for $2 or so a song, while some 20 million people who have
downloaded the software of Napster, the embattled online music
start-up, are exchanging hundreds of thousands of songs free. Last
week, a federal judge issued a temporary injunction ordering the
effective shutdown of Napster, which the recording industry accuses
of contributory copyright infringement. But an appeals court panel
on Friday stayed the injunction pending trial.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, record companies have suggested a
subscription service might borrow heavily from the look and feel of
Napster, offering Internet users a search engine to find songs to
download, but effectively adding a cash register, and with the
songs encrypted to prevent their free and unfettered exchange.
</P>
<P>
   This would be distinct from a pay-per-song model in which users
pay to download or listen to tracks on an individual basis.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Sony Music Entertainment and Universal said they were
exploring a subscription model. Hack said the subscription service
planned to launch by the end of the year will be a product of that
joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many issues are unresolved, Samit said. For example,
he said the labels need to go back to artists and rewrite their
contacts to permit their music to be included in a
subscription-based service.
</P>
<P>
   One record industry executive said the contractual issues aside,
the labels would likely only have to make 5,000 to 10,000 of their
200,000 title libraries available to meet consumer demand, which is
concentrated among a few artists.

&HT;     LAKE GEORGE IS NOT LONGER AN ISOLATED RETREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DINA CAPPIELLO  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE GEORGE, N.Y. _ It used to be a place to go and ``get away
from it
</P>
<P>
   all,'' a retreat for the tired and weary who came to the
Adirondacks to
</P>
<P>
   lose themselves in a landscape of endless mountains, water and
sky.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Northway, a blacktopped trail opening the gateway
of
</P>
<P>
   the Eastern Adirondacks to anyone with a car.
</P>
<P>
   The retreat became a full-fledged resort that attracts nearly 3
</P>
<P>
   million visitors each summer, according to the Warren County
Tourism Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lake George is like a zoo during the summer. There's a
gazillion
</P>
<P>
   motor boats and around the village there's a real carnival
atmosphere,''
</P>
<P>
   said Jerry Pepper, the librarian for the Adirondack Museum, in
Blue
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Lake. ``It's like Coney Island.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, to escape campgrounds with tents stacked
side-by-side
</P>
<P>
   like rowhouses and the incessant whizzing of powerboats,
visitors must
</P>
<P>
   seek trails and camping spots far off upstate New York's major
</P>
<P>
   transportation artery. They literally must venture off the
beaten path.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get away from Lake George village there are some
wonderful
</P>
<P>
   hiking opportunities,'' said Neil Woodworth, deputy executive
director of
</P>
<P>
   the Adirondack Mountain Club, which recommends the Tongue
Mountain range
</P>
<P>
   for a unique nature experience. The Tongue Mountains are one of
the few
</P>
<P>
   places where Eastern timber rattlesnakes, a threatened species
in New
</P>
<P>
   York, can be found.
</P>
<P>
   But to find true solace in nature near Lake George, the place
Thomas
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson once called ``the queen of America,'' follow the
compass point
</P>
<P>
   east or north, where the lean-tos are perched on much smaller
watering
</P>
<P>
   holes, but most days are left empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of wilderness around Lake George, it's just not
in or
</P>
<P>
   around the lake,'' Pepper said.
</P>
<P>
   Many spots, such as Black Mountain, offer those who reach the
summit
</P>
<P>
   views of Lake George from afar. Peaks such as Sleeping Beauty
and Shelving
</P>
<P>
   Rock Mountain are less-crowded alternatives to Buck Mountain,
according to
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Sweet, information services coordinator for the Adirondack
Mountain
</P>
<P>
   Club's Lake George office.
</P>
<P>
   Interspersed between the mountaintops are a handful of ponds
</P>
<P>
   inaccessible from any major roads _ and thus, less visited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black Mountain ponds look like something from Northern Maine.
All
</P>
<P>
   it's missing is a moose,'' said Russ Guard, who has maintained
the lean-to
</P>
<P>
   at Millman Pond in the Lake George Wild Forest for the last six
years.
</P>
<P>
   The retired state policeman and 46er _ meaning he has climbed
all 46
</P>
<P>
   peaks above 4,000 feet in the Adirondacks _ says the
``beer-drinking
</P>
<P>
   party-goers'' stop off at ponds north and south of Millman, and
tend not
</P>
<P>
   to disturb Millman Pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've developed a following at Millman,'' Guard said, meaning
that
</P>
<P>
   people who discover it generally return.
</P>
<P>
   In the journal at the site, entries described Millman Pond as
</P>
<P>
   ``righteous'' and a ``wonderful place.''
</P>
<P>
   But it depends on what you are looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who go to Lake George to experience the
</P>
<P>
   attractions, and there are people who go to the Adirondacks to
get away,''
</P>
<P>
   said Steve Collyer, communications director for the Adirondack
Regional
</P>
<P>
   Chambers of Commerce.

FANS OF SWAPPING MUSIC ON INTERNET NOT DETERRED BY COURT ORDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By AMY HARMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was around 8 p.m. on Wednesday when Joe Frost heard that a
federal judge had issued an order that effectively shut down
Napster. By 11 p.m., he had linked his computer to one of several
underground networks that allow users to do the same thing as the
popular Internet music-swapping service, only without providing a
central target.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of Napster's millions of users, Frost, a 23-year-old
systems administrator in San Francisco, did not see the court's
ruling as a victory for copyright law or a defeat for a particular
company. He saw it as a call to arms. ``I wanted to get more
involved in keeping free music distribution alive,'' Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Chief Judge Marilyn Patel of the U.S. District
Court in San Francisco to prohibit Napster from offering access to
songs whose copyrights are owned by the major record labels is
being viewed as a serious blow to those who had hoped to build a
business around the trading of copyrighted music over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But the cultural phenomenon shows no signs of abating, as
Internet users swarmed to other services that are not necessarily
designed to make money. And since many of the alternatives are
decentralized and noncommercial, they are likely to be much harder
for the recording industry to attack.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, a San Mateo, Calif., company that hopes to make money
through advertising, sponsored promotions and sales of CDs and
other music-related items, asked the court for an emergency stay of
the preliminary injunction Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter the case's ultimate outcome, Hugh Trout, 15, of
Washington, who has copied hundreds of songs using Napster over the
last year, said he was spending Thursday learning how to use
Gnutella, a free program that connects people who want to trade
music files by linking hundreds of thousands of individual
computers together, rather than operating with a single central Web
site like Napster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks just as good as Napster,'' said Trout, who downloaded
the program before the main Gnutella Web site was overloaded late
Thursday afternoon, leaving visitors with the message that its
servers had to be taken off-line temporarily ``due to the
unprecedented traffic volume following the Napster decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Downloads of Freenet, a program that allows users to share video
and text files as well as music, had quadrupled from a daily
average of about 1,000 by noon Thursday, said Tim Perdue, the
administrator of sourceforge.net, the site that posts it.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gnutella, Freenet uses a model that has come to be known as
``peer to peer'' computing, allowing users to download free
software and directly gain access to files on each others'
computers. Both are being developed under the ``open-source''
model, in which programmers around the world donate their services
and software code free.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Clarke, Freenet's primary creator, said the Napster
injunction could have no impact on him or his program. ``I've got
no direct control over how people use it,'' Clarke said Thursday
from London. ``If someone put a gun to my head and said `shut this
down,' I would be unable to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Kan, one of the chief developers of Gnutella, said:
``Gnutella's not a company. It's a movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the reason Napster has been so much more popular than
services like Freenet is because it was much easier for average
computer users to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most important parts of the judge's comments
Thursday is the message it sends to the venture capitalist and
business community about commercializing these services,'' said
Hilary Rosen, chief counsel for the Recording Industry Association
of America, the trade association representing the record labels
that are suing Napster for contributing to copyright infringement.
``It's when they get commercial to a large degree that they get
more user friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Users and developers say the surge in interest Thursday in such
programs, despite their lack of easy interface, underscores the
degree to which people around the world resist the idea that
intellectual property, like a digital music file, should be valued
in the same way as physical property, like a compact disk.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people just want free music,'' Clarke said, ``But
there is a philosophy that justifies that kind of instinct.
Copyright is predicated on the assumption that information is
property. I would contest that assumption.''
</P>
<P>
   The Napster users saying last rites in the service's chat rooms
Thursday while slurping up as many songs as they could before
Friday at midnight, when the court order is due to start, evinced a
range of philosophies regarding copyright.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got 2600 files!!! DOWNLOAD THEM WHILE YOU CAN,''
suggested one user in Napster's ``Alternative Music'' discussion
forum Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Longenecker, a medical sonographer in Lake Havasu City,
Ariz., said he used Napster only to find songs he couldn't get in a
record store. To that end, he went to his computer Thursday morning
and started typing in his favorite artists to look for rare remixes
that might no longer be available to him after the service was shut
down. One he said he was pleased to find: a medley including
AC/DC's ``You Shook Me All Night Long.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something you can buy around here,'' said
Longenecker, 33.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Roth, 27, of Washington, took a less delicate approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of searching by song title, I'm looking for bands,''
he said. ``The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones. Then I
choose a bunch of them to download. With a cable modem, it's taking
me about three minutes per song.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the record industry hopes that shutting down Napster will
result in more CD sales, Sam Chodur, 14, of Lake Hauto, Pa., said
they could not count on any from him, at least not right away. He
is supporting one of several groups calling for a boycott on buying
CDs from the major record labels through the end of October, he
said in an e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   Chodur and several friends are setting up a server on the
OpenNap network, another chain of computers that connects would-be
music traders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I chose to do this because I thought it was unfair what they
did to Napster,'' wrote Chodur, who will be in the ninth grade this
fall. ``It lets me sample the songs from a CD and I get to see if I
want to buy the CD or not. I don't find it to be any damaging to
any musicians. I actually think it is helping them.''

TECHNOLOGY GETS REAL: 3D AND VIRTUAL INNOVATIONS RETURN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Peter Braccio bent to look inside the work area of
a three-dimensional printer, as though peering through an oven
window. Inside, things were baking nicely.
</P>
<P>
   A cube slowly slid back and forth along a track and each time it
passed over the small model it was creating, the printer spewed a
thin layer of wax in just the appropriate spots. Layer by layer,
like sheets of phyllo dough on a streudel, the sculpture that had
been designed on a nearby desktop computer gradually took shape.
</P>
<P>
   All around the room, hundreds of people were hard at work _
waiting their turn at the 3D printer or designing posters for an
enormous printer that could disgorge canvas sheets as big as a
garage door.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is some of these people's only opportunity to play with
some of this high-end equipment,'' said Braccio, part of the
volunteer staff helping put together this year's Siggraph
convention. Siggraph _ derived from the show's original name,
Special Interest in Computer Graphics _ is the most important
annual gathering for computer graphics and interactive
technologies, drawing everyone from industrial designers to serious
video artists to Hollywood special-effects wizards.
</P>
<P>
   The event, which ended its five-day run on Friday at the
riverfront convention center here, is a trade show where the
biggest names in the industry and many hopeful start-up companies
unveil their newest products for computer animation, data
compression, virtual reality, three-dimensional imaging and other
high-technology tasks.
</P>
<P>
   But besides showing what is currently available, the annual
gathering also allows researchers to share prototypes from emerging
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there was a sense at this year's Siggraph that the
time was ripe for three-dimensional, interactive animation on the
Internet. And there was also a sense that many other technologies
were pushing hard against their boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Two-dimensional technologies yearned to be three-dimensional,
such as a figurine printer that 3D Systems was offering.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were the three-dimensional technologies yearning
to be four.
</P>
<P>
   Holoscape, a project of Zebra Imaging and the University of
Texas at Austin, was a series of what researchers called ``digital
holographic stereograms.'' Instead of a two-dimensional picture
contained within a frame, the images were three-dimensional
holograms that appeared to protrude from the frame. The images
changed as the viewer moved from side to side, like scenes from a
3D movie.
</P>
<P>
   To a viewer standing in front of it, one 3D image appeared to be
a husband and wife smiling sweetly. But as the viewer moved from
left to right, the image sprang to life and the wife turned, hugged
her husband and leaned her head on his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   One word on the lips of many people at the show was
collaboration _ devices and software designed to nudge people into
working in a more collaborative way, either in cyberspace or at the
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're around here long enough, you'll get sick of hearing
the word collaboration,'' said Dan Wright, president of Fakespace
Systems, a company that makes three-dimensional imaging devices for
commercial and industrial uses. The company was showing a concave
monitor that looked like the inside of a steel hemisphere in whose
cavity images assumed three-dimensional life. Another company,
Elumens, was showing a similar monitor that allowed viewers to move
through three-dimensional landscapes and architectural models.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Siggraph trade floor was peppered with virtual
workbenches and virtual tunnels, all designed to allow several
workers to experience an image _ and interact with it _ at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get people working together,'' said Scott Ross,
president of Digital Domain, one of Hollywood's leading
special-effects houses. Ross said he had long recognized that good
ideas do not always bubble up unless people are forced to interact
_ especially computer people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, many of these people are conflict avoidant and don't
have great interpersonal skills,'' he said. ``That's one of the
reasons they gravitated to a career where they work with a
computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Another theme that seemed to envelop Siggraph this year was
renewed interest in virtual reality _ not so long ago a virtual
dirty word because of its failure to deliver on the promises of the
early 1990's. In particular, researchers seemed to be struggling
with ways to throw off the cumbersome goggles and gloves that early
virtual reality devices utilized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, immersive technologies have let us down,'' said
Robert Stone, scientific director at Muse Technologies. ``At one
time, people said, `Put on a headset and it's a different world,
your dreams can come true.' Instead, you were always aware you had
this thing on your head and some people came out feeling nauseous
and disoriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtual reality devices were in evidence on the Siggraph floor
that allowed users to dispense with goggles and add some other
senses for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   The Tokyo Institute of Technology was showing a Virtual Rubik's
Cube. The user could insert his hands into an empty metal frame
that contained rings with strings attached into which he could fit
his fingers. A video monitor above the frame showed his hands and a
three-dimensional cube that did not actually exist. As the user
twisted and turned the imaginary cube, the tension on the strings
was altered to give the user the sensation of manipulating the cube
he could see twisting and turning on the monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Kurzweil, the convention's keynote speaker and the author of
``The Age of Spiritual Machines,'' said he foresaw a world just a
few decades away when computers would disappear, information would
be displayed directly onto the retina and nano-tubes implanted at
nerve endings would allow people to flip in and out of totally
immersive and totally convincing virtual reality.
</P>
<P>
   Such science-fiction peeks into the future are also a Siggraph
staple, but there were tiny indications that the technology was at
least moving in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is not flat,'' said David Hague, senior director of
3D technology at Immersion. ``It's not a two-dimensional computer
screen. It's real and it's full of interesting things to
experience. It's full of things to experience with all of your
senses.''

 &HT;    When you think Texas and power and politics, think oil
 &HT;    By Mary Alice Davis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the new Texas, as in the old, when you talk about power and
money, you always end up talking about oil.
</P>
<P>
   As high tech, silicon-savvy and info-hip as we believe ourselves
to be, here in the world's 11th-largest economy, the well-being of
the oil biz is never far from our thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   So when the national Republican Party tops its ticket with ``two
Texas oilmen,'' as it plans to do this week, that sounds normal.
From childhood we've seen that while oil and water don't mix, oil
and politics do.
</P>
<P>
   When Texans elected George W. Bush as governor in 1994, what we
mainly knew of him was that his dad was ex-President Bush, a nice
man who called Houston home. The state embraced W. as an amiable
and fabulously successful sports investor with a lovely family.
</P>
<P>
   But it certainly didn't hurt his image that he had found his
adult identity and the seeds of a considerable fortune as that
mythic creature, the Texas oil man. Twice in recent decades, the
state had picked as governor another of that ilk, the gruff Bill
Clements, who once suggested that a good hurricane would tidy up
oil-spill damage his company had done in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was a footloose Yalie who had embraced the rough and tumble
of Midland by creating a drilling startup in 1977. The company
faltered and was absorbed by other oil outfits. Bush wound up as a
director of Harken Energy Corp., then as a phenomenally productive
short-term investor (returns of more than 2,000 percent) in pro
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   As stockholder Bush was leaving Harken, the company pulled off
what is recalled wondrously in the oil world as ``the Bahrain
deal.'' With no overseas experience to speak of, Harken won a
contract to explore for oil and gas in the Persian Gulf. The Wall
Street Journal, in an editorial page analysis, referred to this
Persian Gulf business coup as ``a piece of exceptional luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, the elder Bush's secretary of defense, spent most of his
life in government service before finding a niche directing a
Texas-based oil conglomerate. Since 1995, he has run the global
operations of Halliburton Co., an oil-field services and
construction company with headquarters in Dallas. He recently sold
about half his Halliburton stock for an estimated $5.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the new globalized economy, the oil business and politics are
pretty much the same thing, as they traditionally have been in
Texas. Cheney, as head of Halliburton, lobbied hard against U.S.
sanctions against countries such as Iran, on the grounds that it's
not good for business. The Gulf War was to a major extent, a war
about the oil business and fueling SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Bush is often photographed with black or brown
schoolkids, plugging away on the theme of education. But this week,
it seemed far more natural to see him again at the side of a
wealthy, pink-cheeked oil executive such as Cheney _ much like the
ones who have run Texas for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is struck from the mold of Bush's greatest mentors. Texas
oil millionaires (old think) and billionaires (new think) loom
large in the Bush history. Notable among them is Richard Rainwater,
a Fort Worth oilman and sports investor and former Bush business
partner who has contributed generously to his friend's political
life.
</P>
<P>
   Scrappy wildcatters such as Jett Rink of ``Giant'' may be scarce
in today's Texas, but gushers still come in. The New York Times
recently reported that major oil companies are expecting earnings
for the latest quarter to be double what they were a year ago.
Exploration and production companies were expected to report profit
increases averaging 371 percent. Refinery profits could double or
triple.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, here in the industry's spiritual homeland, oil
chieftains speak darkly of hard times and the urgent need to repeal
the severance tax _ the tax our income-tax-free state levies on
those who extract minerals from the land.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the state's three railroad commissioners (who, oddly,
regulate oil and gas, not railroads) recently said that might be a
good idea. Another Bush point man, Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo,
said the tax should, at the very least, be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Poignant stories of oil-patch hardship were a key feature of the
1999 legislative session. While oil industry tax breaks didn't get
a mention in Bush's opening address to lawmakers, they topped his
legislative priorities. Bush declared as a legislative emergency
the granting of an oil-industry ``hard times'' tax break of up to
$45 million. The bill passed easily, despite Democrats' grumbling
that it was considerably less important than reducing the shocking
number of Texas children with no health insurance, a topic on which
Bush was virtually mute.
</P>
<P>
   Only later did we learn that the biggest beneficiary of the tax
relief was an oil company in which Richard Rainwater, the
governor's old pal, was the biggest individual stockholder.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison has long distinguished
herself fighting for the rights of the major oil conglomerates to
underpay the public for taking minerals from public lands.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democrats may try the oilman-cum-politico gimmick, with
University of Texas regent Tony Sanchez thinking over a bid for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   More than nostalgia led Texas to put those two little oil
derricks on its new license plates.

 &HT;    Now it's our turn to take care of them
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one asked Joe Levinson if he could afford to serve in three
wars. These days, however, Levinson is being told that the country
he defended in World War II, Korea and Vietnam can't quite follow
through on its promise to provide him free medical care for the
rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   That was part of the deal Levinson and millions like him made
with the government: 20 years or more of their lives in exchange
for, among other things, free medical care for life, assuming they
survived to collect it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they should have read the small print. That's free medical
care for life at military hospitals and then only after active duty
personnel were treated. Even so, that wasn't a really bad deal
before the end of the cold war brought on a round of base closings.
Closing Bergstrom Air Force Base put Levinson, who now lives in
Buda, in a position of making some bad choices even as the years
and the exposure to the defoliant Agent Orange began to catch up
with him.
</P>
<P>
   He could either: a) get on a waiting list for an appointment at
the nearest active military base in San Antonio b) reach into his
pocket for Medicare and supplemental coverage or c) suffer.
</P>
<P>
   He chose b, but questions why he or any other military retiree
should. The government promised medical care for life, after all.
When is a deal not a deal?
</P>
<P>
   Levinson entered the military in March 1942, four months after
Pearl Harbor. He mustered out in 1946, having served as a Navy
radio operator and gunner. After the war, he joined the Army
National Guard in Illinois and got a commission. He was called up
for service in Korea and decided to make the military a career.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, Levinson commanded an aviation company that never
lacked for excitement during the early stages of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   A magazine article of the period described one night in
Levinson's life: ``. . . Somewhere below the major's (helicopter)
the Viet Cong first regiment was silently closing in on Soc Trang
airfield, the vital American base in the Mekong Delta . . . (its)
aircraft all sitting duck targets for VC mortars if the guerrillas
crept close enough to attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lose Soc Trang and there was a good chance the entire Mekong
Delta would fall to the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Levinson) had already made up his mind that there was only
one way to locate the VC guerrillas in the darkness below and that
was to use his own helicopter as bait.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what he did and survived to tell the tale. Just
another day at the office.
</P>
<P>
   His warrior days are long gone, but Levinson, 76, and others
like him _ an estimated 1.4 million military retirees are in the
country today _ have seen their access to health care shrink even
as their need for it grows.
</P>
<P>
   He signed up with a grass-roots movement to push for legislation
to give military retirees the same kind of health benefits civilian
federal employees and members of Congress collect.
</P>
<P>
   There is legislation that would do that, but members of
Congress, including U.S. Sen. Trent Lott, R-Mississippi, balk at
the price tag, maybe $40 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson, a congenial soul with a good-natured and quick wit,
notes with a chuckle that the potential costs go down daily as
World War II and Korean War veterans fall into the final formation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they stall long enough, some of us won't be around to
collect,'' Levinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Levinson and his comrades in arms kept their end of the
deal with the nation. It's time for the government to keep its end
of the deal with those from whom much was asked.

&HT;     VICTIMS OF ABUSE GET NEW CONFIDENCE WITH 911-CELL PHONES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ She had left her husband after suffering years
of violent abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband had threatened to kill her and she was on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was charged with assault, he was free on bail and
she was terrified to leave her new apartment in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after a month, authorities convinced the woman it was
safe to go outside. A cellular phone programmed to call 911, given
to her by authorities, did the trick.
</P>
<P>
   It also convinced the San Francisco district attorney's office
that other victims of abuse and stalking might be helped by cell
phones.
</P>
<P>
   This week the district attorney teamed up with Cellmania.com, a
Mountain View, Calif.-based online wireless commerce site, to lend
phones with 911 service to victims of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Cellmania.com, donated 30 phones to District Attorney Terence
Hallinan's Victim Services unit. The company plans to donate 30
more later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to call 911 anytime, anywhere is important to a
person who feels their life is in danger,'' said Hallinan.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Alexander, assistant director of victim/witness programs
for the district attorney's office, said that was made clear in the
case of the woman who was on the run from her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was her first step toward rebuilding her life,'' Alexander
said.
</P>
<P>
   The cell phones provided by Cellmania.com are used, ones that
have been turned in by Cellmania customers to upgrade to newer,
flashier models. Customers can get a $25 rebate by donating their
old phones. The company is encouraging people to use that credit to
support the service for crime victims.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Peterson, spokeswoman for Cellmania.com, said the company
chose San Francisco because it has an influential and strong
domestic violence prevention program, which serves about 2,400
victims each year.
</P>
<P>
   The new phone service, in a way, also fulfills a campaign
promise made by Hallinan last fall. During the political campaign,
challenger Bill Fazio advocated a personal alarm system to be worn
by women in danger of being abused. During debates he often
challenged Hallinan to adopt the program immediately. Hallinan
conceded that the idea had merit.
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan said the phone service goes further.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alarm only works near your home. With these cell phones,
you can go anywhere,'' Hallinan said. ``These woman, who have
already suffered so much, can finally feel safe.''

REPUBLICANS PREPARE TO ANOINT BUSH AS CONVENTION ENTERS ITS FINAL
DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated by 9 p.m. EDT with a story
by R.W. Apple Jr.) 
 &HT;     
 By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Republicans opened the final day of their
national convention Thursday, preparing to make Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas their presidential nominee and relishing the fight that he
has already started with his democratic rival, Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush officially became the party's nominee during Wednesday
night's roll call vote, when delegates from Wyoming _ the home
state of his running mate, Dick Cheney _ cast votes that put him
over the 1,034 convention votes needed for a majority. But the big
balloon-dropping celebration will come Thursday night when the last
of the 2,066 delegate votes will be delivered from the floor of the
First Union Center by the Texas delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening will be a defining moment in Bush's political
career. He and his speechwriter have been working for weeks on the
acceptance speech the governor will deliver before a nationwide
audience, albeit one that is likely smaller than in past
presidential elections. The campaign hopes the remarks will signal
to the nation that Bush is a different kind of conservative who has
transformed his party to appeal to groups that are not
traditionally receptive to the Republicans' message.
</P>
<P>
   It is also likely that Bush will devote a good portion of his
speech to critiquing the Clinton-Gore team. His spokeswoman, Karen
P. Hughes, has said that Bush will lament the current
administration's failure to accomplish critical tasks.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to his arrival here Wednesday, Bush
became increasingly aggressive in his criticism of Gore and of
President Bill Clinton. Bush's running mate, Cheney, turned up the
volume even more on Wednesday night in his acceptance speech,
bringing thunderous applause from the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all a little weary of the Clinton-Gore routine,''
Cheney told cheering Republicans. ``But the wheel has turned.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney tried to turn the vice president's own words against him.
Appropriating Gore's 1992 campaign slogan as his own, Cheney said,
``It is time for them to go!''
</P>
<P>
   While the attacks on the Clinton-Gore administration are popular
with the Republican rank and file, the Texas governor is also
trying to persuade independent voters, who in the last two
elections embraced the centrist position to which Clinton has moved
the Democratic Party, that Bush has transformed his party. But Bush
must also be careful not to alienate the conservatives who are the
Republicans' bedrock.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the opening days of the convention were devoted to
projecting a centrist image, with issues like immigration and
education dominating a stage filled with racially diverse speakers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many previous conventions, candidates in hard-fought
congressional races _ like Rep. Rick Lazio of New York, who is
battling Hillary Rodham Clinton for a Senate seat from New York _
were kept out of the spotlight. So too were many elements of the
Republicans' battles with President Clinton over the last six
years. Issues like family values, abortion rights and the culture
wars were not showcased.
</P>
<P>
   Bush used the week leading up to the convention to pacify
conservative delegates. He allowed a plank opposing all abortion
rights to stand and chose a conservative running mate with a voting
record to match.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A good portion of the news in Philadelphia has happened outside
the convention hall. Former President Gerald Ford was hospitalized
on Wednesday after suffering what physicians say was a minor
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Police also arrested hundreds of protesters after they blocked
traffic and held dozens of loosely coordinated demonstrations. But
the protests have been largely non-violent and nowhere near the
magnitude that city officials and convention organizers feared.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Much feistiness has occurred on the convention stage, and it has
come from Republican leaders raining blows on the Democrats.
Wednesday night, the Republicans showed their knuckles.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Senate majority leader, used
his nominating speech for Cheney to deliver pointed criticism of
congressional Democrats opposed to tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But that was just a prelude to the main event of the evening,
when Cheney opened his speech by praising Bush for reaching out to
Democrats and governing in a bipartisan manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush doesn't accept old lights of argument and
division,'' Cheney said. ``He brings people together, reaching
across party lines to do the party's business.''
</P>
<P>
   But after condemning partisan bitterness and strife, Cheney
himself launched into a lengthy attack on Gore and Clinton. He
criticized the current administration for ``legalisms and carefully
worded denials,'' and for ``spreading fear and panic'' and
``dividing generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviving a criticism first made by former Sen. Bill Bradley,
Gore's rival in the primaries earlier this year, Cheney portrayed
Gore as a man who would make ``a thousand promises, a thousand
attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney also criticized the Clinton administration for failing to
reform Social Security, improve the nation's schools or maintain
the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We offer another way, a better way, and a stiff dose of
truth,'' Cheney said. &QL;

 &HT;    (The following ``separate buy'' article is available from the
New York Times Syndicate. Please contact syndicate sales
representative DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    While America was focused on the Republican Convention this week
in Philadelphia, Billy Graham, 81, attracted 10,000 evangelists to
a conference in Amsterdam.
 &HT;    Sadly, Graham was unable to attend the first week's events due
to the discovery of a buildup of fluid on his brain. It was hoped
he would be able to attend the final session on Sunday at least by
satellite hookup, so he can ''pass the torch'' of evangelism on to
a new generation.
 &HT;    However, Graham was ably represented by his son, Franklin
Graham, a daughter, Anne Graham Lotz, plus such notables as
evangelist Luis Palau, Anglican Archbishop George Carey, and by
Ravi Zacharias, the Indian-born Christian evangelist.
 &HT;    Zacharias, interestingly, challenges the ''tolerance'' of our
culture, which embraces everything from Eastern mysticism to New
Age spirituality, with the uncompromising conviction that Jesus is
the only way.
 &HT;    Speaking at an opening plenary session in Amsterdam, Zacharias
said, ''Religions from the East have come flooding in. Ideas like,
`Discover the God that is in you,' or reincarnation, or meditation
upon a mantra or a chant of another deity have gradually taken on a
huge following'' at the very time that western culture ''has
evicted Christianity as a dominant factor.''
 &HT;    ''The result, I fear, may well be the pointed question whether
Jesus Christ is indeed unique, or is He just one among many ways?'
 &HT;    Four days after Zacharias spoke, George Barna released a new
poll reporting that more than 100 million U.S. adults ''are stumped
as to the meaning and purpose of their life.'' Yet a substantial
majority describe themselves as ''deeply spiritual.''
 &HT;    How can people call themselves deeply spiritual while being
stumped on the meaning or purpose of life?
 &HT;    Zacharias identified some sources of dramatic change. First is
the ''dominance of the visual.... The camera controls the
imagination of young minds.'' True. The new generation does not
read newspapers, for example.
 &HT;    ''The increasing power of a youth-dominated world,'' is another
sign of the time. ''How are cultures that have cherished the past
going to cope with a generation which lives only for the moment?''
 &HT;    Another is ''the bold face of atheism'' seen on university
campuses where many even deny that good and evil exist.
 &HT;    Zacharias summed up these trends to the young evangelists in one
sentence: ''How do you reach a generation that hears with its eyes
and thinks with its feelings?''
 &HT;    First, ''We cannot just speak the Gospel. We will have to embody
the Gospel,'' as did the Belgian missionary Joseph Damien, who
ministered to lepers. One day Father Damien spilled hot water on
his foot and did not feel it. He changed his sermon opening from
''My fellow believers'' to ''My fellow lepers.''
 &HT;    Second, we need a ''proclamation that is not merely argued but
felt.'' Clergy who have to read their sermons to me are speaking
from the head, not the heart.
 &HT;    Finally, Zacharias suggests rescuing not only the ends of the
Gospel, but also the means. Find language that communicates with
power. He notes the way poet Alexander Pope described Jesus'
miracle of Cana turning water into wine, ''The conscious water saw
its Master and blushed.''
 &HT;    In his latest book, ``Jesus Among Other Gods,'' Zacharias
compares Buddha and Mohammed, who merely taught, with Jesus, who
''did not only teach or expound his message. He was identical with
His message.''
 &HT;    ''He did not just proclaim the truth. He said, `I am the truth.'
He did not just show a way. He said `I am the way.''
 &HT;    Zacharias argues, ''All religions are not the same. All
religions do not point to God.''
 &HT;    In an interview from Singapore, Zacharias elaborated: ''Buddhism
at its core is non-theist or atheist. It gives you a way of life
that gives you the retention of your autonomy, your own
sovereignty. Hinduism teaches that every life is a moral repayment
of the previous life, and in the next life you could be mothered by
a boar or a donkey.''
 &HT;    By contrast, Christianity teaches ''We are not in need merely of
a superior ethic, we are in need of a transformed heart and will
that seeks to do the will of God.''
 &HT;

<P>
   When Richard Fosler arrived for his Friday afternoon appointment
cradling a sore elbow, his doctor immediately requested an X-ray.
He then sent the results to a specialist for confirmation. Three
business days later, Fosler logged onto the Internet and got his
final answer.
</P>
<P>
   He clicked open a file called ``review radiology results,''
spotted the words ``no evidence of fracture'' and was pleased. But
while he was perusing his medical records online, he discovered a
mistake: An ankle X-ray listed his age as 49.
</P>
<P>
   ``I immediately e-mailed my doctor with a correction,'' said
Fosler, 44, an electrical engineer.
</P>
<P>
   In a new program designed to give patients more control _ one
that worries some doctors _ the CareGroup hospital and doctors
network soon will roll out one of the country's first interactive
Internet medical-records Web sites to as many as 1,000 doctors and
700,000 patients. More than 500 patients, including Fosler, and 30
physicians have spent the summer testing the new site.
</P>
<P>
   PatientSite has the potential to propel the patient empowerment
movement far beyond researching medical conditions on the Web and
commiserating in chat rooms. It theoretically takes away the
doctor's power to decide what the patient should and shouldn't know
and makes the patient an equal partner in his treatment. Patients
can read their medical records, comment on them, review test
results, and search their doctors' schedules for openings.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Ives, a CareGroup doctor in Lexington, Mass. who has
signed up 100 patients, called it a departure from old-fashioned
paternalistic medicine where the physician has all the control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major thing this system will do is build trust,'' said
Ives, one of the most outspoken PatientSite supporters. ``Patients
think doctors are not telling them everything or they're not doing
a test because the insurance company won't let them. Mostly
patients are worried we're not telling them the full story.''
</P>
<P>
   But already PatientSite is rankling more than a few doctors, who
worry about alarming patients with information they don't
understand and allowing them to type their symptoms and maladies
into their medical record without an official medical opinion. And,
they don't necessarily want Mrs. Smith to know they've blocked out
a vacation day when they could be tending to her aching ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a lot of resistance in a lot of
quarters,'' said Dr. Daniel Sands, clinical director of electronic
patient records and communication at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center in Boston and a PatientSite tester. ``Doctors are already
overwhelmed, and they want to know if this is going to increase
their workload.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, he said, CareGroup leaders have struck a compromise by
letting doctors decide which PatientSite features to switch on or
off. While Sands applauds the overall concept, he does not give his
patients access to his schedule, or to the portion of their record
called the ``problem list,'' which is his roster of their medical
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use that to remind myself of issues that are going on with
the person,'' Sands said. ``If I think depression or alcoholism is
a problem and they're not ready to deal with it or discuss it yet,
then it's not helpful for them to see that in the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Ives, on the other hand, has turned on all of the PatientSite
components, and said he's willing to post his ``physician notes'' _
one portion of patients' medical records not yet included on
PatientSite. ``If you can't say it to the patient or the judge,
then you shouldn't be saying it,'' he said. As for his schedule,
Ives said, ``It all comes back to trust. I trust my patients to
realize that I have a life.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said some of their initial worries have been addressed:
The site, for which patients need a password, is more secure than
sending e-mail over the commercial Internet; test results are
posted after a 24-hour delay, so doctors can call patients first
with bad news; CareGroup has decided not to put up complicated
biopsy results; and patients enter new allergies or problems in a
separate file, letting the doctor decide whether to add the
information to the permanent record.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will send us notes saying, `While I was (at the beach)
this weekend I stepped on a rusty nail and I got a tetanus shot at
the ER,'' said Dr. Steven Flier, chief executive of Affiliated
Physicians Group, a CareGroup doctors network. ``If they waited
until their next appointment, they might forget.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sands said he does not like the function allowing patients
to add to their record any new medications they're taking. The site
does not automatically notify them of dangerous drug interactions;
they have to click a box labeled ``Drug Interactions _ Step 1.''
Some interactions may not be siginificant, such as mild nausea, and
Sands does not want to alarm patients unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies and hospitals across the country are racing
to develop medical records that patients can view securely over the
Internet. But the industry is young and most programs are still in
the testing phase. Cydney Kislin, an analyst with Tucker Anthony in
New York, said she knows of only one company _ MedicaLogic _ whose
product allows patients to add to their medical record. CareGroup,
she said, is on the cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so early,'' she said. ``A lot of the hospital
organizations are very interested in the Internet; they just don't
know what to do with it. The number one problem with electronic
medical records is that physicians are slow to adopt new technology
_ especially when they think it will disrupt their work flow.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 survey by the American Medical Association found that
while 47 percent of doctors use the Internet, they rarely employ it
to e-mail patients or access electronic medical records.
</P>
<P>
   CareGroup's chief medical information officer, Dr. John Halamka,
a former emergency room physician, created the hospital network's
PatientSite technology, which cost $250,000 to develop and
implement. CareGroup's flagship hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center, which is striving for a financial turnaround this
year, has a reputation for providing patients with the comforting
extras, and hopes PatientSite will give it a competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, patients seem to love it.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ellen Pierce, 51, had an MRI for a back injury last Sunday.
The results were posted on PatientSite by Tuesday. Since she didn't
receive a phone call from her physician, Flier, she assumed nothing
was seriously wrong. But by seeing the MRIS report firsthand, she
could be sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a nagging doubt in your mind that maybe
everything's not OK and your results just got lost in the
shuffle,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Kress, 70, regularly reviews all of his test results,
including his cholesterol numbers for the past five years, which
makes him feel good about his progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who want to deny all kinds of issues, health
issues particularly. This site is not for those people,'' he said.
``It's for people who don't want to hide from the facts so they can
aggressively help themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Fosler said the system is ``awesome'' but he worries about what
will happen when more patients have access. He asked, ``Will my
doctor have time to screen this day in and day out and still be
able to see his patients?''
</P>
<P>
   Flier said doctors will adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty years ago, they were saying the telephone would be an
intrusion on health care,'' he said.

THE ANTIDOTE TO E-SNOOPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week I offered a half-hearted defense of the FBI's
notorious Carnivore program, the one that can scan millions of
e-mail messages in pursuit of terrorists, dope dealers, and sellers
of illegal cable TV boxes. It seems to me that the technology isn't
that dangerous if it's hedged about with strong legal safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   And one other thing _ Carnivore won't work. All the e-mail
snooping in the world will be of little value against bad guys who
encrypt their messages. The Feds may be able to read the addresses,
which must be sent in the clear. But use a good crypto program and
everything else in the message is just a blur of seemingly random
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, computers can eventually decipher the messages _ in a
few million years per message, using your typical supercomputer.
And even if some genius in the basement of the National Security
Agency has found a way to decode each message in, say, a week, he'd
still be overwhelmed by the sheer number of messages he'd have to
crack.
</P>
<P>
   It makes you wonder why the FBI even bothered to develop
Carnivore, until you ask yourself whether you encrypt your own
e-mail. Here's a good Baptist bet for you: If 50 readers of this
column can prove to me that they use e-mail encryption, I'll slip
an extra $50 into the collection plate next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It's been several years since I tried an early version of Pretty
Good Privacy, one of the first e-mail scramblers. With its talk of
hash algorithms, passphrases, public and private keys, it made my
brain hurt. Dr. Evil himself would probably be repulsed by the
complexity of the process. For a law-abiding sort like me, it
wasn't worth the bother.
</P>
<P>
   But it needn't be this way. Web browsers come with sophisticated
encryption software built right in. It kicks in automatically when
you use your credit card to buy something online. This same
encryption engine can be applied to your e-mail by obtaining a
``digital certificate,'' basically a set of keys that let you send
and receive scrambled messages. Standard e-mail programs like
Microsoft Outlook and Netscape Communicator let you plug in these
certificates and use them with ease.
</P>
<P>
   Most people haven't known about this feature, or they aren't
willing to pay the minimum of $14.95 a year charged by Verisign
Inc., the best known dealer in digital certificates. But in the
grand tradition of the Internet, somebody thinks he can give away
the certificates and make it up in volume. WildID (www.wildid.com)
passes out free certificates good for 30 days, and sends you an
e-mail when it's time to renew. The company hopes to make money by
attracting millions of users to its site and bombarding them with
ads.
</P>
<P>
   The WildID system requires you to fiddle with some browser
settings that most folks never touch, but in only a couple of
minutes I was sending secret messages _ with nobody to send them
to. Just as in the days of Pretty Good Privacy, WildID sends
encrypted messages only to other WildID users. That's fine if you
send messages only to fellow members of the Soprano crime family.
But your notes to others remain insecure.
</P>
<P>
   Another secure mail service called ZixMail (www.zixmail.com)
offers a handy backup. ZixMail runs inside its own client software,
instead of the e-mail program you normally use. Also, it's not as
easy to set up as WildID.
</P>
<P>
   But ZixMail has a clever feature that lets you send secure
e-mails to people who don't use the product. What they get is an
unencrypted e-mail that contains a link to a Web page where the
message is waiting. When the recipient clicks the link, the Web
page uses the browser's standard encryption system to download,
decode, and display the message. It's pretty slick.
</P>
<P>
   It's still not quite slick enough. Most of us will keep on
sending our e-mails in the clear. But if the government is ever
caught abusing its e-snooping technology, ZixMail and WildID will
have all the business they can handle. And the FBI's poor old
Carnivore will starve to death.

<P>
   ROCKLAND, Mass. _ Marc Johnson wants to make one thing perfectly
clear: ``I am not here to help people. I am here for the birds.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a former potter married to a cancer researcher, is in
the throes of a winged love affair that has brought him more than
150 avian roommates: macaws, cockatoos, Amazons, conures and a
dozen other kinds of parrots.
</P>
<P>
   His house and barn, located near town center, is home to Foster
Parrots Ltd., a non-profit sanctuary that takes in abandoned
parrots and offers some for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   But after taking birds in seemingly almost every week, Johnson's
home has become a crowded, parrot boarding house with birds perched
on cages, branches and ropes throughout the house.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with great joy that Johnson greeted Paula Foster on
July 5. The hapless parrot owner from Marshfield handed Johnson her
two blue-crown conures and the key to his wildest dream: enough
land to build a rainforest pavilion and other specialty aviaries
for his family of African, South American, Pacific, and Australian
parrots.
</P>
<P>
   It would become New England's largest parrot attraction that is
not part of a zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Foster and her husband plan to donate to Foster Parrots about
five acres of a 40-acre Marshfield property they inherited from a
relative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we would donate some land for something, so I told
(Johnson) that we don't need it all and he could have a little,''
said Foster, 33, a advocate for children at a Marshfield shelter.
``So many animal shelters take in cats and dogs, but pet birds are
overlooked. I feel like I am giving back.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be a while though before Johnson's flock enjoys a little
more wing room.
</P>
<P>
   For the next few months, the acreage is tied up in land court.
Then there are zoning and other licenses needed from the town. Not
to mention the $3.5 million Johnson says he needs to raise for a
world-class sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it's getting crowded at 35 Vernon St.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 parrots have arrived since January alone, 16 of which
Johnson has adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 46, doesn't make the situation any easier. Despite
insisting he's full up, he rarely says no to guilt-ridden parrot
owners who come to him bedeviled by their inability to care for the
wild, loud, and ultra-sensitive birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really want to impress upon people the emotional
requirements of these birds,'' said Johnson, adding that he knows
of about 20 other individuals and groups nationwide that rescue
abandoned parrots. ``Leaving a little parakeet alone in a cage to
look out a window is a sad scenario. We don't feel parrots should
be pets. They are wild animals.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson said 60 million parrots are kept as pets in the
United States, making them the second most popular American pet.
Cats are number one. He said he does not breed his parrots.
</P>
<P>
   Parrot owners and lovers apparently like what Johnson is doing
and many send his organization unsolicited monthly checks from as
far away as Alaska. He received $22,000 in donations last year and
expects $30,000 this year, including $10,000 from a computer
company.
</P>
<P>
   To raise the large sum he needs to build the sanctuary, Johnson
will have to be more aggressive about seeking donations. He said he
hopes to attract corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   For now, five cockatoos and one Amazon named Mexico Pete live in
Johnson's former breakfast room. The old barn, attached to the
breakfast room, is filled with more than 100 parrots, some in cages
and others flying free or snuggled next to their partners on
perchs.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's place is noisy _ it sounds like a rain forest _ and
hectic. Tending to them means sweet talk and cuddles, John Denver
and opera, fresh fruit and nuts, and three weekly dinners:
Spaghetti, sweet potatoes, and a rice-and-vegetable medley. He
gives some birds the nectars or pollens they would normally seek
out in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his parrots were severely neglected by former owners and
plucked themselves bald in despair. A macaw named Floyd, who had
four homes in one year, hates women because his previous female
owner threw shoes at him to shut him up when he squawked.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of volunteers, including Tufts Veterinary
School students, come by Johnson's home every day to help clean and
feed the birds. Given the size and the flight freedom of this bird
population, the place is downright clean and odor-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``These animals are like people. They go insane in solitary
confinement,'' said Laura Lafay, a law student and parakeet owner
who comes by weekly to talk and play with the parrots.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs in the barn, Johnson has built eight 10-foot-high
flight cages that hold some of the more incorrigible macaws, ones
he won't put up for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Wally, Johnson's first parrot. Wally bit the
flesh clean off Johnson's nose two years ago (it was sewn back on)
and a week later sliced his lip.
</P>
<P>
   But despite that Johnson understands what Wally and many of his
other birds have endured. That's why, few would-be owners get to
adopt his birds. If they do, they have to agree to visits by
Johnson during a two-year probation period. Johnson will take the
birds back if he gets even a whiff of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ``As pets, birds seem a neat, tidy package with their cages and
their plastic toys,'' he said. ``But the reality is they are not
pets and we are denying them their lives.''

FOR SOME STUDENTS, CO-OP PROGRAM ISN'T DOING THE JOB 
</HEADLINE>

   BOSTON _ Some marketing majors fold shirts at clothing stores. A
student studying psychology hands out towels at the university gym.
And political science majors often pass months photocopying and
faxing at law firms.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the past century, Northeastern University has been a
national pioneer in blending college studies with work. The goal
was to help provide the mainly working-class students an income.
</P>
<P>
   But today, when a typical $10-an-hour job barely dents the
annual $20,000 in tuition, Northeastern has begun selling students
on the idea that the work is part of their education.
</P>
<P>
   Promotional brochures trumpet Northeastern's
cooperative-education program as on-the-job training that ``focuses
on preparing students for the real-world challenges of professional
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   However, for many students, the new cooperative education still
translates into the grind of menial labor _ and they don't like it.
</P>
<P>
   Students interested in law complain they rarely get the chance
to help prepare cases. Journalism students working at newspapers,
including about 50 every year at the Globe, say they tend to answer
the phones, instead of writing stories. And some criminal justice
students gripe that their training consists of little more than
staring at TV cameras on the graveyard shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a 100-year-old program. It's not going to
change overnight,'' said Northeastern's president Richard M.
Freeland, who's leading the effort to revamp the co-op program as
``practice-oriented education.'' ``This is very much a work in
progress. We're trying to reinvent the program. So, I think you'll
find a lot of unevenness throughout.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Freeland sparked a stir of dissent with a memo
heralding significant changes in the co-op program. In light of the
increasing competition and the declining value of students holding
clerical jobs, he called on the university to strengthen links
between the classroom and the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   With the rise of the new economy, liberal arts students seeking
computer-oriented jobs, and nearly 1,500 colleges around the
country offering a version of Northeastern's co-op program,
Freeland said it is vital that the university distinguish itself.
The niche it carves out, he says, must better bind academic theory
and practice.
</P>
<P>
   The lofty rhetoric led Northeastern to lengthen the time of a
typical co-op student's work from three months to six months,
station co-op coordinators at their respective academic departments
instead of in a central building, and create new surveys and
Internet-based feedback forums to ensure the quality of students'
work experiences as linked to the classroom. The changes stress
more of an academic connection.
</P>
<P>
   The new tack, however, was challenged by many of the
university's 50 co-op coordinators. They say students should have
more opportunities to explore different jobs, and students' work
should be just that, work, not a stress-free internship.
</P>
<P>
   They want to ensure the co-op experiences are legitimate work
experiences, not controlled academic environment. They fear that
stressing more of an academic connection will reduce the quality of
the work experience. the academic work
</P>
<P>
   The dean overseeing the co-op program, Robert Tillman, resigned
over the president's changes and coordinators sent trustees letters
and studies criticizing the plans. Tillman and others lambasted the
scattering of coordinators, warned that the co-op program's unique,
century-old attributes would be lost, and worried about an employer
backlash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's turning us into an internship program,'' said
Kathleen Finn, an associate professor and nursing co-op faculty
coordinator, claiming she and others have had their jobs threatened
because of their complaints. ``I think it's a travesty. His plans
are going to destroy the co-op program.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many students want more quality control and say they feel
they have been misled by Northeastern's promotional literature,
which conveyed the impression they would do serious work.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Eric Ewing's experience. The 21-year-old political
science major spent the majority of one co-op job answering phones,
clipping newspaper articles, and mailing out form letters from
Senator Edward M. Kennedy's office.
</P>
<P>
   In another job at Northeastern's Education Technology Center,
Ewing had little supervision and few responsibilities. Most days he
had little else to do but scour the Internet for a diversion. ``I'm
a little let down,'' he said. ``I was definitely hoping my creative
abilities would be harnessed more. But I think it's a fairly common
feeling for liberal arts students.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Switalski, 20, a psychology major, spends most of her time
as a teacher's helper at the Montessori Educare School in Newton.
The Northeastern student does everything from prepare toddlers'
lunches to accompany them on long walks around a nearby lake. But
as in her previous co-op job, she says she feels hemmed in,
restricted in what she can do and learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I interviewed, they didn't even care about my
experience,'' she said. ``They just wanted to know when I could
start. What I would like is more decision-making power. There's
only so much you can learn in some positions.''
</P>
<P>
   While many students complain they are not getting the training
they hoped for, other students, especially those studying business
and engineering, often land lucrative and interesting co-op jobs. A
survey of this year's graduates found nearly all would recommend a
co-op-based education to a friend. Frequently the jobs do more than
bolster a student's resume: 50 percent of all students receive job
offers from their co-op employers, according to Northeastern.
</P>
<P>
   Further, some students, coordinators, and employers argue that
the work environment and a student's initiative is as important to
the learning experience as the work.
</P>
<P>
   After six months at PaineWebber Inc., Annie Nam, 20, a finance
major, got what she wanted out of her co-op experience, even if it
wasn't what she hoped for. While much of her job included
administrative work, such as answering phones, she learned a lot
about the mutual-fund business, she says.
</P>
<P>
   But just sitting in the office every day, Nam learned something
even more important: ``What made it such a good experience,'' she
said, ``is that I figured out it wasn't what I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the main perks of the co-op program, students and
coordinators emphasize, is it allows for error. Students get a
chance to weed out a prospective career before plunging into it
after school.
</P>
<P>
   But the opportunity to try out different jobs will be
increasingly limited as Northeastern pushes to lengthen the term of
co-op jobs. By 2003, when the university switches from a quarter
system to a semester system, the average number of co-op jobs per
student will drop from seven to three, university officials say.
</P>
<P>
   That only makes it more important for Northeastern to live up to
its promise of providing students quality, hands-on training, says
Richard Porter, the university's acting vice president of
cooperative education.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a co-op is not contributing to a student's overall growth,
we need to be doing better,'' he said. ``We need more feedback, and
we are planning to get it. If the work is going well with the
employer, we should know that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Administrators know not all students will be satisfied, and
experienced seniors will often have better jobs than inexperienced
sophomores. But they say they're up against a culture that for too
long has settled for middling jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Like many co-op employers, Pheroza N. Madon, the head of
Newton's Montessori Educare school, says the best way for young
people to learn is by starting at the bottom and mastering rote,
mundane tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Co-ops are young, naive, and they have a lot to learn,'' she
said. ``Many haven't ever worked before. They should start off at
the lowest level. But that doesn't mean they can't learn. Nothing
is . . . boring, as long as you have an open mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, many students who come to Northeastern arrive with higher
expectations. If they wanted to start at the bottom, collecting
faxes or folding shirts, they may have gone to another school, they
say.
</P>
<P>
   During a break in freshman orientation recently, incoming
students and their parents said they have high hopes for the co-op
program. Mollie Bisesi, for instance, said she is coming to
Northeastern for one reason: She wants to know for sure whether to
pursue a career in forensics. Bisesi, 18, of Buffalo, N.Y., could
have gone to Michigan State, the University of Delaware, or Boston
University, but only Northeastern promised legitimate job
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Although she's aware students can get stuck with menial jobs,
Bisesi's confident she won't get a raw deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't stand for being anyone's little helper,'' she said.
``I want to do real work, work that will help me prepare for my
career.''

SEIZED PHILIPPINE PRIEST STRUGGLES TO TURN THE OTHER CHEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   LAMITAN, Philippines _ This is the story of a priest who was
kidnapped by Muslim rebels and nearly martyred for his faith, and
who cannot forgive those who trespassed against him.
</P>
<P>
   He struggles with his assigned mission to serve the poor and the
weak, and his adopted role as the spiritual leader of an army of
self-proclaimed, modern-day Crusaders.
</P>
<P>
   He wields the Gospel, but has an M-16 assault rifle ready if he
needs it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ready to die'' for the Roman Catholic Church, Rev. Cirilo
Nacorda said solemnly, his soft, boyish features clouded by a
thousand memories of his capture six years ago, and by as many
demons he has battled since. ``I am ready to be killed _ but I'm
bringing firearms with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nacorda, 43, says he needs an M-16 and a .45-caliber handgun
``not for abuse, but for protection'' from the Muslim rebels who
abducted him and well over 100 other Christians over the past
several years. ``I'm also willing to kill if they have the
intention of killing me or Christians whom I serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Nacorda's former captors are the group that seized 21 people
from a Malaysian resort in late April, and are still holding most
of them on the southern Philippine island of Jolo, 50 miles south
of here. A breakaway faction of Muslim separatists, the Abu Sayyaf,
which once had a clear Islamic agenda, now is more interested in
ransom than in greater rights for Muslims, experts on the rebellion
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should be angry only at the Abu Sayyaf, but it seemed I was
angry at all Muslims. . . . I wanted revenge,'' Nacorda said. ``It
took me years to realize that Muslims are innocent and Abu Sayyaf
is a small group trying to divide us. Now I am able to focus my
hate on that group only. Hate is a bad word to use, but I have to
admit it.''
</P>
<P>
   With each new hostage crisis or massacre attributed to the Abu
Sayyaf, the Christians who represent one-third of this tiny island
of 295,000 people feel more embattled. The priest, to the dismay of
the local bishop and to the glee of a military that has failed to
wipe out the Abu Sayyaf, has become the inspiration for armed
Christians who want their justice against those they see as Muslim
troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
   Here on Basilan Island, Christian militias with ominous names
such as ``Chop-Chop'' and ``Dark World'' have joined to form the
Coalition of New Christians for Empowerment and Reform. CONCERN
claims 3,000 members, 4,000 unregistered fellow travelers, 1,000
financial backers _ and the man they call the ``warrior-priest'' as
their spiritual adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Nacorda admitted to having joined two posses that have searched
for ``known criminals,'' but added quickly, ``God did not allow me
to kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Basilan's Bishop Romulo de la Cruz is appalled by Nacorda's ties
to the vigilantes, and fears militias are using the priest to gain
the seal of the church. ``Father Nacorda is not a warrior-priest,
and we are not into the Crusades,'' he said. ``He told me he wanted
to guide them so they will not take the law into their own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not at all clear, however, that the armed and angry
militants would listen even if their mascot-priest told them to
desist.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslims ``want to finish off the Christians,'' said Andy
Anoos, an irascible municipal councillor and member of CONCERN who
says he has led dozens of ambushes on Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Vigilante groups have existed here for almost 30 years, since
the start of a Muslim insurgency that has claimed 100,000 to
200,000 lives in the southern Philippines. Muslims make up 4
percent of the national population, but are a majority on some
islands such as Basilan.
</P>
<P>
   Some community members worry that Nacorda's ties to the militias
could provoke lawless elements to target his parish. Others, such
as municipal councillor Peter Eisma, say the priest's involvement
is to ``promote peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Nacorda's ordeal began on June 8, 1994, with a scene that has
repeated itself many times since, when armed men stopped a convoy
of vehicles. The rebels separated out the Muslims and let them go.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen Christians _ drivers, laborers and others too poor to
pay ransom _ were shot, and half were beheaded. The remainder _
Nacorda and 21 teachers _ were marched for 12 hours to a jungle
hideout. His wrists and ankles were chained so he couldn't escape.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers were released five days later, after the government
forked over a $7,700 ``board and lodging'' fee. But the group held
onto Nacorda.
</P>
<P>
   He said his captors threatened to chop off his head, cut him to
pieces, or shoot him in the back when he stood to urinate. The
rebel commander used him for target practice, hurling knives at his
sides. ``Sometimes I would close my eyes and say, `Just kill me,'
'' Nacorda recalled, his face stiffening.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that Islam was a peace-loving religion. They forced
him to wear a Muslim cleric's cap, jeering at his humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   He cried twice in captivity, once when their camp was bombarded
by marines and he was sure he would die. ``I was praying, `Lord,
protect the soldiers, help them in their rescue operation.' But
after three hours, I saw many soldiers scattered and killed, and I
said, `Lord, you are not listening, you are helping these bad guys.
What kind of a God are you?' I was shouting and crying, and for
three weeks, I stopped praying to the Lord,'' although he continued
to pray to the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   The second time, he repented and cried for forgiveness. The same
day, they ambushed again, and Nacorda felt a force stronger than
nature pushing him to the ground. All around him, Abu Sayyaf rebels
were shot down. ``I don't know if you believe in miracles, but
bullets fell without hitting me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After 61 days and a payment, Nacorda was released, and he
insisted on returning to his parish.
</P>
<P>
   Nacorda had begun life here in Lamitan, a backwater town that
even today has no telephone service. He battled his origins, his
family, and the color of his skin to fulfill his dream of being a
priest, and he wasn't about to give up after his rebel ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   It took two months to persuade the bishop to let him stay. ``I
had told my parishoners to be strong, to have faith in the face of
Abu Sayyaf's rise. After that, how could I leave them? A priest
should lead the people, not run away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But neither could he run from the phantoms of his captors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially after my release, but even now, whenever there is a
massacre or kidnapping, I cannot understand my own feelings,''
Nacorda confided in a halting voice. ``Sometimes I would say to my
parish, even during my homily, `If this is a war situation, let's
give them some of their own medicine.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Among themselves, parishioners wondered, ``What's happened to
Father Nacorda? He's always angry now.'' They hired a psychiatrist
to counsel him twice, and he poured out his emotions, but mostly he
could only shout and cry. He has been counseled a half-dozen times,
but nothing has made him whole. Last year in Manila, he saw a
psychiatrist, ``but I just cried for three hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Nacorda recently invited Muslim community leaders to his parish
and said he is trying to build a harmonious interfaith
relationship. ``But it's not easy to dialogue when you are
unarmed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop has tried for years to persuade Nacorda to take time
off to recuperate and get some perspective. ``We want him to be
healed,'' de la Cruz said.
</P>
<P>
   With every attack on Christians, wounds open anew for Nacorda. A
fellow Basilan priest, Rev. Rhoel Gallardo, 33, was kidnapped a few
months ago by Abu Sayyaf and killed in an encounter with the
military. ``Each time something happens, it triggers my anger,''
Nacorda said. ``I would really like to undergo healing, but I
cannot afford to be away from my parish.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Cruz disagrees. ``Nobody is indispensable in Basilan.
Perhaps he'll have a different perspective when he comes back.
Basilan will still be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly six years to the day since his release, Nacorda admits
that his inner struggle between shepherding his flock and healing
his soul continues. ``Even though I am broken, wounded, I can be
useful. . . . But when I am alone in my room, alone in a silent
place, that is when I struggle to control myself.''

ROGUE TO RICHES: AN 18TH-CENTURY ACCOUNT

MILLIONAIRE 
The Philanderer, Gambler, and Duelist Who Invented Modern Finance 
By Janet Gleeson 
Simon &AMP; Schuster, 303 pp., $24 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Law had the misfortune to be born 300 years too early. Had
he lived in our time, he would have been celebrated as a visionary
and an entrepreneur. He would have been on the cover of Time
Magazine, along with Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   In early 18th-century France, Law specialized in coming up with
new enterprises _ first a national bank, then the Mississippi
Company, a speculative venture that invested in colonizing America.
For a brief time Law's company captivated France and set off a
stock-market boom that made lots of people rich.
</P>
<P>
   But just as quickly the boom turned to bust as it became clear
the Mississippi Company's claims were mostly hype. Alas for Law,
the Parisians of his day were not as tolerant of money-losing firms
as we are today. They tried to hang Law and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Vive la difference.
</P>
<P>
   Law's life is the subject of ``Millionaire,'' a generally lively
biography by Janet Gleeson. The subtitle of the book lets you know
you are dealing with an interesting character. Law, in fact, liked
to gamble, dated lots of women, and killed a rival in a duel. And
he was interested in financial innovation, especially in banking.
</P>
<P>
   The European economies of Law's day all suffered from the same
problem: too little money. The amount of money in circulation
depended on finding new gold and silver. If new supplies were not
forthcoming, economic activity was constrained. Law and others saw
the solution in paper money, which could be backed by gold and
silver. If people would accept paper _ a big ``if'' in that era _
the supply of money could expand dramatically, and so could the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   A Scot by birth, Law couldn't sell his scheme in his home
country. He had better luck in France, where he fled after his
duel. In 1716 he started the Banque Generale, which later became
the Banque Royale, the official government bank. Letting the
government take over the bank was Law's first big mistake. The
government had a great temptation to print too much money, which
over time was bound to erode confidence in the bank and in paper
money in general.
</P>
<P>
   Law's second big mistake was selling shares in the Mississippi
Company, a government plan to develop the Louisiana territory. ``No
one knew what riches lay beneath its soil or within its forest,''
writes Gleeson of Louisiana, ``but it was whispered that this new
Eldorado was copiously endowed with seams of gold and silver with
emerald mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   Substitute ``e-commerce'' for ``gold and silver'' and you get
some idea how excited investors became. The mere promises of riches
triggered an incredible bull market in Mississippi shares.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels to today are striking. Ordinary people were drawn
into the stock market. Law's coachman made so much money he quit
his job and hired his own coachman. The money earned in the market
led to a huge run-up in real estate prices and a boom in luxury
goods. Elegant cafes opened up where the newly rich could drink
fancy coffee ``while their brokers made them rich.'' How do you say
Starbucks in French?
</P>
<P>
   Information didn't travel as fast 300 years ago as it does
today, but eventually news filtered back from the New World that
the Louisiana colony was a loser. Investors lost confidence in Law,
shares prices plunged, and things turned ugly. Law barely escaped
from France with his life and spent his final years in exile. Along
the way he invested in art, including works by Titian, Raphael, and
Michelangelo. Clearly the man had a knack for being ahead of his
time.
</P>
<P>
   Gleeson's account of Law's life loses energy once the stock
market bubble bursts. The author is also never able to explain
convincingly how a smart guy like Law could make such disastrous
errors. Still, Law's story illustrates the timeless appeal of
investing and the hope, usually unrealized, that the new thing will
make us all rich. As the French say, ``Plus ca change . . .''

`VEINY' WOOD, A SPIRAL GARDEN, AND A PLAGUE OF YELLOWISH STAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A little here and a little there on a lazy summer afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a question from J. Murman of Moline, Ill.:
</P>
<P>
   ``I painted my new wainscoting that the carpenter said was
somewhat `veiny.' When painted twice, the veins showed through. The
paneling is not smooth. Would more paint help or must the paneling
be sanded?''
</P>
<P>
   I think your wainscoting is oak, and oak is an open-pored wood.
So is mahogany, and walnut, but most wainscoting sold today is oak.
There are no open-pored softwoods that I know of.
</P>
<P>
   Those ``veins'' are the pores. When painted, the pores will
appear as little pockmarks or shallow streaks, no matter how many
coats of paint are applied. The paint simply will not fill them,
and the finish as a result is not smooth.
</P>
<P>
   There is a cure, and it does not involve heavy sanding. To get
the finish smooth, fill the pores with a paste wood filler. It is
not the same as wood filler used to fill nail holes. It is more
runny than paste, and can be painted on the surface. Paint it
against the grain, let it set for a few minutes, rub the filler
into the pores against the grain with a rough cloth; then rub
lightly with the grain.
</P>
<P>
   Filling the pores is best done on bare wood, but I think it can
be done on a painted surface as well. After drying overnight, sand
the finish smooth.
</P>
<P>
   If the filler does not stay in the painted pores, then the
wainscoting must, indeed, be sanded before filling.
</P>
<P>
   When you repaint, use a latex primer-sealer before applying the
finish coats.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A spiral garden
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to innovating in the garden, you can't beat Bill
Downey, who made the most of a huge maple tree in his front yard.
</P>
<P>
   His yard is pretty well full of the usual things that grow in
summer.
</P>
<P>
   But Downey, 64, looked at the venerable maple and decided to
improve on it. Improving on a noble maple is quite an
accomplishment, but Downey did it.
</P>
<P>
   He bought two dozen square plastic flower pots, filled them with
annuals, and tacked them on the tree in a spiral, sort of like a
corkscrew, twisting up the tree higher than he could reach. A few
small nails or screws driven into a large maple tree will not hurt
it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great way of showing annuals: petunias, impatiens,
geraniums, and other plants that bloom brightly all summer, before
and after perennials have faded.
</P>
<P>
   When neighbors saw what Downey had done, they said, ``Call the
Globe!''
</P>
<P>
   He did, and the rest is history, with Downey's grandchildren
getting their picture in the paper.

   Those yellow stains
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Yellow stains. They're a plague on white vinyl kitchen floors,
it seems. The handyman gets many questions asking what they are,
what causes them, and most important, how to get rid of them.
</P>
<P>
   They are chemical stains, caused by water, and seem to hit only
white vinyl floors, although other colored floors may get them but
they are less visible.
</P>
<P>
   They cannot be removed, but can be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what Armstrong, maker of vinyl flooring, sent to the
handyman:
</P>
<P>
   ``Armstrong's vinyl floors have been formulated to be very stain
resistant to most reagents and traffic. Certain compounds added to
rubber can discolor a vinyl floor when in contact with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``These compounds, referred to as antioxidants, are formulated
into rubber material to extend the life of the rubber and prevent
brittleness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some antioxidants react chemically with ingredients
(plasticizers) in flexible vinyl to produce a yellowish stain. This
is referred to in the vinyl industry as `antioxidant staining.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Any source of rubber containing these antioxidants in contact
with the floor could produce this staining. Certain types of rubber
mats, rubber-backed rugs and rubber wheels on carts can cause this
discoloration.
</P>
<P>
   ``To avoid this problem, insure that the mats and wheels which
will be in contact with vinyl floors are of the `non-staining' type
of rubber.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   While water does not cause the stains, water is often associated
with them because rubber mats on the vinyl (the real cause of the
stain) often get water trapped under them.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Republicans opened the final day of their
national convention Thursday, preparing to make Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas their presidential nominee and relishing the fight that he
has already started with his democratic rival, Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush officially became the party's nominee during Wednesday
night's roll call vote, when delegates from Wyoming _ the home
state of his running mate, Dick Cheney _ cast votes that put him
over the 1,034 convention votes needed for a majority. But the big
balloon-dropping celebration will come Thursday night when the last
of the 2,066 delegate votes will be delivered from the floor of the
First Union Center by the Texas delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening will be a defining moment in Bush's political
career. He and his speechwriter have been working for weeks on the
acceptance speech the governor will deliver before a nationwide
audience, albeit one that is likely smaller than in past
presidential elections. The campaign hopes the remarks will signal
to the nation that Bush is a different kind of conservative who has
transformed his party to appeal to groups that are not
traditionally receptive to the Republicans' message.
</P>
<P>
   It is also likely that Bush will devote a good portion of his
speech to critiquing the Clinton-Gore team. His spokeswoman, Karen
P. Hughes, has said that Bush will lament the current
administration's failure to accomplish critical tasks.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to his arrival here Wednesday, Bush
became increasingly aggressive in his criticism of Gore and of
President Bill Clinton. Bush's running mate, Cheney, turned up the
volume even more on Wednesday night in his acceptance speech,
bringing thunderous applause from the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all a little weary of the Clinton-Gore routine,''
Cheney told cheering Republicans. ``But the wheel has turned.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney tried to turn the vice president's own words against him.
Appropriating Gore's 1992 campaign slogan as his own, Cheney said,
``It is time for them to go!''
</P>
<P>
   While the attacks on the Clinton-Gore administration are popular
with the Republican rank and file, the Texas governor is also
trying to persuade independent voters, who in the last two
elections embraced the centrist position to which Clinton has moved
the Democratic Party, that Bush has transformed his party. But Bush
must also be careful not to alienate the conservatives who are the
Republicans' bedrock.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the opening days of the convention were devoted to
projecting a centrist image, with issues like immigration and
education dominating a stage filled with racially diverse speakers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many previous conventions, candidates in hard-fought
congressional races _ like Rep. Rick Lazio of New York, who is
battling Hillary Rodham Clinton for a Senate seat from New York _
were kept out of the spotlight. So too were many elements of the
Republicans' battles with President Clinton over the last six
years. Issues like family values, abortion rights and the culture
wars were not showcased.
</P>
<P>
   Bush used the week leading up to the convention to pacify
conservative delegates. He allowed a plank opposing all abortion
rights to stand and chose a conservative running mate with a voting
record to match.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A good portion of the news in Philadelphia has happened outside
the convention hall. Former President Gerald Ford was hospitalized
on Wednesday after suffering what physicians say was a minor
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Police also arrested hundreds of protesters after they blocked
traffic and held dozens of loosely coordinated demonstrations. But
the protests have been largely non-violent and nowhere near the
magnitude that city officials and convention organizers feared.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Much feistiness has occurred on the convention stage, and it has
come from Republican leaders raining blows on the Democrats.
Wednesday night, the Republicans showed their knuckles.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Senate majority leader, used
his nominating speech for Cheney to deliver pointed criticism of
congressional Democrats opposed to tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But that was just a prelude to the main event of the evening,
when Cheney opened his speech by praising Bush for reaching out to
Democrats and governing in a bipartisan manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush doesn't accept old lines of argument and
division,'' Cheney said. ``He brings people together, reaching
across party lines to do the party's business.''
</P>
<P>
   But after condemning partisan bitterness and strife, Cheney
himself launched into a lengthy attack on Gore and Clinton. He
criticized the current administration for ``legalisms and carefully
worded denials,'' and for ``spreading fear and panic'' and
``dividing generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviving a criticism first made by former Sen. Bill Bradley,
Gore's rival in the primaries earlier this year, Cheney portrayed
Gore as a man who would make ``a thousand promises, a thousand
attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney also criticized the Clinton administration for failing to
reform Social Security, improve the nation's schools or maintain
the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We offer another way, a better way, and a stiff dose of
truth,'' Cheney said. &QL;

FORD'S FOCUS FILLS A NICHE, BUT ITS SEATS COME UP EMPTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, let's talk about the biggest flaw in the Ford Focus and
get right to the bottom: the front seats.
</P>
<P>
   They are just too uncomfortable. When I drove the
top-of-the-line 2000 Focus ZTS in October of last year, I noted
that the seats were ``a bit soft'' but also said they were
comfortable. What was I thinking?
</P>
<P>
   I got the soft part right, but this time, in the 2000 Focus ZX3,
the base model, they proved not only soft, but too restrictive,
even pinching, up the back, and tiring on a long trip.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has done everything else with this car in such a superb
manner, here's hoping they broaden the seat backs and give better
thigh support in the future. But enough grumping.
</P>
<P>
   It is refreshing to see an American auto manufacturer step
effectively into the fray to sell in a market _ small, inexpensive
cars _ that American manufacturers have either virtually given up
on or competed poorly in of late.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors' Ron Zarella, the company's North American
president, acknowledged that GM has essentially lost the market to
Koreans. And certainly, this has been a niche dominated by Asian
manufacturers: Toyota Echo, Honda Civic, Nissan Sentra, Daewoo
Nubira, Hyundai Elantra, Kia Sophia. Dodge jumped in with the Neon,
and Ford has entered with great fanfare and acceptance with the
Focus.
</P>
<P>
   And they've done it obviously understanding that small and
inexpensive doesn't have to mean cheap, dangerous, or underpowered
anymore. Four-cylinder engines with 16 valves can crank out plenty
of power. Air bags, child-safety-seat tethers, and spaciousness can
be part of any small car.
</P>
<P>
   The Focus, which can be purchased from $12,000 to $16,000, is
offered as a three-door coupe (the ZX3 of this review), four-door
sedan, and five-door wagon. Two engines, both inline fours, are
offered, one that produces about 110 horsepower, the other 130.
Interestingly, the more powerful 2.0-liter, 16-valve Zetec is
standard in the ZX3, the entry-level car. Four-speed automatic and
five-speed manual transmissions are available, and I'm a fan of the
manual. It makes this front-wheel-drive car more fun.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier test of the top-of-the-line ZTS showed it to be so
roomy it had a van-like feel, from the high roof to the huge
windshield and the hood that dropped away so quickly you could not
see it from the driver's seat. Ford, with its ``New Edge'' styling
has gone distinctly European with the Focus and that trait may be
most noticeable in the ZX3, which struck me as a bigger, crisper
version of the Volkswagen Golf.
</P>
<P>
   The New Edge program is meant to appeal to younger drivers and,
given their need to carry gear _ skis, boards, camping equipment,
the ``three-door'' _ OK, let's say hatchback like in the old days _
may be the most appealing model. The trunk is cavernous and with a
tall roofline can be piled high, especially if you fold down the
60/40 split rear seat. You could sleep back there waiting for a
morning assault on the barricades at the next Phish concert.
</P>
<P>
   Dashboard ergonomics are modern _ an airplane-cockpit feel to
the tilt-to-the-driver presentation of audio and climate controls,
while all instrumentation is behind the wheel, with the tachometer
and speedometer at center, and the fuel and temperature gauges at
opposite ends of this instrument oval.
</P>
<P>
   There is good storage space in front-door slots _ though the car
could use a between-seats bin up front _ and the glove compartment
is big, as well.
</P>
<P>
   While the 135-horsepower engine has plenty of zip, it is aided
by the fact that Ford kept this car light. Both engines have
aluminum cylinder heads, pistons, and oil pan. The three-door
weighs just over 2,500 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   It gives you a graceful and quiet ride, cruising smoothly at 55
while turning just over 2,000 rpms and hitting 3,000 only when
passing at 75. This effortless power let the Focus get just under
28 miles per gallon in mixed highway and country driving.
</P>
<P>
   In designing the ``ride'' for the Focus, Ford tried to find a
middle ground behind hard and soft.
</P>
<P>
   You may have seen the commercial: a group of Gen-Y'ers, all with
some sort of drink in hand, is in a Focus as it cruises toward a
railroad crossing. ``Dude!'' each of the passengers says in warning
that the driver ought to slow down so that no drinks will be
spilled. ``Dooooooood!'' they cry in happy unison when the car,
still at speed, romps smoothly over the tracks without a drop of
spillage.
</P>
<P>
   Effective _ though not as daring as a commercial I remember from
a ``Saturday Night Live'' skit in which a circumcision was
performed in the back seat of a bouncing auto _ but what does a
ride so soft really mean?
</P>
<P>
   It means you get a certain floatiness, particularly in the
steering, on the highway and a softness in cornering. Straight
ahead, the ride is wonderful. However, given that Ford is aiming
this car at younger _ and presumably somewhat more aggressive _
drivers, they ought to tighten it up a bit for some in-corner
handling.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be hard to tweak, with a front suspension that
includes struts, coil springs, dampers and antiroll bar, and a
fully independent rear setup with damper units and antiroll bars.
</P>
<P>
   They also ought to go with disc brakes all around.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, this is a great debut of a new model for Ford and I am
sure you will spot Focuses on college campuses all over America
this year. To help lure young buyers, Ford offers options for the
active lifestyle _ bicycle racks, backpacks that hang over the
backs of the front seats, switchable seat covers. And while a fine
car for the young, the Focus would be a good buy for older drivers
looking for that get-around-town car.
</P>
<P>
   Now if only they'd improve those front seats.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The child-safety-seat tethers at the tops of the seat. They
show somebody was thinking about who would be buying this car.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --Antilock brakes are a $400 option. They ought to be standard
on every car built today, and if that means the base price has to
be $400 higher, so be it. Safety should not be an option.

 THE 1958 DUAL-GHIA WAS A CONCEPT AS LOFTY AS ITS FINS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are cruisin' through the rolling southwest Vermont
countryside like a land shark: sleek nose, fins raking the air like
razors.
</P>
<P>
   I've got both hands on a steering wheel that seems as big as the
wheel on a sailboat and the car's suspension lets it float enough
up front that you feel that you might, indeed, be making your way
over the water.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but we've also got a 329-hemi _ two four-barreled carbs and
400 horsepower _ under the hood. And we've got history on our side.
That's because we're behind the wheel of a Dual-Ghia 400, a one-off
prototype built for the 1958 New York Auto Show.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen this car before and now, at an invitational
drive-and-ride at Hemmings Motor News headquarters in Bennington,
Vt., and thanks to the trust and generosity of this rare car's
owner, I'm behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   That owner is Fred Kanter, who with brother Dan founded Kanter
Auto Parts, a major supplier of restoration parts for collector
cars. Fred Kanter was 13 when the car caught his eye at the auto
show. In 1977, three hours after he heard its owner had put it up
for sale, he bought it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it basks in unretouched original glory. The thick coat of
Italian paint that covers its Ghia body is cracked like enamel in
places, but original. The roof, patched here and there, is original
as well. Everything about the car remains as built by Dual Motors
of Detroit more than four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Its wedge shape was developed in a wind tunnel _ a first for its
day. Beneath its Italian-designer skin lurks a 1957 Chrysler 300C,
kin to the hottest cars of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The inside, chrome and leather _ even the door handles are woven
leather straps _ is part art deco, part fine Italian furniture.
It's three-speed Torqueflite automatic transmission is operated by
five rectangular buttons at the center of the dash. There is no
parking gear. To start the Dual-Ghia, you turn the key, then push
the ``Neutral'' button.
</P>
<P>
   You get a throaty, basso rumble that veritably roars when you
stomp the gas on the highway. You get a ride right out of the past
and, should you choose, you get Percy Faith and His Orchestra
playing from ``Romantic Moods'' on the 16 2/3-r.p.m. record player
built into the dash. You get a top speed of 140 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, you get to drive a piece of history, a car far ahead
of its time, whose shape, style, and power have been found in cars
down the decades ever since.
</P>
<P>
   But driving pieces out of history is what this annual Hemmings
event for automotive journalists, choice collectors, and others
with industry connections is all about, and here are some other
notables available for them to play with:
</P>
<P>
   --Besides the Dual-Ghia, my favorite was a 1946 Ford Super
DeLuxe station wagon. You'd recognize it immediately as a
``Woody.'' What you might not recognize it as is an early SUV. Sits
high, has huge legroom, headroom, three bench seats, plenty of
cargo space. The lingering throwback is the presence of two
ashtrays built into the dash _ back from the days when even doctors
told us in ads that cigarettes were good for us. A predictor of
things to come in SUVs is the gas mileage: 12-15 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   --In fact, driving old cars shows you how far we have come in
gas-mileage figures. Most six- and eight-cylinder cars from back
then got between 10 and 20 miles per gallon. The 1957 Ford Custom
V8, the 1940 Buick Century, and the Hudson Terraplane delivery
sedan all got 10-13. By 1958 you had a Volvo PV 445 that delivered
a whopping 15-20 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   --And of further interest at the Hemmings ride-and-drive: a 1973
Volvo P1800ES 2(plus)2. Always looked like an interesting sports
car to me. Drives like a truck. A 1934 Ford Tow Truck _ 90
horsepower V-8 engine, $600 new, about $175 extra for the
hand-cranked crane at the rear. And a 1930 Ford ``Doodlebug'' _ a
Sears, Roebuck creation with a ladder frame, 40-horsepower engine,
open cockpit, and gear-driven (as in gears at each end of the rear
axle transferring power to gears that line the inside of the rear
wheels). Talk about low-range torque.

RAUNCHY LYRICS REQUIRE REAL CONVERSATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost everywhere Deirdre Houtmeyers goes these days, she brings
along a portable CD player, thrusts the headset at friends, and
fast-forwards to a rap song called ``Kim.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she watches her friends' horrified expressions.
</P>
<P>
   Houtmeyers is definitely into this for the shock value, but not
in the way you might think. A mother of two who lives in Belmont,
Mass., she hopes listening to the lyrics of rapper Eminem will be a
wake-up call to other parents, just as it was for her a few weeks
ago when her 15-year-old nephew handed her a headset and said,
``You need to know what your kids are listening to.'' He was
worried. He had heard 11-year-old Nick hum an Eminem song.
</P>
<P>
   When Ryan played ``Kim'' for her, Houtmeyers recalls, ``I could
feel the blood draining from my face. It frightened me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim'' is one of the cuts on Eminem's most recent,
much-publicized, top-selling album, ``The Marshall Mathers LP.''
It's a story of a husband who puts his baby to bed, then kidnaps
and murders his wife. The track contains words that are unprintable
here and vivid sound effects (gurgling as he cuts Kim's throat).
Eminem is a Grammy-winning white rapper from Detroit whose real
name is Marshall Mathers and whose wife is Kim. Their stormy
relationship, including her suicide attempt last month, has been
entertainment news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants their kids listening to this? Not me,'' Houtmeyers
says.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if Eminem is the first or only songwriter to glorify
violence and profanity. As Globe colleague Renee Graham wrote
earlier this summer, there's a long tradition in music of
blood-drenched lyrics. Still, parents like Houtmeyers and teenagers
like her nephew are wise to be concerned.
</P>
<P>
   When Houtmeyers asked her son, Nick, about the music, his answer
was typical: ``It's only a song, Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of answer worries sociologist Gail Dines, an associate
professor at Wheelock College. ``If it doesn't get a rise from a
child, it means they don't even see there's a problem,'' she says.
``That's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   She blames the nonchalance on our culture: ``It's so awash with
violence that children learn from an early age to accept it as
normal: not a big deal, just a song, just a video.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not so much that one song or one video can trigger a young
person to aberrant behavior, although that does sometimes happen,
says popular culture researcher Michael Marsden of Eastern Kentucky
University. ``The bigger issue,'' he says, ``is that children see
violence as an acceptable solution to problems in general because
that's the message they get over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   This has particularly serious implications for women, says
Houtmeyers. As a nurse and cochairwoman of the Domestic Violence
Taskforce at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Brighton, Mass., she
works with women who have absorbed the message that abounds in rap
lyrics: ``I'm not worth much. I deserve it if my boyfriend/husband
whacks me around.'' The message men get, she says, is that it's OK
to beat up a woman who displeases them for any reason, from
cheating to folding the laundry wrong.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Kim' is a blueprint for domestic violence,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents have a hard time believing the media have such a
powerful influence. They do, but they don't have to, Dines says.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for instance, the developmental need teenagers have to
separate from their parents. ``It's something they're hard-wired to
do,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-cultural studies show they aren't hard-wired to separate
rebelliously, however. We've come to accept that the two go hand in
hand, says Dines, ``because the media in this country takes the
need to separate and shapes it into rebellion through consumer fads
like body piercing, tatooing, and rap.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes this more worrisome than in previous generations is
the level of violence. ``To get kids to buy your product, you have
to be more and more outrageous, which today translates to more and
more violent,'' Dines says.
</P>

<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once teens understand the connections between the media,
consumerism, and real-life violence, they tend to become more
critical as consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are usually appalled and insulted. They don't like being
manipulated,'' says Jeff O'Brien, director of Northeastern
University's Mentors in Violence Prevention Program. Funded by the
state Department of Public Health, the free program is in 20 high
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what O'Brien does is help teenagers deconstruct cultural
messages and get them talking about the issues so they don't
automatically buy into them. Marsden says this kind of media
literacy is undervalued and underutilized in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most neglected part of kids' education,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Social historian Joe Boskin of Boston University, who studies
the connection between values and violence, wishes schools would
make these connections for kids in fifth and sixth grade. In fact,
he wishes they'd start this fall with ``Kim.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Kim'' is not yet being played on Boston-area stations
because it hasn't been released as a single, ``you know kids even
this young are hearing this song. If not this one, then other ones
just as bad. It's part of their social currency,'' says Boskin.
Indeed, he sees a danger in not talking about it: ``In the absence
of discussion, we leave them to their peers' interpretation, which
accepts messages at face value.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Parents' dilemma
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Giving them our spin presents a different problem.
</P>
<P>
   It means we need to listen to music most of us don't like. Even
if we do listen, we can't always understand it, so we either pay no
attention or, like Houtmeyers's sister, Carmel O'Doherty-Popp, we
ban it.
</P>
<P>
   She says, ``After my sister played `Kim' for me, I told my kids,
`I need to know the words you listen to. Since I can't understand
most of the words on the rap stations, no more rap stations.' ''
She has five children, 6 to 19.
</P>
<P>
   For children under 10, family rules about radio stations, like a
no-TV rule on school nights or no PG-13 movie rule, is something
they understand and even welcome. It helps them feel parents are
keeping them safe.
</P>
<P>
   With children over 10, censorship is problematic. ``They see you
as the parent who is not cool and doesn't understand,'' says Dines.
It also makes what you ban more appealing.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, however, it doesn't give them tools to make
informed decisions. Marsden tells parents, ``This is a chance to
reinforce your values, to put the media messages in a context that
says clearly, `This is not normal behavior.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Raising the issue
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to do that:
</P>
<P>
   --Don't pay for music whose values you don't like: ``I can't
stop you from using your own money, but I don't want my money to
support this musician or his message, and here's why.''
</P>
<P>
   --Initiate conversations. About ``Kim,'' for instance: ``What do
you think of what he says? How does it make you feel to hear women
called derogatory names? Have you ever been mad enough to want to
hit a teacher or parent? Did you? Why/why not?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What you want to get to,'' says O'Brien, ``is that acting in a
violent way is a choice we don't have to make.''
</P>
<P>
   He frequently begins classroom conversation by asking, ``If you
saw a guy pushing a girl against a locker, what would you
think/do?'' When teens say it's none of their business, he talks
about how we learn behaviors that are antisocial.
</P>
<P>
   Some teens may be defensive if you talk about a rapper they
like. ``Don't let that stop you,'' says Dines.
</P>
<P>
   Her theory is that many children are walking around with low
levels of post-traumatic stress syndrome. ``The view they have
developed of the world is that it's a dangerous, violent place,''
she says. ``They are secretly reassured to hear what you have to
say, even if they don't tell you so.''
</P>
<P>
   Few teens will be won over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't even expect that,'' says Marsden. ``Your goal is to get
them to think about the issues you raise.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One mother's goal
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houtmeyers's goal is to get an 800 number so parents can hear
``Kim'' and other lyrics without putting money into rappers' or CD
producers' pockets. (Speaking of producers, Eminem's label,
Interscope Records, did not return calls.) She also intends to be
more attentive and involved with her sons about media issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a parent, a woman, and a human being, I cannot not react to
this,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Suggestions for parents &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Other rappers to be wary of for their violent and offensive
lyrics include Juvenile, DMX, Jay-Z, Wu Tang Clan, and Sisqo,
according to Jeff O'Brien of Northeastern Unviversity.
</P>
<P>
   --It's not enough to have one or two conversations with your
kids about the values popular culture presents. To make a
difference, dialogues need to happen frequently.
</P>
<P>
   --Be explicit with both sons and daughters: ``This song can
subconsciously make a woman think she deserves to have a man treat
her badly/a man think it's OK to treat a woman badly. I want to
make sure you know that's never true.''
</P>
<P>
   --The leading cause of injury in the United States to women age
15 to 44 is men hitting them, according to the National Coalition
against Domestic Violence.

<P>
   Even though William Moran is an administrative law judge at the
US Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, he would rather
have fresh sheets in his hotel room every day than reuse them to
conserve water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that since I'm with the EPA I should say that I want to
conserve water, but I like clean sheets and a freshly-made bed,``
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moran, 50, was in Boston recently for a two-day business meeting
and stayed at the Copley Square Hotel, which offers guests the
option of reusing towels and sheets during their stay at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to save money and to preserve the environment, many
hotels are asking guests to reuse their towels and sheets.
</P>
<P>
   It's a practice that has become commonplace in Europe and Asia.
Now US hotels are placing cards on doors and bedside tables urging
guests, ``Please reuse the towels.'' They tell guests to leave
towels on the floor if they want new ones or to hang them back up
if they want to reuse them.
</P>
<P>
   At the Boston Park Plaza Hotel, customers move a card from the
nightstand to their pillow if they don't want their sheets changed,
said Christopher Vicalora, the hotel's manager. The hotel
automatically changes every person's linen after the third day, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Moran had the option of recycling his linens, he said
he would not participate in the program. ``If I go out late and
come home and don't have the chance to take a shower, I want new
sheets the next day,`` he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-nine hotels in New England participate in linen reuse
programs, said Patricia Skozelas, marketing representative for
Project Planet, a Georgia-based provider of environmental products
for the hospitality industry. The company's clients include Bass
Hotels &AMP; Resorts, the owner of Holiday Inn hotels, and Choice
Hotels, which owns Comfort Inn.
</P>
<P>
   An average-sized hotel with 150 rooms and 66 percent guest
participation can save about $32,000 a year by implementing a
linen- and towel-reuse program, said Skozelas. Savings come not
only from reducing water use, but also from reducing linen
purchases and the labor cost of doing laundry, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hotels are always looking to save money,'' said Arthur Canter,
executive director of the Massachusetts Lodging Association, the
industry's trade association.
</P>
<P>
   Many hotels contract with companies like Project Planet and the
``Green'' Hotels Association, a Houston-based, for-profit
organization promoting ecological consciousness, to supply the
cards requesting reuse of linen and towels. Hotels are afraid ``it
can come off as being cheap'' if the hotel apprears to initiate the
request, said Patricia Griffin, president of the ``Green'' Hotels
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The savings far outweigh the cost of buying the cards: Project
Planet sells a pack of 100 cards for $60.
</P>
<P>
   The water conservation benefits are significant. Project Planet
estimates that 72 million gallons of water would be saved if 11,000
hotels out of the 45,000 hotels in the United States participated
in a linen-reuse programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a crazy thing to demand fresh sheets and towels
everyday,' said Griffin. ``No one does that at home.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 40 percent of hotels with 250 rooms or more
participated in the program, according to the American Hotel &AMP;
Motel Association in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a wonderful response from guests,'' said Tedd
Saunders, executive vice president of the Saunders Hotel Group,
which includes the Lennox Hotel and the Copley Square Hotel in
Boston. The hotel group has had a linen-reuse program in place
since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders, also president of EcoLogical Solutions, a Boston-based
consulting firm to hotels, says that 40 percent of guests staying
at his hotels reuse their towels.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Green'' Hotels Association, which provides response cards
for guests staying at member hotels, says that business travelers
are most enthusiastic about recycling their towels.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Mars, a computer trainer for CompuMasters in Kansas,
travels on business twice a month and said he does not mind using
the same towel and sheets for more than a day.
</P>
<P>
   Mars, who originally thought that hotels were using the program
to save money, now hangs his towel back on the rack, signaling to
the hotel not to wash it. Although Mars said he did not notice the
linen reuse signs during his recent two-day stay at the Boston Park
Plaza Hotel, he said he has seen them at other hotels and always
participates in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the hotel changes the sheets in between guests,
that is the important thing,`` he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Park Plaza Hotel has found that older guests prefer
to have their towels cleaned every day, while younger guests reuse
their towels, said Vicalora.
</P>
<P>
   Some hotels, like the Lenox and Copley Square hotels, have
implemented other enviromental programs, including
``climate-neutral rooms,'' which use renewable energy so that none
of the rooms have a negative impact on global warming, Saunders
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some hotels remain concerned about how guests will perceive the
quality of service if the hotel participates in the reuse program.
</P>
<P>
   The Harborside Hyatt in Boston cleans all three sheets on every
bed so that customers ``always sleep on clean bedding,'' said David
Martin, general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Although the hotel has won the Massachusetts Lodging Award for
recycling and energy conservation, the hotel has never considered a
linen-reuse program, Martin said. Because an average guest stays
1.1 nights, a reuse program would have very little water and cost
savings, he said.

VERIZON WORKERS SEEK SURVIVAL IN THE WIRELESS AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The differences between the two sides couldn't be starker.
</P>
<P>
   On one side is the old-line Bell Atlantic telephone company,
whose workers are unionized; on the other side is the new and
quickly expanding Verizon Wireless unit, whose employees are
nonunion and have less job security.
</P>
<P>
   At issue: the old economy workers want to unionize their new
economy counterparts. Verizon Communications, formerly Bell
Atlantic, says no.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 85,000 telephone workers on the East Coast are threatening
a walkout at 12:01 a.m. Sunday that, for both sides, underscores
concerns about survival in the wireless age.
</P>
<P>
   A strike by members of both the Communications Workers of
America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
could cripple services to some 25 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   A central sticking issue is the labor groups' demand for the
right to voluntarily unionize the company's rapidly growing
wireless unit without interference from management. Currently, only
45 of the unit's 30,000 employees are union members.
</P>
<P>
   The unions also want higher wages, pension changes, and job
security for all workers, but the push to unionize Verizon Wireless
is, perhaps, the most critical matter on the table, say analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for wireless telephones has made the unit one of the
fastest growing divisions at Verizon, and it has fueled concerns
that such explosive growth will lead to increased hiring of
lower-paid, nonunion employees and a corresponding push to shed
traditional, old-line telephone workers.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, in a walkout that focused largely on Bell
Atlantic's use of nonunion contractors and on who would fill jobs
created by new technologies such as the Internet, more than 70,000
telephone service representatives struck. Though the 2 1/2-day
strike granted some concessions to workers, it excluded employees
in cellular and wireless services from the contract.
</P>
<P>
   CWA represents 72,000 telephone workers. IBEW represents 13,000.
Of that 85,000, about 15,000 work in the New England region. Of
Verizon's total work force of 260,000, about 120,000 are local
phone company employees.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a push to gain a foothold in the rapidly expanding
wireless market, CWA President Morton Bahr says failure to secure a
satisfactory contract, including language permitting expedited
union elections or a voluntary card check agreement, could result
in a strike. Under voluntary card checks, companies agree to
recognize a union as the bargaining agent for their workers if a
majority of employees sign union cards.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say Verizon likely will oppose any attempts to
unionize employees at its wireless unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, what we are seeing with the unions and the company
is a transition from the old economy to the new economy or
marketplace within the telephone industry,'' said Atlanta analyst
Jeffrey Kagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company, in order to protect its competitive position and
subsequently its shareholder values, is going to fight this,'' he
added. ``Its ability to compete relies on having a low-cost
structure, and it can't charge too much for its products. So,
unionization in the wireless sector could be a ball and chain on
the playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   For the unions, the issue is just as critical. Having gained a
toe-hold at a handful of wireless companies, they are fighting to
secure membership in a subsidiary that, by all accounts, is an
industry leader. Unions are hoping a win at Verizon Wireless will
result in a domino effect that will trigger union expansion in the
industry as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fastest-growing area in the industry,'' said
Elaine Bernard, director of the Harvard University Trade Union
Program. ``It is also a life and death issue for the IBEW and the
CWA. If they do not break into these units, they will die, because
the other end of the industry is not growing. So this is not an
issue where either side will back down easily.''
</P>
<P>
   To bolster their argument, the unions point to the erosion of
pay and working conditions as key reasons to organize wireless
service units at Verizon and other leading firms.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three years, the CWA has made a little headway,
organizing about 5,000 wireless workers at SBC Communications. The
wireless division, which includes CellularOne, employs 14,400.
</P>
<P>
   At AT&AMP;T Wireless, meanwhile, the unions have won the right to
use a voluntary card check procedure and began organizing a few
months ago. If a majority of workers sign cards, an election can be
held within 10 days and certified by the American Arbitration
Association, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, 120 wireless workers based at an AT&AMP;T West Palm Beach,
Fla., unit have been organized. AT&AMP;T employs 22,000 wireless
workers.
</P>
<P>
   For both unions, there is another key concern: the decline of
union membership. In 1984, the year deregulation forced the breakup
of Bell Telephone, CWA boasted 500,000 members in the telephone
industry alone. Today, it represents 300,000 telephone workers
throughout the United States, a loss both labor leaders and
analysts attribute to automation and technological advancements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want a strike, but we will walk out if we cannot
settle key issues such as the unionization of Verizon Wireless,
increases in pay, job security, and certain pension issues,'' said
CWA spokesman Jeffrey Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that wireless communications and
Internet-related communications are the future growth areas in this
industry,'' he added. ``We want to give our people the opportunity
to move into these markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller argued that the lower-paid unit eventually could
undermine earnings at other divisions within the company. He said
service representatives at the top of the pay scale in the wireless
unit earn approximately $33,000 per year, $11,000 less than their
unionized colleagues in other divisions.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in an internal memo obtained by The Boston Globe,
Verizon disputed union wage reports that recently appeared in The
New York Times, saying senior service representatives in the
wireless division earn between $23,000 and $47,500, with annual
bonuses tied to job classifications and assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said union service representatives work 37.5 hours, but
Verizon Wireless service representatives work 40 hours per week for
the same pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Verizon Wireless worker has to work 40 hours before he or
she is eligible for overtime,'' he contnued. ``Our people are
guaranteed overtime after 7.5 hours a day. Health care is fully
paid for union workers. Wireless workers get HMO coverage but do
not have plan choice. They pay up to $210 per year toward HMO
coverage for a single person and up to $672 for family coverage.
They also pay for dental care. Our people do not. Plus, wireless
workers have no job security. Our people have protections against
layoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Verizon again disputed the facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bell Atlantic Mobile (now Verizon Wireless) people actually
received 100 percent matching funds in their 401(k) programs for
the past three years,'' the company wrote in the memo. ``The actual
range of annual health-care costs to employees, depending upon the
coverage they elect, is $210 to $924.''
</P>
<P>
   Verizon spokesman Steve Marcus said the firm wants to see a
satisfactory resolution of the issues, but pointed to competition
as a central concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wireless business is really different from our wireline
phone business,'' said Marcus. ``It does not have a history of
union representation. It competes mostly with other companies that
are primarily nonunion. Yes, we are committed to fair compensation,
but we have to be able to compete and succeed in the face of rapid
changes. To do that, we have to offer compensation that is typical
for the work these employees do.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus said the company is continuing to expand its traditional
business, and has added some 3,000 workers, all union members, in
New York, New England, and the mid-Atlantic states. ``That is
tangible proof that this business is dynanmic and it has a great
future for union-represented employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, recent reports of second-quarter earnings at some of the
nation's biggest telecommunications firms suggest the biggest gains
these days are in new technology. AT&AMP;T Wireless Group, for example,
reported $2.5 billion in sales in the second quarter, its first as
a public company. The firm's gains were 32 percent higher than a
year ago. The company also reported a record 532,000 new
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the traditional consumer telephone market is being
battered by losses due to decreased prices, a crowded field of
competitors, and new advances in cellular and Internet phone
services that do not bill consumers for long-distance calls. With
wireless phones gaining popularity, even traditional local
telephone services may be threatened by the trend.
</P>
<P>
   That's what worries the unions. Indeed, nearly two decades after
the first wave of layoffs in manufacturing, telecommunications, and
focused attention on the technology revolution, many unions are
still smarting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past several years, we've seen extensive job loss due
to new technology,'' said CWA's Miller. ``We've also seen the
industry move into these new areas because that's where the growth
is. We know we have to be able to organize those areas so that we
can negotiate good standards and offer our members job mobility.''

`QUEEN OF STEAM' HAS PRESSING NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to a recent survey, Bostonians lead the nation in
ironing curtains, but rank near the bottom for ironing T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   At least one respondent to the poll, conducted by the Rowenta
company, Medford, Mass. maker of $100 German-engineered irons, said
the hood of a car, presumably in a garage, was the pressing surface
of choice. Others ironed on a photo album or, not really
recommended, on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some admitted to ironing nude.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara ``Queen of Steam'' Zagnoni, consumer education director
for Rowenta, takes all this in stride, hoping to spread the gospel
of ironing to those who find it too time-consuming, annoying, or
even destructive toward white shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Zagnoni kicked off a nationwide ironing tour in Boston in late
July, saying the first mistake of the wrinkled masses is buying a
$12 iron with an imprecise thermostat, which causes the appliance
to leak and spit or scorch clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Buy the right iron _ a Rowenta, of course _ and the job would be
so much easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have to go over things more than once, you're working
too hard,'' said Zagnoni, who began ironing at age 12 when her
mother returned to work. ``You need more steam.''
</P>
<P>
   She demonstrated on a blue pinstripe oxford, explaining how a
shirt could and should be ironed in less than five minutes,
especially with a machine like hers that glides with the ease of a
BMW thanks, she said, to all the dimples on the soleplate.
</P>
<P>
   First, start with the back of the collar, placed toward the
narrow end of the ironing board, then move to the yoke and the
cuffs and the sleeves. Next, iron the front, then the back, and
finish with the exposed part of the collar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you iron those other things last, you wrinkle the body
again,'' Zagnoni says.
</P>
<P>
   As for pants, begin by ironing the pocket pouches. The front
crease should approach the waistline. The rear crease should stop
at the ``crotch line.'' Don't just press one side of the slacks.
</P>
<P>
   Pleated skirts? Pin the pleats and iron in sections.
</P>
<P>
   Also, with the right iron, there should be no need for starch,
she says. If you insist, go light on spraying and let the garment
sit for a minute before ironing. Otherwise, one risks having the
starch stick to the iron, leaving those black smudges that can rub
off on clothes. There are cleaners available at hardware stores to
rid irons of the gunk, according to Zagnoni.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the need for her advice, Zagnoni insists ironing is not
a lost art, especially in these days of casual dressing. As proof,
she said Rowenta's sales have more than doubled over the last few
years. (However, the company does not disclose revenue figures.)
</P>

ROLLERS MAY BE BEST WAY TO MOVE SHED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have an 8- by 16-foot shed that I want to move from one
part of the yard to another. Is it feasible to put the shed on
rollers and push it bodily?
</P>
<P>
   LEVON CHORBAGIAN, Billerica, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It sure is, if your property is relatively flat and even, and
you don't have to take the shed under any low branches. It was a
common way of moving small buildings in the olden days before
forklifts and other power machinery. Make sure you have plenty of
huskies along to push and pull, and move the rollers as the shed
makes its way to its destiny. Also, make sure you have a proper
foundation or platform to put the shed on when it gets there.
</P>
<P>
   Getting all those helpers is important, because manpower is
still the most important moving force in the world. Many years ago,
when the handyman was serving in Korea, a large building had to be
moved. The GIs did nothing but stand around trying to figure out
how to do it. But a Korean honcho gathered 200 or so young men,
most of them POWs, who lined up all the way around the building,
grabbed a bottom edge, and at a hoarse ``harrumph'' from the
honcho, lifted it bodily. At another ``harrumph,'' they started to
trot, literally, with this behometh in hand, yelling staccato
``harrumphs'' at every step, ending minutes later at the new
location.
</P>
<P>
   There were no strains, sprains, broken bones, or hernias. It was
a sight to remember.
</P>
<P>
   If moving the whole shed seems too much, or simply can't be
done, you could take the roof off, undo the walls, and carry each
wall to the new site. But remember, those walls are too heavy for
even two huskies to handle. You will need help. It can be done. The
handyman has already done half the same project with his old
toolshed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a fine-looking brass door knocker shaped like a
fireman's helmet. My daughter found it in an antiques store, and
being an ex-fireman, I appreciate it. Someone lacquered it, and for
the life of me I can't get it off. Using Wright's brass polish and
a Dremel brush helps, but it is tedious. Will anything do it
faster?
</P>
<P>
   DICK GILES, Duxbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If it is really lacquer, lacquer thinner will do it, but work
outdoors with the thinner because it is very volatile. Put the
thinner in a container and soak the knocker. Then scrub with fine
steel wool. If it is plastic or varnish, use chemical paint remover
the same way. Once the knocker is polished and installed, let it
tarnish; you will have a good-looking antique brass knocker with no
maintenance. If you really want to coat it again, use a Krylon
clear spray finish.
</P>
<P>
   My door knocker is solid brass and beautifully tarnished, so I
do not have any extra chores to do.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am putting a sheet of 3/8-inch plywood on a door on my
shed, to help reinforce it and make it look a bit better. How can I
paint it to withstand the weather and also look good for some
years?
</P>
<P>
   THOMAS CURRAN, Somerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Use an oil- or latex-based exterior primer, and be sure to
paint all edges as well. Finish with one or two coats of a latex
house or trim paint. It would not hurt to paint the inside of the
door as well.
</P>
<P>
   I think the primer and paint are musts for plywood. If the wood
were solid, you could apply a solid color stain, with no primer
needed, or a semitransparent stain.
</P>

FORGET CASUAL DAY: DRESS WAY, WAY UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when the idea of dressing down had seeped into the far
cubicles of America, dressing up, way up, is the trend for women
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of a cycle,'' says Laura Mandia, spokeswoman for
Bloomingdale's. ``We have gone as far as we are going with the
deconstructed casual look. And now it's fun to look elegant and
luxurious again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ladylike suits are back. So are prissy heels and puny purses,
big belts, fluffy lapel flowers, and gold chains. Fabrics of choice
are boucle, lame, tweed and plaids from Glen to Burberry. And camel
is among the most popular colors.
</P>
<P>
   Animal skins (and prints), especially snake, ostrich, crocodile,
and leather are used for skirts, pants, jackets, and shoes, along
with fur trim, to the chagrin of animal rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing creative or visionary about ripping skin off
animals' backs,'' says RaeLeann Smith, Skins Campaign coordinator
for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
</P>
<P>
   One could argue that there's not much creative or visionary
about any of the fall's fashion trends. Granted, most of it's
pretty. But despite the futuristic ring of 2000, the season's looks
are based almost entirely on the past.
</P>
<P>
   Helmut Lang five years ago was more forward-looking than just
about anything being offered this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there is choice.
</P>
<P>
   It's not all about one designer or one look. You can wear '80s
redux with slanted zippers one day and a blouse with neck bow or
fitted blazer with puffy sleeves the next. Oversize logos appear on
everything from Chanel stockings to Gucci rain hats. Necklines
vary, but the cowl is in.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a `70s influence, some of it disco related (hoop
earrings and shimmery fabrics) and some of it right off the street
(cuff watches and knee-high go-go boots).
</P>
<P>
   You have to reach farther back in the closet of history to
qualify for the vintage look, which is also being pushed this
season through reinterpretations of schoolgirl dresses as well as
original old pieces that can be mixed with new ones. Graphic
swirly-patterned Pucci dresses, new or old, are fashionable too.
Suddenly, 1970 is modern again.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a 1940s tone to ladies' shoes, dominated by T
straps or ankle clasps, feminine edging, perforations, and accents,
such as leather florettes, on the toes. Stockings, in fishnet or
with a simple seam up the back, can be paired with such footwear. A
matching bowling bag _ or any top-handle purse _ completes the
look.
</P>
<P>
   The maxim that skirt lengths reflect the economy should be
refined this year to say that skirt lengths reflect the stock
market. Up, down, all over the place. Anywhere but just above the
knee. Make it much shorter or just a teeny bit longer.
Ankle-skimming skirts are also in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   For casual wear, there are chunky knits, dark denim, and
thin-wale corduroys with a retro feel. Ponchos and funky sneakers
are also back.
</P>
<P>
   To summarize: fluffy, puffy, Pucci, Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alas, there are some of us who are still shopping for summer
things before heading out on vacation but are panic-stricken
because all the goods have been cleared out of the stores to make
room for fall merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   But one Web site, FlipFlopTrunkshow .com sells sandals
year-round to accommodate women from all climates who insist on
open-toe shoes, no matter the temperature.
</P>
<P>
   The site has a large selection, including designers such as
Robert Clegerie, ESPACE, BCBG, Patrick Cox, and Freelance. Prices
range from $6 to $400.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another site, shesheme.com, offers all manner of things to buy
hidden in entertaining expository content, packaged a la ``Bridget
Jones's Diary'' in biweekly columns.
</P>
<P>
   By clicking on the underlined words (shown below in bold), the
shopper is linked to another site (amazon.com in the first instance
below, for example).
</P>
<P>
   A recent column read this way: ``Wednesday, while reading
Getting Over It (by Anna Maxted, a fashion editor), standing up
NAKED, and waiting for my self tanner to dry, I heard a knock at
the door. DREAD. Peering through the peephole, I saw adorable new
neighbor delivering my fly rod ``and fish purse, which was
strategically yet `mistakenly' delivered to his address at 518. It
was my big chance for an introduction . . . but there I was, lubed
up, sort of shiny, untanned-yet and clothed only in bikini outline
tape!''

MCGINEST COULD MAKE GIANT IMPACT FOR THE PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ In those fragile years when one injury would
compound another every time he stepped onto the field, he gave you
the Willies. Now Bill Belichick is pretty grateful to have one
Willie: Willie McGinest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tremendous athlete who runs like a linebacker but has
more the power of a defensive lineman,'' said Belichick. ``He's a
very intelligent, instinctive player.''
</P>
<P>
   Here comes the punch line: ``In many ways he's like Lawrence
Taylor. Lawrence was a guy who . . . he may not have known
everything in the game plan, but when the ball was snapped he knew
how the play affected him and he knew how to defend it. Willie has
the same kind of instinctiveness. It's a unique trait to have
instinct recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick knows Taylor because he coached him with the New York
Giants. ``That's the highest compliment,'' said McGinest, sounding
a bit embarrassed by the praise. ``LT is a hero just like Andre
Tippett and Derrick Thomas. He's in a league of his own.''
</P>
<P>
   How are they the same? ``We both like to kill quarterbacks,''
said McGinest.
</P>
<P>
   McGinest nearly killed Jeff Garcia, the 49ers' heir apparent to
Steve Young, in Monday's 20-0 victory. McGinest sacked Garcia
twice, and his hard rush enabled Chad Eaton to swoop in for another
sack.
</P>
<P>
   After spending two years in and out of the trainer's room and
doctor's office for groin problems, McGinest returned to form last
year with 8 1/2 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Though he didn't play much Monday, he was a force when he was on
the field. In the new 3-4 defense (which occasionally switches to
4-3), McGinest's job is to chase the quarterback. Although McGinest
will at times drop back in coverage, Belichick wants to use
McGinest as he once used Taylor, raising havoc and being
disruptive. McGinest relishes the role. As the Patriots' No. 1 pick
out of Southern California in 1994, there were high hopes for him
to be one of the league's most disruptive players. Now he's getting
back to the point where he can make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   In the new defense, he begins the play upright and looks like
he's an outside linebacker _ even though he's listed as a defensive
end. Not that it matters. Technically, he played linebacker when he
first came up for Bill Parcells, then switched to defensive end,
then, under Pete Carroll, switched to ``elephant.''
</P>
<P>
   What is he? ``An elephant,'' said McGinest. ``I'm not a
defensive end or a linebacker.''
</P>
<P>
   But if he's LT-like, they should call him an ``animal.'' A
``monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the other members of the defense, McGinest feels he's died
and gone to heaven because Belichick is running the unit. He feels
Belichick will get the most out of his potential and put him in
position to be the centerpiece of the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, his teammates feel the same way, voting him cocaptain
along with Lawyer Milloy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My teammates voted for me and that's a great thing,'' he said.
``It means a lot to me. I want to lead, but I want to lead on the
field as much as anything. We do a lot of (talking) in practice,
but when it's time to get serious you have to make the plays to
prove yourself. That's what I hope I do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are guys who don't show up all the time, but when you're
a leader you put yourself out there on the line every play and
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest has joined many of his teammates in saying the team
needed a taskmaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be a well-disciplined team,'' said McGinest. ``We need
discipline. It's proven that this group of guys plays its best
football when we have discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest earned his only All-Pro berth under Parcells,
Belichick, and Al Groh in '96. But Ty Law and Milloy became Pro
Bowlers under Carroll, despite their praise of the current coach.
Chris Slade, McGinest's bookend, also became an All-Pro in the
Carroll regime, even though he was a ``situational player'' in
Parcells's final year, which included Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the maturing of players under Carroll, Belichick's
concept of team defense is a system the players would rather play.
No defensive back will be hung out to dry in single coverage.
Belichick stresses not giving up big plays in the secondary because
he stresses containment and aggressive play by the players up
front.
</P>
<P>
   What McGinest loves is the defense's unpredictability. Belichick
disguised the defenses well Monday, even fielding something that
looked like a 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go out there and execute what we're supposed to do, it's
hard to pick up what we're doing,'' said McGinest.
</P>
<P>
   McGinest said that, despite the public perception, the defense's
play was far from perfect. It was a message Belichick drilled into
his players. McGinest, for one, got the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made mistakes. It wasn't perfect,'' said McGinest.
</P>
<P>
   If the leader of the defense believes the coach's message, even
after pitching a shutout, then the rest of the unit had better
believe it. As Belichick said, he's setting a high bar for the team
_ and now he's setting a high bar for McGinest.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Belichick mentioned Lawrence Taylor in the same
breath as McGinest. Coaches say those things to the media for a
reason.
</P>
<P>
   And now McGinest knows what the coach expects.

HAMILTON TO MAKE OLYMPIC DEBUT IN SYDNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tyler Hamilton admits he wasn't totally surprised Tuesday when
he got the call at his home in Nice, France, telling him he'd been
chosen to be on the US Olympic cycling team.
</P>
<P>
   But he was relieved.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, of Marblehead, Mass., was on the 1996 Olympic team _
but as an alternate. He couln't even travel to Atlanta with the
team, let alone wear the team uniform.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, he knew he had a better chance, with four
Tour de Frances under his belt. Hamilton finished 13th overall last
year and 25h this year, both times playing a significant role in
helping teammate Lance Armstrong get to the winner's podium in
Paris. Hamilton also scored a big victory with two stage wins and
the overall title at a race in France last June.
</P>
<P>
   So he figured he was in a good position to be picked for Sydney.
``I felt like I had done everything I could possibly do, but you
never know,'' said Hamilton, 29, who was aware that there were
half-dozen qualified cyclists vying for the two remaining spots.
</P>
<P>
   It's exciting, and now it's official,'' he said Wednesday from
Nice, his home during the racing season. ``I knew I had a good
chance. I think in the time-trial race and the way I worked for
Lance, I opened their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They'' were US Olympic road coach Jim Ochowicz and Sean Petty,
the director of athlete performance at USA Cycling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have assembled a first-rate team, that will no doubt be
favored in both the road race and individual time trial,'' Ochowicz
said when he announced the roster Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Hamilton and Armstrong will be Antonio Cruz, of Long
Beach, Calif., who won the Olympic trials road race; George
Hincapie, of Greenville, S.C., the top US cyclist in the World Cup
standings; and Fred Rodriguez, of Emeryville, Calif., who won the
national professional championship last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who rode in the Tour de France with Mapei, finished
in the top four places in three Tour stages. Like Hamilton, he felt
confident of his performance but realized his fate was out of his
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've proven that I deserve a spot on the team,''
Rodriguez said during the Tour de France. ``It's up to them now.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong and Hamilton also will compete in the 29-mile
individual time-trial race. That was by far their forte in the Tour
this year and last year. Armstrong won the final time trial both
times, while Hamilton came in third last year and fourth this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton is now off to a four-day stage race in Spain Sunday,
then has half-dozen more races until he heads to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Going to the Olympics, he said, is something he thought of when
he used to ski competively, in his precycling days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I always dreamed of,'' he said. ``But once I
broke my back and ended my ski career, I pretty much shelved the
idea of ever going to the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the dream is back.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a good cause
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's not as old as the Boston Marathon or as grueling as
the Tour de France, but the Pan-Massachusetts Challenge has become
a mainstay for biking in Boston. The ride, which supports the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute's Jimmy Fund, began in 1980 with 36
participants who raised more than $10,000. More than 3,000 cyclists
will make the ride this year on six routes from Sturbridge to
Provincetown beginning Saturday. Last year the ``everyday Lance
Armstrongs'' contributed $8.7 million to the Jimmy Fund . . .
Hamilton won't be coming to the United States later this month to
defend his record in the Mount Washington Hillclimb in New
Hampshire, but another world-class cyclist will be there. French
racer Jeannie Longo, who holds 11 world titles in both road and
track racing, is slated to climb the mountain Aug. 19. Longo, who
won won the women's Tour de France three times and has medals from
the 1992 (silver) and 1996 (gold) Olympics, apparently is using the
race as a tuneup for the Olympics. Hamilton won the race both in
1997 and 1999, and had a course record of 50 minutes 21 seconds for
the 7.4-mile climb.

SAVAGE COMPETITION SHAKES STAPLES' INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Staples is like the guy who owns a nice house in a run-down
neighborhood. Prospective buyers want to know: Will the blight
spread here, too?
</P>
<P>
   As far as investors are concerned, the office-superstore
neighborhood is a scary place to be. Staples' two main rivals,
Office Depot and Office Max, have both signaled that intensifying
competition is hurting their bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
   Staples has yet to say that those same pressures are having an
impact, but investors, always a nervous lot, are bracing for the
worst. ``People are wondering when the next shoe will drop,'' said
Eileen Leary, a portfolio manager at State Street Research.
</P>
<P>
   If that were not enough, Wall Street is also on edge about
Staples' Internet business, Staples.com. When will it become
profitable? Will it become profitable?
</P>
<P>
   Investors will be looking for clues when the Framingham, Mass.
company releases quarterly earnings Aug. 15. Company executives
said they could not comment until then.
</P>
<P>
   How bad has life been for Staples? Real bad. The stock is down
50 percent since February and roughly 60 percent since the spring
of 1999. Office Depot is down 76 percent from its 1999 high. Office
Max is off 66 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This category has gone from one of the most attractive to the
least attractive retail groups,'' said Bill Sims, an analyst with
Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The basic problem: too much competition. The once formidable
category killers are killing each other and, in turn, are being
killed by other category killers _ notably Costco and Wal-Mart.
Wal-Mart has been particularly aggressive in promoting its
back-to-school business.
</P>
<P>
   Office Depot, citing pressure from the discount chains, said in
July that it was cutting prices on paper, ink, and toner cartridges
to lure more shoppers into its stores. ``A price war is always a
significant negative,'' said Rary Delaney, an analyst with Fleet
Investment Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   Staples followers may note a certain irony in the increasing
threat posed by the general discounters.
</P>
<P>
   When the government rejected Staples' proposed merger with
Office Depot in 1997, on antitrust grounds, it said that the office
superstore category represented a separate and distinct market
which the merged companies would dominate. Staples countered that
the discounters were going after the same business and that the
market still would have been very competitive.
</P>
<P>
   With the benefit of hindsight, it looks as if Staples was right.
But that is small consolation for investors.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue for investors is the future of Staples.com. The
company launched its dot-com at a time when Internet retailing was
all the rage and the market was willing to tolerate start-up
losses. Those days are gone, and investors now want to see profits
_ fast.
</P>
<P>
   Staples.com lost $20 million in the first quarter on $75 million
in sales. Analysts don't expect the unit to become profitable until
some time in 2002. Staples has filed to create a separate tracking
stock for the dot-com business, but Wall Street now doubts the deal
will ever go through.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kully concedes Staples faces plenty of challenges, but he
says the market has overreacted to the company's troubles. ``At
this price, this stock is a helluva good buy,'' said Kully, a money
manager with Pegasus Associates in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Kully expects Staples' earnings to climb at a 25 to 30 percent
pace over the next three years. If he is right _ a big if _ then
the stock is definitely cheap, using traditional measures.
</P>
<P>
   Kully acknowledges that Office Depot's price cuts were bad news,
but he says that investors missed other news in the announcement
that was equally important. Office Depot in July said it was
scaling back its expansion plans and would close stores it operates
in very competitive markets. ``If you look at the whole
announcement, it was a net plus for Staples,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Leary, another Staples fan, says investors have also been
too gloomy about the dot-com business. She expects that in its
earnings report, Staples will say that the Internet operation is
growing more quickly than anticipated and that profitability will
come sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   Leary also says that because of the nature of Staples business _
customers buy significant quantities of supplies on a regular basis
_ the operation has much sounder economics than do many other
Internet retailers. ``This business makes sense,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Is it time to jump in and buy Staples? Brave investors like
Kully and Leary say it is. Chickens may want to wait until Aug. 15,
when presumably a clearer picture of Staples' future will emerge.

<P>
   Two years ago, musician Trix Kout bought a dresser at an auction
and found some unexpected treasures stuffed in a drawer: a dozen
handmade aprons, circa 1940s or '50s.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was made of flamboyant sheer red netting with a
satin sash. Another was a delicate granny print, lovingly stitched
together with floral patchwork scraps. A red floral cotton number
was the es-sence of casserole and canned string beans. Then there
was the demure Heidi-style apron, with its rickrack and dotted
Swiss and heart-shaped pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just so cute,'' says Kout. ``They were so
era-sensitive. They were like the ones my mother had, in the
'50s.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is they were like the ones a lot of mothers in
American kitchens wore: homemade, highly embellished, and as
essential to life in the kitchen as a wooden spoon or tea towel.
While these bow-in-the-back aprons aren't likely to return as a
fashion statement anytime soon, 50 years after their heyday, they
are coming back, this time as collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like there is an underground network'' of apron
collectors, says Joyce Cheney, Missouri-based author of the book
``Aprons: Icons of the American Home''(Running Press), and
organizer of a retrospective on aprons that is touring American
museums through 2002. ``This is a critical time for aprons.''
</P>
<P>
   It's critical because their original wearers are getting up in
years and aprons proudly worn five decades ago are now heading to
rubbish piles and thrift shops. There is a diminishing market these
days for cross-stitched gingham kitchen apparel with poodles on the
pockets.
</P>
<P>
   As they disappear, so does an era's worth of memories: that
first high school sewing project, fashion accessories, hostess
gifts, art form, clothespin holders. Aprons made from scrap fabrics
or feed bags, the ultimate in thrift. Aprons that wiped sweat off
foreheads in steamy kitchens, dusted furniture, doubled as hot
pads, and held peas from the garden when the bottom was pulled up.
Cooking aprons. Serving aprons. Holiday aprons.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Symbols of home''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aprons ``remind us of mothers, grandmothers, and our own
pasts,'' Cheney writes in her book. ``They serve as symbols of
home, motherhood, and housewifery, from images of a colonial woman
fanning the cooking fire with her long apron . . . to a Fifties
housewife wearing a ruffled and rickracked apron to serve dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, 50, a writer and curator with about 400 aprons in her
personal collection, has charted the rise and fall of aprons in her
book. She says the use of aprons peaked in the postwar years, in
the late '40s and '50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when you find the plethora of wonderful styles,'' she
said in a telephone interview from St. Louis. ``This happened for a
number of reasons. Fabric was more available after World War II,
and sewing machines were more common. And more importantly, all the
institutions in society at the time, the school, the church, the
government, the media, the whole marketplace, was pushing a certain
model of the family, which was the Cleaver family. Mom stayed home,
her job was to make the home, and the apron was the uniform of her
profession.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aprons as folk art
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The average mom had two kinds of aprons, Cheney says. the
``workaday apron'' she wore in the kitchen to prepare the food, and
the ``hostess apron'' she donned for serving it. While aprons were
commercially available, many women sewed their own, and apron
patterns were a staple of newspaper women's pages and magazines,
says Phoebe Erb Gallagher of Boston, a commercial textile designer
who has been an avid apron aficionado for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher curated an apron exhibit at the Newton (Mass.) Free
Library in March, and in it cited a 1953 sewing manual with
patterns for 41 aprons: the mend-while-you-iron apron, the
hair-washing apron, the vacuum-cleaning apron, and others.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher has more than 100 aprons in her collection, mostly
acquired at thrift stores, ranging in price from 99 cents to $12.
She says part of what intrigues her about them is ``the variety of
doodads'' that were incorporated into their design.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the trimmings and shapes and patterns is sort of a
testament to the imagination and ingenuity of housewives, who on
the one hand we tend to think of as being repressed. . . . They may
symbolize the unfulfilled housewife,'' she says. On the other hand,
``they reveal the good-humored homemaker whose tasks never
ceased.''
</P>
<P>
   Among her favorite finds are an ecru-colored, doily-like,
crocheted apron with a yellow ribbon woven through it; an apron
made completely of handkerchiefs, with a sawtooth edge; an apron
with mah-jongg game designs on the skirt; an apron made from the
bags used by farmers for animal feed, and the piece de resistance,
the apron she calls the ``G-string,'' a kind of cotton loincloth
that suggested at least one cook in this country had more on her
mind in the kitchen than simmering soup stock.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A discarded uniform
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the era of the apron came and went. As more families
acquired washing machines and wash-and-wear clothes became the
norm, it was less necessary for cooks to keep their clothes
covered. As women entered the work force, they spent significantly
less time in the kitchen. With the advent of the women's movement,
Cheney says, ``we were no longer just housewives and we didn't want
the uniform of housewives.''
</P>
<P>
   Now aprons are showing up in flea markets and old dresser
drawers, and Cheney acknowledges she has her doubts they'll make a
comeback, other than those full-length ones spotted around the
barbecue or on sales staff at retail outlets like Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Trix Kout, who has consigned the ``cute'' aprons she
found to an antiques shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a musician, I don't have cocktail parties,'' she says.
``What am I going to do with them?''

ONCE AGAIN, PEDRO RIDES TO THE RESCUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It took 19 innings spread over 5 hours 34 minutes to
determine a winner when the Red Sox and Mariners played Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, it took less than 10 minutes and less than one
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the first five Red Sox batters crossed home plate in the
opening frame. Game over.
</P>
<P>
   The game was over because Pedro Martinez was on the mound. Pedro
does not cough up a 4-0, first-inning lead. He gave up five hits,
walked two, and fanned seven in beating the Mariners, 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Pedro went nine when there was no one else left
to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was over right away,'' Martinez acknowledged. ``I knew they
were down after those four runs we scored. I just throw strikes and
keep the ball down and they get themselves out.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro presents himself as a legitimate MVP candidate on nights
like this. The Sox needed a win, but more than anything, they
needed him to go nine. He went nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no chance of pitching anything like three innings,''
said closer Derek Lowe. ``Everybody was pretty much done except for
emergency purposes. He knew that. I'm running out of things to say
about the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For this one, he gets a win and a save,'' said Boston pitching
coach, Joe Kerrigan.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro is the best pitcher in baseball and he is the reason why
the motley crew that is the 2000 Red Sox still have a chance at
postseason play. He can neutralize a 10-game suspension to the star
center fielder. He can stabilize a clubhouse reeling from Dan
Duquette's revolving door. And he can guarantee rest for a
dog-tired bullpen that just chucked 18 innings in two days.
Martinez has pitched into the seventh inning in all 19 of his
starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox were reeling after Tuesday's late-night loss. The relief
corps was depleted, spirits were low, and Jimy Williams was
desperately in need of a strong outing from a starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, it was Pedro's day to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The diminutive righthander has been in a great mood all week.
After beating the A's in Oakland Friday, he served as interpreter
for Cuban righthander Rolando Arroyo. Martinez was good. If the
United Nations could match his $75 million salary, Pedro could get
work as a translator.
</P>
<P>
   He entertained a hoard of scribes at his locker before Tuesday's
game, then thrilled the early arrivals at Safeco Field, tossing
baseball after baseball into the stands during batting practice. It
was a delight to watch and Pedro seemed to be enjoying it as much
as the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the Mariners sold out Safeco Field (45,121),
attracting an additional 10,000 fans simply because of Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   It was bad news for the Mariners hitters, however.
</P>
<P>
   In accordance with Pedro Rules, outfielder Jay Buhner was given
the night off. Against Martinez, Buhner is 0 for 8 lifetime, all
strikeouts. Pedro probably would have liked a little revenge since
Buhner hit a grand slam off Brother Ramon Monday, but Seattle
manager Lou Piniella wouldn't have it. Sweet Lou has decided that
letting Buhner hit against Pedro is inviting a funk that can carry
into the next week. So when Martinez pitches, Buhner sits.
</P>
<P>
   Typically terrific, Martinez gave up nothing but a couple of
scratch singles in the first five innings as the Sox coasted with a
5-0 lead. In the bottom of the sixth, Mark McLemore walked and
moved to third on a couple of ground outs, but Martinez fanned Alex
Rodriguez (swinging) for the second time and it was on to the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   He got the side in order in the seventh, fanning Tuesday's homer
hero, Mike Cameron, for a second time to end the inning.He had
thrown only 90 pitches through seven.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners reached him for three hits and two runs in the
eighth, but Martinez got out of the jam when Nomar Garciaparra
turned a nice double play on a hot grounder up the middle by Stan
Javier. By this time, Derek Lowe was warming up in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The ninth was 1-2-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had to go as deep as possible,'' said Martinez.
``I had to pick up the guy in the bullpen and there's no one better
to do that than me. I had more rest than most people and it was a
pleasure to pick them up.''
</P>
<P>
   David Wells is contesting for the Cy Young Award and Bob
Gibson's 1968 ERA of 1.12 may be tough to reach, but Pedro, now
13-3, hasn't lost since coming off the disabled list July 13 and 20
wins is within reach.
</P>
<P>
   So the trip through Oakland and Seattle produced a 4-3 record
(two wins from Martinez) and Boston is three games behind the
Yankees. The Sox are 4-5 since Carl Everett started his suspension
and Jurassic Carl returns Saturday at Fenway against the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Pedro has righted the SS Duquette. Again.

   CVN-CONVENTION-RDP (Philadelphia) _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush
accepts his party's presidential nomination in a speech in which he
is expected to talk about the Clinton years in a ``regretful tone,
not a harsh tone,'' according to his press secretary. He is also

Campaign, the nation's oldest gay political organization, hold a

individuals but opposes laws protecting homosexuals from
discrimination or allowing them to serve in the military. By ERIC

<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   CVN-MEANS-COLUMN (Philadelphia) _ Everyone knew they wouldn't _
couldn't, shouldn't _ keep it up. All that gooey sweetness just
wasn't real. Mama and papa Bush broke through the cocoon of
convention platitudes first, rising to President Clinton's bait to
defend their son Dubya with some sharp-tongued cracks about
Clinton's lack of character. Then GOP veep nominee Dick Cheney cut
to the chase, dropping those vague allusions to Democratic failings
in favor of a direct attack on the real target here, Vice President
Al Gore. By MARIANNE MEANS.
</P>
<P>
   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ The relationship between the
George W. Bush's Republicans and Bill Clinton is a fascinating
study in contradictions. On the one hand, GOP leaders express their
disgust with the president's behavior and speak longingly of having
a president worthy of their respect. On the other hand, their
decision to transform the GOP's image by opening the party's doors
widely to African Americans, Hispanics and gays copies the type of
strategy that twice won the presidency for Clinton and the
Democrats. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON. (For release Sunday, Aug 6.)

   GOP-BUSH-SPEECH (Philadelphia) _ On the speech Gov. George W.
Bush is scheduled to deliver Thursday evening. The speech, which

   And
</P>
<P>
   GOP-ECON-ASSESS (Philadelphia) _ The Bush campaign portrays his
economic agenda as all about helping single moms and small business
owners. Just as Clinton worked to give Democrats a claim to fiscal
responsibility, Bush is working to give conservatism a claim to
solving social problems. But Bush also was seeking here to avoid
drawing attention to the fact that his tax plan would largely
benefit the wealthy. And to the degree he engages Gore on economic
issues, he is moving onto tricky turf, given the widespread
prosperity. By Richard W. Stevenson. (900 words)

service problem since adopting a new ``Satisfaction Guarantee,''
Amtrak says it has had to give thousands of passengers coupons good

Philadelphia Sunday night, when strong winds knocked trees unto the
tracks and lighting zapped the signal system. The railroad, trying
to build confidence, is throwing extra equipment into service today

pollution-related beach closures and advisories nationwide
increased by 50 percent between 1997 and 1999, with more than half
in California, according to a report released by the Natural

   INDONESIA-SUHARTO (Jakarta) _ Sick, bewildered and besieged at
his home by angry protesters, former President Suharto was formally
charged Thursday with corruption during his 32 years of unchecked
power in Indonesia. The charge involves only a small portion of the
widespread corruption that characterized his rule, but it sends a
significant signal of Indonesia's attempts to overhaul its economy
and political system and lay the basis for the rule of law. By Seth
Mydans.

   SRI-LANKA-TAMILS (Chennai, India) _ Sri Lanka's ruling coalition
has proposed a new constitution that would give greater political

separatist rebels for a Tamil homeland. By Celia W. Dugger.

<P>
   BRITIAN-QUEEN-MOTHER (London) _ Queen Elizabeth, the Queen
Mother, turns 100 years old Friday, and the British have been
commemorating the event with what could be the last full-throated
hurrah for the crown. There have been full dress parades, Royal Air
Force flyovers, pageant-filled church services, ``God Bless You
Ma'am'' tabloid headlines and editorials crediting her with having
saved the monarchy from perils ranging from the abdication of her

   GOP CONVENTION
</P>
<P>
   CVN-GOP-MAIN _ PHILADELPHIA _ With the eyes of the nation on him
as never before, Gov. George Bush accepts the Republican Party's
presidential nomination Thursday night. His speech will do much to
shape voters' opinions and frame the fall campaign. (Heath, Austin
American-Statesman).

performed. (Herman, Austin American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   WAN: Location Austin, category National, subcategory Politics
</P>
<P>
   CVN-SCENE _ PHILADELPHIA _ Many Republican members of Congress
who are used to being on center stage in the capital have been
relegated to the sidelines at this diversity-friendly convention,
but they can always find solace at the congressional village, a
compound near the hall devoted to their care and feeding. (Dart,
Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   WAN: Location Atlanta, category National, subcategory Politics.
</P>
<P>
   CVN-GUNS _ PHILADELPHIA _ Gun-control issues are swarming around
the Republican National Convention, but their message has not made
it inside. Despite a downtown rally, an ad campaign attacking
Bush's pro-gun record, and several White House announcements, GOP
delegates are not talking about their pro-gun ownership platform
plank. (Moscoso, Cox News Service). 25.
</P>
<P>
   WAN: Location Atlanta, category National, subcategory Politics.
</P>
<P>
   CVN-GOP-MONEY _ PHILADELPHIA _ All aboard! Rep. Tom Delay's
party train parked outside the First Union Center is only one of
many sites where congressional leaders are offering convention
attendees food and entertainment. Who's paying for it? Hard to
tell, because of lax disclosure rules for ``leadership PACs.''
(Sherman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

pulled from Cox staff and wire reports. (Cox News Service) ETA: 6
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   OPED/EDITORIAL
</P>
<P>
   EDITORIAL-CHILD-MOLESTATION _ Howard Thompson nine years ago was
convicted on three counts of child molestation in Brunswick, Ga.,
and given 10 years unsupervised probation. Effectively, Brunswick
washed its hands of him, ordered him to get out of a five-county
judicial circuit and stay away for 10 yeablem. Change-o: Now
others' problem. (Waco Tribune-Herald)
</P>
<P>
   BORDERS-COLUMN _ NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ My youngest daughter has
it all figured out. She just turned 19, has a year of college under
her belt, is still in relatively good graces with the
powers-that-be at the University of Texas, and now knows for sure
what she wants to do for a living. She wants to be a film director.
(Gary Borders is editor and publisher of the Nacogdoches Daily
Sentinel.) EMBARGOED for Sunday. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   DAVIS-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Cheney is struck from the mold of
Bush's greatest mentors. Texas oil millionaires (old think) and
billionaires (new think) loom large in the Bush history. Notable
among them is Richard Rainwater, a Fort Worth oilman and sports
investor and former Bush business partner who has contributed
generously to his friend's political life. (Davis, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   GARCIA-COLUMN _ His warrior days are long gone, but Joe
Levinson, 76, and others like him _ an estimated estimates are that
there 1.4 million military retirees are in the country today _ have
seen their access to health care shrink even as their need for it
grows. (Garcia, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Forget what they say on the
Sunday morning news shows. The key to understanding this year's
elections is The Boredom Factor. This is a strange year. For the
first time there was more suspense in the Mexican presidential race
than in the American. (Lane, Daytona News-Journal) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   MCNEELY-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ PHILADELPHIA _ That guy on the
famous steps here, getting his picture taken, was Ricky, not Rocky.
Or at least that's what his momma calls him. Rick Perry, the
lieutenant governor of Texas who will become governor if his buddy
George W. Bush beats Al Gore on Nov. 7, was on the Philadelphia
Museum of Art steps featured in Sylvester Stallone's ``Rocky''
movie Wednesday, waiting for Bush to arrive at a rally. (McNeely,
Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas - It's times like these when those
blessed with cable options give thanks for A&AMP;E, the Discovery
Channel and Animal Planet. My wife, for instance. She surfed upon a
scene of African children in grass skirts scampering across a
stage. Jabbing the remote, she bolted before realizing it was
actually about Africans. ``Sorry,'' she said, ``I thought it was
the Republican National Convention.'' (John Young is opinion page
editor of the Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

   EARTHLINK-FOLO _ ATLANTA _ Following developments based on
Charles Brewer's departure from EarthLink. (Staff, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 15.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHERNERS-BADRAP _ A study out of Texas says people with
Southern drawls get a bad rap on the job. The study had human
resources directors rank accents from around the country and then
assign jobs to the speakers they heard. Y'all guessed it:
Southerners were viewed as dumb, got low marks and were put in jobs
where they had little contact with the public or customers.

United States. It can only enhance sales of the 3-Series line.

death of a rookie Atlanta policeman who was mowed down by a driver
while in the act of doing his job and the teenage driver and
Transportation Department personnel who were hit by a driver using
the emergency lane as a passing lane. (Sharp, Atlanta

   THE-MECHANIC _ ATLANTA _ Last week, a student asked me what I
thought was the single most important pollution control device on
any passenger vehicle. Without hesitation, I mentioned the

internal combustion engine to its current ``almost

   EMINEM _ In the tradition of NWA, Marilyn Manson and others,
Eminem, who appears here tonight, sings to shock. Unlike the
others, his is enjoying phenomenal mainstream commercial success;
his song about having sex with his mother is on the radio. This at
a time when ever-younger kids are into mainstream music, lured by
the likes of Disney Channel videos and Disney Radio. What are
boomer parents, who fought their own parents to hear Jim Morrison's
Oedipal rant, to do? Censor and be old fogies or let kids hear
songs of rape and homophobia? (Harris, Atlanta

   GOP-ECON-ASSESS-NYT _ The Bush campaign portrays his economic
agenda as all about helping single mothers and small business
owners. Just as Clinton worked to give Democrats a claim to fiscal
responsibility, Bush is working to give conservatism a claim to
solving social problems, but Bush is also seeking to avoid drawing
attention to the fact that his tax plan would largely benefit the
wealthy. And to the degree he engages Gore on economic issues, he
is moving onto tricky turf, given the widespread prosperity. By

 &HT;    Delegate says Bush won't curb Social Security benefits
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ For Wayne Christian, a Center stockbroker who
represents Nacogdoches in the Texas House, perhaps the biggest
surprise for him as a delegate to the GOP national convention is
that there have been no surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from Texas and having served under Gov. Bush for the
past 3 1/2 years, I think it's quite amazing that the same message
is being given that we've seen in Austin and in Texas all along.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that consistency of politics, Christian said, that refutes
efforts by Democrats ``to try to portray this (party unity) as some
kind of fake scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian, 49, said he was not among those individuals who bowed
their heads in prayer as a protest to the Tuesday night appearance
on the program by Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona, the only openly gay
Republican member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prayer is always proper and good,'' he said, ``but the idea is
to hate the sin but love the sinners.
</P>
<P>
   Christian noted that Kolbe's four-minute speech on international
trade ``was in no way in regard to homosexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect anyone of any belief and any persuasion to be able
to exhibit their opinion and views and being able to participate in
the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian, who served as an alternate delegate in 1996, said he
has been especially impressed at this convention by the
participation of ``the diversity of racial groups that heretofore
have been labeled as Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more people, he said, have ``come to realize that the
best hope for the American dream is offered by the Republican
Party'' through programs that ``Gov. Bush has already proven in
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the programs of ``compassionate conservatism'' and
``faith in action,'' he said, that have resulted ``in moving 60
percent of the decrease in Texas welfare rolls to paying jobs,''
much of it ``through private enterprise and through churches and
other organizations coming in and helping.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian said the ``best assistance given to families is to
promote marriage and to promote jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compassionate conservatism realigns that area (of assistance)
by putting faith and hope and caring local individuals back in the
process, and not just the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is Christian's definition of a compassionate conservative:
</P>
<P>
   ``Caring about people who have needs and doing whatever we can
do to lift people to the greatest opportunity available for them to
pursue the American dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that's compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   On a personal level, Christian said he hopes the GOP convention
will denounce the ``fear factor'' being used by opposition groups
who claim Republicans will reduce Social Security benefits for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   As state representative, he said he had received phone calls
from Social Security recipients, including from his 75-year-old
mother, who are worried that they will be targeted for cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``No policy from pre-Reagan on, including the Bush and the Gore
plan, advocate any change to current recipients,'' he said. ``We
need to assure senior citizens who have worked and put that money
into Social Security that they are not being threatened by either
political party.''

   ROSLER-RETROSPECTIVE (New York) _ If you happen to be on
basically OK terms with the world as it is, the alert, irritated,
combative work of the U.S. artist Martha Rosler may not be your cup

   MOVIE-SOUNDTRACKS (Undated) _ New movies come in on waves of
hype and anticipation, followed, if they're lucky, by swelling word
of mouth. When the waves recede, they leave behind something
tangible: soundtrack albums. If summer is a prime time for movie
releases, it's also a good time to look back over recent albums,
some of which are better than the movies themselves. By Jon
Pareles.
</P>
<P>
   NY-DANCING (New York) _ It is summer in New York, this year a
season that jumps from muggy heat to damp chill without warning.
There is relatively little dance in pleasantly climate-controlled
theaters. So what do those mad creatures called dancers do? Forget
about vacations or more trips to the office-temp center. Dancers
dance. So they are taking to the city's parks, rooftops, gardens
and empty buildings over the next four weeks in a surge of activity
that truly offers something for just about everyone. By Jennifer
Dunning.
</P>
<P>
   JAPANESE-RENAISSANCE (Undated) _ The presence of what might be
called the eternal modern can be felt in certain great examples of
African, Egyptian and early Greek art and different kinds of Asian
art. Right now this presence hovers like a beautiful mist over
``The Arts of Hon'ami Koetsu, Japanese Renaissance Master'' at the
Philadelphia Museum of Art, which pays homage to a late
16th-century artist who has become known as ``the Leonardo da Vinci
of Japanese art.'' By Roberta Smith.

   El que engaqa con aparencia de verdad es impostor(beginitalic).
(enditalic)(He who deceives with a truthful appearance is an
impostor).
</P>
<P>
   An old Mexican saying from a new book on sayings, folktales and
wisdom, It's All in the Frijoles(beginitalic), (enditalic)by
Yolanda NavaThe saying comes to mind as the spectacle that is the
Republican National Convention continues to flit past.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, we've heard such noble notions as compassionate
conservatism and leaving no child behind. We had George P. Bush,
the nominee's Latino nephew, and Colin Powell putting high-profile
faces to the GOP's claims of inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   But, we also had a Texas delegation nearly boycotting a speech
on international trade by Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., because he is
gay. Perhaps a dozen satisfied themselves instead by bowing their
heads in prayer during his speech, demonstrating anew that holier
than thou doesn't have much to do with being more caring or polite.
</P>
<P>
   We had a party platform still out of sync with most of the
nation on abortion and that stated flatly that homosexuality is
incompatible with the military and that gays don't deserve the same
protections in law that the rest of us do.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates, despite the more high-profile members, didn't
much look like us either, though we should all aspire to their
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   I'd be surprised if African-American and Latino representation
broke into low double digits, even including those paraded before
the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   We had Arizona Sen. John McCain - who crusades on campaign
finance reform - putting on a happy face as corporate donors hung
their convention banners to signify kinship to and ownership of the
party.
</P>
<P>
   But, for all the transparency at work at the convention, it just
might work.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Americans could be more interested these days in
simply electing someone they can like. That is what this GOP
convention and campaign-to-be is about - donning the mantle of
likability. The fact is, Bush, a likable guy, isn't running against
Al Gore, he's running against Bill Clinton, arguably one of our
most unlikable presidents for character flaws all too fresh in
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, as part of the Clinton administration, Gore should
bear some of the criticism stemming from governance over the past
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, however, is that this has been a moderately
successful administration that has presided over what is generally
accepted as boom times (though everyone seems to gloss right over
that widening gap between rich and poor).
</P>
<P>
   It's simply more important under these circumstances to link
Gore more with Clinton-the-man than with the administration's
policies. Really, it's about being more likable than Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Gore has sins of his own (as does Bush), but they pale in
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Take Bush's VP pick, the consummate insider Dick Cheney. His
congressional voting record makes Newt Gingrich look like Mother
Teresa, but Cheney is described as likable and affable (and gives
an aura of substance to a candidate who desperately needs it).
</P>
<P>
   And this is a campaign about likability. It's not that the
Republicans really have any illusions about minorities flocking to
sign up. They just know that swing votes may come from the larger,
fair-minded middle, which has an equally difficult time with a
party viewed as mean-spirited and selfish.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are tired of losing and that means muting sentiments
and philosophy still very much part of the GOP, truth be known.
</P>
<P>
   So, here's another saying: Don't put on a tutu and prance on
your tiptoes and tell me you're a pretty ballerina.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 FEARS FOR EARS  
 &HT;    American farmers have planted 20 million acres of genetically
modified corn, engineered to repel predatory insects without using
noxious chemicals.
 &HT;    If farmers are not careful, a new report warns, the scheme could
backfire and breed even more troublesome strains of pests.
 &HT;    The modified crops pump out Bt toxin, a natural insecticide
created by bacteria. Some insects, in turn, carry genes that
protect them from the toxin. To check the spread of those genes,
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requires that farmers
intersperse fields of genetically modified crops with islands of
non-modified plants.
 &HT;    The idea is that insects in the refuges would remain vulnerable
to Bt toxin, and the bugs would interbreed to keep the whole
population susceptible.
 &HT;    For the first time, scientists have proof the tactic works.
Entomologist Anthony Shelton of Cornell University and his
colleagues sowed fields of altered broccoli and then unleashed
broccoli-eating diamondback moths.
 &HT;    In fields containing refuges of non-modified plants, resistance
genes were less likely to be spread through the moth population.
 &HT;    But there is a big caveat. Spraying the refuges with pesticides
_ a common practice among farmers, and one permitted by EPA
regulations _ sped the appearance of toxin-resistant moths.
 &HT;    ``Any time you spray insects on a plant, you are never going to
get 100 percent mortality,'' Shelton says. ``You end up putting a
mosaic of doses on the plants-some high, and some low. Where the
doses are low, you won't kill all the insects, and those that
survive will be more likely to develop resistance.''
 &HT;    
 STAR TREK SYRINGE  
 &HT;    The doctors keep saying it won't hurt a bit, and it keeps
hurting. There's got to be a better way to get drugs into the body
than a brutal needle and syringe.
 &HT;    Chemist Terry Burkoth and his collaborators at PowderJect
Pharmaceuticals in Oxford, England, agree. They have replaced the
needle with a flashlight-size tube that uses a jet of helium to
accelerate powdered drugs to supersonic speeds.
 &HT;    Just press it against the skin, and the PowderJect system shoots
a dose directly into the underlying cells. The drug particles are
so small that the patient hardly feels a thing.
 &HT;    And the supersonic shot could make it easier for doctors to
deliver precise dosages of drugs to hard-to-reach regions just
below the skin's upper layer.
 &HT;    
 PICTURE-PERFECT PLASTIC  
 &HT;    Because of a rogue speck of dust floating around Stephen Chou's
lab at Princeton University, your next computer monitor may display
a much sharper image.
 &HT;    An electrical engineer, Chou was working on a better way to
configure polymer plastics used to make light-emitting diodes, or
LEDs, and other electronics.
 &HT;    One of his graduate students pressed a mask into a layer of
plastic, preparing to transform the material into a pattern of
electrical circuits. By a fluke, bits of dust got behind the mask.
When Chou removed it, he was startled to see that an array of
beautiful, highly regular microscopic pillars had sprung up where
the mask did not lie flush on the surface.
 &HT;    Chou thinks his polymer pillars will simplify the manufacturing
of LED video displays, which have better resolution than
cathode-ray tubes but are expensive to build.
 &HT;    Color LED screens usually contain three different materials to
display the red, blue and green parts of the picture.
 &HT;    ``In the old technology, you had to fabricate each color
separately,'' Chou says. ``With this process, you can fabricate all
the colors at the same time, using the pillar height and size to
control the color.''
 &HT;    
 MODERN SWINGER  
 &HT;    In the robotics laboratory at Japan's Nagoya University, a
strange machine swings from bar to bar like a gibbon.
 &HT;    Toshio Fukuda and Jun Nakanishi, along with Dan Koditschek at
the University of Michigan, recognized that the primate's
arm-to-arm movement is a very complex form of locomotion and set
out to build a robot that could master it.
 &HT;    They demonstrated that a simple double joint _ essentially a
pendulum linked to another pendulum _ could perform the key
swinging motion.
 &HT;    Then the Nagoya group built the Brachiator III, which has legs
to generate initial momentum and a computer vision system to figure
out where to place its handlike grippers.
 &HT;    Nakanishi believes that lessons learned from building the
swinging robots will aid the design of future walking, hopping, or
jumping automatons.

 By BOB BERMAN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    On desolate mountaintops in Hawaii, Arizona and Chile, a group
of billion-dollar super-telescopes is about to expand the
boundaries of what we can see in space.
 &HT;    The language used to express these accomplishments may seem like
hieroglyphics. How many people will understand the technical
meanings of ``magnitude'' and ``arc second''?
 &HT;    But what really matters is that we'll be able to spot fainter
stars and galaxies, and they'll appear sharper than ever before.
 &HT;    Despite the boasts of ``500-power'' used by manufacturers of
cheap toy-store telescopes, the truest measure of an instrument's
worth is the diameter of its main lens or mirror, not its
magnifying power.
 &HT;    The Hale Telescope on Mount Palomar, which was the world's
largest for half a century, has a mirror 200 inches, or 5 meters,
across.
 &HT;    The just-completed Japanese Subaru Telescope is 8.2 meters
across, the twin Kecks are 10 meters each, the two Gemini 'scopes
are 8.1 meters, the upcoming Large Binocular Telescope sports dual
8.4-meter mirrors, and the European Very Large Telescope will be an
amazing 16.4 meters when completed in 2003.
 &HT;    The amount of light a telescope collects depends on the surface
area of its main lens or mirror. Each Keck mirror, twice as wide as
the one on Mount Palomar, can detect objects four times as faint.
 &HT;    Astronomers quantify the brightness of celestial objects with a
confusing term: magnitude. Higher numbers indicate fainter things;
each magnitude is about 2.5 times dimmer than the one before, so an
increase of five magnitudes denotes a hundredfold brightness drop.
 &HT;    White Vega and orange Arcturus, the bright stars now high in the
sky, are zero magnitude. The human eye can barely pick out
sixth-magnitude stars, some 250 times fainter.
 &HT;    Amateurs' telescopes collect enough light to make out stars of
magnitude 14. Keck dips down to the 29th magnitude. Hubble's
smallish mirror _ 2.4 meters across _ can detect 30th-magnitude
objects because it orbits above Earth's blurry atmosphere, so it
can concentrate starlight more precisely.
 &HT;    Thirtieth-magnitude objects shed as much light as the glow of a
cigarette in Hawaii as seen from Boston. The Very Large Telescope
will do even better, despite being earthbound.
 &HT;    Bigger mirrors also produce sharper images. Here the standard
scientific measure is the arc second, an angle 1/3,600 of a degree.
The sun and moon appear just under 2,000 arc seconds across.
 &HT;    A good backyard telescope reveals Jupiter's moons as little
disks, a 1-arc-second resolution. Hubble can resolve features as
small as 1/20 arc second. That is equivalent to standing in
Brooklyn and distinguishing the two headlamps of a taxicab in
Paris.
 &HT;    Although the new telescopic giants must peer through layers of
turbulent air, novel de-smudging techniques should allow them to
surpass even Hubble in sharpness.
 &HT;    Declassified adaptive-optics technology will allow them to
compensate for atmospheric distortion using deformable mirrors
attached to motorized pistons.
 &HT;    The Kecks and the Very Large Telescope will eventually combine
light from several telescopes, improving their resolution to
once-unimaginable levels. They may get down below 1/1,000 arc
second, good enough to pick out those headlights on a taxi driving
across the moon, 235,000 miles away _ a feat as astonishing as what
the cab's meter would be reading.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 FEARS FOR EARS  
 &HT;    American farmers have planted 20 million acres of genetically
modified corn, engineered to repel predatory insects without using
noxious chemicals.
 &HT;    If farmers are not careful, a new report warns, the scheme could
backfire and breed even more troublesome strains of pests.
 &HT;    The modified crops pump out Bt toxin, a natural insecticide
created by bacteria. Some insects, in turn, carry genes that
protect them from the toxin. To check the spread of those genes,
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requires that farmers
intersperse fields of genetically modified crops with islands of
non-modified plants.
 &HT;    The idea is that insects in the refuges would remain vulnerable
to Bt toxin, and the bugs would interbreed to keep the whole
population susceptible.
 &HT;    For the first time, scientists have proof the tactic works.
Entomologist Anthony Shelton of Cornell University and his
colleagues sowed fields of altered broccoli and then unleashed
broccoli-eating diamondback moths.
 &HT;    In fields containing refuges of non-modified plants, resistance
genes were less likely to be spread through the moth population.
 &HT;    But there is a big caveat. Spraying the refuges with pesticides
_ a common practice among farmers, and one permitted by EPA
regulations _ sped the appearance of toxin-resistant moths.
 &HT;    ``Any time you spray insects on a plant, you are never going to
get 100 percent mortality,'' Shelton says. ``You end up putting a
mosaic of doses on the plants-some high, and some low. Where the
doses are low, you won't kill all the insects, and those that
survive will be more likely to develop resistance.''
 &HT;    
 STAR TREK SYRINGE  
 &HT;    The doctors keep saying it won't hurt a bit, and it keeps
hurting. There's got to be a better way to get drugs into the body
than a brutal needle and syringe.
 &HT;    Chemist Terry Burkoth and his collaborators at PowderJect
Pharmaceuticals in Oxford, England, agree. They have replaced the
needle with a flashlight-size tube that uses a jet of helium to
accelerate powdered drugs to supersonic speeds.
 &HT;    Just press it against the skin, and the PowderJect system shoots
a dose directly into the underlying cells. The drug particles are
so small that the patient hardly feels a thing.
 &HT;    And the supersonic shot could make it easier for doctors to
deliver precise dosages of drugs to hard-to-reach regions just
below the skin's upper layer.
 &HT;    
 PICTURE-PERFECT PLASTIC  
 &HT;    Because of a rogue speck of dust floating around Stephen Chou's
lab at Princeton University, your next computer monitor may display
a much sharper image.
 &HT;    An electrical engineer, Chou was working on a better way to
configure polymer plastics used to make light-emitting diodes, or
LEDs, and other electronics.
 &HT;    One of his graduate students pressed a mask into a layer of
plastic, preparing to transform the material into a pattern of
electrical circuits. By a fluke, bits of dust got behind the mask.
When Chou removed it, he was startled to see that an array of
beautiful, highly regular microscopic pillars had sprung up where
the mask did not lie flush on the surface.
 &HT;    Chou thinks his polymer pillars will simplify the manufacturing
of LED video displays, which have better resolution than
cathode-ray tubes but are expensive to build.
 &HT;    Color LED screens usually contain three different materials to
display the red, blue and green parts of the picture.
 &HT;    ``In the old technology, you had to fabricate each color
separately,'' Chou says. ``With this process, you can fabricate all
the colors at the same time, using the pillar height and size to
control the color.''
 &HT;    
 MODERN SWINGER  
 &HT;    In the robotics laboratory at Japan's Nagoya University, a
strange machine swings from bar to bar like a gibbon.
 &HT;    Toshio Fukuda and Jun Nakanishi, along with Dan Koditschek at
the University of Michigan, recognized that the primate's
arm-to-arm movement is a very complex form of locomotion and set
out to build a robot that could master it.
 &HT;    They demonstrated that a simple double joint _ essentially a
pendulum linked to another pendulum _ could perform the key
swinging motion.
 &HT;    Then the Nagoya group built the Brachiator III, which has legs
to generate initial momentum and a computer vision system to figure
out where to place its handlike grippers.
 &HT;    Nakanishi believes that lessons learned from building the
swinging robots will aid the design of future walking, hopping, or
jumping automatons.

 By BOB BERMAN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    On desolate mountaintops in Hawaii, Arizona and Chile, a group
of billion-dollar super-telescopes is about to expand the
boundaries of what we can see in space.
 &HT;    The language used to express these accomplishments may seem like
hieroglyphics. How many people will understand the technical
meanings of ``magnitude'' and ``arc second''?
 &HT;    But what really matters is that we'll be able to spot fainter
stars and galaxies, and they'll appear sharper than ever before.
 &HT;    Despite the boasts of ``500-power'' used by manufacturers of
cheap toy-store telescopes, the truest measure of an instrument's
worth is the diameter of its main lens or mirror, not its
magnifying power.
 &HT;    The Hale Telescope on Mount Palomar, which was the world's
largest for half a century, has a mirror 200 inches, or 5 meters,
across.
 &HT;    The just-completed Japanese Subaru Telescope is 8.2 meters
across, the twin Kecks are 10 meters each, the two Gemini 'scopes
are 8.1 meters, the upcoming Large Binocular Telescope sports dual
8.4-meter mirrors, and the European Very Large Telescope will be an
amazing 16.4 meters when completed in 2003.
 &HT;    The amount of light a telescope collects depends on the surface
area of its main lens or mirror. Each Keck mirror, twice as wide as
the one on Mount Palomar, can detect objects four times as faint.
 &HT;    Astronomers quantify the brightness of celestial objects with a
confusing term: magnitude. Higher numbers indicate fainter things;
each magnitude is about 2.5 times dimmer than the one before, so an
increase of five magnitudes denotes a hundredfold brightness drop.
 &HT;    White Vega and orange Arcturus, the bright stars now high in the
sky, are zero magnitude. The human eye can barely pick out
sixth-magnitude stars, some 250 times fainter.
 &HT;    Amateurs' telescopes collect enough light to make out stars of
magnitude 14. Keck dips down to the 29th magnitude. Hubble's
smallish mirror _ 2.4 meters across _ can detect 30th-magnitude
objects because it orbits above Earth's blurry atmosphere, so it
can concentrate starlight more precisely.
 &HT;    Thirtieth-magnitude objects shed as much light as the glow of a
cigarette in Hawaii as seen from Boston. The Very Large Telescope
will do even better, despite being earthbound.
 &HT;    Bigger mirrors also produce sharper images. Here the standard
scientific measure is the arc second, an angle 1/3,600 of a degree.
The sun and moon appear just under 2,000 arc seconds across.
 &HT;    A good backyard telescope reveals Jupiter's moons as little
disks, a 1-arc-second resolution. Hubble can resolve features as
small as 1/20 arc second. That is equivalent to standing in
Brooklyn and distinguishing the two headlamps of a taxicab in
Paris.
 &HT;    Although the new telescopic giants must peer through layers of
turbulent air, novel de-smudging techniques should allow them to
surpass even Hubble in sharpness.
 &HT;    Declassified adaptive-optics technology will allow them to
compensate for atmospheric distortion using deformable mirrors
attached to motorized pistons.
 &HT;    The Kecks and the Very Large Telescope will eventually combine
light from several telescopes, improving their resolution to
once-unimaginable levels. They may get down below 1/1,000 arc
second, good enough to pick out those headlights on a taxi driving
across the moon, 235,000 miles away _ a feat as astonishing as what
the cab's meter would be reading.

   VIGILANTE-PRIEST (Lamitan, Philippines) _ Father Ceritto Nicorda

he has a problem with anger. By Indira A.R. Lakshmanan. 1450 words.

   COOP-EDUCATION (Boston) _ For much of the past century,

 By MERLE GINSBERG 
 (One color slide is available.) 
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    If hair is destiny, then Natasha Lyonne's future is going to be
huge. Not to mention wild and out of control.
 &HT;    Of course, hair isn't really destiny (unless you're Kirsty
Hume). But Lyonne, who grew up in Manhattan and went to an
exclusive private school with a bunch of what she calls ``total,
like, icy snobs,'' has her own idiosyncratic notions about the
world _ and one of them is that her mammoth strawberry-blond mane
has sealed her fate. And not necessarily in a good way.
 &HT;    ``I guess it depends on how you feel about Medusa,'' sighs the
diminutive Lyonne, 21. (As she speaks, her hair _ even after a
marathon blowdry _ is expanding a little in the New York humidity.)
 &HT;    ``I'm so fed up with being the kooky funny girl,'' she says.
``And I know it all starts with the hair. I'm not that funny. I'm
fairly antisocial, and I live in my head _ I'm always analyzing
everything. But having crazy hair always makes people think I'm
wild and funny.''
 &HT;    Then there are Lyonne's numerous other quirks: the
chain-smoking, the exaggerated New York accent (which, in
combination with her gravelly voice, makes her sound like a female
Harvey Fierstein), the hipster vocabulary and the long list of
outre interests, including a passion for slasher films.
 &HT;    Most wacky of all, however, is Lyonne's taste in film roles,
which seems to get even wackier as she gets older. Although she's
starred in a couple of studio films (most recently ``Slums of
Beverly Hills'' and ``American Pie''), she's much more likely to be
found in offbeat, semi-obscure indies such as the campy comedy
``But I'm a Cheerleader.''
 &HT;    In the film, Lyonne plays a girl who's sent away to a
conservative cheerleading camp after her parents and would-be
boyfriend begin to suspect she's gay. Naturally, while doing
splits, she falls for a girl (Clea Duvall). Following
``Cheerleader,'' Lyonne will appear this fall in something called
``Confessions of a Trickbaby.''
 &HT;    ``I'm still turning down mainstream movies all the time,'' the
actress says between constant puffs on a cigarette. ``I just keep
turning down that boring stuff.''
 &HT;    She adds that she's not always in the running for big Hollywood
projects, such as the upcoming ``Charlie's Angels.'' ``No one asked
me to be the third angel,'' she says with mock disappointment.
 &HT;    Actually, playing a tough-but-glamorous detective wouldn't be
much of a stretch for Lyonne, who's been standing up for herself
since she was a young girl. When her snooty Manhattan schoolmates
made fun of her hair, she beat them up. So independent was she as a
teen-ager that her mother let her get her own apartment.
 &HT;    ``Can you imagine an 18-year-old getting by a co-op board?''
Lyonne says with a snicker.
 &HT;    Lately, Lyonne says, she's been behaving more and more like a
true adult, much to her surprise.
 &HT;    ``I'm starting to realize that cashmere is more comfortable than
fishnets,'' she says, proud to have moved beyond the rock-chick
look. ``I'm starting to kind of like the idea of being a female.''
 &HT;    Much of her newfound maturity may stem from her very grown-up
relationship with 22-year-old actor Edward Furlong (``American
History X,'' ``Terminator 2''), whom she met on ``Detroit Rock
City'' more than a year ago.
 &HT;    ``We got the L.A. house, we got the dog, we got the DVDs,'' she
says. ``I even cook! Low carb.''
 &HT;    Lyonne suggests that no one but Furlong could have lured her
from New York to the West Coast.
 &HT;    ``I mean, I just spent a year and a half in L.A. just to be with
this dude!'' she says. ``He's one of the real ones _ true hot
stuff. But I was so based in New York and not willing to change
that. I was the big tough-ass New Yorker. Now he says he saw
through that at the very beginning, and that was what was so silly
and endearing about me _ putting on this tough act when I'm just
this little girl.''
 &HT;    Furlong and Lyonne are so devoted to each other that he became
fiercely jealous of her kissing scenes in ``Cheerleader'' _ even
though they were with a woman.
 &HT;    ``And Clea and I were already friends long before the movie,''
Lyonne says. ``The last thing we were going to do, since neither of
us is into girls, is go for each other.''
 &HT;    Lyonne played another gay character earlier this year _ a '70s
activist in HBO's ``If These Walls Could Talk II'' _ but she's not
too worried that the public will misconstrue her sexuality.
 &HT;    ``Everyone in high school thought I was gay, because they never
saw me with a guy,'' she says. ``Truth was, I couldn't get a date.
So I was happy they thought I was gay. At least that meant I wasn't
a loser.'' c.2000 Fairchild Publications

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 PARTY PALACE  
 &HT;    Prince Ernst-August of Hanover and his wife, Caroline of Monaco,
didn't really need an excuse to throw their first ball together at
Marienbourg, Ernst's 19th-century castle outside Hanover, Germany.
 &HT;    But Ernst reportedly told some of the 700 guests, who arrived in
a swarm of private jets, that the occasion was to celebrate the
appearance of their daughter Alexandra's first baby tooth. Security
was tight, and all the invitees _ with the sole exception of
Caroline's old friend Francois-Marie Banier _ were warned not to
bring cameras.
 &HT;    Everyone had to give a secret password to book a room at one of
the hotels Ernst had reserved in advance, although many guests
never actually made it back to their rooms on the night of the
party.
 &HT;    The festivities roared along until 8 a.m. as revelers guzzled
wine, table-hopped and danced to six orchestras _ which played
everything from waltzes to salsa _ through Marienbourg's endless
rooms. (Oversize television monitors allowed diners to keep an eye
on the action elsewhere in the castle.)
 &HT;    The crowd included plenty of nobles, such as Pierre d'Arenberg
and Michael of Greece, as well as the German families of
Furstenberg, Bismarck and Saxe-Weimar.
 &HT;    Then there was Karl Lagerfeld (who designed Caroline's dress and
the one worn by her daughter Charlotte), along with Valentino,
Hubert de Givenchy, Robert and Chantal Miller, Mick Flick, Philip
and Spyros Niarchos, Susan Gutfreund, Judy Taubman and Lynn Wyatt.
A send-off lunch had been scheduled for the next day, but nobody
made it.
 &HT;    ``They were too hungover,'' one guest explained.
 &HT;    
 UNDIE ACHIEVERS  
 &HT;    Having snubbed New York as ``too uptight'' to be the site of
Agent Provocateur's first U.S. store, the creators of London's
infamous naughty-lingerie-for-rich-girls line have decided to open
up shop this September on L.A.'s Melrose Avenue.
 &HT;    And word is that the company's first fragrance will make its
debut at the shop soon thereafter.
 &HT;    ``I think people like to look sexier in L.A.,'' says
designer/owner Serena Rees, whose peephole bras and sheer culotte
panties have found fans in Gwyneth Paltrow, Nicole Kidman and
Madonna. ``I mean, just look at how much they care about breasts
here.''
 &HT;    
 KRAVIS IN PARIS  
 &HT;    Paris is quietly whispering that Henry and Marie-Josee Kravis,
New York's billionaire Francophiles, are coming to town.
 &HT;    The Kravises, whose palatial New York spread is crammed with
major 18th-century furniture assembled with the help of decorator
Francois Joseph Graf, are said to have bought an apartment on
discreet rue de l'Universite.
 &HT;    Although it's reportedly a small pied-a-terre, the Kravises have
again enlisted the services of Graf, who's known as ``the emperor''
for his grand personality and grander work for such clients as
David and Olympia de Rothschild.
 &HT;    
 SILICON ICON  
 &HT;    He was the first designer to dress Hollywood, and now Giorgio
Armani has moved upstate to Silicon Valley.
 &HT;    The designer has positioned a particularly proactive manager in
his San Francisco store to help transform sartorially challenged
dot-com nerds.
 &HT;    ``We're talking about women who show up for an event dressed in
dresses and ... Nikes,'' said one fashion observer.
 &HT;    An Armani spokesman put it another way: ``These are people who
want to evolve from a very casual look to something easy but
elegant.''
 &HT;    
 JERSEY JON  
 &HT;    Guess who's no longer wearing head-to-toe Versace? Jon Bon Jovi.
 &HT;    The rocker/actor was spotted at a recent party in Monte Carlo
wearing a suit by a little-known L.A.-based company called Lords.
 &HT;    ``I'm breaking out of my mold,'' said Bon Jovi, showing off the
big-shouldered dark blue suit. ``But I still wear Italian suits:
Lords is designed by two Italian guys from Jersey.''

 By SHARON EDELSON 
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    ``When Are You Entitled to New Underwear and Other Major
Financial Decisions'' ... ``Prince Charming Isn't Coming: How Women
Get Smart About Money'' ... ``A Girl Needs Cash: How to Take Charge
of Your Financial Life.''
 &HT;    Judging by the titles of these recent financial self-help books
for women, you'd think that the fairer sex was positively clueless
about matters of money.
 &HT;    That common perception may help to explain the plethora of
candy-colored book covers and financial seminars packaged with
girlish pursuits.
 &HT;    Henri Bendel recently hosted an event called ``Make Over Your
Financial Future'' which paired the Laura Mercier team of makeup
artists with a Merrill Lynch financial adviser.
 &HT;    Then there's the marketing blurb for the personal-finance book
``Girls Just Want to Have Funds,'' which begins, ``If you know how
to deal with a bad hair day, you have what it takes to be a smart
investor.''
 &HT;    Jennifer Lang, an editor at Hyperion Press, which published
``Girls Just Want to Have Funds,'' says the title and marketing had
a lighthearted approach because ``a lot of the people who are going
to buy this book are younger women.''
 &HT;    But not everyone in the business of offering financial advice
thinks female equals flighty.
 &HT;    ``Publishers and authors sometimes underestimate women,'' says
Sue Herera, the co-anchor of CNBC's ``Business Center.'' ``More
women than ever are managing their portfolios or their family's
portfolios. Women are becoming a huge force in controlling wealth
in this country.''
 &HT;    And there is some evidence that authors and publishers are
catching on.
 &HT;    ``Some titles are a bit patronizing to women, and so are the
books,'' says Fred Hills, a Simon &AMP; Schuster vice president. ``They
presume that women are ignoramuses, when in fact, there are more
women entrepreneurs running small businesses than men.''
 &HT;    When Mary Farrell, a senior investment strategist at
PaineWebber, wrote her latest book, ``Beyond the Basics,'' she
included plenty of hard information on index funds, mutual funds
and identifying future financial trends.
 &HT;    ``There's nothing cutesy about Mary or the title or tone of the
book,'' says Hills, who edited ``Beyond the Basics.'' ``She is the
intelligent spokesperson for female investors, as opposed to the
dumb-blonde approach.''
 &HT;    Farrell, in fact, claims her book isn't specifically designed
for women (though book editors say the picture of her on the cover
is aimed at a female audience).
 &HT;    ``I did some research when I was trying to decide whether to
write a book,'' Farrell says. ``I was very surprised and angry at
how many feel-good books there are but not many books with hard
knowledge. So many of the books were like crisis management. They
just presented one anecdote after another of women as victims.''
 &HT;    Best-selling financial guru Suze Orman's ``9 Steps to Financial
Freedom,'' for example, offers more anecdotes than advice on stocks
and bonds.
 &HT;    Orman takes a psychological approach based on her belief that
women need to overcome their money fears _ about having it and not
having it. While many experts say women have made great strides,
Orman, who travels the country giving seminars, begs to differ.
 &HT;    ``It all depends on where the women live,'' she says. ``In
middle America, a lot of women still are clueless and have this
belief that their husbands know what they're doing with the
money.''
 &HT;    Maybe Orman has an audience among beginners, but financial
experts point out that female-only investment clubs regularly beat
the returns of men-only or mixed clubs.
 &HT;    Judith Briles Ph.D., author of ``10 Smart Money Moves for
Women,'' says men act on hot tips while women do more homework, and
a study by the University of California, Davis, found that men
trade more frequently than women _ and often earn lower returns as
a result.
 &HT;    The need for gender-specific financial advice may be a matter of
style more than substance.
 &HT;    ``Women like communicating with other women,'' says Jennifer
Openshaw, who founded wfn.com (Women's Financial Network). ``They
face different issues. They live longer than men, so they need to
save more in their lifetimes.''
 &HT;    Of course, the latest battleground for the hearts and wallets of
women is the Internet, where female-oriented Web sites such as
msmoney.com offer a no-nonsense approach, dispensing with feel-good
psychobabble and providing investment strategies for different
stages in a woman's life.
 &HT;    ``One of the big pluses for women is that there's never an issue
of being patronized or ignored on the Internet,'' says Briles, who
is also a spokeswoman for wingspanbank.com.
 &HT;    But even some New Economy entrepreneurs believe investment sites
need bells and whistles in order to be compelling to women.
 &HT;    Openshaw, for one, hired Sela Ward _ the actress who plays Lily,
a financially awkward single mom on ABC's ``Once and Again'' _ to
promote wfn.com.
 &HT;    ``Sela could be the poster child for everywoman,'' Openshaw
says. ``She says, 'Finances make my eyes glaze over.''' c.2000

 By MERLE GINSBERG 
 (One color slide is available.) 
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    If hair is destiny, then Natasha Lyonne's future is going to be
huge. Not to mention wild and out of control.
 &HT;    Of course, hair isn't really destiny (unless you're Kirsty
Hume). But Lyonne, who grew up in Manhattan and went to an
exclusive private school with a bunch of what she calls ``total,
like, icy snobs,'' has her own idiosyncratic notions about the
world _ and one of them is that her mammoth strawberry-blond mane
has sealed her fate. And not necessarily in a good way.
 &HT;    ``I guess it depends on how you feel about Medusa,'' sighs the
diminutive Lyonne, 21. (As she speaks, her hair _ even after a
marathon blowdry _ is expanding a little in the New York humidity.)
 &HT;    ``I'm so fed up with being the kooky funny girl,'' she says.
``And I know it all starts with the hair. I'm not that funny. I'm
fairly antisocial, and I live in my head _ I'm always analyzing
everything. But having crazy hair always makes people think I'm
wild and funny.''
 &HT;    Then there are Lyonne's numerous other quirks: the
chain-smoking, the exaggerated New York accent (which, in
combination with her gravelly voice, makes her sound like a female
Harvey Fierstein), the hipster vocabulary and the long list of
outre interests, including a passion for slasher films.
 &HT;    Most wacky of all, however, is Lyonne's taste in film roles,
which seems to get even wackier as she gets older. Although she's
starred in a couple of studio films (most recently ``Slums of
Beverly Hills'' and ``American Pie''), she's much more likely to be
found in offbeat, semi-obscure indies such as the campy comedy
``But I'm a Cheerleader.''
 &HT;    In the film, Lyonne plays a girl who's sent away to a
conservative cheerleading camp after her parents and would-be
boyfriend begin to suspect she's gay. Naturally, while doing
splits, she falls for a girl (Clea Duvall). Following
``Cheerleader,'' Lyonne will appear this fall in something called
``Confessions of a Trickbaby.''
 &HT;    ``I'm still turning down mainstream movies all the time,'' the
actress says between constant puffs on a cigarette. ``I just keep
turning down that boring stuff.''
 &HT;    She adds that she's not always in the running for big Hollywood
projects, such as the upcoming ``Charlie's Angels.'' ``No one asked
me to be the third angel,'' she says with mock disappointment.
 &HT;    Actually, playing a tough-but-glamorous detective wouldn't be
much of a stretch for Lyonne, who's been standing up for herself
since she was a young girl. When her snooty Manhattan schoolmates
made fun of her hair, she beat them up. So independent was she as a
teen-ager that her mother let her get her own apartment.
 &HT;    ``Can you imagine an 18-year-old getting by a co-op board?''
Lyonne says with a snicker.
 &HT;    Lately, Lyonne says, she's been behaving more and more like a
true adult, much to her surprise.
 &HT;    ``I'm starting to realize that cashmere is more comfortable than
fishnets,'' she says, proud to have moved beyond the rock-chick
look. ``I'm starting to kind of like the idea of being a female.''
 &HT;    Much of her newfound maturity may stem from her very grown-up
relationship with 22-year-old actor Edward Furlong (``American
History X,'' ``Terminator 2''), whom she met on ``Detroit Rock
City'' more than a year ago.
 &HT;    ``We got the L.A. house, we got the dog, we got the DVDs,'' she
says. ``I even cook! Low carb.''
 &HT;    Lyonne suggests that no one but Furlong could have lured her
from New York to the West Coast.
 &HT;    ``I mean, I just spent a year and a half in L.A. just to be with
this dude!'' she says. ``He's one of the real ones _ true hot
stuff. But I was so based in New York and not willing to change
that. I was the big tough-ass New Yorker. Now he says he saw
through that at the very beginning, and that was what was so silly
and endearing about me _ putting on this tough act when I'm just
this little girl.''
 &HT;    Furlong and Lyonne are so devoted to each other that he became
fiercely jealous of her kissing scenes in ``Cheerleader'' _ even
though they were with a woman.
 &HT;    ``And Clea and I were already friends long before the movie,''
Lyonne says. ``The last thing we were going to do, since neither of
us is into girls, is go for each other.''
 &HT;    Lyonne played another gay character earlier this year _ a '70s
activist in HBO's ``If These Walls Could Talk II'' _ but she's not
too worried that the public will misconstrue her sexuality.
 &HT;    ``Everyone in high school thought I was gay, because they never
saw me with a guy,'' she says. ``Truth was, I couldn't get a date.
So I was happy they thought I was gay. At least that meant I wasn't
a loser.'' c.2000 Fairchild Publications

 From WWD, W magazine and DNR) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 PARTY PALACE  
 &HT;    Prince Ernst-August of Hanover and his wife, Caroline of Monaco,
didn't really need an excuse to throw their first ball together at
Marienbourg, Ernst's 19th-century castle outside Hanover, Germany.
 &HT;    But Ernst reportedly told some of the 700 guests, who arrived in
a swarm of private jets, that the occasion was to celebrate the
appearance of their daughter Alexandra's first baby tooth. Security
was tight, and all the invitees _ with the sole exception of
Caroline's old friend Francois-Marie Banier _ were warned not to
bring cameras.
 &HT;    Everyone had to give a secret password to book a room at one of
the hotels Ernst had reserved in advance, although many guests
never actually made it back to their rooms on the night of the
party.
 &HT;    The festivities roared along until 8 a.m. as revelers guzzled
wine, table-hopped and danced to six orchestras _ which played
everything from waltzes to salsa _ through Marienbourg's endless
rooms. (Oversize television monitors allowed diners to keep an eye
on the action elsewhere in the castle.)
 &HT;    The crowd included plenty of nobles, such as Pierre d'Arenberg
and Michael of Greece, as well as the German families of
Furstenberg, Bismarck and Saxe-Weimar.
 &HT;    Then there was Karl Lagerfeld (who designed Caroline's dress and
the one worn by her daughter Charlotte), along with Valentino,
Hubert de Givenchy, Robert and Chantal Miller, Mick Flick, Philip
and Spyros Niarchos, Susan Gutfreund, Judy Taubman and Lynn Wyatt.
A send-off lunch had been scheduled for the next day, but nobody
made it.
 &HT;    ``They were too hungover,'' one guest explained.
 &HT;    
 UNDIE ACHIEVERS  
 &HT;    Having snubbed New York as ``too uptight'' to be the site of
Agent Provocateur's first U.S. store, the creators of London's
infamous naughty-lingerie-for-rich-girls line have decided to open
up shop this September on L.A.'s Melrose Avenue.
 &HT;    And word is that the company's first fragrance will make its
debut at the shop soon thereafter.
 &HT;    ``I think people like to look sexier in L.A.,'' says
designer/owner Serena Rees, whose peephole bras and sheer culotte
panties have found fans in Gwyneth Paltrow, Nicole Kidman and
Madonna. ``I mean, just look at how much they care about breasts
here.''
 &HT;    
 KRAVIS IN PARIS  
 &HT;    Paris is quietly whispering that Henry and Marie-Josee Kravis,
New York's billionaire Francophiles, are coming to town.
 &HT;    The Kravises, whose palatial New York spread is crammed with
major 18th-century furniture assembled with the help of decorator
Francois Joseph Graf, are said to have bought an apartment on
discreet rue de l'Universite.
 &HT;    Although it's reportedly a small pied-a-terre, the Kravises have
again enlisted the services of Graf, who's known as ``the emperor''
for his grand personality and grander work for such clients as
David and Olympia de Rothschild.
 &HT;    
 SILICON ICON  
 &HT;    He was the first designer to dress Hollywood, and now Giorgio
Armani has moved upstate to Silicon Valley.
 &HT;    The designer has positioned a particularly proactive manager in
his San Francisco store to help transform sartorially challenged
dot-com nerds.
 &HT;    ``We're talking about women who show up for an event dressed in
dresses and ... Nikes,'' said one fashion observer.
 &HT;    An Armani spokesman put it another way: ``These are people who
want to evolve from a very casual look to something easy but
elegant.''
 &HT;    
 JERSEY JON  
 &HT;    Guess who's no longer wearing head-to-toe Versace? Jon Bon Jovi.
 &HT;    The rocker/actor was spotted at a recent party in Monte Carlo
wearing a suit by a little-known L.A.-based company called Lords.
 &HT;    ``I'm breaking out of my mold,'' said Bon Jovi, showing off the
big-shouldered dark blue suit. ``But I still wear Italian suits:
Lords is designed by two Italian guys from Jersey.''

elements of that period are back _ with a ladylike slant.
 &HT;    This season's perfectly pulled-together ensembles pay homage to

 By SHARON EDELSON 
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    ``When Are You Entitled to New Underwear and Other Major
Financial Decisions'' ... ``Prince Charming Isn't Coming: How Women
Get Smart About Money'' ... ``A Girl Needs Cash: How to Take Charge
of Your Financial Life.''
 &HT;    Judging by the titles of these recent financial self-help books
for women, you'd think that the fairer sex was positively clueless
about matters of money.
 &HT;    That common perception may help to explain the plethora of
candy-colored book covers and financial seminars packaged with
girlish pursuits.
 &HT;    Henri Bendel recently hosted an event called ``Make Over Your
Financial Future'' which paired the Laura Mercier team of makeup
artists with a Merrill Lynch financial adviser.
 &HT;    Then there's the marketing blurb for the personal-finance book
``Girls Just Want to Have Funds,'' which begins, ``If you know how
to deal with a bad hair day, you have what it takes to be a smart
investor.''
 &HT;    Jennifer Lang, an editor at Hyperion Press, which published
``Girls Just Want to Have Funds,'' says the title and marketing had
a lighthearted approach because ``a lot of the people who are going
to buy this book are younger women.''
 &HT;    But not everyone in the business of offering financial advice
thinks female equals flighty.
 &HT;    ``Publishers and authors sometimes underestimate women,'' says
Sue Herera, the co-anchor of CNBC's ``Business Center.'' ``More
women than ever are managing their portfolios or their family's
portfolios. Women are becoming a huge force in controlling wealth
in this country.''
 &HT;    And there is some evidence that authors and publishers are
catching on.
 &HT;    ``Some titles are a bit patronizing to women, and so are the
books,'' says Fred Hills, a Simon &AMP; Schuster vice president. ``They
presume that women are ignoramuses, when in fact, there are more
women entrepreneurs running small businesses than men.''
 &HT;    When Mary Farrell, a senior investment strategist at
PaineWebber, wrote her latest book, ``Beyond the Basics,'' she
included plenty of hard information on index funds, mutual funds
and identifying future financial trends.
 &HT;    ``There's nothing cutesy about Mary or the title or tone of the
book,'' says Hills, who edited ``Beyond the Basics.'' ``She is the
intelligent spokesperson for female investors, as opposed to the
dumb-blonde approach.''
 &HT;    Farrell, in fact, claims her book isn't specifically designed
for women (though book editors say the picture of her on the cover
is aimed at a female audience).
 &HT;    ``I did some research when I was trying to decide whether to
write a book,'' Farrell says. ``I was very surprised and angry at
how many feel-good books there are but not many books with hard
knowledge. So many of the books were like crisis management. They
just presented one anecdote after another of women as victims.''
 &HT;    Best-selling financial guru Suze Orman's ``9 Steps to Financial
Freedom,'' for example, offers more anecdotes than advice on stocks
and bonds.
 &HT;    Orman takes a psychological approach based on her belief that
women need to overcome their money fears _ about having it and not
having it. While many experts say women have made great strides,
Orman, who travels the country giving seminars, begs to differ.
 &HT;    ``It all depends on where the women live,'' she says. ``In
middle America, a lot of women still are clueless and have this
belief that their husbands know what they're doing with the
money.''
 &HT;    Maybe Orman has an audience among beginners, but financial
experts point out that female-only investment clubs regularly beat
the returns of men-only or mixed clubs.
 &HT;    Judith Briles Ph.D., author of ``10 Smart Money Moves for

a study by the University of California, Davis, found that men

 &HT;    The need for gender-specific financial advice may be a matter of

 &HT;    Of course, the latest battleground for the hearts and wallets of

 &HT;    But even some New Economy entrepreneurs believe investment sites

 &HT;    Openshaw, for one, hired Sela Ward _ the actress who plays Lily,
a financially awkward single mom on ABC's ``Once and Again'' _ to
promote wfn.com.
 &HT;    ``Sela could be the poster child for everywoman,'' Openshaw
says. ``She says, 'Finances make my eyes glaze over.''' c.2000

CHENEY DELIVERS MEAT TO THE HUNGRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA -- There'd been precious little forage for
carnivores down at the bottom of Broad Street till Dick Cheney rode
the meat wagon onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it was raw meat time for the protein-starved loyalists,
whose pent-up longings for steaks, cutlets, ribs, and loin burst
into full fury at Cheney's invocation of the man the Republicans
love to hate.
</P>
<P>
   In a 180-swerve after two days of making nice, the delegates
declared war against Bill Clinton. Al Gore was a distant second,
almost an afterthought as the Bush machine ramped up its assault on
the man who cannot run to succeed himself, but who still mesmerizes
his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in together,'' said Cheney in his laconic delivery,
``Now let us see them off together.'' Like so many thousand umpires
giving the thumb's-out sign to an errant baserunner, the delegates
waved their reverse-Tomahawk-Chop in blissful unison. After being
penned in to narrow made-for-TV-guidelines by the Bush campaign
scripters, told to swallow their differences on abortion or
anything else and just mouth happy-talk to the trouble-seeking
press, the delegates rose to Cheney's trolled bait like hungry
trout.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the first hour of the first day, he (Bush) will restore
decency and intgegrity to the Oval Office. Soon, our men and women
in uniform will once again have a commander-in-chief they can
respect . . . help is on the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, joy! Oh, rapture! At last, the Clinton-bashing unleashed,
but maybe too late to enlarge the incredibly shrinking TV audience.
Interlarding excessive praise of his own guy with denunications of
the incumbent, in the fine old tradition of running mates doing the
heavy lifting of negative campaigning, Cheney blamed Clinton for
the sinkhole that is politics in D.C.: ``In Washington today,
politics has become war by other means, an endless onslaught of
accusation, a constant setting of groups one against another.''
Just look at what Bill Bradley said about Gore, humphed Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   If you were a Democrat, it was a night for a Philly cheese
steak, because you saw a lot of cheese atop the beef. Mike Dukakis
howled with laughter at the Bush camp's superfluity of supposedly
righteous indignation over negative campaigning. ``It's so phony,''
chortled the 1988 Democratic presidential nominee from his
Northeastern University office. ``Old George Bush _ he's very upset
about negative campaigning,'' laughed the Duke, who was savaged by
Bush's negative ads using black criminal Willie Horton. ``Let's
bring back character and integrity to the White House,'' jibed
Dukakis, ``like Iran-Contra.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the hall, the GOP felt triumphant. ``Mr. Gore tries to
separate himself from his leader's shadow,'' said Cheney, ``But
somehow we will never see one without thinking of the other.''
That's the Bush strategy laid bare: run against Clinton, against
Monica, against ``a definition of what `is' is.'' But that also
means running against record-breaking prosperity, the lowest
unemployment in decades, America's might unchallenged abroad.
Morphing Gore out of Clinton's profile can backfire, if voters
prefer what they've got to the risk of change.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was preaching to the choir here. But we don't yet know if
the rest of America wants to join this particular church. Cheney is
a bit of a flatliner in the oratory department. As a longtime
handler of political frontmen the former defense secretary is
even-toned, discreet, self-effacing. He delivery was crisp; the
bones he tossed the ravenous and raptuous gang in the hall drew
bell-ringing applause in almost every paragraph. But there was a
disconnect between his message and his mien.
</P>
<P>
   At 59, Cheney is only five years older than the guy who picked
him, and has five times as much political experience at the
national level. But his health and energy level are suspect, after
three heart attacks, a bypass, and a weight gain that makes him
look more than five years Bush's senior. Few politicians get to
make half-hour speeches on national television in front of
thousands of riotously happy partisans. There's a knack to it.
Cheney spent half his air time smiling blandly, sometimes
quizzically, as the crowd responded to his sallies with
full-throated roars. He waited patiently for the recurring din to
subside, smiling wanly at some junctures, a Jack Benny look-a-like
playing the classic straight man.
</P>
<P>
   It was a gear shift of an evening for the thoughful Cheney,
whose hallmark has been careful assessment and cautious judgment.
The role change from bespectacled bureaucrat Clark Kent to
fire-breathing Superman was jarring to those who know Cheney's
past. But he has changed before, from anonymous backroom staff guy
to war-waging defense secretary to multi-millionaire oil-company
oligarch as he doubled Halliburton Corp.'s government contracts in
five years as CEO to more than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney told the delegates he left Washington eight years ago in
a U-Haul truck he drove to Wyoming. Now, if he wins, he'll need an
armored car to cart away $40 million-plus in stock options from
Halliburton's Texas headquarters.

INDONESIA'S FORMER PRESIDENT SUHARTO CHARGED WITH CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Sick, bewildered and besieged at his home
by angry protesters, former President Suharto was formally charged
Thursday with corruption during his 32 years of unchecked power in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The charge involves only a small portion of the widespread
corruption that characterized his rule, but it sends a significant
signal of Indonesia's attempts to overhaul its economy and
political system and lay the basis for the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   President Abdurrahman Wahid has said repeatedly that he would
pardon his predecessor but only after the legal process is
complete. He has also suggested that Suharto could strike a deal by
returning his wealth to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Unless his lawyers can use his illness and mental incapacity
following a stroke to delay things, Suharto, 79, could be put on
trial this month, said Attorney General Marzuki Darusman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The official charge legally, of course, will be done in the
courtroom,'' Darusman said. ``But as of today he has been
officially charged by the attorney general's office.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the attorney general was trying to hurry
things in advance of a state-of-the nation address by Wahid next
week. Progress in the case may be one of the few concrete
accomplishments Wahid will be able to present as his country
struggles to find its footing following Suharto's forced
resignation in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The charge _ like a series of interrogations that led up to it _
was presented at Suharto's home in central Jakarta, where he has
been confined to house arrest since May.
</P>
<P>
   Unappeased, a small group of mostly young protesters rallied in
the streets outside his home, as they have many times before,
raising a familiar battle cry: ``Hang Suharto!''
</P>
<P>
   Both prosecutors and defense lawyers have said the former
president is frail and has shown difficulty comprehending and
answering questions. They offered conflicting accounts Thursday on
whether he had been alert enough to sign a formal acknowledgment of
the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person who cannot explain his thoughts should not be put on
trial,'' said Muhamad Assegaf, one of Suharto's lawyers. But the
attorney general's office said its case also included the testimony
of more than 100 witnesses, including three of his six children.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Thursday's proceedings involved the presentation of
the case to the city prosecutor's office by Darusman's office.
Lawyers on both sides said Suharto's status had shifted from ``the
suspect'' to ``the accused.''
</P>
<P>
   The case focuses on the misuse of at least $150 million funneled
through tax-free charitable foundations controlled by Suharto. That
falls far short of the billions of dollars he is widely reported to
have stolen, along with his family and circle of favored friends.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Darusman said he was seeking to carve a narrow and provable case
out of a complex web of financial manipulation during Suharto's
tenure, much of it legalized at the time by presidential decrees.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last month, he said investigators had not been
able to find any money hidden overseas and were concentrating on
the former president's assets in Indonesia. Two buildings connected
to the charitable foundations have been seized by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Though Thursday's action symbolized the government's good
intentions, there has been little progress so far in reforming the
laws and institutions that Suharto manipulated for his own gain.
</P>
<P>
   The major monopolies of the Suharto years have mostly been
broken, said James Castle, who heads The Castle Group, a leading
consulting and investment advising company. And there is less
large-scale corruption because there are fewer lucrative
investments in Indonesia's slumping economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, corruption is down, but the opportunities for it are
down,'' Castle said. ``And we are still waiting for the legal
reforms that would assure that when things pick up it does not
reappear like before. Unfortunately, we haven't had a really good
chance to test things yet.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For some Indonesians, Thursday's action was far from
satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Hasibuan, a human rights lawyer who leads a private group
called Corruption Watch, said he was disappointed by the narrow
focus of the case. ``The charges should include not only the
foundations but also the collusion and nepotism which has benefited
the children and the cronies and has robbed the state of billions
of dollars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a political scientist who
was an adviser to former President Habibie _ who held power for 17
months before Wahid's election _ said she did not believe that most
Indonesians really wanted Suharto to go to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Although people do want the case to go forward, she said, ``few
of the political elite want to see Suharto behind bars.''
</P>
<P>
   But they apparently do not want to see him on their banknotes,
either.
</P>
<P>
   As of Aug. 21, the 50,000 rupiah bill that bears his image (once
worth $20 and now worth less than $6) will no longer be legal
tender. In its place, a new banknote carries a portrait of the
composer of the national anthem, Wage Rudolf Soepratman.

 THE 1958 DUAL-GHIA WAS A CONCEPT AS LOFTY AS ITS FINS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are cruisin' through the rolling southwest Vermont
countryside like a land shark: sleek nose, fins raking the air like
razors.
</P>
<P>
   I've got both hands on a steering wheel that seems as big as the
wheel on a sailboat and the car's suspension lets it float enough
up front that you feel that you might, indeed, be making your way
over the water.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but we've also got a 329-hemi _ two four-barreled carbs and
400 horsepower _ under the hood. And we've got history on our side.
That's because we're behind the wheel of a Dual-Ghia 400, a one-off
prototype built for the 1958 New York Auto Show.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen this car before and now, at an invitational
drive-and-ride at Hemmings Motor News headquarters in Bennington,
Vt., and thanks to the trust and generosity of this rare car's
owner, I'm behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   That owner is Fred Kanter, who with brother Dan founded Kanter
Auto Parts, a major supplier of restoration parts for collector
cars. Fred Kanter was 13 when the car caught his eye at the auto
show. In 1977, three hours after he heard its owner had put it up
for sale, he bought it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it basks in unretouched original glory. The thick coat of
Italian paint that covers its Ghia body is cracked like enamel in
places, but original. The roof, patched here and there, is original
as well. Everything about the car remains as built by Dual Motors
of Detroit more than four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Its wedge shape was developed in a wind tunnel _ a first for its
day. Beneath its Italian-designer skin lurks a 1957 Chrysler 300C,
kin to the hottest cars of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The inside, chrome and leather _ even the door handles are woven
leather straps _ is part art deco, part fine Italian furniture.
It's three-speed Torqueflite automatic transmission is operated by
five rectangular buttons at the center of the dash. There is no
parking gear. To start the Dual-Ghia, you turn the key, then push
the ``Neutral'' button.
</P>
<P>
   You get a throaty, basso rumble that veritably roars when you
stomp the gas on the highway. You get a ride right out of the past
and, should you choose, you get Percy Faith and His Orchestra
playing from ``Romantic Moods'' on the 16 2/3-r.p.m. record player
built into the dash. You get a top speed of 140 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, you get to drive a piece of history, a car far ahead
of its time, whose shape, style, and power have been found in cars
down the decades ever since.
</P>
<P>
   But driving pieces out of history is what this annual Hemmings
event for automotive journalists, choice collectors, and others
with industry connections is all about, and here are some other
notables available for them to play with:
</P>
<P>
   --Besides the Dual-Ghia, my favorite was a 1946 Ford Super
DeLuxe station wagon. You'd recognize it immediately as a
``Woody.'' What you might not recognize it as is an early SUV. Sits
high, has huge legroom, headroom, three bench seats, plenty of
cargo space. The lingering throwback is the presence of two
ashtrays built into the dash _ back from the days when even doctors
told us in ads that cigarettes were good for us. A predictor of
things to come in SUVs is the gas mileage: 12-15 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   --In fact, driving old cars shows you how far we have come in
gas-mileage figures. Most six- and eight-cylinder cars from back
then got between 10 and 20 miles per gallon. The 1957 Ford Custom
V8, the 1940 Buick Century, and the Hudson Terraplane delivery
sedan all got 10-13. By 1958 you had a Volvo PV 445 that delivered
a whopping 15-20 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   --And of further interest at the Hemmings ride-and-drive: a 1973
Volvo P1800ES 2(plus)2. Always looked like an interesting sports
car to me. Drives like a truck. A 1934 Ford Tow Truck _ 90
horsepower V-8 engine, $600 new, about $175 extra for the
hand-cranked crane at the rear. And a 1930 Ford ``Doodlebug'' _ a
Sears, Roebuck creation with a ladder frame, 40-horsepower engine,
open cockpit, and gear-driven (as in gears at each end of the rear
axle transferring power to gears that line the inside of the rear
wheels). Talk about low-range torque.

FORD'S FOCUS FILLS A NICHE, BUT ITS SEATS COME UP EMPTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, let's talk about the biggest flaw in the Ford Focus and
get right to the bottom: the front seats.
</P>
<P>
   They are just too uncomfortable. When I drove the
top-of-the-line 2000 Focus ZTS in October of last year, I noted
that the seats were ``a bit soft'' but also said they were
comfortable. What was I thinking?
</P>
<P>
   I got the soft part right, but this time, in the 2000 Focus ZX3,
the base model, they proved not only soft, but too restrictive,
even pinching, up the back, and tiring on a long trip.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has done everything else with this car in such a superb
manner, here's hoping they broaden the seat backs and give better
thigh support in the future. But enough grumping.
</P>
<P>
   It is refreshing to see an American auto manufacturer step
effectively into the fray to sell in a market _ small, inexpensive
cars _ that American manufacturers have either virtually given up
on or competed poorly in of late.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors' Ron Zarella, the company's North American
president, acknowledged that GM has essentially lost the market to
Koreans. And certainly, this has been a niche dominated by Asian
manufacturers: Toyota Echo, Honda Civic, Nissan Sentra, Daewoo
Nubira, Hyundai Elantra, Kia Sophia. Dodge jumped in with the Neon,
and Ford has entered with great fanfare and acceptance with the
Focus.
</P>
<P>
   And they've done it obviously understanding that small and
inexpensive doesn't have to mean cheap, dangerous, or underpowered
anymore. Four-cylinder engines with 16 valves can crank out plenty
of power. Air bags, child-safety-seat tethers, and spaciousness can
be part of any small car.
</P>
<P>
   The Focus, which can be purchased from $12,000 to $16,000, is
offered as a three-door coupe (the ZX3 of this review), four-door
sedan, and five-door wagon. Two engines, both inline fours, are
offered, one that produces about 110 horsepower, the other 130.
Interestingly, the more powerful 2.0-liter, 16-valve Zetec is
standard in the ZX3, the entry-level car. Four-speed automatic and
five-speed manual transmissions are available, and I'm a fan of the
manual. It makes this front-wheel-drive car more fun.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier test of the top-of-the-line ZTS showed it to be so
roomy it had a van-like feel, from the high roof to the huge
windshield and the hood that dropped away so quickly you could not
see it from the driver's seat. Ford, with its ``New Edge'' styling
has gone distinctly European with the Focus and that trait may be
most noticeable in the ZX3, which struck me as a bigger, crisper
version of the Volkswagen Golf.
</P>
<P>
   The New Edge program is meant to appeal to younger drivers and,
given their need to carry gear _ skis, boards, camping equipment,
the ``three-door'' _ OK, let's say hatchback like in the old days _
may be the most appealing model. The trunk is cavernous and with a
tall roofline can be piled high, especially if you fold down the
60/40 split rear seat. You could sleep back there waiting for a
morning assault on the barricades at the next Phish concert.
</P>
<P>
   Dashboard ergonomics are modern _ an airplane-cockpit feel to
the tilt-to-the-driver presentation of audio and climate controls,
while all instrumentation is behind the wheel, with the tachometer
and speedometer at center, and the fuel and temperature gauges at
opposite ends of this instrument oval.
</P>
<P>
   There is good storage space in front-door slots _ though the car
could use a between-seats bin up front _ and the glove compartment
is big, as well.
</P>
<P>
   While the 135-horsepower engine has plenty of zip, it is aided
by the fact that Ford kept this car light. Both engines have
aluminum cylinder heads, pistons, and oil pan. The three-door
weighs just over 2,500 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   It gives you a graceful and quiet ride, cruising smoothly at 55
while turning just over 2,000 rpms and hitting 3,000 only when
passing at 75. This effortless power let the Focus get just under
28 miles per gallon in mixed highway and country driving.
</P>
<P>
   In designing the ``ride'' for the Focus, Ford tried to find a
middle ground behind hard and soft.
</P>
<P>
   You may have seen the commercial: a group of Gen-Y'ers, all with
some sort of drink in hand, is in a Focus as it cruises toward a
railroad crossing. ``Dude!'' each of the passengers says in warning
that the driver ought to slow down so that no drinks will be
spilled. ``Dooooooood!'' they cry in happy unison when the car,
still at speed, romps smoothly over the tracks without a drop of
spillage.
</P>
<P>
   Effective _ though not as daring as a commercial I remember from
a ``Saturday Night Live'' skit in which a circumcision was
performed in the back seat of a bouncing auto _ but what does a
ride so soft really mean?
</P>
<P>
   It means you get a certain floatiness, particularly in the
steering, on the highway and a softness in cornering. Straight
ahead, the ride is wonderful. However, given that Ford is aiming
this car at younger _ and presumably somewhat more aggressive _
drivers, they ought to tighten it up a bit for some in-corner
handling.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be hard to tweak, with a front suspension that
includes struts, coil springs, dampers and antiroll bar, and a
fully independent rear setup with damper units and antiroll bars.
</P>
<P>
   They also ought to go with disc brakes all around.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, this is a great debut of a new model for Ford and I am
sure you will spot Focuses on college campuses all over America
this year. To help lure young buyers, Ford offers options for the
active lifestyle _ bicycle racks, backpacks that hang over the
backs of the front seats, switchable seat covers. And while a fine
car for the young, the Focus would be a good buy for older drivers
looking for that get-around-town car.
</P>
<P>
   Now if only they'd improve those front seats.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The child-safety-seat tethers at the tops of the seat. They
show somebody was thinking about who would be buying this car.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --Antilock brakes are a $400 option. They ought to be standard
on every car built today, and if that means the base price has to
be $400 higher, so be it. Safety should not be an option.

HENEY DELIVERS MEAT TO THE HUNGRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA -- There'd been precious little forage for
carnivores down at the bottom of Broad Street till Dick Cheney rode
the meat wagon onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it was raw meat time for the protein-starved loyalists,
whose pent-up longings for steaks, cutlets, ribs, and loin burst
into full fury at Cheney's invocation of the man the Republicans
love to hate.
</P>
<P>
   In a 180-swerve after two days of making nice, the delegates
declared war against Bill Clinton. Al Gore was a distant second,
almost an afterthought as the Bush machine ramped up its assault on
the man who cannot run to succeed himself, but who still mesmerizes
his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in together,'' said Cheney in his laconic delivery,
``Now let us see them off together.'' Like so many thousand umpires
giving the thumb's-out sign to an errant baserunner, the delegates
waved their reverse-Tomahawk-Chop in blissful unison. After being
penned in to narrow made-for-TV-guidelines by the Bush campaign
scripters, told to swallow their differences on abortion or
anything else and just mouth happy-talk to the trouble-seeking
press, the delegates rose to Cheney's trolled bait like hungry
trout.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the first hour of the first day, he (Bush) will restore
decency and intgegrity to the Oval Office. Soon, our men and women
in uniform will once again have a commander-in-chief they can
respect . . . help is on the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, joy! Oh, rapture! At last, the Clinton-bashing unleashed,
but maybe too late to enlarge the incredibly shrinking TV audience.
Interlarding excessive praise of his own guy with denunications of
the incumbent, in the fine old tradition of running mates doing the
heavy lifting of negative campaigning, Cheney blamed Clinton for
the sinkhole that is politics in D.C.: ``In Washington today,
politics has become war by other means, an endless onslaught of
accusation, a constant setting of groups one against another.''
Just look at what Bill Bradley said about Gore, humphed Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   If you were a Democrat, it was a night for a Philly cheese
steak, because you saw a lot of cheese atop the beef. Mike Dukakis
howled with laughter at the Bush camp's superfluity of supposedly
righteous indignation over negative campaigning. ``It's so phony,''
chortled the 1988 Democratic presidential nominee from his
Northeastern University office. ``Old George Bush _ he's very upset
about negative campaigning,'' laughed the Duke, who was savaged by
Bush's negative ads using black criminal Willie Horton. ``Let's
bring back character and integrity to the White House,'' jibed
Dukakis, ``like Iran-Contra.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the hall, the GOP felt triumphant. ``Mr. Gore tries to
separate himself from his leader's shadow,'' said Cheney, ``But
somehow we will never see one without thinking of the other.''
That's the Bush strategy laid bare: run against Clinton, against
Monica, against ``a definition of what `is' is.'' But that also
means running against record-breaking prosperity, the lowest
unemployment in decades, America's might unchallenged abroad.
Morphing Gore out of Clinton's profile can backfire, if voters
prefer what they've got to the risk of change.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was preaching to the choir here. But we don't yet know if
the rest of America wants to join this particular church. Cheney is
a bit of a flatliner in the oratory department. As a longtime
handler of political frontmen the former defense secretary is
even-toned, discreet, self-effacing. He delivery was crisp; the
bones he tossed the ravenous and raptuous gang in the hall drew
bell-ringing applause in almost every paragraph. But there was a
disconnect between his message and his mien.
</P>
<P>
   At 59, Cheney is only five years older than the guy who picked
him, and has five times as much political experience at the
national level. But his health and energy level are suspect, after
three heart attacks, a bypass, and a weight gain that makes him
look more than five years Bush's senior. Few politicians get to
make half-hour speeches on national television in front of
thousands of riotously happy partisans. There's a knack to it.
Cheney spent half his air time smiling blandly, sometimes
quizzically, as the crowd responded to his sallies with
full-throated roars. He waited patiently for the recurring din to
subside, smiling wanly at some junctures, a Jack Benny look-a-like
playing the classic straight man.
</P>
<P>
   It was a gear shift of an evening for the thoughful Cheney,
whose hallmark has been careful assessment and cautious judgment.
The role change from bespectacled bureaucrat Clark Kent to
fire-breathing Superman was jarring to those who know Cheney's
past. But he has changed before, from anonymous backroom staff guy
to war-waging defense secretary to multi-millionaire oil-company
oligarch as he doubled Halliburton Corp.'s government contracts in
five years as CEO to more than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney told the delegates he left Washington eight years ago in
a U-Haul truck he drove to Wyoming. Now, if he wins, he'll need an
armored car to cart away $40 million-plus in stock options from
Halliburton's Texas headquarters.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Bolsheviks for Bush
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Here I am, a Democrat being trampled in stampede
of Republican elephants. That's as good an excuse as any to act
like a jackass.
</P>
<P>
   This was no spur-of-the-moment bad decision. I had given it a
lot of aforethought before I ever got here.
</P>
<P>
   It was an idea that goes back a decade.
</P>
<P>
   That's when, on assignment in the old Soviet Union, a Russian
friend presented me with a red velvet Communist banner complete
with a picture of Lenin and some sort of party slogan emblazoned
across it.
</P>
<P>
   I forgot to ask at the time, and never had a way to later find
out, exactly what the slogan said.
</P>
<P>
   But I've treasured the banner ever since and proudly display it
on the wall of my office.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, it caught my eye as I was packing for the
trip to Philadelphia to cover the GOP National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Without thinking twice, I stuffed it into my bag. You just never
know when you're going to need a Communist banner, particularly at
a GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it came in handy.
</P>
<P>
   A multitude of delegates and members of the media were being
housed at hotels at the airport. Shuttle buses were running for
anyone who needed a ride. So it was that most days I'd join folks
from the North Carolina delegation for the trip to the convention
center.
</P>
<P>
   I always made it a point to dress appropriately, coat and tie,
for rubbing well-tailored elbows with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But the next to last night, I made an exception. I made a
fashion statement.
</P>
<P>
   My determination reinforced by influential beverages, I put on
my old faded blue jeans, a wrinkled cotton shirt, a flaming red
gimme cap advertising my hometown's ZOO park railroad and then...
and then ...
</P>
<P>
   And then I draped the Communism banner around my neck.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans claim they are for inclusiveness. I wanted to
see just how inclusive them could be.
</P>
<P>
   An eight-inch cigar clamped between my teeth, I arrived early at
the bus stop behind the hotel. By the time the bus got there, we
had a full load -- all the better to gauge reaction.
</P>
<P>
   But they're shifty, those Republicans. They be looking at my
banner, but when I'd look at them, they'd look away. Everytime, it
was the same.
</P>
<P>
   After awhile I started singing just loud enough to be heard,
``Look away, look away, look away, Re-pub-li-cans.''
</P>
<P>
   We all spilled off the bus at the convention center. They went
their way, I went my mine. I was almost home free when a woman
security guard stopped me for a closer look at my credentials.
</P>
<P>
   But what she was really eyeing was my banner.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does that say?'' she asked, her jaw set.
</P>
<P>
   Casually, I removed the cigar from between my teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bolsheviks for Bush,'' I said, evenly.
</P>
<P>
   She paused a long moment, looking at me and then again at the
banner.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' she finally nodded, ``go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, if that's not inclusiveness I don't know what it is. The
Republicans have even made room for compassionate communists.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I was a little disappointed nobody asked who the picture
was. I was ready for that.
</P>
<P>
   I was going to tell them it was George W. Bush's grandfather.

BARAK MEETS EGYPTIAN LEADER TO DISCUSS PEACE WITH PALESTINIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak met Thursday
with President Hosni Mubarak, saying he wanted to clarify for the
Egyptian leader his desire to reach a peace agreement with the
Palestinians once they show ``responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, in the port city of Alexandria, lasted about two
hours. Mubarak had met with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat,
on Wednesday in Alexandria, Arafat's summer residence.
</P>
<P>
   It was Barak's first excursion outside Israel since returning
from the peace talks in Camp David, Md., last week and then
watching his governing coalition begin to crumble.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 days of negotiations ended without an accord, and Israel
has blamed Arafat for their failure, an accusation that Arab
leaders, including Mubarak, have rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found in Egypt a listening ear to the complexity of the
problem,'' Barak was quoted by the Associated Press as saying after
his meeting Thursday. ``I clarified that we are ready to do what is
necessary to achieve an agreement, but we have important interests,
and an agreement will only be achieved if the other side
demonstrates openness, seriousness and responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Egypt has played a pivotal role during the past seven years as a
mediator for the Palestinians and successive Israeli prime
ministers. The first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel, in 1979, Egypt has also had the closest ties to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The summit meeting at Camp David, and its aftermath of
recriminations, have soured Mubarak's relations with both
countries. Still, the Egyptian president has been meeting
constantly with fellow Arab leaders since the negotiations broke
down, in an attempt to maintain some momentum in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of Palestinian sovereignty over Arab East
Jerusalem, which Egypt has supported and Israel has steadfastly
rejected, Mubarak has given no indication that he will bend in
consideration of Barak's domestic troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we supposed to pressure President Arafat to make
concessions on Jerusalem?'' said Foreign Minister Amr Moussa after
Thursday's meeting. ``It is not our role to ask any side to accept,
without discussion, a stand proposed by the other side. Our role is
to make the two sides reach a fair, reasonable and balanced
stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, meanwhile, continued on his own peripatetic mission to
explain his position. He has already visited France, as well as
North Africa and several other Arab states, and Thursday he arrived
in Johannesburg for a meeting with former South African President
Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these meetings between Arab leaders are preparing the Arab
world for compromises on issues other than Jerusalem,'' said
Mohammed Said Said, a researcher at the Al Ahram Center for
Political and Strategic Studies here. ``Egypt is sending a very
clear message to America that, even though Egyptian-American and
Egyptian-Israeli relations are very strained now, it will not
change its stance over Jerusalem.''

 &HT;     (For Release Sunday, August 6)  
 &HT;     Republicans dislike Clinton, but like his political strategy 
 &HT;     (For use by New :York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The relationship between the George W. Bush's
Republicans and Bill Clinton is a fascinating study in
contradictions. On the one hand, GOP leaders express their disgust
with the president's behavior and speak longingly of having a chief
executive worthy of their respect.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, their decision to transform the GOP's image
by opening the party's doors widely to African Americans, Hispanics
and gays copies the strategy that twice won the presidency for
Clinton and the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a self-proclaimed new Democrat, moved his party to the
center of the political spectrum and away from its left-wing
moorings in 1992. Bush and his triumphant brethren have shifted the
GOP away from its ultra-conservative base and into the mainstream
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Republican platform continues to support a
constitutional amendment to end abortion, Bush, if elected, is
expected to do little to achieve that objective. The platform does
not, as in years past, demand abolition of the Department of
Education. Instead, Bush advocates a strong federal role in
boosting the education of American youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bush's wife, Laura, a former schoolteacher and
librarian, devoted her televised convention speech last Monday
night to the theme that no child should be left behind.
</P>
<P>
   That same night, retired Army Gen. Colin Powell, arguably the
most admired man in America, challenged his fellow Republicans to
``bring the promise of America to everyone'' and to spread the
legacy of Abraham Lincoln throughout the land.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates even applauded him when he announced that he supports
a woman's right to choose, a policy despised by abortion opponents,
and affirmative action, which most Republicans have opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Old Party just ain't what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is that the new Republican leadership,
represented by Bush and the man he beat for the GOP nomination,
Arizona Sen. John McCain, have watched Clinton's successful
stewardship of the Democratic party and learned from it.
</P>
<P>
   After months of public attention to his outrageous personal
behavior, Clinton still can thrill a partisan crowd with his
rhetoric and demonstrate that the way to success in politics is
through diversity and the inclusion of voters who once were outside
a party's perimeters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began his presidency badly by spending an inordinate
amount of time trying to keep his campaign promise clear the way
for gays in the military. Then, after failing to win passage of the
massive health care plan that he and Hillary devised and losing
control of Congress to Newt Gingrich's Republicans in 1994, Clinton
proclaimed that the days of big government ``are over.''
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Clinton was viewed as something of a political
corpse; his presidency was considered to be nearly over.
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly adapted his policies to the realities expressed
by voters in 1994 and defeated Bob Dole for president in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He won the votes of African-Americans, Hispanics, women and gays
by making the Democratic Party hospitable to them.
</P>
<P>
   To convert Clinton's strategy into a winning stance for
Republicans, Bush and Company have played down their ties to the
religious right and their party's tradition of appealing primarily
to white males, leaving African Americans, Hispanics, Asians and
gays outside their door.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, evangelist Pat Robertson, a staunch Bush supporter in
the South Carolina primary, which was dominated by the rightwing,
described the Philadelphia convention as ``four days of Pablum.''
He said he longed for the days when Republicans fought vigorously
over issues.
</P>
<P>
   But Pablum is exactly the main course that Bush ordered served
at the convention that nominated him for president.
</P>
<P>
   Those like Robertson who long for the era of magnificent
Republican confrontations could recall the bitter showdown between
the mainstream forces of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower and the narrow
conservative and isolationist forces led by Ohio Senator Robert A.
Taft in 1952. Ike won that one.
</P>
<P>
   Or they could look back to 1964, and the vicious battle between
Barry Goldwater's ultra-conservative supporters and the more
liberal wing of the party led by New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller
It was at the GOP convention in San Francisco that year that
conservative delegates mercilessly booed Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater won the nomination but was badly trounced by Lyndon
Johnson in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Convention delegates also might gaze back just eight years to
Pat Buchanan's fiery speech on the ``moral crisis'' in America _ a
lengthy harangue against gays, immigrants, supporters of abortion
and liberals that forced Ronald Reagan to delay his last televised
speech to a Republican convention until after prime time.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's convention, Bush and his brethren arranged for
African-Americans and Hispanics to play highly visible roles in the
televised unfolding political drama. They served as speakers, as
entertainers, as leaders in salutes to the Stars and Stripes and as
theatrical ``extras'' providing onstage audiences for appearances
by the party's stars.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party of George W. Bush is _ at least on the
surface _ a different party that that of George Herbert Walker
Bush, Ronald Reagan and Bob Dole. In November, we will learn
whether the transition is successful.

SOMETHING SMELLS FISHY IN SWEDEN  

</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not too early to book a flight to Sweden for next year,
when the world's first rotten fish museum is scheduled to open.
</P>
<P>
   According to Reuters, the museum will tell the story of a
fermented fish dish called surstromming (sour herring), a Swedish
delicacy that unsophisticated outsiders claim has the aroma of dog
excrement.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, only 2 percent of Sweden's 800,000 cans of surstromming
are exported each year, making it hard to find on the shelves of
your local Publix. For those of you who would like to make some at
home, all you basically have to do is get a tub o' herring,
sprinkle a little salt on it, and then let it stand in the sun
until that mouth-watering kennel-like aroma wafts through your
window, or your house is covered with flies, whichever comes first.
</P>
<P>
   For Sweden, better known for its socialism and pornography, this
is a welcome and long-overdue first step into the lucrative world
of tourist attractions. One might think that it will be difficult
to get people to shell out $35 a head for the privilege of walking
through a museum that smells like a house-full of mastiffs with
tummy problems, but I don't think that will be the case.
</P>
<P>
   The secret, of course, is marketing. Disney World makes more
money in a year than most South American countries, and what are
visitors paying for? The opportunity to stand for three hours under
the kind of sun that can cause one's mouse ears to spontaneously
combust in order to take a 90-second ride that is likely to give
you a migraine headache or make you sick to your stomach, or both.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's back to your $300-a-night hotel room for a quick
shower and another invigorating two-hour wait at one of the
resort's many overpriced restaurants. And then, finally, to bed,
perhaps to dream of a rich relative leaving you a hefty inheritance
so you can pay off your Visa bill sometime before the first woman
walks on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world come to
Orlando to treat themselves to this experience. New theme parks
seem to sprout up on a weekly basis to handle the overflow. The
attractions differ slightly from theme park to theme park but long
waits in the hot sun appear to be the common denominator that keeps
folks coming back.
</P>
<P>
   When you compare the experience of an Orlando theme park in
summer to that of a Swedish museum that walks visitors through the
ancient technique of making fish smell like a failed experiment in
housebreaking, I, for one, have got to go with the museum.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the kids would not be pestering you for snacks
every five minutes. Also, Sweden's climate being what it is, most
tourists will probably come down with a cold or some other kind of
upper respiratory infection that will render them incapable of
smelling fish, fermented or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   And, if all else fails, there is the fine selection of
pornography in the museum's gift shop to keep people's minds off
the stink, which I bet isn't so bad once you get used to it.

AIRPORT FACILITY COULD GENERATE SAVINGS AND REDUCE AIR POLLUTION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BRYON OKADA 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS/FORT WORTH AIRPORT _ A power plant that creates
electricity from natural gas could be built at Dallas/Fort Worth
Airport in the next two years, a move that would give the airport
its own environmentally friendly power source.
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials are considering building a combined-cycle
cogeneration plant that uses natural gas-powered turbines to make
electricity, then uses heat-capturing equipment to create steam for
space heating.
</P>
<P>
   Having an on-site power source would save the 18,000-acre
airport millions of dollars in utility bills while reducing air
pollution, according to D/FW officials. The airport plans to
convert most of its vehicles to clean-burning engines by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for the power plant discussion is the need for D/FW
Airport to reduce boiler emissions by 70 percent, as mandated by
the region's strategy for meeting federal air quality standards in
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what changed the scope of the project,'' said Rusty
Hodapp, the airport director of maintenance. ``Originally this was
about installing the heating and cooling capacity. Then the plan
targeted boilers for emissions reductions. We had 30-year-old
boilers that weren't going to be impacted. Now we have to do
something to reduce the emission.''
</P>
<P>
   The airport requires about 20 megawatts of electricity for its
operations. That may grow to 70 megawatts, as Terminal D, Terminal
F, the people mover, the Central Utilities Plant, parking
structures and ground support are created or expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Building a power plant would reduce emissions in several ways,
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   First, it would take the airport off the market as a consumer.
The airport currently purchases power from TXU Electric &AMP; Gas.
Major tenants, such as American and Delta airlines, contract
separately for power.
</P>
<P>
   The airport has a goal of reducing nitrogen oxide emissions, or
smog, by 70 percent from its current 58 tons, Hodapp said. A new
plant would produce about 16 tons, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The new plant also would use excess heat, usually looked at as
waste, to regulate the temperatures in Terminal D, then use what is
left to increase electricity-making capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Benefits of building a power project are that you improve the
reliability of the airport,'' said Katherine Potter, spokeswoman
for San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine Corp., the nation's leading
independent power company, which recently sold a similar
107-megawatt cogeneration plant to the Port Authority of New York &AMP;
New Jersey for use at John F. Kennedy International Airport. ``From
costs and environmental standpoints, it's a win-win.''
</P>
<P>
   D/FW officials said they also believe that the creation of the
plant will save the airport $100 million over 30 years in utility
bills.
</P>
<P>
   The plant probably would be built at the Central Utilities Plant
between the two Hyatt hotels, with a satellite facility nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The deregulation of the electrical industry will take effect in
Texas in January 2002, and standards for nitrogen oxide emissions
will take effect in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to position ourselves to operate in that environment,
being mindful of the emissions being generated,'' Hodapp said.
</P>
<P>
   That the airport is using the next two years as a transition
period is not unique, TXU officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to have D/FW as a customer and we'll compete for them,
but the fact that they are looking at self-generation or
cogeneration is not new,'' TXU spokeswoman Carol Peters said.
``Many companies are looking ahead and trying to manage their
energy consumption in a market that is open. This project would be
considered an independent power project in terms of competition,
and we welcome additional generation in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   A summary of a study on energy needs for Terminal D and the
people-mover system, conducted by Fort Worth-based Carter &AMP;
Burgess, is expected to be submitted today to the Dallas/Fort Worth
Airport Board. A final report is expected in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final piece to this puzzle is as we finish the
comprehensive study with the Terminal D and the energy loads
associated with the people-mover project, the scope of the study
needs to be expanded to include all the development in the central
terminal area,'' Hodapp said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we'll end up with is a bigger project than what is
currently envisioned.''

MAINLAND CHINESE SET FIRE TO IMMIGRATION OFFICES; DEPORTATIONS
ORDERED 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ For the mob of mainland Chinese immigrants who
massed in the 13th-floor lobby of Hong Kong's immigration tower on
Wednesday afternoon, the time for filling out forms or even howling
in protest had passed.
</P>
<P>
   After being turned away yet again by immigration officers in
their quest for residency permits, the immigrants doused the lobby
floor with a flammable liquid and ignited it. The fire raced
through the offices, and by the time it was extinguished by a
sprinkler system, 50 people had suffered burns, and several of them
were in serious condition. Six immigrants were still in critical
condition Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden eruption of violence flabbergasted people in this
normally tranquil city. Most had stopped paying attention to the
lonely struggle of 6,000 mainland Chinese for the right to settle
in this former British colony.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuffed repeatedly by the local courts and facing deportation
to the mainland, the immigrants were a sad reminder of the awkward
relationship between China and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty under a July
1997 agreement with Britain, the former colony has retained much of
its autonomy under China's ``one country, two systems'' formula.
That included control over immigration, which means Chinese
mainland citizens here must have residency permits or they will be
sent back.
</P>
<P>
   As the mainlanders have run out of options, they have grown
frustrated and angry. On Wednesday, the anger mutated into a
desperate attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to control our emotions,'' said a mainland
woman who gave her name as Ngai. ``We've been here so long, we
can't work, we can't earn a living. Even our families in China are
now against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ngai, who is 26 and is from Guangdong Province, was not involved
in the attack. She deplored the actions of her fellow immigrants,
which she said were not supported by the vast majority of the
immigrants. And she feared the attack will lead to a backlash
against mainland Chinese here.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Hong Kong government moved swiftly Thursday to crack
down. It announced the immediate deportation of 1,000 mainland
Chinese who are not involved in legal cases, which effectively
stays their deportation orders. Until now, Hong Kong has treated
the mainlanders gingerly, partly for political reasons and partly
to guard its reputation for the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   The police arrested 15 immigrants in connection with the blaze,
while Hong Kong's leaders condemned the attack in unusually blunt
terms. Tung Chee-hwa, the territory's chief executive, called it
``brutal behavior, irrational behavior that is unacceptable to all
of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The showdown between the mainlanders and the Hong Kong
government had been brewing for more than a year. In December, 50
protesters clashed with police outside Tung's offices, hurling
bamboo sticks and flower pots. Last week, 10 mainlanders scuffled
with guards and threatened to commit suicide after immigration
officers refused to meet with them.
</P>
<P>
   Their frustration stems from a ruling by Hong Kong's high court
in early 1999 that granted residency to mainland-born children with
at least one Hong Kong parent. The ruling opened the door to tens
of thousands of mainland Chinese who are the product of
cross-border marriages or relationships. And it terrified the local
government, which claimed that Hong Kong would be inundated by 1.6
million people.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, at the behest of the government, China's
parliament, the National People's Congress, overturned the ruling
by rewriting the parts of Hong Kong's constitution on which it was
based. That closed the door to all but about 6,000 immigrants, who
had already lodged residency claims.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hong Kong allowed those people to remain in the territory to
fight their cases. But the high court recently reaffirmed China's
right to overturn its ruling. And a series of lower courts have
hewed to that line, ruling against the immigrants or refusing to
hear their cases.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here said they have been tolerant of the mainlanders _
allowing them to camp for weeks in front of the government's
offices and to protest almost daily at the immigration tower. But
the rampage could poison the attitude of Hong Kongers toward their
mainland cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Although they share cultural ties _ and in some cases familial
ones _ many people in this affluent capitalist bastion already look
down on mainlanders. They fret that if the immigrants are allowed
in, they will blight Hong Kong, taking jobs and lowering the living
standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very difficult road ahead of us,'' said Ngai, as she
and her friends gathered to talk nervously about their future.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If nothing else, the television movie ``One Kill'' offers the
most unusual language of love.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day I enlisted my life fell into place,'' whispers a
Marine captain, an attractive blond woman, as she kisses a male
superior officer. As the captain becomes more aroused, she moans,
``I had something to aim for. Duty, honor weren't words, but
something I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   The major sighs, ``I used to dream about girls like you _ in
high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, this seemingly perfect match ends up with him dead and her
defending herself against a murder charge and a military conspiracy
(of course). Viewers must defend against unconvincing characters,
murky storytelling and a barrage of cliches. Yes, a pack of
reporters thrusts microphones in the captain's face when she goes
to trial. Yes, the night before she testifies, she sits at a table
and downs a glass of whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Heche does what she can (not much) with the part of Mary
Jane O'Malley, the captain. Shelley Evans has written a character
who may be morally and maternally impeccable. (Her children, by a
former husband, frolic with her and cutely call her Captain.) But
she is also impenetrable. It's hard to imagine what lies behind her
Mona Lisa smiles and self-righteous pronouncements. (``I don't make
deals with my principles,'' she says.)
</P>
<P>
   She isn't popular with the men under her command, though it's
hard to understand why, exactly, from this scenario (except that
they, too, may find her obnoxiously smug). She seems to be the only
woman doing actual soldiers' work on the base. The only other
military women are a clerk and the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The movie wants to make a feminist stand, about the unfair
treatment of women in the military, but seems too tired to put up
much of a fight. It also capitalizes in an unseemly way, given its
message, on Heche's body, with many peeks at her wearing her
underwear and less, during a sex scene. The movie, based on a real
case, makes Captain O'Malley the victim of an anti-female cover-up,
by a Marine establishment bent on protecting the dignity of her
dead lover, a Vietnam veteran with 35 years of service. But the
filmmakers unwittingly created a dramatic obstacle to their polemic
by casting Sam Shepard as the major whom O'Malley kills in
self-defense. Unlike Heche, who seems trapped within the narrow
confines of her character, Shepard has a craggy charisma that
implies depth where there may not be any. You feel some sympathy
for him, another middle-aged man unhinged by hot sex with a younger
woman, even as his behavior becomes erratic and then dangerous
toward Captain O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is billed as a thriller, but its pulse is weak. It
does have one astute line, uttered by Eric Stoltz, playing Captain
O'Malley's lawyer: ``This case doesn't have any heroes, captain.
Nobody likes it.''
</P>
<P>
   Also this weekend:
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to pin down the genesis of creativity, but that's
the ambition of ``Influences,'' a new half-hour series airing 7:30
p.m. on Bravo. Each week, after an ingratiating introduction by
Alan Alda, television writers, directors, actors and comedians
discuss what motivated them. The program is also produced by the
Museum of Television and Radio, so television shows are the
dominant source of inspiration. Parents, however, aren't ignored.
(``All it would have taken is one hug from my father and I'd be an
accountant,'' says Ray Romano, the comedian and star of ``Everybody
Loves Raymond.'')
</P>
<P>
   In the premiere, the least interesting of the first few shows in
the series, Tracey Ullmann pays homage to _ not surprisingly _
Lucille Ball, Mary Tyler Moore and Lily Tomlin, from her
``Laugh-In'' days. Ted Danson reveals that he grew up in a house
without television.
</P>
<P>
   But the old television clips are fun to watch, especially
unfamiliar shows like ``Price of Tomatoes,'' a 1962 television play
starring Peter Falk, that was momentous for the actress Tyne Daly.
``He just leaped out of the television set and grabbed me,'' she
says of Falk's performance.
</P>
<P>
   John Lithgow gives credit to Shakespeare and Milton Berle,
whereas Susan Lucci, who has spent most of her life playing the
duplicitous Erica Kane on ``All My Children,'' found ``The Donna
Reed Show'' important. ``I saw that things were too polite,'' she
says, preferring ``I Love Lucy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That seemed better to me,'' Lucci says. ``They weren't so
polite to each other.''

`COYOTE UGLY': SUPERMODELS IN A DIVE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Coyote Ugly,'' three of the supermodel bartenders _ Zoe
(Tyra Banks), Rachel (Bridget Moynahan) and Cammie (Izabella Miko)
_ are poring over an issue of Playboy and making fun of the
Playmate's favorite movie, ``Saving Private Ryan.'' At this point,
there's a cosmic shift in the universe, a rumbling that disrupts
the plates of karma. Those same women leap on a bar and douse
themselves with water _ presumably so their leather pants can get
even tighter around their slender hips _ for a bunch of leering
drunks. So having a movie as superficial as ``Coyote Ugly'' make
fun of someone's shallowness is like having Ronald McDonald
criticize your taste in clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coyote Ugly'' combines the showier elements of ``Flashdance,''
a movie whose follow-your-dream simple-mindedness it seeks to
duplicate, and ``Cocktail,'' in which Tom Cruise flipped bottles of
liquor for a clientele apparently uninterested in drinking. It
looks like a big-budget version of a Miller's Genuine Draft
commercial. (After extolling the fun of alcohol, the movie is
lacking only the somber tagline ``Drink Responsibly,'' which
actually makes the Miller television spots morally superior.)
</P>
<P>
   Piper Perabo, a young actress with worried eyes and clean hair,
is Violet, a New Jersey girl who moves to New York City in hopes of
realizing her dream of becoming a songwriter. The ambition to
entertain is in her blood: Violet's mother was a singer and
songwriter who never got to see her dream come true. As Violet
trundles from record company to talent agency to drop off her demo
tape and get rebuffed, EMF's ``Unbelievable'' cranks along on the
soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   The song is probably meant to draw attention to the walls of
indifference that Violet meets, but it functions more as a comment
on the willful naivete of Gina Wendkos' script. It seems that
Violet has never even seen MTV, where videos on this same subject
turn up all the time. It also seems they don't have credit cards in
New Jersey; when Violet goes shopping for a computer to use when
she's composing, she asks if the store has a payment plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coyote Ugly'' seems to take place in 1989, since most of the
songs _ ``Need You Tonight,'' ``All She Wants to Do Is Dance,'' ``I
Will Survive,'' ``One Way or Another'' _ are from roughly that year
or before. Violet gets a job at Coyote Ugly, the East Village bar,
after she watches Cammie, Rachel and Zoe show their sensitivity
when they ridicule the Playmate. The bar, run by the tough and tart
Lil (Maria Bello), encourages its female barkeeps, clad in snug
halter tops, to stoke the libidos of its howling customers by
flirting with them _ Hooters as a mom-and-pop operation _ while a
tape loop repeatedly plays the same verse from the Charlie Daniels
Band's ``Devil Went Down to Georgia.'' (Maybe all that stomping is
causing the jukebox to stick.) The place is a brightly colored
dreamsicle for every frat boy in the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   The producer Jerry Bruckheimer (``Flashdance,'' ``Top Gun,''
``Armageddon'') and the director, David McNally, traffick in the
lamest of soft core. This kind of teasing lacks even the
complications of the escapades in ``Where the Boys Are,'' which in
its Jurassic Era way suggested that there might be repercussions to
such actions. Violet has to find the courage to follow her dream,
conquer her stage fright and get the man she desires (Adam Garcia)
to commit. Will she accomplish all of those things? Those who've
never seen ``Flashdance'' or heard its Oscar-winning title song may
be surprised by this film's ending (re-shot a few weeks ago), which
features an epic lip-sync.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief appearance in ``White Boys'' as a sullen hip-hop kid
in the Farm Belt, Perabo showed that she has enough going for her
to survive ``Coyote Ugly,'' but here can show only her spunk and
her confident voice. John Goodman plays her worried dad; he gets
his laughs and almost gives the picture a heart.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the other women in the cast is given a single trait for
definition. Zoe, for example, left the bar to study law _ perhaps
at the Donatella Versace Law School, where you have to work both
torts and leather fittings into your schedule. She pops back into
Coyote Ugly as a costumer, and soon enough she is dragged kicking
and screaming away from her books and back onto the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else can be said about ``Flashdance,'' its cutting,
cinematography and use of music were brand new back in 1983.
``Coyote Ugly'' continues the tradition of integrity set by
``Flashdance,'' in which a dancer doubled for the star, Jennifer
Beals. Here the actresses have body doubles and dance doubles, and
one of them even has a ``fire leg double.'' At one point, when
Violet and her bartender associates _ or their body doubles _ are
driving the drunken patrons wild, Lou the bouncer (Del Pentecost)
starts heaving troublemakers out. Lou grabs a guy with a camera,
who screams, ``Hey, man! I'm a reporter for The Voice.'' Maybe his
article will show up in the director's cut on DVD.
</P>
<P>
   Someone needs to warn the bartenders at the real Coyote Ugly bar
that now is a good time to start shopping around for doubles and
extra pairs of leather pants. They'll need them for the onslaught
of customers the movie will bring in.

FORD EXPECTED TO RECOVER 
</HEADLINE>
   By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Doctors upgraded the condition of former
President Ford Thursday morning, a day after he was admitted to the
neurological intensive care unit of Hahnemann University Hospital
here after suffering at least one small stroke over the last few
days.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin McDowell, Ford's spokesman, said that the former
president's condition had been upgraded from serious to fair.
McDowell, who will hold a second briefing with doctors at noon,
said Ford had risen from his bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has been up and had a short, brief walk this
morning,'' McDowell said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, doctors said the prognosis was good that Ford
would make a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president should totally recover,'' said Dr. Robert J.
Schwartzman, the hospital's chief neurologist.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 87, was the nation's 38th president, and he has been in
Philadelphia for the Republican National Convention. Only hours
before being admitted to the hospital, near the city's center, he
had been given a rousing salute by convention delegates for his
brief, generally calming and healing stewardship of the nation in
the aftermath of Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   Ford arrived at the hospital at about 9 a.m. Wednesday,
complaining of dizziness, weakness in his left arm and slurred
speech. He was admitted, hospital officials later said, after an
imaging scan indicated he had suffered at least one stroke in the
brain stem at the rear of his head.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 10 hours earlier, around midnight, the former
president had walked in with his usual Secret Service security
detail, complaining of sinus pain. He was given some pain medicine
and released.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials defended their decision to release him
without further tests, saying they felt that they had responded
properly to the symptoms they saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he sought was some pain relief,'' said Dr. Wayne Satz, the
hospital's chief of emergency medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what was different about the symptoms during the second
hospital visit, Satz said that they were more acute. He also said
that Ford's wife, Betty, had reported that Ford had also felt ill
earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, before heading for Philadelphia, Ford saw a doctor in
Colorado, complaining then, as later, of head pain, Mrs. Ford told
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   In the convention hall on Tuesday night, while Ford was being
honored, he appeared visibly tired and in one interview noticeably
slurred his words.
</P>
<P>
   News of his hospitalization injected a somber note into a
convention that up until then had been one big, joyful celebration
of George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Hahnemann doctors said they were treating Ford with
blood-thinners in an effort to lessen the likelihood of future
strokes. In someone his age, they emphasized, there was a greater
danger of another stroke than in someone younger.
</P>
<P>
   But a minor stroke is not unusual at Ford's age.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzman said that Ford was ``perfectly awake, functioning
mentally _ that's not a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   McDowell earlier described Ford as ``very alert and ready to go
home.'' Should he continue to recover without complications,
hospital officials said, he might be released in five or six days.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzman said he did not think Ford had suffered any brain
damage from the stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will all clear, mainly in his balance center,''
he added. ``That should all recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Brott of the National Stroke Association said it was
possible that the signs and symptoms Ford spoke about in his visit
to the hospital Tuesday night, when he complained of pain in his
face, dizziness and sleeplessness, would not have immediately
suggested to doctors that a stroke had occurred. Symptoms described
by a patient, Brott said, are often ambiguous and might point to a
more likely cause than a stroke _ for example, an infection.
</P>
<P>
   On the same point, Schwartzman said that a mild stroke ``looks
like an inner-ear infection sometimes, sometimes it's hard to tell
the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   A stroke is usually caused by a blood clot blocking a vessel in
the brain, so that cells beyond the blockage do not receive
nutrients, and can thus be injured or die.
</P>
<P>
   The cells affected in Ford's case are in the lower rear of the
brain where motor activity, like balance, is controlled.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, when the stroke is small, the damaged brain cells
can recover or the killed cells can be bypassed so that other
healthy cells can perform the same function, leading to complete
recovery.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  RETAILERS HOPE FOR A ``VERY HARRY'' CHRISTMAS &HT;    By SHERRY THOMAS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated)_Pottered out?
</P>
<P>
   Retail giants hope not. Many are banking on a very Harry
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   This has nothing to do with book sales, mind you. J.K. Rowling's
``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' may have sold 5 million
copies, but that's a bean drop in the beaker compared to the gold
some 45 licensed manufacturers hope to find in the world's favorite
boy wizard.
</P>
<P>
   Expect the faces of Harry and his spellbinding associates to be
plastered everywhere this fall, from sheets to toys to boxer
shorts.
</P>
<P>
   First up, collectible Christmas ornaments. Coming soon, Harry
Potter-themed furniture, electronics, board games, trading cards,
plush toys, dolls _ you name it. Rumor has it Cap Candy is even
developing its version of Bertie Botts Every Flavored Beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of interesting to me,'' said Sally Jordan, owner of
Jeremy's Books and Toys in Webster, Texas, southeast of Houston. At
a show in Dallas in June, ``there wasn't that much (Harry Potter
paraphernalia) showing. But I have a feeling when I go back in the
fall, there will be more now that there's so much publicity about
Harry Potter.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' consumer products division gained all worldwide
licensing and merchandising rights for the Potter series as part of
its film deal with Rowling.
</P>
<P>
   The first movie, based on Rowling's first book, ``Harry Potter
and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' won't hit theaters until 2001. But with
``Goblet of Fire'' making a big goblet of money, and the holiday
retail season fast approaching, manufacturers are being told to get
on the broomstick, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at Cornelius Nurseries in Houston are already taking
orders for Harry Potter ornaments and lights from Kurt S. Adler
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be of Harry playing Quidditch, Harry and
Hedwig, Hermione, and Ron,'' said Pat Nichilo, a designer at one
four Houston-area Cornelius stores. ``We're also going to carry the
Nimbus 2000 broom and Lightning Bolt icicle ornaments.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that a Harry Christmas tree probably won't come
cheap. One of Adler's Polonaise glass ornaments sells for $50 _ or
you can get a boxed set of four for $200. The light set retails for
$22.50. Other ornaments (including resin and tin) in the collection
sell from $5.50 and up.
</P>
<P>
   But if all your pint-size Potter fan wants for Christmas this
year is a Harry Potter bed (with attached wizard tent), you may be
out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at the very end of the year, or the beginning of
next,'' said Steve Paul, a sales representative for P.J. Kids, the
Princeton, N.J.-based company licensed to design and manufacture
Harry Potter bedroom furniture.
</P>
<P>
   He said the line, which will include bedding and accessories
(with stars and lightning bolts, no doubt), is aimed at upscale
department and furniture stores. A retail trade magazine reported
last month that a deal had already been struck with FAO Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Paul nor FAO Schwartz, however, could confirm details.
</P>
<P>
   Marcel Meissner, a manager at Houston's FAO Schwartz store, said
the store is expecting a Harry Potter line before the holidays, but
he wasn't privy to the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably expecting to get the line as of late fall,''
Meissner said. ``The (flagship) store in New York will carry it
first. This store just started carrying Harry Potter recently, so
it's going to take a while before we get the full line in.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who has ordered Harry Potter calendars, address books
and playing cards for her Webster store, remained skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a nice add-on. Like this Christmas, we'll have some
nice backpack chains and key chains for people who know their
children and grandchildren really like Harry Potter. But the plush
toys and the other stuff? I don't know,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're selling to readers. And let's face it, there
are a lot more moviegoers than readers _ even of Harry Potter. A
lot of people will buy it (Harry Potter merchandise) just because
it's hot, not really knowing anything about Harry Potter. But the
10- or 11-year-olds? They're not going to want Harry Potter sheets.
They're going to want another book.''

`THE TAO OF STEVE': A BIG MAN CHASING `COOL' ONE CONQUEST AT A
TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no Steve in ``The Tao of Steve,'' the
light-as-a-marshmallow romantic comedy directed by Jenniphr
Goodman. But there is a universal ideal represented by a spiritual
concept proposed by the main character, Dex: The pursuit of the
perfection attained by all-American cool guys like Steve McQueen,
Steve McGarrett (``Hawaii Five-0'') and Steve Austin (``The Six
Million Dollar Man'').
</P>
<P>
   Dex (Donal Logue) never really explains why emulating McGarrett,
a lawman who had roughly one romance a season and a propensity for
chasing down hitmen from the mainland who had brought only one
bullet with them, is a goal to which he aspires. (``Tao'' also may
be a sleight-of-hand pun on the movie's setting, Santa Fe, N.M.,
near Taos.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dex is a likable guy, a walking epitome of the Peter Pan
syndrome. Actually, he's more like a blobby epitome of that
syndrome, a little boy unashamed of his rolls of flab. His size
doesn't prevent him from scoring with the ladies, and his
minor-league obsession with the Steves underscores his devotion to
trivial matters.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is the story of Dex's infatuation with women and how
he eventually has to deal with giving up his one-night stands to
find spiritual truth with one woman, Syd (Greer Goodman, sister of
the director, who worked on the screenplay with her and Duncan
North). Dex's romping with his dog, a happy sun-colored Lab, and
his ease with the preschoolers he teaches are part of what makes
him so attractive to women. He explains himself to each potential
conquest so that his lack of deviousness becomes part of his
come-on.
</P>
<P>
   Logue's winning performance comes out of Dex's own amusement at
the effort he puts into his pleasure-hunting, giving the lie to his
apparent slacker vibe. He's very serious about not being serious.
Dex's Taoism is fairly well worked out; he's a guy with too much
time on his hands who has spent a lot of energy on his world view.
He has quotes from ``Don Giovanni'' and Thomas Aquinas to
rationalize his life.
</P>
<P>
   Logue's turn as Dex won him a deserved acting award at this
year's Sundance Film Festival, and when he is onscreen the picture
glides, in part because Dex has a cherub's glee over what he gets
away with. Maybe too many movies celebrate extended adolescence,
but Logue's breezy and innocent hedonism gives ``Tao'' a roughhouse
affability. He is one of those actors you've probably caught out of
the corner of your eye, the bad guy who gets one scene in a movie.
(In ``The Patriot,'' he's the racist who quickly reforms.) If he
has been biding his time and waiting for the chance to prove he can
carry a movie, ``Tao'' shows he is up to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   He plays off his avoirdupois, commenting on it before anyone
else can and making it part of his arsenal. (At Sundance, he had a
matinee-idol trimness as he accepted his award.) There's an ``if
only he used his power for the good of mankind'' aspect here, as
there almost always is in stories of unregenerate Lotharios.
(``Tao'' does bring up ``Don Giovanni,'' after all.) It is evident
that he is smart and wasting away _ well, intellectually, anyway _
and that all he needs is the right woman to bring things together.
</P>
<P>
   The movie bogs down when he starts to lavish the same attention
on his courtship of Syd, who is still nursing a wound over having
been one of his one-night stands. Goodman has to play the grown-up,
and it's hard to tell if the writing for Syd is subpar or if she is
stiff as an actress. Eventually, Dex's doughy sheepishness and his
attempt to elevate his self-indulgent behavior by mixing in
European philosophy along with Hollywood Boulevard icons feels a
bit like a conceit. The cat-and-mouse game that he and Syd play
stretches out because it's standard-issue plotting. ``The Tao of
Steve'' can't redeem the moves toward its predictable happy ending.
But the movie has a protagonist who has a great time getting there.

`BETTER LIVING': A FAMILY SO DYSFUNCTIONAL IT COULD BLOW UP A DAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth has a heart the size of a mountain,'' Gail says
about one of her sisters in ``Better Living.'' In this movie,
everyone has a heart the size of a mountain, and most of the
characters make as much noise as a rock slide. If you've missed the
kind of bellowing in a comedic context that disappeared with the
Norman Lear sitcoms _ called scream theater in the 1970s _ then
this is the movie for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better Living'' is one of those comedy-dramas in which
everyone is a little crazy in a way that is intended to be
ingratiating until a horrible family secret is revealed. Skin-deep
quirkiness is not always adorable, however, especially when
everyone has been conceived as a ``character.''
</P>
<P>
   Olympia Dukakis plays Nora, the delusional mother who is
building an underground structure of some sort under her house. Her
daughters _ Gail (Wendy Hoopes), Elizabeth (Deborah Hedwall) and
Maryann (Catherine Corpeny) _ holler at one another but love their
nutty mom. When their dad, Tom (Roy Scheider), shows up at their
mother's doorstep, it causes some confusion because Nora has been
saying he is dead and doesn't quite recognize him. For whatever
reason, he has been gone for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gail is happy to see him come back. Tom left when she was very
young, and she is looking for a father figure. She snuggles up to
her uncle, Jack (Edward Herrmann), a priest, for encouragement and
advice, and he feigns lack of interest. Elizabeth, a public
defender, is full of rage about her father; she remembers how
turbulent the house was when Tom and Nora were together. And that's
saying something, since there's still plenty of china crashing into
the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better Living'' is jam-packed with sarcasm and would-be
eccentricity; the perpetually dazed Maryann has yet to name her
8-month-old daughter and has the free-floating neurosis of a
character from a 40-year-old stage play. The picture feels like a
blocking rehearsal for a play where all the movement is being
coordinated but the underlying emotional notes have yet to be set.
Any sense of reality that the movie tries to build is not helped by
the shouting matches, which come across as actressy tantrums.
</P>
<P>
   Herrmann comes off best because he doesn't have to shriek his
lines. He is the cynical priest who takes a snort or two from his
flask whenever things get too weird, a condition that seems to be a
constant here. Jack is mournful; a lot of wasted hope seems to be
stored in his jowls. But Herrmann is fleet and smooth; he takes
some pride in his performance. Hoopes has some fine moments.
Hedwall has some powerful scenes; she could be Dukakis' daughter.
It would help if she could take her foot off the gas.
</P>
<P>
   Nora keeps a snapshot of Tom, and it's a photo of Scheider from
his role in ``Sorcerer,'' William Friedkin's remake of ``The Wages
of Fear.'' It was chosen because Tom wears a stingy-brimmed hat
similar to the chapeau Scheider wore in ``Sorcerer.'' One wonders
if, after seeing ``Better Living,'' he fondly looks back on the
days when he was in a movie about transporting nitroglycerine over
the rugged back roads of South America in a truck without shock
absorbers. The circumstances must have been much less volatile.

DESPITE NEW FOOD AND DRINK ITEMS, BASEBALL FANS STICKING TO
TRADITIONAL FARE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By SEAN WOOD 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ When Tim Donegan looks at The Ballpark in
Arlington, he sees an imaginary yellow line encircling it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people cross that yellow line their eating habits change
to stuff they don't normally eat,'' said Donegan, manager of The
Ballpark's food service company, Sportservice. ``I've seen it in
Cincinnati. I've seen it in St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   Thoughts of salads, roast pork and bottled water are often
replaced by cravings for nachos, hot dogs and beer. And while you
can get all of the above items at The Ballpark, it is the last
three that drive sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how expansive our menu is, 80-85 percent of fans
still want the traditional ballpark fare of hot dogs, popcorn,
peanuts, beer and soda,'' said Karen Liberatori, public relations
manager for Sportservice's parent, the Delaware North Cos. ``That
holds true whether you're talking traditional concessions or
upscale dining in our suites and clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   You can get grilled scallops, rack of lamb, roast tenderloin and
antipasto salad. And Sportservice continues to tweak its
fine-dining menu and introduce four or five new concession items
each year ``to keep the place fresh and to drive revenue,'' Donegan
said.
</P>
<P>
   But for most sports fans, dining at a ballpark is a matter of
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could design the greatest food concept at the ballpark but
it may not be what the customers want,'' Donegan said. ``Coming to
the ballpark and eating a hot dog never goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the core group of foods still provides most of the
refreshment revenue at ballgames, food service companies continue
to try new items in an effort to offer a little more variety and
perhaps pump up sales a bit.
</P>
<P>
   And, if the new menu items catch on, they can boost the bottom
line for both the food service and the ballpark. Forty-three
percent of the sports and event venues nationwide are reporting
higher spending by fans this year than last, in part because of a
wider variety of menu items, according to a spring report by
Amusement Business, an industry trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Neither The Ballpark in Arlington nor Sportservice will disclose
how much money food and drinks bring in at The Ballpark, or how the
profits are divided. But with fans spending at least $7 per person
on refreshments at each game, it can easily run into the millions
during a season.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Sportservice pays close attention to what fans
like, and dislike.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as The Ballpark in Arlington, they don't have many of
the lighter selections,'' Liberatori said. ``They just don't sell.
They had frozen yogurt. But nobody wants frozen yogurt. They want
ice cream.''
</P>
<P>
   One item that has taken off is the 20-ounce plastic bottle of
Miller Lite beer. Miller Brewing Co. and Donegan won't release
sales figures for the bottles, but Donegan said they were a ``boost
to vending.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It keeps the beer colder because it's a double-insulated
bottle wall,'' Donegan said. ``It's easier to handle. It fits real
nice into the cupholder. People still enjoy drnking beer out of the
original package. You just screw the top off. It saves transaction
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Donegan said it cuts at least 20 seconds off of the time it
takes a beer vendor to open a can and pour it into a paper cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Specifically focused on the venues, it's been a phenomenal
success for us,'' said Scott Bussen, spokesman for Miller in
Milwaukee. He said they have plastic bottles in more than 200
venues. ``Our production capacity for those bottles is not enough
to keep up with demand. We're looking for ways to increase our
capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans have been less enthusiastic about some of the other new
items introduced at The Ballpark this year. Tater tots have already
come and gone. While sausage on a stick is still holding on, a
version with jalapenos has been nixed. Funnel cakes, however, have
done relatively well, Donegan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always thought they would,'' he said. ``We've seen them do
well at places like Six Flags.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to finicky fans, there are a number of factors
beyond the control of the concessionaire that can affect sales.
</P>
<P>
   If a team does badly, attendance _ and food sales _ may drop
off. Or loyal season ticket holders who are accustomed to buying
their food at the park may give their tickets to friends or
employees who decide to bring their own food. Even the weather can
affect how much, and what, fans buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People eat more when it's cool,'' Donegan said. ``Hot weather
kills peoples' appetites. It's not good for much of anything except
for waters and frozen lemonade.'' Milder weather in the early part
of summer this year helped drive food and beer sales at The
Ballpark this year, for example, but soda sales were down 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The milder weather also meant that warm foods that Rangers fans
avoid in hotter weather saw increased sales through the end of
June. Jumbo dog sales were up 7 percent, kosher dogs were up 13.6
percent, barbecue chicken sandwiches were up 16.1 percent, cheese
fries were up 26 percent and super nachos were up 15 percent.

ROLLING GOOD TIMES PRESENT A PROBLEM FOR BUSH
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CECIL JOHNSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The urban sprawl of the Cityview section of Fort Worth casts a
specter over this week's whoop-dee-doo in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Inch by inch, acre by acre, mile by concreted and asphalted
mile, the proliferating growth in Fort Worth and other cities
gobbles up the rolling terrain. The profusion of new homes,
apartment complexes, shopping centers, hospitals, schools and
big-footprint superstores has taken on the aspect of a whole new
city swelling within a city.
</P>
<P>
   And that spells trouble for the elephantine celebrators in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   This Cityview phenomenon would not be a problem for the folks
who have convened in Ben Franklin's town to try to catapult Texas
Gov. George W. Bush into the White House if it were unique. Trouble
is, Cityview is far from singular. North Central Texas is studded
with such pockets of rampant growth. So are other parts of the
state and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century ago, a musician named Louis Jordan popularized a
song called ``Let the Good Times Roll.'' That's the kind of
economic music that this nation is making today. And America's
Cityviews are reflections of the strong, vibrant, pulsating
economy.
</P>
<P>
   To most Americans, that's just a little short of wonderful. But
it makes it hard for Bush to argue that the nation would be better
off with him as president than with his opponent, Vice President Al
Gore, who is part of the current administration.
</P>
<P>
   How does one argue against letting the good times roll? If Bush
suggests that his economic policies will be significantly different
from those of the Clinton administration, he risks scaring away
voters who are now enjoying the fruits of one of the most
prosperous periods in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   These rolling good times in which most Americans are immersed
explain in large measure why the public is paying so little
attention to the presidential election campaign, why the Republican
convention is attracting such unimpressive numbers of television
viewers, and why the poll numbers at this stage of the campaign are
nearly irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps something will be said in the waning hours of the
convention that will really grab the public's attention. It is a
pity that Gen. Colin Powell spoke so early in the convention, when
hardly anyone was watching and listening. He delivered the best
oration at a Republican convention since Ronald Reagan waxed
eloquent.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's speech, however, was not the kind of oratory that most
of the delegates came to hear. And the applause for him was
underwhelming. Except for his obligatory lauding of Bush near the
end of his speech, Powell's remarks seemed more suited for a
Democratic convention. Perhaps that was why he was scheduled so
early.
</P>
<P>
   Powell did nothing to help solve Bush's Cityview problem. The
sloganizing about not leaving any children behind when Texas has
one of the highest rates of child poverty in the nation didn't do
it. Nor did the misleading assertions about all that voucher
advocate Bush has done for education in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It is becoming increasingly clear that the Republicans, instead
of focusing on matters economic, are going to try to run against
President Clinton and damage Gore with guilt by association.
</P>
<P>
   When the good times are rolling, that won't work. Americans for
the most part always have and always will vote their pocketbooks.
And because of that, Clinton _ despite the rantings of the
moralistic ideologues and professional Clinton-haters _ would
probably be re-elected to a third term were he constitutionally
eligible for it.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome the Cityview factor, Bush will have to convince the
American public that he will do nothing fiscally or monetarily to
stop the good times from rolling. But that could be difficult to do
without making the same promises as his opponent. If he says
something different, he could scare off voters.
</P>
<P>
   As November approaches and the voters begin to pay more
attention to the election, they are likely to become wary of
electing a Republican president because they will recall the
history of economic downturns during Republican administrations.
Thoughts of what a Republican administration in league with a
Republican-controlled Congress could do to the economy just might
scare the bejeebers out of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   The good times are rolling. The Cityviews are blooming. Bush
must convince America that he will do nothing to change that, or
the party affiliation of the man in the White House won't change.

`PSYCHO BEACH PARTY': A PLAY THAT LONG WANTED TO BE A MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When ``Psycho Beach Party,'' Charles Busch's raucous theatrical
spoof of ``Gidget,'' ``Beach Party'' movies and teen slasher films,
opened Off Broadway in 1987, it hilariously upended constricting
notions of ``normal'' teen-age American life peddled by Hollywood
in the 1950s and early '60s. The only frustration was that while
Busch's hilarious trivia-savvy script was obviously meant to be a
movie, the fun could be enjoyed only on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after 13 years, ``Psycho Beach Party,'' the movie, has
arrived. And given how pop culture runs in cycles, it is
surprisingly timely. What, after all, is the homogenized pop ethos
of Britney Spears, 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys other than a
slicker, contemporary update of the surf-side bubble gum world of
Frankie Avalon, Annette Funicello and the forever-perky Gidget?
Throw in some tacky pre-``Scream'' horror, and you have a crude
blueprint for what has come around once again.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, directed by Robert Lee King, accomplishes what no
stage production could. By assiduously copying the look and sound
of those '60s movies _ the wriggling title sequences, the twangy
surf music and the gawky gee-whiz screen acting style _ it
definitively skewers the false innocence of American pop culture on
the eve of the countercultural deluge. Most of the play's
subversive humor has arrived on the screen intact. Beneath a
charade of sanitized fun, fun, fun, ``Psycho Beach Party''
discovers a post-Freudian nightmare world of repressed violence and
kinky sex bursting to get out.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference between the play and the movie is Busch's
role. In the original stage version, this sometime drag actor, who
has revised the play extensively for its screen edition, played the
central character, Florence Forest (aka Chicklet), a bouncy
Gidget-like teen-ager who is revealed to have multiple
personalities. One of those personalities may or may not be a
homicidal maniac. In the movie's dramatic climax, dear sweet
Chicklet, under the spell of an amateur hypnotist, relives a
traumatic memory borrowed directly from Alfred Hitchcock's
``Marnie.''
</P>
<P>
   On the stage Busch's sudden metamorphoses from simpering
Chicklet into her alter ego, Ann Bowman, a raging, foul-mouthed
dominatrix who proclaims herself empress of the world, were
virtuosic camp flourishes demonstrating the phenomenal comic range
of this great drag actor. In the movie, Florence is played by
Lauren Ambrose, an actress who is so true to type she could have
played the original Gidget.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ambrose, in her quick-change sequences, can't begin to
match Busch's histrionic stretch from Gidget into a Tallulah
Bankhead-like monster, something is lost. At the same time, having
a woman play Florence sharpens the satire by emphasizing the tonal
accuracy of its play's deadpan comic realism.
</P>
<P>
   Those pining for Busch need not despair. Here he appears as
Capt. Monica Stark, an Eve Arden-like police investigator who
solves a series of murders on Malibu Beach that threaten to wipe
out the surfer population.
</P>
<P>
   Busch's screenplay is a carefully overstuffed hybrid of '60s
teen movie scenarios embellished with references to grown-up films
like ``Mildred Pierce'' and ``Berserk.' (Joan Crawford's ghost
lurks everywhere.) Here, Beth Broderick (from ``Sabrina the
Teen-age Witch'') plays Chicklet's prim controlling mother, a
character to whom Busch has given some of his choicest throwaway
lines. ``I thought you were going to help me pickle those beets,''
she tells her daughter sternly.
</P>
<P>
   Busch's impeccable ear for early '60s slang takes us back to the
era of ``fantabulous'' and the hep-cat slang of pseudobeatniks
slinging terms like ``daddy-o.'' The wittier inventions include
Lars (Matt Keeslar), an excessively polite, bespectacled exchange
student from Sweden who lives with the Forests and has a bogus
foreign accent, Starcat (Nicholas Brendon), a psychology major from
Northwestern who solemnly dispenses nuggets of watered-down
Freudian psychology, and Marvel Ann (Amy Adams), a boy-crazy
teen-age vixen.
</P>
<P>
   Malibu's cocky male surfers turn out to have Achilles heels. The
local surf legend Kanaka (Thomas Gibson) discovers an appetite for
humiliation, while the casual wrestling matches between the teen
hunks Yo-Yo (Nick Cornish) and Provoloney (Andrew Levitas)
increasingly threaten to end in romantic clinches.
</P>
<P>
   And just when you're sure whodunit, the movie, whose story
expands into the ozone with alarming speed, takes another ludicrous
twist to foil your expectations. Even now, it's fun to be reminded
that there's no such thing as ``normal.''

 &HT;    Coens' early redneck noir is still simply irresistible
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Blood Simple'' is back in all its devilishly degenerate glory.
Re-released in a spruced-up but still-smirking so-called director's
cut (see article below for details), the movie is pretty much
exactly as it was when it originally hit theaters in 1984. That is,
a good-old-boy gothic full of flashy camera angles and trashy
people.
</P>
<P>
   The setup is the sort of thing that would ring bells for the
postman. Marty (Dan Hedaya), the owner of a down-and-dirty Texas
watering hole called the Neon Boot, suspects his younger, sexier
wife (Frances McDormand) of having an affair with his younger,
sexier bartender (John Getz). So he hires a wheezily sleazy private
detective (M. Emmet Walsh). His plan, however, changes from
catching them in the act to having them killed. Things get tricky _
and trickier _ when the private eye turns out to have a few plans
of his own.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a corpse-strewn black comedy that marked the
dazzling debut of the brother act Joel and Ethan Coen, who've since
attained a kind of household-name notoriety for their particular
brand of cocky quirkiness. If you've seen their Oscar-winning
``Fargo,'' you know what I mean.
</P>
<P>
   What's astonishing about ``Blood Simple'' is how much of their
unique talent was evident from the start. In a strange way, this
movie could be the blueprint for the later, more polished
``Fargo.''
</P>
<P>
   The great joy of ``Blood Simple'' is that, for all its delirious
impudence and film school showiness, it's so clearly a movie made
by guys crazy about moviemaking. And crazy about it in a way you
didn't see much of in the mid-'80s. There's not an unimaginative
shot in the piece. Yet, unlike so many filmmakers with a gift for
dynamic visuals, the Coens don't neglect their story. It twists and
turns with the playful perversity of a Hitchcock thriller that has
collided with ``Tobacco Road'' a kind of numbskull redneck noir
that Homer Simpson might find himself ensnared in.
</P>
<P>
   The actors hold their own as well. The moronic level of Marty's
manipulations is signaled by Hedaya's cliched open shirt and gold
chains. Getz is dumb, devoted and, relatively speaking, vaguely
decent, while McDormand is a classic whisper-voiced trailer-trash
tramp, right down to the dust between her painted toenails.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all is Walsh, whose garbage-dump soul somehow just
naturally draws flies. Decked out in a pale yellow leisure suit
(like the yellow snow mothers warn their kids to steer clear of)
and drenched in a perpetual greedy sweat, he gives a performance as
luridly playful as the Coens' camerawork. He also shares their
blood lust. Be forewarned _ this movie gets very, very messy.
</P>
<P>
   But that's all to the good, especially when you consider that
something like ``Pulp Fiction'' wasn't even a buzz in Quentin
Tarantino's head when this movie opened. Brimming with cinematic
self-assurance, head-spinning technical virtuosity and flashes of
cruel yet irresistible humor, ``Blood Simple'' is still an occasion
for blood, sweat and cheers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood Simple''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    `Coyote' a real howler _ bar none
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a good title. You know, calling a movie ``Coyote Ugly.''
Especially one with five hot, boot-wearing chicks stamping on a
wooden bar, pulling at their tiny, low-cut tops and vests, raking
long-nailed fingers through their sweaty hair while bumping and
grinding in tight leather pants and ultra-minis.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Coyote Ugly'' come-on is these five women. Every one of
them a beaut. There's tough blond bar owner Lil (Maria Bello),
sugary-sweet Cammie (Izabella Miko), tie-you-up dominatrix Rachel
(Bridget Moynahan), sultry Zoe (Tyra Banks) and _ the new kid in
New York _ vulnerable Jersey (Piper Perabo).
</P>
<P>
   They splash whiskey across the bar and set it afire. Amid hoots
and catcalls from the inebriated clientele crammed into their tiny,
dilapidated bar world, the girls hold torches, swig liquor and spew
fireballs like curvaceous human flamethrowers. They douse each
others' T-shirts with big pitchers of water.
</P>
<P>
   Hello, spring break.
</P>
<P>
   This is high-concept moviemaking from producer Jerry
Bruckheimer, who with and without his late partner, Don Simpson,
has fashioned a long line of loud, rock 'em, moneymaking films such
as ``Flashdance,'' ``Top Gun,'' ``Days of Thunder,'' ``Con Air''
and ``Armageddon.'' Nary a one of them contained a molecule of
brain matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coyote Ugly'' keeps the string going. It is profoundly stupid,
earnestly inept at conveying a story and hellbent on wallowing in
its shallow emotional manipulations. It'll probably make millions.
</P>
<P>
   With the flimsiest of plots, this movie blares nearly 30 songs
(including Def Leppard's ``Pour Some Sugar on Me,'' EMF's ``You're
Unbelievable,'' Kid Rock's ``Cowboy'' and Blondie's ``One Way or
Another''). It entices with a single nude silhouette (this movie
only boasts skin, it never really displays it). As in that other
gloriously bad bar movie ``Cocktail,'' the liquor bottles are
twirled like six-shooters.
</P>
<P>
   The slapdash story involves a young waif, who, to make ends
meet, takes a job at a New York bar called Coyote Ugly. She's
Jersey, aka Violet Sanford (Perabo), a struggling songwriter fresh
from New Jersey aching for stardom in the big, big city if she can
ever get over stage fright. See, she can't sing when anyone's
watching her. She can climb up on a bar and shag a mean wet T-shirt
dance but she just can't sing in public. You know how it is.
</P>
<P>
   So she meets this Australian guy named Kevin (Adam Garcia). They
go to his day job and throw fish. She gets to like him. Maybe even
like like him. She tells him all about her. He won't say much about
himself. You know how it is.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon, we're watching him have anxiety over a comic book.
She's singing her innocuous songs on her apartment rooftop under a
glowing moon.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, you're a long way from that rowdy fun-time bar. Now,
you're stuck in this gooey glump of a movie about a guy who won't
open up and a girl who won't shut up. She lets him have it. ``It's
so easy being you!'' It's the big, bad breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Will they get back together? Will she ever take her singing
passion and make it happen? Can this girl really have it all?
</P>
<P>
   Egad. What a feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coyote Ugly''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Starring Piper Perabo, Adam Garcia, Maria Bello and John
Goodman. Rated PG-13 for sensuality. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 34
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Dog-face hideous.

 &HT;    Shortcomings transparent in `Hollow Man'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Hollow Man'' sure is.
</P>
<P>
   A high-tech fusion of ``The Invisible Man'' and ``Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde,'' it lets director Paul Verhoeven (``Starship Troopers,''
``Total Recall'') show off some gruesome, state-of-the-art computer
effects and exercise his gleeful brand of brutal action. But his
filmmaking energy is wasted on a weak script and characters so
two-dimensional, they're virtually all transparent.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Bacon, with his trademark blue-eyed amorality, plays Dr.
Sebastian Caine (now there's a movie name). Driven and
narcissistic, he's heading a top-secret, Pentagon-funded study in a
lab buried deep beneath the streets of D.C. He's aided by Linda
(Elisabeth Shue), a former lover, and Matthew (Josh Brolin), who,
unknown to the jealous Caine, is Linda's new boy-toy. They seem to
be turned on by their mutual blandness.
</P>
<P>
   There are also a handful of lab assistants who might as well
have ``Third-Act Victim'' stamped on their foreheads.
</P>
<P>
   The team's job is to create an invisibility serum. That part's
easy: The lab is crammed with cages full of invisible test animals.
The trickier job is developing a formula that makes the critters
visible again, without killing them in the process.
</P>
<P>
   You know what happens next. Yes, Caine volunteers to be the
first human guinea pig. Then, he can't turn visible again. As days
pass, the serum starts to give him evil thoughts, and he begins to
misuse his invisibility. From practical jokes, he graduates to
breaking and entering, rape and murder.
</P>
<P>
   This would be a lot more interesting if Caine started off as
someone recognizably human; he's already such a cad when we first
meet him, his later bad behavior isn't surprising. This is a guy
who calls himself God, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Sneaking up behind his colleagues, playing mind games with them,
the see-through Caine says, ``You have no idea how much fun this
is.'' No, we don't. The script is too busy hurtling toward its
Gotterdammerung finale (flamethrowers, falling elevators,
explosions, etc.) to let us get a sense of what invisibility might
feel like from the inside.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason to see ``Hollow Man'' is to check out the
computer-generated effects. Yes, you will believe there's an
invisible man onscreen. You just won't be very interested in him.
The most spectacular sequences are when Caine takes the formula,
and gains transparency from the outside-in. It looks as if the skin
is melting off his body, revealing the sinews and blood vessels
beneath. The effects are fascinating, and pretty gross.
</P>
<P>
   They can keep you paying attention, and so does Verhoeven's
steely, relentless pacing. But nothing can save the half-hour
finale that turns the unlikely Shue into an action heroine. By
then, at a preview screening this week, ``Hollow Man'' was met by
hollow laughter from mocking audience members.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, ``End of Days'' scribe Andrew W. Marlowe wrote
the thing. At one point in the movie, Caine says, ``It's amazing
what you can do when you don't have to look at yourself in the
mirror anymore.'' Maybe that's how Marlowe managed to write
something so trite: He covered up the mirrors in his house until he
finished the script. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollow Man''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue. Rated R for graphic
violence, nudity, profanity. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 54 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: After a suspenseful first half, you may wish it
would just disappear.

 &HT;    Go with the gentle flow of charming `Shower'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Knowing where it's going doesn't really spoil the charm of
``Shower,'' a gentle Chinese comedy about the restorative power of
water, tradition and family ties. Despite its title, the movie is
mainly about baths, mainly those in the small-town bathhouse run by
old Master Liu (Zhu Xu). It's the heart of the community, where the
men gather to soak and gossip and wager over cricket fights.
</P>
<P>
   Quick and efficient showers, by contrast, represent the quick
and soulless city life personified by Liu's oldest son, Da Ming (Pu
Cun Xin). He returns home after getting a cryptic postcard from his
mentally retarded brother, Er Ming (Jiang Wu), who lives with their
father and helps run the family business.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Danish film ``Mifune,'' with which it shares several
narrative similarities (including the character of a mentally
challenged brother), ``Shower'' takes the figure of the prodigal
son and turns him into a profit-minded one. You'll guess pretty
quickly that the laid-back pace of village life and the desire to
mend his relationship with his aloof dad will keep Da Ming in town
longer than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Like a variant of Fellini's ``Amarcord,'' the movie introduces
us to regulars at the baths, with their problems and quirks. One
young man sings ``O Sole Mio'' as he bathes, but chokes up in
public without the inspiration of a showerhead. Another admits he's
grown impotent, shamed by the lengths his wife went to in
retrieving a gift from him that a thief snatched from her. (Master
Liu brews up a peacemaking bath for the couple, adding a very
specific ingredient to the water.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie also digresses several times, telling the story of
dwellers in dusty northern climes, where water is so scarce it's an
expensive commodity. These scenic interludes lend ``Shower'' an
extra, fablelike shimmer. As refreshing and as fleeting as an
afternoon thunderstorm, the movie makes for a genially conservative
summer treat. Writer-director Zhang Yang handles his tale with a
delicacy that makes you overlook its slightness.
</P>
<P>
   It's only after you leave the theater that you realize somebody
in the community would probably love to swipe Da Ming's return
train ticket to the big city and get the hell out of there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shower''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Zhu Xu and Pu Cun Xin. Rated PG-13 for profanity and
nudity. In Mandarin with subtitles. 1 hour, 32 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Simple and refreshing.

 &HT;    Geezer `Cowboys' ride high in well-crafted space vehicle
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Geezer chic gets a grand showcase in Clint Eastwood's
shamelessly crowd-pleasing ``Space Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood, who directed as well as stars, joins Tommy Lee Jones,
James Garner and Donald Sutherland as aging astronauts who were
axed from the fledgling program in 1958 by an uptight bureaucrat
(James Cromwell) who felt they weren't the proverbial team players.
They were replaced by a chimpanzee.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years later, Cromwell needs their help. A decrepit Russian
satellite launched several decades earlier is malfunctioning and
threatening to crash to Earth. Too big to be taken down by
conventional methods, the thing has to be repaired, and the only
guy still around who knows how to fix it is Eastwood. But he won't
play ball unless his whole team goes along. ``I can't fill up a
space ship with geriatrics,'' Cromwell pouts.
</P>
<P>
   Famous last words.
</P>
<P>
   The movie good-naturedly _ and unapologetically _ borrows from
any number of classic flicks. First, there's the
round-up-the-old-gang part _ a bit right out of ``The Magnificent
Seven.'' Except, instead of James Coburn whipping out the fastest
knife in the West, we get Sutherland (the ladies' man in the
group!) explaining that he only needs his glasses to read, to go to
the movies, to drive. ...
</P>
<P>
   The next segment _ the training part _ is straight out of ``The
Dirty Dozen.'' Only, these guys' ``crime'' is that they're over 30.
Aside from the usual period of adjustment to all the newfangled
technology and some strenuous workouts to prove they're physically
fit enough to serve, a friendly rivalry grows between our guys and
Cromwell's younger team of back-ups. For instance, in the
cafeteria, the kids send over a round of Ensure; in return, Clint
and company serve them a tray of baby food.
</P>
<P>
   The final part is the mission itself, which turns out to be a
surprisingly effective nail-biting adventure. Despite all the
tech-talk (you've got to connect the Grazmat to the Schizmo or the
whole thing'll blow!), we basically get the point: do, or die
trying.
</P>
<P>
   Several quibbles with the picture. One, Garner doesn't get
enough to do. Two, the fate of one of the four is telegraphed far
too early. Three, William Devane, as the project's flight director,
is handed some truly vapid dialogue. Four, not enough use is made
of the marvelous Courtney B. Vance, who plays one of the younger
astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   But on the whole, ``Space Cowboys'' is a delight. As craftily
savvy as it is well-crafted. The sheer pleasure of watching these
four old pros, together playing off one another like seasoned
veterans of the Senior Tour, is reason enough to see it. Better
yet, there's simply nothing else out there like it this summer. And
there's not likely to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Space Cowboys''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, James Garner and
Donald Sutherland. Rated PG-13 for some profanity. 2 hours, 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: The right stuff.

   CANADA-SHIP (Ottawa) _ Canadian troops stormed on board the

in which hundreds of millions of dollars of Canadian military

focus of a bitter commercial tug-of-war between its owner and the
firm that chartered the vessel to transport the equipment. The
squabble drew in the Canadian government, which grew increasingly

 &HT;    From unhappy housewife to porn star
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Stacy Baker switched her last name to Valentine, it was the
start of major changes. The Oklahoma housewife moved to Los
Angeles, found a porn-flick manager and ditched her controlling
husband _ the husband who first persuaded her to have breast
implants and encouraged her to pose for a nudie magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In Christine Fugate's documentary ``The Girl Next Door,''
Valentine is an engagingly slippery subject. She's part feminist
self-actualizer, part pawn of sexual stereotypes, undergoing a
series of plastic surgeries that transform her into a live-action,
hard-core Barbie doll. (Some of the procedures, including
liposuction, are shown onscreen; anyone buying a ticket out of
titillation also needs a strong stomach.)
</P>
<P>
   Sweet-faced and driven, Valentine admits that going into the
adult film industry was a choice she made from among meager
options. Raised to be a housewife by her supportive mother, she
found herself in a loveless marriage, aware of only one real
talent: ``I know I'm good at sex,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She proves this in scenes that show her professionalism in the
casually insane world of pornography. When ants interrupt an act of
alfresco coitus, she sensibly grabs a broom and sweeps the suckers
away. And in one all-night shoot, she endures 38-degree weather and
some special-effects smoke that irritates her lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Work becomes her life. She lives alone; she doesn't date. ``If I
need affection, I have my cat,'' she says. Things change when she
meets the one-named porn actor Julian, ``on the set.'' The
documentary becomes an interesting look at the ways a couple who
spend the day having sex with other people can manage (or fail) to
maintain love and trust at home.
</P>
<P>
   Though a whiff of doom hangs over the relationship, you find
yourself rooting for these two to find some normalcy in their
topsy-turvy world. But Julian admits he's in love with Stacy Baker,
whereas Stacy Valentine, her celebrity-seeking alter ego,
continually gets in the way.
</P>
<P>
   On a visit to Cannes, France, for a porn film festival,
Valentine crosses the line into prostitution, and the choice
creates a sadness that the movie never shakes. Admitting that she
faked pleasure during the liaison, she chirps, ``So I guess I can
act.'' But she can't cover the unease in her smile.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Annabel Chong, subject of the documentary ``Sex: The
Annabel Chong Story'' (screened last week at Cinefest), Valentine
comes off as a relatively stable person, loved by her mother and
stepfather and not driven by childhood demons. In the end, ``Girl
Next Door'' is like a dual biography, showing us the ways some
people develop a second personality to get ahead. In this way, it
becomes a microcosm of Los Angeles, a city where looks count for
everything and where everyone, to some degree, puts out for profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Girl Next Door''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Stacy Valentine. Unrated, but contains nudity and
hard-core sex acts. $3, $5 after 6 p.m. Through Thursday at
Cinefest (Georgia State University). 404-651-2463.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An interesting, evenhanded look at a woman trying
to make her mark in porn.

 &HT;    Main draw of `Mambo' is Russell's auburn mane
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only thing ``Mad About Mambo'' is truly mad about is Keri
Russell who, judging from her cascading curls and second billing,
must've filmed this uneven Irish charmer before becoming the WB's
``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in Belfast (meaning the Troubles provide an intriguing,
ever-present backdrop), the picture focuses on a soccer-mad lad
named Danny (William Ash) who dreams of playing for United,
Belfast's pro team. He faces two problems. First, he's Catholic
and, with the exception of an imported Brazilian superstar, United
is overwhelmingly Protestant. Second, Danny doesn't always have the
talent to match his passion. As his coach advises, ``Unless you do
something drastic to improve your game, you won't make it on any
team.''
</P>
<P>
   So Danny does something drastic. Inspired by his Brazilian
hero's remarks that ``when we play football, we don't run with the
ball, we dance,'' Danny signs up for Latin dance lessons. That's
where he falls for Lucy (Russell), who's rich, spoiled and
Protestant. The only thing going for him is her boisterous dad (a
movie-stealing Brian Cox), who loves his self-involved daughter
almost as much as he likes shaking her up.
</P>
<P>
   As a comedy, the movie has its moments _ especially the scenes
with Danny and his irrepressible pals. But as a romance, well, the
stars have almost zero chemistry. Filmmaker John Forte apparently
was so distracted by Russell's luxurious auburn mane and long legs
(she does a mean samba) that he failed to realize that Lucy comes
off as more than a bit of a pill. The notion that she's someone who
needs to be taken down a peg is fine, but the more we see of her,
the less we like her. It's the sort of movie where boy meets girl
and we don't really care if boy gets girl.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, because there are a lot of delightful little touches.
For instance, Danny's older brother speaks only Irish and dismisses
soccer as ``a British imperialist sport.'' On the other side,
there's the well-off Protestant matron who, when told Danny is
getting home by bus, smiles politely, ``Ah, we still have buses. I
thought your people had burnt them all.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is, Russell is probably the only reason ``Mad About
Mambo'' is getting a stateside release, yet she's the weakest thing
in the film. It's a star vehicle with an as-yet-unformed star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mad About Mambo''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring William Ash and Keri Russell. Directed by John Forte.
Rated PG-13 for profanity. 1 hour, 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Can't really dance to it.

<P>
   ``Across the Sea of Time'' G
</P>
<P>
   3-D Imax film
</P>
<P>
   about New York City.
</P>
<P>
   History comes alive visually in this 3-D Imax movie focusing on
New York City. It's full of big, gloriously detailed ``stereoview''
photographs depicting immigrant life at the turn of the century.
(Bob Longino) 51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adventures of
</P>
<P>
   Rocky and Bullwinkle'' PG (brief mild language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robert De Niro, Rene Russo
</P>
<P>
   and Jason Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   The live-action and animated comedy drags the heroic squirrel
and moose into the 21st century, and into three dimensions. The
movie front-loads its clever bits, and its second half offers
diminishing returns. It keeps you awake with its throwaway sight
gags, retro tone recalling ``Austin Powers'' and its pop culture
japes. (SM) At metro theaters. 1 hour, 32 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Momma's House'' PG-13 (crude humor, sexual,
</P>
<P>
   profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Martin Lawrence
</P>
<P>
   and Nia Long.
</P>
<P>
   It's one super-sized Martin Lawrence. As an FBI agent on a
neighborhood stakeout to capture a vicious bank robber, Lawrence
dons layer upon layer of prosthetics to impersonate a 325-pound,
small-town granny in Cartersville (the movie, however, was filmed
in Los Angeles). The results may be predictable, but with
Lawrence's manic comedic timing they are also occasionally quite
funny. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 39 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood Simple'' R (violence, sex, nudity and language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Dan Hedaya,
</P>
<P>
   Frances McDormand
</P>
<P>
   and M. Emmet Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   The Coen brothers' first film is back in all its devilishly
degenerate glory. Re-released in a spruced-up but still-smirking
so-called director's cut, the movie is pretty much exactly as it
was when it originally hit theaters in 1984. That is, a
good-old-boy gothic full of flashy camera angles and trashy people.
What's astonishing is how much of the Coens' unique talent was
evident from the start. (ERG) 1 hour, 37 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm a Cheerleader'' R (profanity and sexual themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Natasha Lyonne
</P>
<P>
   and Clea DuVall.
</P>
<P>
   Call it ``Girl, Intercepted.'' Megan (Natasha Lyonne) is a
cheerleader shipped off to a homosexual rehab center called True
Directions because of certain ``telling'' signs. There's potential
here for some funny, nasty satire, but filmmaker Jamie Babbit soon
backs off the risky stuff. The funniest thing in the movie is
RuPaul as a rehab counselor who proudly disowns his gay past and
wears a ``Straight is Great'' T-shirt. (ERG) 1 hour, 25 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Run'' G
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices of Mel Gibson
</P>
<P>
   and Miranda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Set on a chicken farm in 1950s Britain, the movie is about some
hens' repeated attempts to fly the coop after their villainous
owner decides there's more money in chicken pies than in chickens.
If you're in the mood for something offbeat and wackily deadpan,
this may be just your kind of amiably bird-brained entertainment.
(ERG) 1 hour, 22 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Coyote Ugly'' PG-13 (sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Piper Perabo,
</P>
<P>
   Adam Garcia, Maria Bello
</P>
<P>
   and John Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   Dog-face hideous. The come-on is five hot chicks serving liquor
in a rowdy fun-time saloon (they splash whiskey across the bar and
set it afire; they douse each others' T-shirts with big pitchers of
water). But it's really the slapdash story of a young waif, a
struggling songwriter aching for stardom in New York City.
``Coyote'' is profoundly stupid and earnestly inept at conveying a
story. (Bob Longino) At metro theaters. 1 hour, 34 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Croupier'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clive Owen
</P>
<P>
   and Alex Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   This 1998 film involves a struggling author who takes a job at a
casino running a roulette wheel to look for wrtiting inspiration.
Soon he's convinced to join a robbery scheme. ``Croupier'' has more
on its mind than danger and plot twists. It's a fascinating,
hard-edged portrait of a man who swears he doesn't gamble. (SM) 1
hour, 31 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Girl Next Door'' Unrated (contains nudity
</P>
<P>
   and hard-core sex acts)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Stacy Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting, evenhanded look at a woman trying to make her
mark in porn. In Christine Fugate's documentary, Stacy Valentine is
part feminist self-actualizer, part pawn of sexual stereotypes,
undergoing a series of plastic surgeries that transform her into a
live-action, hard-core Barbie doll. (Anyone buying a ticket out of
titillation also needs a strong stomach.) (SM) 404-651-2463. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator'' R (extreme violence,
</P>
<P>
   perverse sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand _ or, if you want to add computer effects, 200,000
_ thumbs up for Ridley Scott's spectacle starring Russell Crowe as
a Roman general, who returns to the Colosseum to take revenge on
the odious Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The battles staged
before the mob of mindless ancient Romans are the film's
centerpieces, but its brave heart (so to speak) is Crowe. (ERG) 2
hours, 33 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' PG-13 (sexuality,
</P>
<P>
   profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Cage plays Memphis Raines, a reformed car thief called
back behind the wheel when his little brother bungles a deal for a
British crime lord. If you sit through the usual formula garbage,
``Gone'' delivers a long, harrowing car chase that easily outdoes
the motorcycle finale in ``M: I-2.'' A few IQ points may be lost
while watching the flick. But you'll be having too much fun to
care. (SM) 1 hour, 59 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollow Man'' R (graphic violence,
</P>
<P>
   nudity, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Bacon
</P>
<P>
   and Elisabeth Shue.
</P>
<P>
   A high-tech fusion of ``The Invisible Man'' and ``Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde,'' it lets director Paul Verhoeven (``Starship Troopers,''
``Total Recall'') show off some gruesome, state-of-the-art computer
effects and exercise his gleeful brand of brutal action. But his
filmmaking energy is wasted on a weak script and characters so
two-dimensional, they're virtually all transparent. (SM) 1 hour, 54
minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The In Crowd'' PG-13 (violence, sexuality, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Susan Ward,
</P>
<P>
   Lori Heuring and Matthew Settle.
</P>
<P>
   A community theater mix of ``Rebecca'' and ``Caddyshack.'' At a
country club, young women with deep, dark secrets populate a plot
that builds to a final cat fight that has to take place in a
setting with as many lethal implements as a hardware store. (Elvis
Mitchell, New York Times)
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 50 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus' Son'' R (profanity, sexual and
</P>
<P>
   drug content, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Billy Crudup
</P>
<P>
   and Samantha Morton.
</P>
<P>
   Like the book of Denis Johnson's vivid short stories that it's
based on, the movie mirrors its protagonist's sense of dislocation
as it woozily tours a few years in the life of a boozing,
pill-popping young man (Billy Crudup). The film is like
``Trainspotting'' or ``Drugstore Cowboy'' played out on the
suicidally prosaic Midwest plains. (SM) 1 hour, 50 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Loser'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Biggs
</P>
<P>
   and Mena Suvari.
</P>
<P>
   It's mostly a bore. Jason Biggs is Paul, a scholarship student
fresh from a small Midwestern town who arrives in New York City
with full-blown naivete. He meets Dora (Mena Suvari), a bright,
Gothic-styled American beauty who's sleeping with the college's
uppity, self-absorbed English lit professor (Greg Kinnear). Paul
and Dora getting together is no surprise, but it takes an eternity
to happen. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 38 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Mad About Mambo'' PG-13 (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring William Ash
</P>
<P>
   and Keri Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Can't really dance to it. Set in Belfast, the picture focuses on
a soccer-mad Catholic lad (William Ash) who joins a dance class to
improve his game. There he falls for a beauty (Keri Russell) who's
rich, spoiled and Protestant. As a comedy, the movie has some good
moments (the Troubles are gently but effectively lampooned). But as
a romance, well, it doesn't help that the stars have zero
chemistry. (ERG) 1 hour, 40 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' R (sexual content, crude
</P>
<P>
   humor, profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Carrey
</P>
<P>
   and Renee Zellweger.
</P>
<P>
   Those impish filmmaking Farrelly brothers, Peter and Bobby,
prove yet again that, no matter how foul and nasty their humor,
they understand very clearly how to set up the joke and when to
fire the over-the-top punch. This movie, starring Jim Carrey and
Renee Zellweger, is bound to make you laugh. Too bad it's clueless
when it comes to constructing a plot with which to thread the
powerful jokes. (Bob Longino) 2 hours. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan to the Max'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Imax documentary
</P>
<P>
   about Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   It shoots; it scores. Like Mount Everest, Michael Jordan has his
own 2-D Imax film. It's the biggest format for the biggest sports
story ever told. Part bio, part well-deserved pat on the back, it's
a loving look at the Chicago Bulls superstar and hones in on the
1998 NBA playoffs when a determined Jordan led his team to a sixth
championship before retirement. (Bob Longino) 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission: Impossible 2'' PG-13 (intense sequences of violent
</P>
<P>
   action and some sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Cruise
</P>
<P>
   and Thandie Newton.
</P>
<P>
   This underscripted sequel, directed by John Woo, is a
full-fledged Tom Cruise star vehicle as he battles baddies after an
Ebola-like virus. The movie contains overamplified kung-fu fights
and a very long motorcycle chase consisting of quick, tight shots.
The sexy Thandie Newton holds her own in the film's first half, but
gets demoted to playing the Girl for the last act. She deserves
better. So do we. (SM) 2 hours, 6 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutty Professor II:
</P>
<P>
   The Klumps'' PG-13 (crude humor and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Eddie Murphy
</P>
<P>
   and Janet Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The big problem in ``Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' is the
nutty professor. This sequel to the 1996 hit seems designed for
video: You want to fast-forward through all the parts focused on
tubby scientist Sherman (Eddie Murphy) so you can get back to the
rest of his family (played by Murphy, Murphy, Murphy and Murphy,
plus a fat kid). Murphy is jaw-droppingly funny. But the script is
simply not nutty enough. (SM) At metro theaters. 1 hour, 45
minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Old Man and the Sea'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   A live-action animated short.
</P>
<P>
   This 'toon, based on an Ernest Hemingway novel, is, like the
author's word choice, deceptively simple and strikingly beautiful.
It's everything a moviegoer would expect, but didn't get, from
``Fantasia/2000.'' (Bob Longino) 6 and 8 p.m. Fridays; 6 p.m.
Saturdays and Sundays. Through September. Fernbank Museum of
Natural History. Tickets: 404-929-6400. Imax information line:
404-370-0019. 22 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriot'' R (strong war violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mel Gibson,
</P>
<P>
   Heath Ledger and Jason Isaacs.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Gibson single-handedly wins the American Revolution, among
other historical revisions. The latest from Roland Emmerich takes
the jingoistic spirit of his ``Independence Day'' and amps it to a
feverish, flag-waving pitch. The movie is beautiful on the eye and
crafted with great care. It relies on oversimplification, cheap
sentiment and a villain so two-dimensionally nasty even Satan
wouldn't claim him. (SM) 2 hours, 44 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm'' PG-13 (profanity and scenes of peril)
</P>
<P>
   Starring George Clooney,
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane.
</P>
<P>
   The fishermen of the Andrea Gail take a pounding, and so does
the audience in the latest movie directed by Wolfgang Petersen.
Based on Sebastian Junger's best seller, it re-creates the
collision of three weather systems in the fall of 1991 _ and the
battle of men (George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg) and women (Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio) at sea, trying to survive the monstrous
sea. (SM) 2 hours, 15 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon the Movie 2000'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated film featuring the
</P>
<P>
   voices of Ikue Ootani
</P>
<P>
   and Unsho Ishizuka.
</P>
<P>
   The new Pokemon movie is a lot better than last year's first
flick. And slightly better than a poke in the eye. ``Pokemon the
Movie 2000'' has more accomplished animation, more drama and a
decent-enough sprinkling of jokes, all adding up to something
barely watchable. Still, it's mostly cheaply made, barely
interesting and focused on niche marketing. (Bob Longino) 1 hour,
24 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Scary Movie'' R (strong crude sexual humor,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, drug use and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Anna Faris,
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Wayans and Marlon Wayans.
</P>
<P>
   Propped up by the Wayans brothers _ Keenen (writer/director),
Shawn (writer/actor) and Marlon (writer/actor) _ ``Scary Movie'' is
a parody of teen horror flicks. The ``Scream'' trilogy, ``I Know
What You Did Last Summer,'' ``The Blair Witch Project'' and, just
because it was popular, ``The Matrix,'' all get skewered in a
thousand jokes that are either hilarious, funny, not funny or
simply crude. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 28 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaft'' R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson,
</P>
<P>
   Christian Bale and Jeffrey Wright.
</P>
<P>
   You can dig it. Sporting the original Oscar-winning theme song,
the ``Shaft'' 2000, starring Samuel L. Jackson, is one bad
I'm-messin'-with-your-head movie. While the plot is a trumped-up
trifle involving both a suspected racist killer (Christian Bale)
and whacked-out drug lord (Jeffrey Wright), the movie clicks
because of the performances. Wright steals the picture, directed by
John Singleton. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 37 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Shower'' PG-13 (profanity and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Zhu Xu
</P>
<P>
   and Pu Cun Xin.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing where it's going doesn't really spoil the charm of
``Shower,'' a gentle Chinese comedy about the restorative power of
water, tradition and family ties. (In Mandarin with subtitles.)
(SM) 1 hour, 32 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Space Cowboys'' PG-13 (some profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clint Eastwood,
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lee Jones, James Garner
</P>
<P>
   and Donald Sutherland.
</P>
<P>
   The right stuff. Geezer chic gets a grand showcase in Clint
Eastwood's shamelessly crowd-pleasing comedy-thriller. When a
decrepit Russian satellite threatens to crash to Earth, four aging
astronauts who were axed from the program back in the '50s are
summoned back into service to repair the thing. The best part of
the film is watching these veterans play off each other like
seasoned pros on the Senior Tour. (ERG) 2 hours, 15 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunshine'' R (nudity, sex and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ralph Fiennes,
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Ehle and Rosemary Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Though overlong (three hours) and not a very smiley-face story
(the title is ironic), this bleak, sweeping epic is still worth
your time and effort. Oscar-winning director Istvan Szabo
(``Mephisto'') examines the first half of the 20th century through
the painful prism of three generations of a Jewish family in
Hungary. Ralph Fiennes plays the central male in each passage along
with a fine supporting cast. (ERG) 3 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas and the Magic Railroad'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alec Baldwin
</P>
<P>
   and Peter Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't always stay on track. For anyone older than 6 or who
isn't already a fan of the British TV series, this could be
subtitled ``The Little Engine That Couldn't.'' Things start to go
wrong in a magical land where talking trains are menaced by a
bullying diesel and their protector, Mr. Conductor (Alec Baldwin).
It's not total a wreck, but avoid being railroaded into sitting
through it unless there's no choice. (ERG) 1 hour, 20 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``What Lies Beneath'' PG-13 (terror, violence, sensuality
</P>
<P>
   and brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michelle Pfeiffer
</P>
<P>
   and Harrison Ford.
</P>
<P>
   What lies beneath ``What Lies Beneath'' is a script that could
have come from a 1970s TV movie. Narratively old-fashioned, but
boosted by star performances from Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison
Ford and suspenseful direction, it's a lovingly crafted throwback
to haunted-house movies that relied more on suggestion and slowly
building creepiness than over-the-top effects. (SM) 2 hours, 10
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men'' PG-13 (sci-fi action violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman,
</P>
<P>
   Anna Paquin, Patrick Stewart
</P>
<P>
   and Ian McKellen.
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men'' never comes close to classic status. The best movie to
work this superhero turf lately was the shamelessly entertaining
``The Matrix.'' But director Bryan Singer and his collaborators
treat the comic's mythology with seriousness and respect (unlike
other recent, slapdash comic adaptations ``Spawn'' and ``Blade'').
It's an engaging popcorn movie in a summer that's littered with
duds. (SM) 1 hour, 44 minutes. B-

 &HT;    CONVENTION AN ISLAND OF CALM IN A GUN-CONTROL STORM
 &HT;    660&AMP;add.
 &HT;    EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Gun-control issues are swarming around the
Republican National Convention this week, but have not made it
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Despite several Washington news conferences by gun-control
proponents last week, a silent rally in downtown Philadelphia with
a display of thousands of shoes to represent gunfire victims, and
an ad campaign attacking George W. Bush, GOP delegates say they are
not all that interested in the issue or concerned about its
political effect.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party platform, which has softened on several
points compared to previous years, has not changed when it comes to
guns. It reiterates a defense of ``the constitutional right to keep
and bear arms'' and argues that self-defense is a basic human
right. The answer to violence, it argues, is stronger enforcement
of existing laws.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrell Blount(cq), a GOP delegate from Bethel, N.C., couldn't
agree more.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we convict these people, we need to put them away,'' he
said. ``We don't need to pat them on the wrist and say, 'So sorry,
come back later.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Joe Rogers of Colorado, one of several African
Americans speaking to the convention, shared the same view. ``We
ought to keep (guns) out of the hands of criminals'' while
respecting law-abiding citizens, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The right to self-defense is particularly important for women,
he added. ``I want my wife to have the ability to protect my family
and our children and herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere this week, gun control has been a hot topic.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of more regulation _ including President Clinton _
have been holding press conferences, releasing studies, making
statements and airing commercials, hoping to bring attention to
Bush's record on gun issues in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Bush has generally sided with the National Rifle
Association. He has signed bills allowing people to carry concealed
weapons and preventing municipalities from suing gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent fund-raising letter, Sarah Brady, chairwoman of
Handgun Control Inc., the leading gun-control advocacy group,
wrote: ``My friend, if you and I truly want a safer America, we
cannot allow George W. Bush to be elected president of the United
States. A political disaster of that magnitude would mean four long
years of being on the defensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of gun control also held a rally Saturday in downtown
Philadelphia and set up a display of 18,000 pairs of shoes,
representing people who have died by gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Handgun Control is airing commercials in
Philadelphia that portray Bush as a pawn of the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   The television ad features a video clip from an NRA meeting
earlier this year in which First Vice President Kayne Robinson says
that if Bush gets elected ``we'll have ... a president where we
work out of their office.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, a voice-over says: ``Tell Governor Bush the White
House is our house and it shouldn't belong to the NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   But GOP delegates say they are not worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has a reasonable approach to gun control. He is
working hard to ensure that there's safety in schools. ... He's
talked about trigger locks. He's not an extremist on guns,'' said
Patrick Ballantine of Wilmington, N.C., an incumbent candidate for
the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the NRA is strongly endorsing Governor Bush, there
are some things that he diverges from with their beliefs. ... He's
going to appeal to anybody who is concerned about gun control so
the Democrats really don't have an issue there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Scott McInnis, R-Colo., said that ``the Democrats will make
it an issue, but there are a hundred different issues out there.
Bush's focus is going to be on education, Social Security, and the
economy. I am sure those are the big issues.''
</P>
<P>
   While Handgun Control plans to spend at least $4 million on
political races this year, the NRA plans to spend a record $15
million on state and federal elections this fall.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The firearms industry is also spending some money to attack
Democrats who support a series of lawsuits by state and local
governments against gun manufacturers. The National Shooting Sports
Foundation, the industry's leading trade association, is airing TV
commercials during both major political conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being blamed for crime and violence by this
administration and big-city mayors whose greedy lawyers are using
your tax dollars to sue us,'' says the narrator in one of the two
60-second spots, which depict a well-dressed man, presumably a
lawyer, carefully shredding an American flag.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, gun control took the spotlight in Congress after
Columbine High School students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold
horrified the nation by using high-powered guns to murder 12
students and a teacher before killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy and other highly publicized school shootings had a
great impact on the public and lawmakers, despite the fact that gun
homicides have dropped over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, gun homicides in
the United States dropped from 14,740 in 1995 to 10,976 in 1998.
Homicides committed by teenagers between the ages of 14 and 17 also
dropped, from 2,692 in 1995 to 1,433 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control proponents argue that the numbers are still
staggering and that gun violence will only drop significantly when
the number of firearms is reduced.
</P>
<P>
   A package of gun control proposals that includes stricter
background checks at gun shows, requiring child safety locks on
guns, and banning the import of high-capacity ammunition clips has
been stuck in the Republican-led Congress for months.

 &HT;    HERE'S A COUPLE OF POLITICAL SECRETS
 &HT;    Moving in the (k) commentary and (p) political categories for
release Sunday, Aug. 6.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The 15,000 journalists who came to the Republican
National Convention endured threatening thunderclouds amid a
drought of political news. Caught in what one headline writer
dubbed ``the Bushworld archipelago,'' reporters were reduced to
guessing how much of a post-convention ``bounce'' the Texas
governor would get in the national polls.
</P>
<P>
   While there will be no lack of polls in the next three months,
they really don't reveal too much. That's due to a little secret of
U.S. presidential politics: There won't be a national election
either.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution mandates 51 stand-alone contests in each state
and the District of Columbia. Save for Maine and Nebraska, it's
winner take all.
</P>
<P>
   That means political strategists for George W. Bush and Al Gore
are planning how best to allocate money and candidate time to
attain the 270 electoral votes needed to win.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's political master builder, thinks in such
terms. He focuses on the battleground states in what he views as
likely the closest presidential race in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Within each pivotal mini-race, both sides target swing voters.
For the Bush camp, as Rove sees it, they are suburbanites,
especially those who live in older, close-in suburbs; Catholics,
and non-Cuban Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   While every survey taken during the GOP convention showed Bush
running ahead of Gore, Rove expects the race to tighten in the
fall, when Bush meets Gore in what will likely be two televised
90-minute debates.
</P>
<P>
   To see why Rove's views may be on the mark, take a look at the
1988 electoral map, when George Bush the Elder won the presidency
with 426 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Give his son West Virginia, which the Democrats won in 1988 but
where Bush the Younger now runs well ahead. Then take away from him
Bill Clinton's Arkansas and Al Gore's Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, subtract eight more states that the elder Bush captured
but that his son could plausibly lose to Gore in a tight election:
California, New Mexico, Missouri, Ohio, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New
Jersey and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The result: the rivals would wind in up in a dead heat of 269
votes each, thereby throwing the contest into the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Such speculation leads to the second little secret of U.S.
presidential politics: A winner's capacity to govern effectively
depends largely on his ability during the campaign to muster a
working majority for his policies in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to build up his overall vote count in 1966, Clinton
stiffed bread-and-butter Democratic spear carriers. In time, he
paid price that included a Senate impeachment trial that halted
work on what mattered to him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who makes a political point out of his having worked well
with a Democrat-run legislature in Texas, now runs a similar risk.
He ought to know that the scene in Austin, where the lawmakers meet
only every other year for 140 days, is quite different than what he
would find in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to prevail, Bush seems to feel that he must run apart
from congressional Republicans. In the end, he too may pay a price.

`HOLLOW MAN': OH WHERE, OH WHERE HAS OUR SCIENTIST GONE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The beginning of ``Hollow Man'' is witty enough. An innocent rat
skitters along the floor of an apparently empty steel cage toward a
dish of water, only to be snatched up and devoured by an unseen
predator, whose voracious maw is outlined in the hapless rodent's
blood while the rest remains invisible. Cut to Kevin Bacon in his
apartment, burning the midnight oil in front of his computer. He
stops to do to a Hostess Twinkie what the spectral animal (who
turns out to be a gorilla named Isabelle) has just done to the rat,
and then his computer screen, which has been performing some kind
of 3-D molecular modeling, flashes a dire warning: ``STATUS:
UNSTABLE.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes indeed. In short order we discover that Bacon's character _
a scientist named Sebastian Caine, head of a top-secret,
Pentagon-financed research project _ is a peeping tom, a
self-pitying egomaniac and a very difficult co-worker. How
Hollywood mad scientists have changed since the days of white lab
coats and heavy black-rimmed glasses! Sebastian drives a sleek
silver Porsche and wears a half-length black leather coat that
would make Shaft jealous. Your tax dollars at work, folks.
</P>
<P>
   Caine and his team _ which includes his ex-girlfriend Linda
(Elisabeth Shue) and her current beau (Josh Brolin), as well as a
movie-diverse assortment of specialists _ are at the cutting edge
of a burgeoning new science making stuff invisible, or, more
precisely, is causing living creatures to ``phase shift out of
quantum sync with the visible universe.'' This involves injecting
the subjects with a bright blue serum, which first induces seizures
and then the gradual disappearance of their bodies, one layer at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   We first see the process in reverse with Isabelle, whose bones,
organs, and muscles slowly come into view as she writhes on a
gurney. Before long, in response to pressure from the doddering
generals who control his financing, the impatient Sebastian decides
to become the first human to undergo the process.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon, well-known for his willingness to appear nude in films,
strips down, quite literally, to nothing. Luckily the lab is
well-stocked with infrared goggles, allowing the still-visible
scientists to keep track of their elusive boss. Later on they whip
up some latex to help him look almost human, or at least like a
half-melted Kevin Bacon Halloween mask.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of work has clearly gone into the special effects in
``Hollow Man,'' which uses the latest computer-generated imagery to
update the cinematic obsession with invisibility that dates at
least to James Whale's ``Invisible Man'' in 1933. (It also uses
some tried and true film techniques, including that scary movie
staple, the bad guy's point-of-view shot). Actually, according to
the production notes, ``Hollow Man'' belongs to an even older
tradition, since ``the theme of invisibility is familiar in
premodern narrative,'' figuring prominently, for example, in the
second book of Plato's ``Republic.'' And that's not all: ``From
`The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus' to H.G. Wells' `The
Invisible Man,''' the notes elaborate, ``the idea of invisibility
has been a source of wonder and curiosity, and will doubtless
remain so until the day it becomes a reality.'' Doubtless.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're looking for wonder, or even passable
entertainment, you'd do better to curl up with Plato _ or with the
latest work of literary scholarship from Columbia's publicity
department _ than to endure the long, slow, unraveling of this
movie, which can't even muster the intelligence to be pretentious
or the bravado to be amusingly bad. This is a shame, since the
director, Paul Verhoeven, can usually be counted on for lurid
thrills or for splashy special-effects sublimity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollow Man'' has neither the ripe atmospherics of ``Basic
Instinct'' or ``The Fourth Man'' (the kinky Dutch sex thriller that
earned Verhoeven a ticket to Hollywood) nor the full-throttle
excitement of ``Total Recall'' or the first ``Robocop.'' It even
lacks the howling shamelessness that has turned ``Showgirls'' into
a cult favorite among connoisseurs of guilty video pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Verhoeven and the screenwriter, Andrew Marlowe, have taken what
could have been a fascinating, creepy psychological thriller and
turned it into a labored, implausible piece of action-movie hack
work. Once nobody can see him _ and once he no longer has to look
at himself in the mirror _ Sebastian becomes intoxicated with the
power and freedom that his new state confers. The best part of the
movie tracks his rapid slides from petulant narcissism into
demented evil.
</P>
<P>
   He sneaks up on the high-strung veterinarian (Kim Dickens) and
unbuttons her top while she sleeps and then quickly and with a
minimum of soul-searching descends from hide-and-seek pranks to
raping his neighbor, spying on Linda and taking out his
frustrations on a helpless invisible dog.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of exploring the underside of Sebastian's
personality, or the tantalizing liberty that invisibility might
offer, ``Hollow Man'' quickly becomes a pallid retread of ``The
Terminator'' crossed with a half-dozen second-rate horror movies,
as his fellow scientists pursue Sebastian through their mazelike
underground compound and he dispatches them in the most predictable
order possible.
</P>
<P>
   Fire extinguishers, bags of human blood and a sprinkler system
provide occasions for some show-offy effects as Bacon's unclothed
frame is outlined by computer-enhanced mist and moisture. At the
very end, for reasons doubtless having to do with the finer points
of quantum synchronization, Bacon takes on the appearance of a very
angry anatomical model, all veins and muscles and popping eyeballs,
that has escaped from a medical school classroom to take revenge on
humanity _ or to steal one last kiss from his old flame. Some
things are better left unseen.
</P>

`SAVING GRACE': EVERYBODY, APPARENTLY, MUST GET STONED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rulers of Britain may have embarked on an aggressive
campaign of modernization _ what with the Millennium Dome, the
transformation of the House of Lords and all that throbbing techno
music _ but a segment of the entertainment industry remains
stubbornly wedded to ancient notions of the British character. The
once-mighty empire remains, if recent movies are to be believed, a
nation of absent-minded vicars, codgers and goosey, tea-swilling
ladies who populate cozy crofts and seaside villages and
manufacture eccentricity for the export market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Grace,'' which tries to do for marijuana-dealing what
``The Full Monty'' did for male striptease, is this summer's bait
for the Anglophiles who keep shows like `` Bean'' and ``Keeping Up
Appearances'' running on public television. Though it might be
described as a BBC sitcom as imagined by Cheech and Chong, ``Saving
Grace,'' directed by Nigel Cole, springs from the imagination of
Craig Ferguson. Ferguson wrote the screenplay with Mark Crowdy and
helped to produce the picture, in which he also stars.
</P>
<P>
   A regular on ``The Drew Carey Show'' on ABC and the writer and
star of a recent big-screen hair-care comedy called ``The Big
Tease,'' Ferguson is a leading contender for the title of World's
Most Amusing Scot. Here he is fairly subdued in the role of
Matthew, a transplanted Glaswegian working as a gardener in a
picturesque town in Cornwall and enjoying, in addition to the
traditional pint at the pub, a friendly toke or two with his pals,
including the local doctor, played by the very amusing Martin
Clunes.
</P>
<P>
   But then Matthew's employer, a local widow named Grace (Brenda
Blethyn), encounters some serious money trouble, owing to the
financial irresponsibility of her late husband, who has jumped from
a plane, leaving her with a mountain of debt. Grace must raise
$450,000 or lose her picturesque stone house, and so she and
Matthew decide to clear the orchids from her greenhouse, install a
bunch of hydroponic lights and set about growing some high-quality
hemp.
</P>
<P>
   Mild complications bump the plot along. Some are farcical _ as
when Grace goes to find a dealer in London, decked in an outfit
inspired by either Barbara Cartland or ``American Pimp''_ and some
more serious, like the fact that Matthew's girlfriend, a local
fisherwoman (Valerie Edmond), is pregnant. The movie has a gentle,
silly vibe, and it would peter out in triviality if not for
Blethyn's gift for finding the pain and frustration behind Grace's
facade of housewifely capability.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, all the jokes exploit the same tired premise, which
is the spectacle of variously dotty and stuffy Englishmen and women
getting stoned, wittingly and not. A long set piece involving the
two biddies who run the town convenience store, and who brew up a
pot of tea from the plants they find in Grace's greenhouse, sets
the tone. They giggle uncontrollably and then come down with the
munchies, just like everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   That they're English and elderly apparently makes their antics
screamingly funny to people who would turn up their noses at
similar humor in a film like ``Scary Movie.'' But dopiness, as it
were, transcends culture and nationality, though it is a bit
annoying when it masquerades as good taste and sophistication.

 &HT;    Some trivia behind the Coen brothers' first movie
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  The movie has been trimmed by about eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A prologue has been added in which a pipe-smoking film
preservationist praises the ``digital enhancement,'' the ``ultra
ultra sound'' and adds that ``the boring parts have been taken
out.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Blood Simple,''' he sighs philosophically. ``Forever young.
Forever young.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Frances McDormand, who later won a best actress Oscar for her
pregnant cop in ``Fargo,'' made her film debut in ``Blood Simple.''
However, her first professional acting job was here at the Alliance
Theatre, as Viola in Kent Stephens' production of ``Twelfth
Night.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Helping the Coens in their ``luridly playful'' camerawork was
cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld, who went on to direct ``Men in
Black'' and ``Get Shorty.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The voice heard on one of the characters' answering machine
belongs to Holly Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In their news conference at the New York Film Festival in the
fall of 1984, the brothers explained they had shot the movie in
Texas because one of them (Joel) had ``lived there for awhile and
knew the area. I knew we could make a low-budget feature there. And
the weather was good.'' Brother Ethan's eerily un-prescient
addition was, ``Texas is a more exotic place for murder than
Minneapolis, which is where we come from.'' Um, you betcha.

 &HT;    Weekend TV lineup
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News ServiceToday
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``100 Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Moments on TV'' (6-11 p.m. on
VH1; replays from midnight-4 a.m.) _ VH1 counts 'em down again,
with the final new episode airing at 10 p.m. (280758) And still
they don't include Steve Martin doing ``King Tut'' on ``Saturday
Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Denis Leary: No Cure for Cancer'' (10 p.m. on Comedy
Central, 934452) _ Leary's blistering one-hour stand-up routine of
several years back stands as one of the comedy highlights of the
'90s. Comedy Central will have to bleep it heavily, but Leary has
never been as brutally hilarious as he was in this show.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Quarantine'' (8 p.m. on ABC, 2899) _ In this new disaster
flick about a lethal virus that threatens the world, Harry Hamlin
is the president of the United States, and Nastassja Kinksi is a
research scientist. Hey, it could happen!
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dave Chappelle: Killin' Them Softly'' (11 p.m. on HBO,
401327) _ Film audiences know Chappelle for roles in ``The Nutty
Professor'' (the Eddie Murphy version) and ``Blue Streak,'' but
he's mainly a sharp stand-up guy. In this new special, rated TV-MA
(mature audiences, for language), he takes on racial stereotypes as
well as police encounters with blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Frontline: From Jesus to Christ: The First Christians''
(12:30 p.m. on WGTV, 414544) _ WGTV reruns this four-hour
``Frontline'' special from 1998. It's a fairly rigorous analysis of
what historians think they can know with certainty about the life
of Christ, followed by a chronicle of the rise of the early
Christian church. Matters of faith (such as the virgin birth and
the resurrection) are dealt with barely or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Influences'' (7:30 p.m. on Bravo, 933761) _ A new half-hour
series lets stars talk about who inspired them. In Sunday's
premiere, Tracey Ullman pays tribute to Lily Tomlin's ``Laugh-In''
days while Ted Danson singles out John Cleese of ``Monty Python's
Flying Circus.'' Alan Alda hosts.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``One Kill'' (8 p.m. on Showtime, 930693) _ Anne Heche (right)
stars as the defendant in this new courtroom drama, on trial for
the murder of her lover and commanding officer (Sam Shepard).
</P>
<P>
   Best Bet
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The 10th Kingdom'' (Part 1 of 4 at 8 tonight on NBC, 51433 )
</P>
<P>
   If you missed this magical miniseries back in February when
there was so much sweeps competition, do yourself a favor and give
it a try in its first rerun.
</P>
<P>
   Writer Simon Moore (``Gulliver's Travels'') re-imagines every
fairy tale you ever heard (and some you haven't) into a deliriously
wacky Freudian jumble that's both contemporary and timeless. A New
York waitress (Kimberly Williams) and her oafish dad (John
Larroquette) travel through a magic mirror into an enchanted land
where revisionist versions of legendary characters abound (Snow
White, Cinderella, Red Riding Hood, the archetypal Evil Queen). But
there are many fresh twists (magic mushrooms singing Procol Harum's
``Whiter Shade of Pale,'' a voracious but tender-hearted wolf/man
like nothing you've ever seen, beer bottles multiplying in a fridge
like the brooms in ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice'').
</P>
<P>
   Eight hours long, ``10th Kingdom'' can leave you exhausted,
exhilarated or both and can be too much of a good thing. But that's
rarely a problem with TV, particularly in the summer. Continues at
8 p.m. Saturday (23037), 7 p.m. Sunday (29761) and 8 p.m. Monday
(50945).

   CVN-CONVENTION-RDP (Philadelphia) _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush
accepts his party's presidential nomination in a speech in which he
is expected to talk about the Clinton years in a ``regretful tone,
not a harsh tone,'' according to his press secretary. He is also
expected to tell the delegates that this is a ``unique moment'' of
peace and prosperity that provides the opportunity to solve some
long-standing problems. By STEWART M. POWELL.

   CVN-GOP-GAYS (Philadelphia) _ Leaders of the Human Rights
Campaign, the nation's oldest gay political organization, hold a

discrimination or allowing them to serve in the military. By ERIC
ROSENBERG.

</P>
<P>
   CVN-BLACKS (Philadelphia) _ While the diversity theme of the
convention has brought African-Americans to the podium and stage,
it also has generated plenty of criticism about the contrasting
white face of the convention delegates. It would be fine with the
Republicans if they drew some more black votes, but that would
probably just be icing on the real goal: reassuring white, suburban

   CVN-MEANS-COLUMN (Philadelphia) _ Everyone knew they wouldn't _
couldn't, shouldn't _ keep it up. All that gooey sweetness just
wasn't real. Mama and papa Bush broke through the cocoon of
convention platitudes first, rising to President Clinton's bait to
defend their son Dubya with some sharp-tongued cracks about
Clinton's lack of character. Then GOP veep nominee Dick Cheney cut
to the chase, dropping those vague allusions to Democratic failings
in favor of a direct attack on the real target here, Vice President
Al Gore. By MARIANNE MEANS.
</P>
<P>
   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ The relationship between the
George W. Bush's Republicans and Bill Clinton is a fascinating
study in contradictions. On the one hand, GOP leaders express their
disgust with the president's behavior and speak longingly of having
a president worthy of their respect. On the other hand, their
decision to transform the GOP's image by opening the party's doors
widely to African Americans, Hispanics and gays copies the type of
strategy that twice won the presidency for Clinton and the
Democrats. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON. (For release Sunday, Aug 6.)

 ART ADVISORY: With two photos, of Kelli Sipp (NNS4) and the set-up
for the GOP's balloon drop (NNS5) 
 By DRU SEFTON  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Pulling the strings at the Republican and
Democratic balloon drops is the reigning power couple of decorative
balloon art.
</P>
<P>
   In the GOP's corner is Treb Heining, owner of Balloonart by Treb
in Newport Beach, Calif., who was set to loose up to 200,000
balloons Thursday night in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   A living balloon legend, he created the world's first balloon
arch and performed massive balloon drops, or releases, for the
opening ceremony of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles,
numerous Super Bowls, presidential inaugurations and Oscar shows.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, also dropping nearly 200,000 balloons in Los
Angeles on Aug. 17, is Heining's girlfriend, Kelli Sipp, owner of
Kelli's Balloon Studio in La Verne, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Sipp was the 1999 International Designer of the Year, besting
more than 1,150 balloon artists from 39 countries at the 15th
annual International Balloon Arts Competition. She's the only
designer to simultaneously hold first place in large sculpture,
table centerpiece and buffet arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The two met four years ago at -- where else? -- a balloon
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Just as opposing politicos Mary Matalin and James Carville
didn't discuss work during the 1996 presidential campaign, Sipp,
40, and Heining, 46, aren't swapping any information.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept his drop a total secret from me,'' Sipp said.
</P>
<P>
   They have worked together in the past, however, most notably on
the millennium celebration in New York's Times Square. As the
``airborne effects'' manager, Heining supervised a crew of more
than 100 that dropped tens of thousands of balloons and tons of
confetti at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Sipp said Heining's balloon drops have a distinct style. ``I was
watching him on CNN on the floor of the convention'' during
preparations in Philadelphia, she said. ``I could see his touches.
Unique.''
</P>
<P>
   What would those touches be? Sipp turned evasive. ``I shouldn't
speak too much for him,'' she said. ``There are lots of secrets
that go on in balloon drops.''
</P>
<P>
   Sipp did let slip one detail: She'll be using special
``signature balloons'' that delegates may have autographed.
</P>
<P>
   Heining's response: ``Oh, I wouldn't know anything about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached by cell phone on the frantic eve of his balloon drop,
while finalizing preparations amid the chaos of the convention
center floor, he had little time to say more.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, each political party is just as hush-hush. The
balloon drop is the colorful climax of the convention, just after
the presidential hopeful has accepted the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Balloons are suspended in netting from catwalks. Workers pull
cords to send the balloons cascading down atop the delegates. The
spectacle usually lasts up to 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that all-important moment, signaling the end of the
convention and beginning of the official campaign, is known among
pundits as ``when the balloons drop.''
</P>
<P>
   So both Republicans and Democrats fret about being outdone,
particularly in the number of balloons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were suffocating in balloons,'' New York Rep. Carolyn
Maloney told a reporter after the '96 Democratic convention in
Chicago. ``They were up to your nostrils.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few scant details that each party did reveal
regarding convention balloons:
</P>
<P>
   -- About 40 students from the music program at Penn High School
in Lansdale, Pa., inflated balloons for the GOP drop. The red,
white and blue balloons used were 9-inch, ''100 percent
biodegradable'' latex.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Democrats issued a statement that in Los Angeles,
``balloons and confetti released at the conclusion of the 2000
Democratic National Convention will be environmentally sound. ...
Latex or rubber balloons will be featured at the close of the
convention. They are 100 percent biodegradable.''
</P>
<P>
   After the hoopla comes cleanup. Sipp said that despite the huge
number of balloons, not many are left to haul away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people like popping them, or they take balloons when
they leave,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is good for Sipp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day after my drop the cast of `The West Wing' TV show is
coming in and taping a scene,'' she said. ``So we have to have it
all cleaned up.''

 &HT;    A sensible Escape
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Despite its rather fanciful name that continues Ford's
penchant for E-word monikers for its sport-utility vehicles (it
follows the Explorer, Expedition and Excursion), the Escape is a
perfectly sensible mini-SUV.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, between its positive attributes and consumer-friendly
base price of $18,160, the 2001 Escape may be the pick of a field
that includes the Chevrolet Tracker/Isuzu Vitara, Honda CR-V,
Nissan Xterra, Suburu Forester and Toyota RAV4.
</P>
<P>
   The test Escape did total $24,295, but it was the line-topping
XLT (base price: $20,820), and Ford loaded it with just about every
option offered except leather interior ($870). It had all the
comforts found in a comparably priced sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the ride, of course. But say this for the Escape: It
had a very acceptable ride. Given tires more in keeping with its
use on paved surfaces instead of the 15-inch Wilderness tires, the
ride would have been a lot smoother and certainly a lot quieter.
</P>
<P>
   The XLT's 200-horsepower V-6 engine is clearly preferable to the
only other available powerplant _ a 130-hp four-cylinder motor _
and the price paid for the 3 to 4 mpg lost is rather negligible
(the EPA figures are 20 and 24 mpg on regular unleaded). Gas prices
have fallen some, but the Escape's figures shame those of its
bigger siblings.
</P>
<P>
   The V-6 makes the Escape a speedy SUV, too _ Mazda credits its
version, the Tribute, with a zero-to-60 mph clocking of under 10
seconds, which is respectable by all but sports-car standards. The
test XLT had no trouble keeping up with traffic on expressways, and
it felt stable with little inclination to wander at those speeds.
Its power anti-lock brakes remained effective in jump-and-stop
traffic with little indication of fade.
</P>
<P>
   The Escape's four-wheel-drive system has a dash-mounted switch
for automatic selection or locking it in all-wheel drive, with the
latter being useful only when there's really bad weather or if _
perish the thought _ someone actually takes an Escape off-road and
finds the going really rough.
</P>
<P>
   In the areas of comfort and interior design, the Escape is
decidedly more carlike. Its five-passenger capacity isn't a
stretch, and there's good leg and head room up front and in the
rear. The 70/30-split rear seat folds flat, and the presence of an
upward-opening rear gate _ the window will open separately _ means
it's relatively easy to load and unload.
</P>
<P>
   Grab handles on the front A pillars assist entry (ground
clearance is 7.8 inches, so the Escape is not a lowrider) and the
optional side step bars ($275) are helpful getting in and out. They
also help the appearance, which, face it, is boxy, like that of
other SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   The white-on-black instrumentation is quite utilitarian _ a
120-mph speedometer, an 8,000-rpm tachometer (with no redline), and
fuel and temperature gauges. But the Escape has enough
idiot/warning lights _ a baker's dozen _ to blind its driver should
they all come on at once.
</P>
<P>
   Several drivers noted, as have other reviewers, that the chief
complaint with the interior and layout of the Escape is the
column-mounted shifter and the hard-to-use wiper controls. Drivers
tend to find the shifter awkward to operate, and it's long enough
to interfere with access to the ignition switch and stereo
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Cabin storage is good with a deep, lidded center console and
real-world drink holders up front and at the bottom rear of the
console. There are no door pockets, but the Escape has nets on the
rear of both front seats, and the cargo area gets a cover and four
tie-down hooks.
</P>
<P>
   From front to back, then, it seems Ford has pretty much nailed
the target with the Escape's accommodations and utility. Plus, it's
not so big or so thirsty that it's going to be much of a target for
the anti-SUV crowd.

THE BUYING OF THE PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Hard Rock Cafe throbs with lobbyists,
strategists, politicians, and one journalist up way past the usual
bedtime. Compliments of corporate sponsors, there is free food,
drink, and a foot-thumping rendition of ``Mustang Sally'' in the
real Big Tent _ the money tent.
</P>
<P>
   Sad to say, that's where the serious business of American
politics gets done, whether the participants are Republicans or
Democrats. Watching just a tiny piece of that all-American
enterprise _ the buying of the president _ leaves the impression
that most everything else that is happening here is just circus.
</P>
<P>
   Circus is Arianna Huffington in a designer pantsuit talking
about poverty. It's a parade of media and political people so
important they chatter incessantly into cell phones as they walk or
mostly cab around the city. It's protesters who post their
whereabouts on Web sites so TV cameras and bicycle-riding police
officers are sure to find them.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, it's also the scene at convention headquarters
each night, where image is packaged as reality, all designed to
sell Texas Governor George W. Bush to American voters. In the
surreal bubble of the Republican National Convention, women are
important, if they come in the right package and send the correct
message, like Bush's foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice.
Diversity is prized if it looks and sounds like Colin Powell and
there is no need to commit to specific policies like affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   Against the backdrop of the omnipresent three-ring circus of
this political convention, reality comes in brief flashes and
snippets of conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone stayed on message,'' chortle delegates from the state
of Washington, congratulating themselves for sticking to a ``This
is not Houston'' theme in interviews with local media. ``I want
government out of my life,'' proclaims a female delegate from
Idaho, on the way back to her hotel on a shuttle bus provided by
the government of Philadelphia. Another female delegate from Maine,
wearing a ``W stands for Women'' sticker, explains that the
sentiment comes from the candidate's positions on education and
health care. Asked about his positions on choice and gun control,
she rolls her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the Hard Rock, where the reality of business
and politics meet in the context of hot music, an open bar, two
governors _ John Rowland of Connecticut and Paul Cellucci of
Massachusetts _ and corporate sponsors like Pfizer Inc. and Bell
Atlantic/Verizon. Getting past the watchdogs at the front door
isn't easy _ former Massachusetts state Treasurer Joe Malone didn't
pass muster _ which makes the party all the more alluring. It's
human nature, after all, to covet most what you can't have, to seek
access where it is denied.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has been written and broadcast this week about the sham of
packaged ``news'' put out by the Republicans. In truth, the
Democrats will try to pull off the same thing on behalf of Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Voters who actually watch either convention will be smart enough
to see it and understand it for what it is, political propaganda.
It is what they can't see that is more insidious and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Observes Scott Harshbarger, the former Massachusetts attorney
general who is now president of Common Cause, ``None of the action
is on the floor. All of the action is in private receptions from
which the public is excluded, with a captive audience paid for by
corporate America.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the credential requirements and security checks, it is
hard enough to get on the convention floor, which, after all, is
nothing but a stage. It is even harder and often impossible to get
to the scene of the real action referenced by Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth does trickle out. The press this week reported on
the Republican Regents, a select group of 137 people and companies
that have each contributed at least $250,000 to the Republican
National Committee for this election.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Philadelphia, they are showered with gifts that come in
leather-trimmed goodie bags. The real perk is the schedule of
private receptions with senators, governors, and House leaders _
access for a price that the average citizen could never afford.
</P>
<P>
   The system makes Bush and Gore more of a means to an end for
private interests than a leader for the masses who are the targets
of their televised propaganda. And the masses are smart enough to
know that, too, which is probably why so few of them are bothering
to watch the circus.

   MASKED MEN AND GRINCHES
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Rick Baker's makeup and animatronics studio is on a
scruffy commercial strip at the foot of the back side of the
Hollywood Hills, but inside it's all fantasy and artifice. A creepy
mock graveyard includes headstones for many of the creatures
created by Baker, a four-time Oscar winner, as well as some members
of his current staff. Upstairs, the entrance to his office is down
a tall, narrow corridor of Gothic arches, at the end of which
stands a huge, hooded wraith. In the office, another Gothic marvel
filled with antiques, skulls and other creepy artifacts, sits
Baker, wearing a T-shirt and denim pants, his salt-and-pepper pony
tail hanging over the back of a wood chair.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the movie business is moving deeper into the
virtual illusions of computer effects, Baker represents an older
school of actors in rubber suits, robotic creatures and layer upon
layer of face-altering makeup. ``I really don't think that
computers are going to do away with the makeup side of my
business,'' he said. ``But the animatronics? Maybe. I don't know. I
do kind of hate to see the rubber monster business disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Baker takes on only one project at a time. At the
moment, he is working on Tim Burton's remake of ``The Planet of the
Apes.'' Tim Roth, who will play one of the chief apes, was
downstairs for a makeup test, and on a nearby table were sculptures
of musclebound apes, looking a lot more ``Conan the Barbarian''
than the apes in the original 1968 Charlton Heston film.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, however, Baker said he had two offers he could not
refuse: to transform Eddie Murphy into a half-dozen characters for
``Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps,'' in theaters now, and to
transform Jim Carrey (and 90 other actors) for a big-screen version
of ``How the Grinch Stole Christmas'' to be released this
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like to do them one at a time, if I can,'' he said.
``I'm real hands-on. I don't like to spread myself too thin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutty Professor 2,'' a sequel to a remake, was a particular
pleasure, he said, because Murphy is so adept at bringing Baker's
creations to life. In the film, Murphy plays several members of the
Klump family, and the various characters had to be designed to look
as if they were related but still had their own distinctive
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all actors do, but Eddie kind of likes being hidden,''
Baker said. ``He liked being someone else. It's fun to watch. What
he does is he lets me do my thing, then he takes a look at the
result in the mirror and decides what kind of voice should come out
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Also grueling was the process of applying makeup to so many
actors for ``Grinch.'' A kind of assembly line, more complicated
than anything he had attempted before, was set up on a Universal
Studios stage. But the skills he learned doing that are likely to
come in handy when he and his crew have to transform dozens of
actors into apes, especially since 20th Century Fox is eager for
the film to be ready for next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, Baker said, he does not design for the camera; he
designs for his own eye. ``I make stuff that looks as good as it
can look,'' he said. ``No matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   REEFER MADNESS
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Blethyn's sense is that public attitudes toward marijuana
and other illegal drugs are just about the same in Britain, where
she lives, as in the United States. But she hopes that not too much
emphasis is placed on the dope-smoking aspects of ``Saving Grace,''
the new comedy in which she stars as a Cornish housewife persuaded
by her gardener to grow and sell pot as a means of saving her
impoverished estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I believe that it's ridiculous that tobacco and
alcohol are legal but marijuana is not,'' Blethyn said while
relaxing before an incongruously raging fire (it was a scorching
day outside) in the air-conditioned lobby of the Four Seasons Hotel
in Los Angeles. ``I don't condone drug use in any way, but perhaps
we ought to think about legalizing it. I mean, what we're doing now
doesn't seem to be working.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, which opens on Friday in New York and some other
cities, is the work of the first-time director Nigel Cole and was
one of the hits at the Sundance Film Festival in January. Blethyn
was drawn to it, she said, by the plight of her character, who
suddenly discovers that her husband has lied to her for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did like it,'' she said. ``The idea: to wake up one morning
and discover that 25 years of your life had been a fiction and to
suddenly be left destitute.''
</P>
<P>
   Blethyn is probably best known for her Oscar-nominated role in
Mike Leigh's ``Secrets and Lies.'' While she tends to do most of
her work in independent films, in Britain and America, she said she
had no aversion to working in a big studio film, if the part was
right.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, she is also awaiting the release of ``Sleeping
Dictionary,'' in which she plays a not altogether sympathetic role
as the wife of Bob Hoskins, marooned in the Sarawak jungles of
Borneo. Her memories of that shoot are vivid, if not altogether
pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fascinating, really,'' she said. ``We had a few snakes
turn up, and iguanas sauntering onto the set. I mean, 7-foot ones.
And there were bugs as big as tennis balls attacking you now and
then.''
</P>
<P>
   She did an imitation of what it was like to try to shoo away a
huge insect screeching toward her head. A few people in the lobby
paused, looked over with mystification and gradually moved on.
</P>
<P>
   JACK WARDEN'S GAME
</P>
<P>
   The voice on the phone was unmistakable, stretching back over
the years, from ``The Verdict'' in 1982, ``Shampoo'' in 1975, all
the way to ``From Here to Eternity'' in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, but this was the first time I ever got to work
with Gene Hackman,'' said Jack Warden, who plays a relatively small
role in ``The Replacements,'' a comedy about the National Football
League. ``We're friends, but I've never acted with him before. It's
an amazing thing, you know. I stand there, and I can't see him
acting. Some of these actors, you stand there and you can see them
acting, but with him, he's just there. He just is. What better
compliment can you pay an actor?''
</P>
<P>
   Hackman plays a football coach hired by the team's owner
(Warden) to recruit a squad of has-been players to take the place
of striking superstars. Keanu Reeves stars as the team's new
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed it, I think, because of the subject,'' Warden said.
``I was a fairly good athlete when I was younger, so I was very
familiar with the game. I haven't seen the finished movie yet, just
some of the rushes. A friend of mine saw some clips, and he said it
looked very funny. What else is he going to say? I guess we'll find
out.''

SANTA FE OPERA'S POWERFUL _ AND CONFUSING _ `VENUS' &HT;    (Photos available from
http://www.santafeopera.org/PressPhotos/PressPhotos.htm.)
 &HT;    By CHARLES WARD
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ When two striking dancers enter as a stallion
and mare, complete with stylized masks and hoof-shaped boots,
audiences at ``Venus and Adonis'' may forget momentarily the
ageless tale of love unfolding in Hans Werner Henze's latest opera.
</P>
<P>
   Yet beneath its layers of innovative form, ancient mythology _
and dramatic murk _ it's a simple story of jealousy and its tragic
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Based in part on a Shakespeare poem, ``Venus and Adonis'' is
receiving its American premiere at Santa Fe Opera. The ``opera in
one act for singers and dancers'' (Henze's description) is the
sixth work of his to be staged by the company. The first was ``King
Stag'' in 1965. However, among important 20th-century opera
composers, the German-born Henze is the least familiar to opera
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the strength of Henze's newest opera is bringing the
veiled wisdom of mythology to fresh life. His powerful music _
dissonant, colorful and propulsive _ contrasts with, and clarifies,
his dense storytelling, which isn't surprising for a work born in
post-World War II Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venus'' presents an opera-within-an-opera, wherein three
modern-dress singers, who are rehearsing a work about Venus and
Adonis, act the myth out in ``real life.'' The Hero-Player (Mars)
discovers the Prima Donna (Venus) falling for the younger Clemente
(Adonis). The Hero-Player kills his rival in a lightning-fast act
of brutality.
</P>
<P>
   In a second opera-within-an-opera, a group of six madrigalists
and six dancers also tell the traditional story of Venus,
Adonis &UR;  &LR; and the jealous Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a third level of complication emerges in Alfred Kirchner's
staging. Much of the time the dance and operatic stories unfold
simultaneously; the dancers, through choreography by Ron Thornhill,
tell the same story being set out in song.
</P>
<P>
   Though theoretically fascinating, after a while the multiple
layers blur. The mind _ and eyes _ begin to swim while darting
between the tales unfolding onstage and the English translations of
the text shown on a tiny screen in front of each seat.
</P>
<P>
   The vocal cast comprises the three principals and the
madrigalists, shepherds in white commedia dell'arte dress. Six
dancers also portray Venus, Adonis and Mars, plus the stallion and
the mare _ and the boar that kills Adonis.
</P>
<P>
   In a further abandonment of traditional opera, Henze composed
the work in 17 movements of three types: Madrigal, Recitative, and
Bolero and Dance-Song.
</P>
<P>
   Henze's music is always powerful, and his orchestration
captivating. The choral writing for the madrigalists is
breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   Some dramatic touches are memorable.
</P>
<P>
   The stallion and mare, appearing with no dramatic justification,
are stunning. When the stallion senses the mare, the dancers
intertwine with an eroticism soon matched by Adonis and Venus.
</P>
<P>
   The boar that kills Adonis bursts through a side wall of the
main set, a large, off-white room with industrial skylight and
exposed pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Performances are consistently strong. Among them: soprano Lauren
Flanigan as the Prima Donna, tenor Christopher Ventris as Clemente
and bass-baritone Stephen West as the Hero-Player. Dancers Sarita
Allen (Venus), Brock vonDrehle Labbenz (Adonis) and Peter Mantia
(Mars) acquit themselves well, as do conductor Richard Bradshaw and
the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, despite such committed work on all sides, the
potential of ``Venus and Adonis'' is not realized. Kirchner's
staging and John Conklin's set muddle rather than clarify. Above
all, the production needs visual spaciousness, where Henze's
fascinating story can unfold freely.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: The most important, make-or-break,
moment-of-truth speech of his life

Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush facing the biggest moment of his short political
career, vowed to speak ``from my heart'' when he accepts the
Republican presidential nomination tonight. He said his message
would be positive and uplifting. Bush did not plan to launch
personal attacks on President Clinton and Al Gore but would lament
the administration's ``failure to get anything done,'' aides said.
The tone, according to communications director Karen Hughes, would
be ``regretful rather than critical.'' Bush isn't known for his
oratorical skills and is sometimes prone to mangle even the
familiar phrases he has used over and over again, but he has run
through his speech many times with the help of the TelePrompTer.
</P>
<P>
   FORD'S CONDITION UPGRADED
</P>
<P>
   Former President Gerald Ford was ``in good spirits and doing
much better,'' and expected to make a full recovery after being
hospitalized a day earlier for a stroke, his doctors said today.
George W. Bush who visited Ford shortly after noon, said Ford gave
him some advice for his acceptance speech tonight: ``He told me to
practice.'' The health problems of the nation's 38th president
dampened the mood at an otherwise jubilant GOP celebration.
</P>
<P>
   AND THEN THERE WERE SIX
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has narrowed his search for a running mate to five
members of Congress and a female governor. The Associated Press
reported that the closely guarded list consists only of: Sens. Evan
Bayh of Indiana, John Edwards of North Carolina, John Kerry of
Massachusetts and Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut; House Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri; and Gov. Jeanne Shaheen of New
Hampshire. Gephardt and Shaheen have said they don't want the job.
The AP said Gore left open the remote possibility that he could
consider a dark horse candidate who has not been publicly
discussed, the source said. He plans to announce his selection
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   MISSION ACCOMPLISHED
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is gaining ground during the convention among the
exact voters he's targeting, surging 18 points ahead of Al Gore
among independents and 6 points ahead among women, according to a
bipartisan poll released today. The two were virtually tied among
both groups at the start of the week in the Voter.com-Battleground
poll. Bush has long held a commanding lead among men, now at 21
points. Bush's advantage includes bigger leads among key groups
Democrats very much need such as white women 65 and older and white
married working moms. In the overall presidential race, Bush leads
Gore 48-34 percent, with Ralph Nader getting 6 percent and Pat
Buchanan getting 2 percent. The poll has an error margin of 3
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ALL LOCKED UP AND NOWHERE TO GO
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of protesters at the convention remained in jail today,
many because they are not cooperating with authorities, police
said. Some took their clothes off or refused to give their names to
authorities. About two dozen were released early this morning. The
demonstrators were arrested in the last three days of protests at
the convention, during sometimes-violent clashes with police and
several demonstrations that blocked traffic, police said. ``We're
not letting our guard down until the gavel sounds tonight,'' Police
Comissioner John Timoney said, referring to the end of the
convention. About 60 people were camped at a park near police
headquarters, where most of the arrested protesters were being
held.
</P>
<P>
   BILLY RAY'S BACK
</P>
<P>
   A tuneful mixture of country, rock and roll and blues describes
the new GOP campaign anthem, to be introduced tonight after George
W. Bush completes his acceptance speech. Aimed at working families
and called ``We the People,'' the song includes lyrics such as ``We
pay the taxes, we pay the bills so they better pay attention on
Capitol Hill.'' The song is a new composition being released by
country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, he of the 'Achy Breaky Heart' fame.
Joining Cyrus in singing the new song will be John Anderson, Waylon
Jennings, Danni Leigh, Montgomery Gentry and Yankee Grey.
</P>
<P>
   PARTY POOPER
</P>
<P>
   As guest of a news organization that wanted to observe him
observing Republicans, Green Party presidential candidate Ralph
Nader is at the convention and has a lot to say about it. ``The
Republican National Convention is a political orgy that has reached
new depths of cravenness,'' he said. As for the kinder, gentler
George W. Bush, Nader wasn't buying it: ``He hasn't yet made his
speech, but it's pretty predictable. It's going to be full of sweet
talk, and not backed by the reality of his own performance in Texas
as governor,'' he said. Nader was however impressed with retired
Army Gen. Colin Powell, but said Sen. John McCain, left him
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   GREENS ROLLING OUT THE GREEN
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader said he plans to spend $500,000 to roll out ads
arguing for his inclusion in fall debates. The ads will air in San
Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Portland, Ore., and possibly
other markets where he's being received well. One group he hopes to
attract is organized labor. While Republican leaders met with
International Brotherhood of Teamsters president James P. Hoffa
earlier this week, Nader said he's also had talks with the
Teamsters and he thinks there's a chance they won't endorse anyone.
That, he said, helps him the most. Nader stands at 8 percent in
some polls nationally despite spending only about $1 million on his
campaign so far.
</P>
<P>
   SAY IT TO MY FACE
</P>
<P>
   Denying a story that appeared in the Washington Times yesterday
saying he's ready to endorse George W. Bush, Minesotta Gov. Jesse
Ventura said that as a third-party activist, he cannot endorse
either the Democratic or Republican nominee. ``I stated clearly,
`No I will not,' `` Ventura said. He added that he will endorse the
candidates' policies when he agrees with them, as he did when he
backed Al Gore's call for increased federal funding for
special-education services. Ventura also fired back at Minnesota
Republican Party chairman Ron Eibensteiner, who introduced
Minnesota's delegates to the Philadelphia convention as being from
``the land of 10,000 lakes and one goofy governor.'' ``I wonder if
he'd be so brave if it was just me and him in a room,'' Ventura
said.
</P>
<P>
   WATTS HE UP TO NOW?
</P>
<P>
   The latest buzz developing at the convention is about a
potential John McCain-J.C.Watts ticket down the road. McCain and
Watts maintained that they are working as hard as they can to elect
George W. Bush president, but the duo did fuel speculation when
they launched a new Web site that enables voters to get into direct
contact with the two lawmakers. Talk2Us2000.com arrived weeks after
McCain and Watts unveiled a plan to tour swing congressional
districts later this month. Meanwhile, the Oklahoma congressman
said he is not interested in becoming HUD secretary in a Bush
administration. Watts said he ``would rather be judged by a
half-million people every other year than by one person every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   NOW THIS IS MORE LIKE IT
</P>
<P>
   For those troubled by the tightly controlled, stubbornly
saccharine convention, there's plenty of nastiness and partisanship
to be found _ it has simply oozed to the outskirts of the
convention after organizers banned slime on to be two things: I
want to be an actor and I want to be a dentist,'' she said, before
quickly adding: ``And I want to be president.''

`HOLLOW MAN' TIMID, UNADVENTUROUS REMAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kevin Bacon was a good casting choice for Hollywood's latest
remake of H.G. Wells' ``The Invisible Man.'' He has a certain
malevolent charisma, but his angular features are not easy to look
at in large doses, and you don't miss not seeing him. Invisibility
suits him.
</P>
<P>
   But this dubious achievement aside, Paul Verhoeven's ``Hollow
Man'' is not much.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't do anything new or interesting with its (familiar)
premise. Its special effects are often captivating but add little
to the story, and it is relatively suspenseless and often
distastefully crude.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a curiously timid and unadventurous movie that doesn't
even try to challenge its audience and seems a particular
disappointment coming from a director whose other failures
(``Showgirls,'' ``Starship Troopers'') have tended to be epic,
outlandish and daring.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon plays a hotshot young research doctor of a top-secret
government project who, as the film opens, long ago found the
secret of turning test animals invisible and _ Eureka! _ has just
made the final breakthrough by discovering the secret of returning
them to the visible world.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of handing over his findings to his government funders,
however, the somewhat arrogant and delusional doctor injects
himself with invisibility serum.
</P>
<P>
   When the return serum fails, he finds himself trapped in the
state, gradually goes insane and turns into _ what else? _ a serial
killer.
</P>
<P>
   William Goldman, who wrote the script for the last major
invisible-man movie _ 1992's ``Memoirs of an Invisible Man'' _ once
said that the big drawback of the premise for today's
special-effects-happy horror filmmakers is that its chief effect is
a lack of anything visible. It has to scare us by ``what we don't
see.''
</P>
<P>
   James Whale's 1933 classic, and still best, version of Wells'
novel employed some clever effects _ clothes on a formless void,
etc. _ to explore the visual incongruities of invisibility, but
it's mostly a film of suspense that relies heavily on the
imagination of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   With the success of last summer's ``The Sixth Sense'' and
``Blair Witch Project'' as evidence of a new willingness on the
part of the visually-jaded horror audience to go along with this
kind of film, Verhoeven might well have turned out a similar
shocker that evoked some genuine chills from the unseen.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he loads the film down with expensive but not very
scary visual effects, makes sure his hero/villain can almost always
be seen by the cast and audience via special goggles (which
essentially negates the premise), hammers home every scene with
Jerry Goldsmith's blaring score and spills more blood than ``Saving
Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   It's every bit as overblown an invisible-man movie as last
summer's ``The Haunting'' (ironically, made by Verhoeven's former
filmmaking partner, Jan de Bont), which was so heavy-handed,
hammily acted and lacking in any subtlety that it's unintentionally
funny, recalling such monstrosities of the genre as ``The Ghost in
the Invisible Bikini.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Verhoeven _ no doubt alarmed by the poor box-office
showing of his last few films _ is clearly out to pander to a
teenage audience. His research scientists all talk and act like
annoying high school sophomores, and as the invisible maniac starts
picking off members of the team one by one, the film turns into a
clumsy take on the ``Scream'' formula.

`SEX AND REAL ESTATE': HOME, HEAVILY SYMBOLIC HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sex and real estate? For many aging baby boomers, the scholar
Marjorie Garber argues in her new book, real estate now occupies
the place in their brains once reserved for sex: They fantasize not
about the perfect mate, but about parquet floors and 12-foot
ceilings, and kitchens with Viking stoves; their favorite
pornography consists of Architectural Digest and House and Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Buying and selling a house, she says, ``is a lot like dating'':
``the same emotional overinvestment; the same daydreaming; the same
quickening of the pulse; the lingering around the phone, willing it
to ring.'' She points out that the vocabulary of real estate ads is
``flirty, seductive, a come-on'' (``Prewar Beauty,'' ``Light &AMP;
Lovely on West End Avenue''), and that buyers use similar language
in contemplating a purchase: they talk about making ``an offer'' _
a proposal _ for a property or wanting ``to see it again.'' Open
houses play the role of mixers for prospective buyers; and sellers,
having had their properties rejected once too often, speak of
getting them ``face-lifts'' or ``makeovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such entertaining asides, Garber's book turns out to
have little to do with sex and real estate. It's really a
hodgepodge of essays _ some better than others _ about houses and
the role that houses play in our cultural imagination. Although the
book retraces much of the ground covered by Witold Rybczynski's
classic 1986 book, ``Home: A Short History of an Idea,'' it does so
with considerably less coherence and charm. It also lacks the
cogency and sociological depth of Garber's 1992 study of
cross-dressing (``Vested Interests: Cross-Dressing and Cultural
Anxiety''), substituting anecdotes and assertions for sustained
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   By far the strongest sections of ``Sex and Real Estate'' are
those that are grounded in detailed social observation and the
familiarity of the author, a professor of English at Harvard
University, with American literature. Garber points out that the
phenomenon of the ``trophy house'' is not something new that
started with the likes of Donald Trump or Bill Gates, but something
as old as the American dream.
</P>
<P>
   She observes that William Dean Howells' novel ``The Rise of
Silas Lapham'' depicts an upwardly mobile Boston businessman whose
plans to build an expensive house have the object of making good
marriages for his daughters. She notes that ``The Great Gatsby''
includes some ``unerringly apt descriptions of vernacular
architecture as the sign and symbol of cultural desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Concurrent with Americans' mania for bigger and better houses,
Garber argues, is a nostalgia for history and the vanished past. In
earlier decades, William Randolph Hearst and Isabella Stewart
Gardner stocked their mansions with expensive treasures imported
from Europe, while the slightly less wealthy settled for living in
Elizabethan-style manors and castlelike mansions. Today the aura of
history is available to just about anybody with access to catalogs
from Pottery Barn or Restoration Hardware, which sell everything
from antique-style hardware to lightly distressed furniture to
folk-art reproductions.
</P>
<P>
   In some communities, Garber writes, a battle has emerged between
individuality and authenticity. In the historical district of
Cambridge, Mass., she reports, homeowners must get a ``certificate
of appropriateness'' for any significant changes to their houses,
and on Nantucket, local hardware stores display placards showing
the half-dozen or so historically correct colors that people are
permitted to paint their homes.
</P>
<P>
   It is in the chapters where Garber strays from the world of
observation into the realm of philosophical speculation that this
book begins to run aground. Her efforts to explore the metaphorical
connection between the notions of ``home'' and ``motherhood'' (i.e.
the house as womb, as a refuge of safety and comfort) feel vague
and pretentious, as do her attempts to explicate the metaphor of
the ``house as body'' or container for the soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``If `the house' is a major internalized image,'' Garber writes
in one particularly labored passage, ``it is a second-order image,
derived from myth, art, folklore, psychology and phenomenology _
and from the concurrent development of what might be called the
consumer unconscious, that is, the strategies of advertisement and
merchandising that accompany or anticipate expansion in real estate
and in the selling of high-end household goods and services.''
</P>
<P>
   These sorts of remarks, representing the worst kind of academic
pontification, do nothing to illuminate Garber's subject. Rather,
they obscure the more interesting and valid points she wants to
make in this lumpy and uneven book.

`THE TIC CODE': EVEN AFFLICTED CHILDREN HAVE TANTRUMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One encouraging element of ``The Tic Code,'' a small, sincere
film with an educational agenda, is its refusal to make its plucky
11-year-old hero, Miles (Christopher George Marquette), a 100
percent adorable movie moppet. A stubborn, hypersensitive youth who
knows how to throw a mean tantrum, Miles insists on playing a
vaguely ghoulish question-and-answer game, ``Which would you
rather,'' with his mother, Laura (Polly Draper), that gives her the
creeps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which would you rather have: no feet or no hands?'' asks the
boy, whose excruciating physical self-consciousness is a result of
his suffering from the nervous ailment known as Tourette's
syndrome. In addition to uncontrollable facial tics and jerky
muscular spasms, Miles sometimes emits strange noises that people
mistake for laughter. At moments of peak stress, he involuntarily
babbles socially inappropriate words. In a challenging role,
Marquette delivers a strong, dry-eyed performance utterly devoid of
shameless heartstring-tugging gestures.
</P>
<P>
   Like most movies that examine specific ailments, this gawky,
occasionally touching film has the feel of a dramatized case
history whose purpose is to educate as much as it is to tell a
story. And like most such movies, ``The Tic Code,'' whose title
refers to a strategy by which Miles fools the class bully into
believing his facial tics are a secret code, is better at educating
than at storytelling. Although the rites of passage Miles endures
on his path toward fuller self-acceptance are believable, they are
an overly contrived chain of events culminating in a melodramatic
cliche.
</P>
<P>
   Miles is unusual in more ways than one. A jazz piano prodigy, he
lives in Lower Manhattan with his divorced, fiercely protective
mother, who works as a tailor to support the two of them. After
school he hangs out at the legendary Village Vanguard, where he
occasionally sits in with seasoned musicians. Miles' father (James
McCaffery) is also a musician and is constantly on the road.
Through overheard telephone conversations, the audience learns that
he is in deep denial about his son's condition, which he believes
to be neurotic rather than neurological. When he finally appears
late in the film, he turns out to be such a monstrous narcissist
that he becomes the movie's designated villain.
</P>
<P>
   At the club Miles develops a protege-mentor relationship with
Tyrone (Gregory Hines), a successful jazz saxophonist who also has
Tourette's (with much less pronounced symptoms) and who shares the
boy's feelings of shame. When Tyrone begins dating Laura, her
verbalized concern with her son's ailment brings out Tyrone's own
buried rage and insecurity. Fiercely proud, he refuses to discuss
the ailment. When she persists, he accuses her of both exploiting
and pitying him. Although Hines imbues Tyrone with a slouching,
hooded-eye cool, his performance seems so detached it remains one
step removed from the character.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tic Code'' is the brainchild of Draper, who wrote the
screenplay and who is married to Michael Wolff, a successful jazz
musician with Tourette's. (Wolff composed the effectively moody
soundtrack.) If her screenplay adheres to well-worn dramatic
formulas, it is a useful and informative guide to an ailment that
is largely misunderstood. (As a sidelight, the movie suggests that
Thelonious Monk's stage eccentricities may have been signs of
undiagnosed Tourette's.)
</P>
<P>
   Draper's taut, self-effacing, extremely quiet performance is the
best thing about the movie. She makes us feel the intense pain and
devotion of a dedicated single mother who has choked her own
desires to see her son through a difficult phase of his life.
Without begging for sympathy, she shows the human cost of her
self-sacrifice. When her romance with Tyrone rekindles her adult
desires, she conveys the quaking insecurity and discomfort of a
woman rediscovering a sexuality she had put aside so long ago she
almost forgot it existed.

 &HT;    BUSH-CLINTON FEUD REACHES A SHAKY TRUCE
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ A rickety political truce emerged Thursday
between two feuding members of one of the world's most exclusive
clubs: presidents of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The verbal brawl between President Clinton and the man he
defeated in 1992, former President Bush, served to enliven an
otherwise tightly scripted and relentlessly upbeat Republican
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   It sputtered to a halt because handlers for both George W. Bush
and Al Gore saw the war of words as a risky detour for the
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was widely viewed as having struck the initial blow at a
Democratic fund-raising event last weekend in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``As near as I can tell,'' the president said, ``the message of
the Bush campaign is: 'How bad can I be? I've been governor of
Texas. My daddy was president. I own a baseball team.' ``
</P>
<P>
   The former president sprang to his son's defense in an interview
Tuesday on NBC-TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what I'm going to do,'' Bush said. ``I'm going
to wait a month. And if he continues that, then I'm going to tell
the nation what I think about him as a person and a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has now recanted. In an appearance with his wife, Barbara,
on ABC-TV, he said in his trademark cryptic style: ``Period.
Future. Now. Anytime. Nothing. Not going to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, restoration politics remained in the picture
Thursday when the Republican nominee pointed with pride at his
parents during his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had various takes on the episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds everybody that Bush thinks the presidency is an
office you can inherit,'' said Democratic National Committee
Chairman Joe Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore camp quietly sent word to the president to drop the
subject lest a continuing exchange rob Gore of his turn in the
political spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The bad blood may have its roots in the hard-fought 1992
campaign, but some recall a sharp escalation at the 1996 Republican
convention, when Bush said in his address to the delegates:
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, as president I worked hard to uphold the dignity and
the honor of the presidency, and I tried, as did my superb staff,
to treat both the White House and the presidency itself with
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It breaks my heart when the White House is demeaned, the
presidency itself diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, Bush operatives have made the theme of
restoring dignity to the Oval Office a prominent one. They say such
criticism is justified because Democrats have made clear that
attacks on Bush will be a major part of their campaign strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the (former) president said is justified because
we're going to be under a relentless attack,'' said Haley Barbour,
a top Bush adviser. ``All they know is slash-and-burn, leaving a
scorched earth.''
</P>
<P>
   But Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, denied that the
Bush-Clinton spat had upset the convention's
outreach-through-civility formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's more important is that the vice president is
such a weak candidate that he's forced to rely upon a constant
barrage of attacks launched by President Clinton,'' he said. ``I
think people see it as inappropriate and it paints a picture of Al
Gore as a weak candidate and a weak leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, Clinton's press secretary, also sought to minimize
the feud in an appearance on ``The Late Show'' with David
Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the president did beat him in 1992. He had to move. He
had to pack, move out. But other than that, they're fine. They get
along very well. I think the president went out and poked a little
fun at George W. Bush, which is not a hard thing to do. His father,
being a father, wanted to defend him and he did,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is no sure thing _ given the large egos, the competing
legacies and the prize at stake _ that the truce will hold up until
Election Day.

`SPACE COWBOYS': VOICES OF EXPERIENCE, ROCKETING TO THE RESCUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Space Cowboys'' begins in 1958, with jaunty western guitar
music on the soundtrack and black-and-white vistas of the big sky
and empty land around Edwards Air Force Base in the California
desert. The first scenes follow the adventures of a group of
reckless young pilots who crash their expensive military plane,
bicker and fight among themselves and lose the chance to be the
first Americans in space to a chimpanzee named Mary Ann and a new
civilian agency called NASA.
</P>
<P>
   There is something odd about the four smooth-faced, jaunty young
men who make up Team Daedalus, as the pilots are known. Their faces
have the clean, generic good looks we've come to associate with the
bygone days of the Eisenhower administration, but their voices have
the rasp of hard experience, as well as an uncanny familiarity,
since they belong to Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, James
Garner and, most recognizably, Clint Eastwood, who also directed
the picture.
</P>
<P>
   The overdubbing of these craggy, worn voices is a kind of
subliminal foreshadowing of the movie's theme, which is that while
youth may be pretty to look at, ripeness is all. After the
black-and-white prologue, the scene shifts to the colorful present,
where the members of Team Daedalus, their voices rejoined to their
aching, wizened bodies, reunite to settle scores with the oily
officer who grounded them (James Cromwell) and haul their tired
carcasses triumphantly into orbit. It seems that a Russian
communications satellite outfitted with an operating system like
the one Frank Corvin (Eastwood) designed for Skylab has run into
trouble, and Frank is the only man alive who knows his way around
such obsolete material.
</P>
<P>
   So Frank rounds up his old comrades, none of whom seem to have
eased into graceful retirement. Tank (Garner) has become a Baptist
minister, Hawk (Jones) gives stomach-turning thrill rides in an old
crop duster, and Jerry (Sutherland) _ the only team member with a
two-syllable name and without a Southwestern twang in his voice _
designs roller coasters and chases women half his age. Frank
himself has devoted his golden years to fooling around in his
garage.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow they endure the razzing of their cocky younger
colleagues, the meddling of their bosses (Cromwell and William
Devane) and the rigors of NASA's physical fitness program _
including a medical examination scene obviously filmed without body
doubles _ and find themselves cleared for takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   By the time their space shuttle pierces the earth's atmosphere,
``Space Cowboys'' has already ascended to surprising heights of
entertainment. The movie's release has been preceded by some
derisive eye-rolling, since it appears to be an unlikely hybrid of
two incompatible genres: the geezer ensemble comedy and the
trouble-in-space action adventure _ ``Grumpy Old Astronauts,'' or
``The Sunshine Boys on the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as Tank, Hawk, Jerry and Frank school their arrogant,
by-the-book young understudies (Loren Dean and Courtney B. Vance)
in the low-key, seat-of-the-pants machismo of an earlier era, so do
the scarred show business veterans who portray them knock some
sense, and some manners, into a youth-besotted film industry. Back
in the late 1950s, when the X-Men were still a gleam in Stan Lee's
eye, Eastwood and Garner, both now in their early 70s, were rival
television gunslingers _ on ``Rawhide'' and ``Maverick,''
respectively _ and they bring to their roles here the easygoing
wisdom and humor of long experience.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Jones and Sutherland, who nearly sneaks off with the
movie in his hip pocket, they seem to be in a contest to see who
can give the most understated performance. Sutherland's reedy
whisper delivers a stream of pickup lines that seem to come from
the October 1958 issue of Playboy his younger self is seen perusing
early in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, nearly 20 years younger than Garner but with a face that
says otherwise, has the most complex role, since Hawk is not only
the hot-headed foil for Frank's glowering stoicism, but also the
film's romantic lead and its tragic figure. A widower, Hawk falls
in love with Sara Holland (Marcia Gay Harden), a NASA engineer who
has sacrificed her own dreams of space flight. Harden, in spite of
a credibly unflattering government-scientist haircut, performs with
her usual intelligence and charm, while Jones gives his deepest,
most controlled performance since ``Blue Skies,'' in which he also
played an Air Force pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Once the mission itself gets under way, ``Space Cowboys''
surrenders a little to convention. There's not a lot of fresh life
to be breathed into the Houston-we-have-a-problem technical
difficulty narrative, but the outer-space scenes have a welcome
grandeur and luster and enough of a feeling of real danger to keep
you interested.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood is ordinarily a rather earthbound director, more
interested in the efficient (and sometimes graceless) conveyance of
story and character than in visual beauty, but here the special
effects, by Industrial Light and Magic, add depth and richness to
the movie without distracting from the greater pleasure of watching
four great actors reclaim their prime.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of his directing career, Eastwood has quietly
advanced a revisionist notion of masculinity, a critique from
within of the brutal individualism that made him famous as an
actor. His films explore the possibility that the best parts of the
old code of manly virtue _ loyalty, good humor, a certain reckless
bravado _ might be retained even as its less attractive features
are abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   This time, without succumbing to bitterness or nostalgia or
overstating the case for one generation's virtues, he and his
cohorts mount a vigorous and funny defense of maturity _ the last
thing you might expect from a summer action picture, and one of the
reasons ``Space Cowboys'' is one of the best entertainments this
season has yet offered.
</P>

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Pleasing doctors with the speed of his recovery
from a small stroke, former President Ford regained his sense of
balance, took a short walk and met with Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas in the hospital Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and a Ford spokesman depicted a strong-willed, almost
stubborn patient who was anxious to leave Hahnemann University
Hospital here, where he was admitted Wednesday morning with
symptoms that included slurred speech, loss of balance and weakness
in the left arm.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 87, first sought treatment at the hospital Tuesday
evening; a sinus problem was diagnosed, and Ford was treated for
it. Hospital officials have rejected the suggestion from
journalists that doctors released him prematurely. Ford's
spokesman, Calvin McDowell, said the Ford family was completely
satisfied with the care given.
</P>
<P>
   ``The events and activities of that evening were totally
controlled by the president,'' said McDowell. Despite being
encouraged to undergo a CT scan on his first trip to the hospital,
``It was the president's decision to go back to the hotel,''
McDowell said. He said it was unclear just when Ford suffered the
stroke. Doctors have said he might have suffered more than one, but
tests uncovered evidence of only a single stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, Ford's condition was upgraded from serious to
fair after he had a restful night and took a 30-to 40-foot walk
down a corridor. He was taking blood-thinning medicine to prevent
the recurrence of a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased with his progress and expect him to have a
full recovery,'' said Dr. Robert J. Schwartzman, the hospital's
chief neurologist. Ford's balance and the use of his left hand were
back to normal, and Ford was expected to recover from
stroke-induced speech slurring soon.
</P>
<P>
   A complete recovery in such situations takes from six weeks to
three months, said Dr. Carole E. Thomas, director of the
neurological intensive care unit. Ford could be released this
weekend or early next week. He was already demanding to look at his
calendar to prepare for upcoming events, McDowell said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the prospects for a full recovery, the stroke left Ford
shaken, his spokesman said. Ford had not had so much as a cold in
3{ years, ``so he was nervous. This was a wake-up call,'' McDowell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, the 38th president, was in town for the convention, over
which he casts something of a patriarchal shadow. His chief of
staff as president was a 34-year-old Dick Cheney, who on Wednesday
evening was nominated for vice president. And McDowell pointed out
that Ford gave the Republican presidential candidate's father a
major career boost, naming George Bush director of the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush spoke to Ford on the phone, as did other
Republican figures, including Henry Kissinger and Brent Scowcroft.
George W. Bush stopped by for a 10-minute visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Ford is doing great,'' the presidential candidate
said at a lunch in downtown Philadelphia. ``He told me to tell
people he can't wait to get out and campaign with me.''

`I'M THE ONE THAT I WANT': BEYOND ASIAN STEREOTYPES, THIS COMIC
SETTLES SCORES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
(Eds: This review contains language that some readers may find
objectionable.) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are moments in the filmed concert of Margaret Cho's
successful and hilarious one-woman show, ``I'm the One That I
Want,'' when her cheeks puff up, her eyes crinkle, her mouth curls
into a wicked little smirk and she swings out at the injustices of
the world like an Asian-American Roseanne.
</P>
<P>
   Like her feisty forerunner in stand-up comedy, Cho, who is
Korean-American and grew up in a bohemian section of San Francisco,
has a hefty stash of volatile personal baggage to unload. Much of
it has to do with body image and the pressure on women (especially
in show business) to be fashion-model slim. Add to that the media
stereotyping of Asians as humble, polite, bowing-and-scraping
servants and you have a full arsenal of accumulated resentments
ripe for comic detonation.
</P>
<P>
   Cho is a superb mimic of body language, and her show is strung
with killingly funny parodies of Asian women as meek, supplicating
flower girls. Cho is anything but meek. She is a lusty,
full-figured 31-year-old dynamo whose outrage is tempered by an
empathetic sweetness. A major figure who runs through her show is
her all-knowing Buddha-like mother, whom she impersonates with a
complicated mixture of love and ridicule that tilts just enough
toward love to make us care about her.
</P>
<P>
   Cho's experiences in mainstream show business are a chilling
lesson in ethnic stereotyping. As she discovered first hand,
ludicrous, patronizing preconceptions about Asians and
Asian-Americans still extend to the heart of America's popular
myth-making machine. The spine of the show, filmed at the Warfield
Theater in San Francisco, is Cho's appalling true story of her
experiences starring in the short-lived ABC sitcom ``All-American
Girl,'' the first mainstream television comedy built around an
Asian-American family.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Cho recalls, she believed that all her dreams had
come true and she had found acceptance for the first time in her
life. But those dreams were quickly dashed. No sooner had she won
the role of a character loosely based on herself than the network
tried to revamp her appearance and her personality. Although much
of Cho's stand-up comedy had involved the affectionate ridicule of
her parents, such jokes became taboo on the show. Insisting she
lose weight, the producers hired a personal trainer and
nutritionist to slim her down quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate result of being forced to lose 30 pounds in two
weeks was having her kidneys collapse. But even more damaging was
the loss of personal identity as she dutifully acceded to her
bosses' market-tested notions of who she should be. At one point,
she says, she became so obsessed with slimming down that all she
could think about when watching ``Jesus Christ Superstar'' was the
effectiveness of cross-carrying as a weight-loss regime. The
crowning humiliation was the network's hiring of a special
consultant to instruct Cho on how to seem ``more Asian.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately Cho's sense of herself was so thoroughly undermined
that she went into a suicidal tailspin and became addicted to
alcohol and drugs. She is even able to make this miserable chapter
of her life funny in a bit in which she parodies two drunks
unsuccessfully trying to have sex.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of sex, Cho is refreshingly, uproariously raunchy.
A self-proclaimed ``fag hag,'' ``trash talker'' and
``hetero-phobe'' who was ``raised by drag queens,'' Cho muses
loudly, profanely and at length on gay and lesbian mating habits,
oral sex and pornography, both gay and straight. (She has
particularly nasty things to say about the men in straight porn,
who she believes are selected for their unattractiveness so they
won't threaten male viewers.) As enamored of gay men as she is, Cho
is hardly intimidated by them and has some tart things to say about
their manners in bars. Discussing the Proustian moments that
transport us back to childhood, her most vivid, she says, isn't the
Christmasy fragrance of evergreens but the scent of men in
pantyhose.
</P>
<P>
   How funny is ``I'm the One That I Want?'' Several times while
watching the movie I laughed until the tears were running down my
face.

SANTE FE OPERA: LOVE, MODERN AND MYTHICAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALLAN KOZINN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ There is a faintly bittersweet atmosphere at
the Santa Fe Opera this summer, the company's 44th season and its
last under the directorship of its founder, John Crosby. Crosby,
74, has asked the company not to make too much of his retirement,
and that wish is largely being honored. When the subject is
mentioned, it is mostly in the context of plans for next season, to
be directed by his successor, Richard Gaddes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few opera companies have been so closely associated with
a single person, and for so long. It is not lost on anyone here
that Crosby's vision has been the primary draw for the 60 percent
of the company's audience that comes from outside New Mexico.
Having built (and rebuilt and revamped) an attractive, acoustically
superb open-air opera house in the mountains here, he has filled
its stage with a careful balance of standard repertory, rarities
and new operas, including nearly 50 world or American premieres.
</P>
<P>
   This summer the company adds Hans Werner Henze's ``Venus and
Adonis'' to the American premiere column of its ledger, where it
joins five of Henze's earlier works. On Wednesday evening the
company gave the second of three performances of the opera. The
last is to be on Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the Shakespearean poem, Henze and his librettist,
Hans-Ulrich Treichel, have expanded the story into an operatic
psychodrama with an exquisitely ornate structure. Dance, operatic
vocal writing and madrigals for a six-voice choir alternate in a
series of 17 short scenes lasting 70 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The opera's design calls to mind the masques of Purcell's time,
although Henze's variegated score inhabits a different musical
universe, with its dense layering, dreamlike textures and stretches
of both gritty dissonance and touching lyricism.
</P>
<P>
   The work is set in several worlds. One describes a mythological
triangle, evoked by dancers: Mars lusts after Venus, who rejects
him in favor of Adonis. Adonis is too self-absorbed and
free-spirited to notice, but when he finally responds, after
encountering mating horses that awaken his own sexuality, he is
killed by a wild boar.
</P>
<P>
   A parallel story, evoked in vocal music, shows three singers,
Prima Donna, the Hero-Player and Clemente, rehearsing an opera
about Venus, Mars and Adonis. The attractions and tensions between
the mythological characters are mirrored in the singers'
relationships, and at the moment the boar kills Adonis, the
Hero-Player stabs Clemente. The libretto, in German, sometimes
conveys the singers' thoughts and sometimes those of Venus, Mars
and Adonis; emotionally, they are identical.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is equal to the work's complexities. Stephen West's
solid bass-baritone drips with the Hero-Player's (and Mars')
bitterness and frustration, just as Christopher Ventris' tenor
evokes Clemente's (and Adonis') innocence. Both sing Henze's
angular lines with an Expressionistic edge. Lauren Flanigan, as
Prima Donna (and Venus), moves beyond that angularity, sometimes
giving her music a Straussian gloss that suggests her characters'
seductiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The principal dancers _ Peter Mantia as a mechanical, posing
Mars; Brock vonDrehlecq no space here Labrenz as a fluid,
naturalistic Adonis; and Sarita Allen as a limber, predatory Venus
_ executed Ron Thornhill's choreography with corresponding
vividness.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Kirchner's production is set in a spare, whitewashed
rehearsal-room set by John Conklin, with eye-catching if slightly
motley costumes by David C. Woolard. Richard Bradshaw conducted an
energetic reading of Henze's complex score.
</P>
<P>
   The friction between sexuality and innocence is also at the
heart of Verdi's ``Rigoletto,'' which the company is offering in a
new production by Mikael Melbye, a young Danish baritone who has
taken up directing. Melbye's Mantua is clean, uncluttered and
traditional, but what enlivened the performance on Monday evening
was the degree to which Melbye had persuaded his singers to step
beyond familiar characterizations.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Josephson's Rigoletto, for example, was less twisted and
mean-spirited than most, and as a result his anguish was more
sharply defined. In the scene in which he harassed the unfortunate
Monterone, this Rigoletto knew immediately that he had gone too
far. He was pierced by Monterone's curse the second it was uttered.

HOME VIDEO NOTES AND NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER M. NICHOLS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Visitors to Blockbuster stores on Sept. 1 may be startled to
notice kiosks displaying DirecTV, which beams movies by satellite.
Why would the country's largest provider of videocassettes open the
door to a competing type of movie delivery? Several types, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Late this year or early next, Blockbuster plans to dispense
movies via TiVo, a digital service in California that can serve up
films in the home through a device placed on television sets. Last
month, Blockbuster announced a deal with Enron, a Houston company,
to supply movies on a video-on-demand basis over fiber optic lines
and high-speed digital subscriber lines, or DSL's.
</P>
<P>
   Moves like these could obviously be stirred into doomsday
scenarios for the video store, which some analysts say will go the
way of the dodo once people can get the movies they want with a
click. John Antioco, Blockbuster's chairman, predicts no such
disappearance for stores but said he did see a time eventually when
customers could receive ``the full Blockbuster experience basically
online without having to leave their home.''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, he said, stores will act as supplying agents, so
to speak, for a mix of services in a vastly broadened video scene
that will include traditional rental and sale of cassettes and
especially DVD's (already approaching 10 percent of the video
market), pay-per-view via satellite and digital cable, and video on
demand from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   TiVo and Enron are carriers. Blockbuster supplies content. It is
not yet clear how extensive the new service will be. Antioco refers
to ``Blockbuster on demand.'' And what is ``video on demand,''
beyond vague jargon? ``One minute you want to watch a movie and 15
seconds later you can be,'' Antioco said. Stores can't satisfy
that, of course, nor can anyone else. Blockbuster's initial DSL
inventory will be about 200 films, he said. Later, greater
broadband and Internet access will speed things considerably.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, stores needn't be shut out. Blockbuster outlets,
he said, will be selling products like DirecTV, high-speed DSL
connections and video-on-demand services connected to the Web. Much
of that can be ordered from home, of course, but it seems you'll
still be able to leave the house.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever new technology takes hold, studio accountants can't
fault the videocassette. In its weekly list of 40 best renters,
Video Business magazine compares movies' video revenue to their
theater box-office take. For big theater titles like ``The Green
Mile'' or ``American Beauty,'' the box office outstrips video
rental, but when it comes to smaller films, especially those with
some critical acclaim that may have been missed during their
theater runs, the cassette takes over.
</P>
<P>
   For example, after 10 weeks in stores, ``Boys Don't Cry'' had
taken in $17.5 million in rentals versus $3.7 million in theaters.
After 11 weeks, ``Mystery, Alaska,'' a worthy sleeper, has taken in
$9 million in theaters but almost $20 million on tape. And ``Girl,
Interrupted'' took seven weeks on video to pass its theater run,
$30 million to $29 million.

from her guru. Back home Ruth is turned over to a tough ``cult
exiter'' named P.J. Waters (Harvey Keitel), but gradually he is
overmatched. Though it has sensual allure, Jane Campion's film
isn't helped by a screenplay that, Janet Maslin wrote in The New
York Times, ``threatens to become heavy-handedly ideological
beneath its outward whimsy.''

   In Michigan in the dead of slate-gray winter a dimple-chinned
convict named Rudy (Ben Affleck) gets out of prison and goes home
to romance Ashley (Charlize Theron), with whom a recently deceased
prisoner has been corresponding. Ashley has never seen her pen pal
or his picture, so Rudy slides by on that front, but he has trouble
when Ashley's lowlife brother (Gary Sinise) wants to use his
expertise to rob a casino on an Indian reservation. John
Frankenheimer's film reflects his bent for swift, scary violence,
but at the end ``a needlessly complicated mechanism is a blow to
the breakneck wiliness that has come before'' (Elvis Mitchell).

gay artisan named Leo (Kevin McKidd) has an affair with Brendan
(James Purefoy). But then there is Sally (Jennifer Ehle), Leo's
high school sweetheart, who is breaking up with Brendan. Does Leo
tell her he's sleeping with her former boyfriend? Having begun to
explore the ins and outs of bisexuality, the film then ``loses its
nerve and turns into a shallow sitcom in which everyone is abruptly
and mechanically paired off'' (Stephen Holden).

question, their mother, Lucrecia (Cayetana Guillen Cuervo), who was
unfaithful to Don Rodrigo's son when he was alive and now profits
from a liaison with a government minister, uses her influence to
throw the old man off the track. Part paean to the genuine riches
of life, Jose Luis Garcia's film ``brims with understandings of the

   ROSETTA. Tired of being poor, a desperate 17-year-old Belgian
girl (Emilie Dequenne) is determined to land work at any cost.
Foraging for her existence, she scratches for sustenance and covets
a friend's position as a cook at a waffle stand, to the extent that
she hesitates to rescue him when he falls into a river. Luc and
Jean-Pierre Dardenne's stoically drab film won the top prize at
last year's Cannes Film Festival, with Dequenne named best actress,
and the Darwinian struggle to survive makes a great subject. But

News Service will file the following stories and photos tonight in
the ``p'' news file. For repeats or information, call 888-346-9867

<P>
   GOP-RDP-NYT (Philadelphia) _ A convention roundup: Republicans
open the final day of their national convention, preparing to make
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas their presidential nominee and
relishing the fight that he has already started with Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   (EDS: An early, 950-word version of the roundup has moved and
will be updated with a longer version from Philadelphia written by
R.W. Apple Jr., with quotes from late speeches; complete text of
Bush's speech will be available at the New York Times on the Web:
www.nytimes.com)
</P>
<P>

<P>
   GOP-BUSH-SPEECH-NYT _ On the speech Gov. George W. Bush is
scheduled to deliver Thursday evening. The speech, which has been
ready for two months, and how it was prepared offer a window into
the discipline and strategy of the candidate and his campaign. By
Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   With photos, CVN1,2.

Gerson, an aide to Mayor Stephen Goldsmith of Indianapolis, Bush's
domestic affairs adviser.

   GOP-ASSESS-NYT _ A news analysis on what the GOP has
accomplished and what lies ahead for them _ and for the Democrats.
By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   GOP-ECON-ASSESS-NYT _ What Gov. George W. Bush is trying to do
with Republican economic orthodoxy resembles in many ways what
President Clinton has tried to do for Democrats. By stressing the
elimination of the federal budget deficit and the national debt,
Clinton sought to soften the perception that Democrats are the
party of profligacy and high taxes. In the same way, Bush is
looking to counter the idea that Republicans stand for sweeping tax
cuts are fiscally reckless and a boon only to the country club set.
By Richard W. Stevenson. 1,00 words.

   GOP-CHENEY-NYT _ Speaking with the running mate. By Eric
Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   GOP-BUSH-FAMILY-NYT _ The hottest convention in town is perhaps
not the obvious one made up of 15,000 journalists and an occasional
Republican, but rather a more private one unfolding away from the
television lights, one to which admission is based not on politics
but on blood and marriage. ``It is a family reunion,'' Laura Bush
explained recently. By Nicholas D. Kristof. 1,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   GOP-FORD-NYT _ Pleasing doctors with the speed of his recovery
from a small stroke, former President Gerald Ford regained his
sense of balance, took a short walk and met with Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas in the hospital. By B. Drummond Ayres Jr. 600 words.

November. By Zachary Coile.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much less humid air will spread from the eastern Great Lakes to
the interior Northeast in the wake of a cold front. Meanwhile, high
humidity will linger near the southern New England and Middle
Atlantic Coast Friday morning as the front moves slowly east.
Scattered thunderstorms will develop in the sultry air near the
front from southern New Jersey to the Carolinas at midday and in
the afternoon. By Saturday, dry air will cover a large area from
the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley to the Northeast coast.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Southeast will have limited sun with scattered
thunderstorms. A cluster of strong thunderstorms will plague the
Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians as a jet stream
disturbance passes overhead.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, very warm weather will persist. Thundershowers will
be common over many peaks in the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: FIRST SUNSET
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday at 1:16 a.m., the sun dipped below the horizon for
36 minutes at Barrow, Alaska. It was the first sunset since May 10
at the nation's northernmost weather station. Daylight will dwindle
at Barrow until, beginning on Nov. 18, two months of total darkness
will mark the depths of arctic winter. During the next few months,
the deepening chill in the north will gradually increase the
temperature contrast between pole and equator. The storms which
derive energy from these contrasts will eventually strengthen
enough to draw cold, polar air south for the winter.

`COYOTE' BLENDS LIKABLE LEAD, SWEET STORY INTO CROWD-PLEASER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ad campaign for ``Coyote Ugly'' makes it out to be the
cheesecake movie of the summer: what looks like an explosively
salacious remake of ``Cocktail'' with five flashy, hip-swinging,
supermodel bartenders instead of one Tom Cruise.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the film is more a remake of ``Flashdance,'' a
rather likable and very sweet-spirited story about young love in
the big city and one naive but determined young woman trying to
make her dream happen against all odds.
</P>
<P>
   That woman is Violet (Piper Perabo), an aspiring but painfully
shy young songwriter who, as the film opens, has quit her longtime
job in a New Jersey greasy spoon and _ against the wishes of her
father (John Goodman) _ is leaving home to try to make it in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Everything goes wrong, of course, but she soon finds a
sympathetic boyfriend (Adam Garcia) and a job as a bartender in a
popular watering hole called Coyote Ugly, where the bartenders are
women and the crowds of men behave like sailors on liberty in
Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The movie becomes a question of whether she will be able to fit
in this raucous environment, whether her father and boyfriend will
approve of her working there and whether the public exposure will
help her overcome her crippling stage fright.
</P>
<P>
   As these questions are answered, there are few surprises, but
the movie is still a genuine crowd-pleaser and works mostly off the
casting of Perabo, who stole what there was to steal in ``The
Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'' earlier this summer and has
the kind of looks, presence and self-deprecating sense of comedy
that could make a career.
</P>
<P>
   She also works especially well off other actors, so her scenes
with the equally ingratiating Garcia make a surprisingly winning
love story, her scenes with Maria Bello (as her boss) sparkle with
charm and her scenes with Goodman are so warm and enjoyable they
could probably be re-worked into the pilot for a successful
TV-sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coyote Ugly'' is clearly no masterpiece and suffers from the
usual heavy hand of super-producer Jerry Bruckheimer (``Con Air,''
``Top Gun''). But coming as it does in the midst of a summer in
which every new movie seems to be outdoing the last in the depth of
its scatology and low comedy, it's a small breath of fresh air.

`JERUSALEM SYNDROME': WHEN LIFE IS RIDICULOUS AND YOU ARE LIVING
IT 
</HEADLINE>
   By D.J.R. BRUCKNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is plenty of laughter in Marc Maron's
``Jerusalem Syndrome,'' but this unusual theatrical concoction by
one of the leading practitioners of alternative comedy in New York
City is not a joke. Ambiguity is expected of Maron: One reason he
and a few like-minded comics adopted the label alternative in the
mid-1990s was to signal audiences that they were not quick-laugh
artists like most stand-up comics. Maron in particular has often
explored fairly sophisticated ideas in sizzling exchanges with his
audience. ``Jerusalem Syndrome'' takes his approach into very
different territory.
</P>
<P>
   He performed an early version of this work last year at P.S. 122
as part of a citywide comedy festival. It involved stringing
together several riffs he had first tried in comedy clubs into a
unified story. He and his director, Kirsten Ames, have continued
working on it, and the Off Broadway production by the Westbeth
Theater Center is clearly meant to invite recognition of it as a
new form of alternative theater. Whether as comfort to him or as
reassurance to his fans, Westbeth has kept a hint of the club
setting, with viewers drinking at crowded tables and
brain-shattering music preceding the show. But this show is a long
way from the stand-up clubs and even from Maron's favorite haunt,
the Luna Lounge.
</P>
<P>
   The title is a name given by psychiatrists to a delusion of some
visitors to the Holy Land that they are biblical prophets or divine
emissaries. On the face of it, the thought of God acting through
Maron _ who for years has trumpeted a respect for religion that is
decidedly inferior to his knowledge of it, which is nil _ is funny
enough to get a laugh without being mentioned. The show's theme,
the spiritual journey of a radical materialist, is a good framework
for Maron's fanciful recollection of his life, beginning with a
college flirtation with a beatnik cult.
</P>
<P>
   His examination of the Beat phenomenon as religion, with sacred
texts, established rituals and even pilgrimages (``any car ride
with music and no destination'') is not only good comedy but also
astute criticism, and a poem about visiting Jack Kerouac's grave is
excellent parody. If cocaine addiction in Hollywood seems a detour
on his journey, he does get a real spiritual insight from it:
``When you hear voices, it is never one, but many, and you spend a
lot of time getting them to pick a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   The high point of his quest is a visit to a cigarette factory.
Maron's reflection on brand loyalty as a commitment of faith leads
to a hilarious litany of corporate emblems enshrined in the modern
pantheon of stuff. But real revelation comes in the tobacco works,
where workers all along the assembly line smoke the product of
their craft, as does Maron onstage throughout this show. In most
religions heaven is an eternal life of fulfillment of people's
deepest desires, and to Maron the factory is paradisiacal: ``This
is what socialism should have been!''
</P>
<P>
   But the search disintegrates in Israel, in part because his
conceit of merging with a camcorder is awkwardly intrusive, but in
part by design. His vision of ending a hopeless peace process and
inviting the Disney Co. to turn Jerusalem into the peaceful heart
of a heavenly kingdom is vintage Maron. But his confrontations with
extremely religious Jews at the Western Wall is a jolt. He says he
grew up in a Jewish family in which religion was almost never
mentioned, and through his life it never touched him. In Israel it
cannot be avoided, and he seems nervous about that. He does not
express distaste for the practices of some of the people he mimics
at prayer; he says, ``I don't like them.'' Every glance and gesture
telegraph his discomfort and suggest he is talking about a part of
himself he does not want to recognize.
</P>
<P>
   In club acts this man was the specialist in alienation; his
ferocious assaults on assertive audience members, driven by a
formidable intellect, can spread waves of discomfort all around
him. Suddenly he is the alien, facing himself as an alien. He is
clever enough to make this hapless self-awareness amusing, but
under it is a murmur of sadness that makes the audience restless.
Throughout the performance there is a slightly unnerving suggestion
that he would like some understanding, and in the last segment that
he could use some warmth. A warm hug was never his metier unless he
had a stiletto up his sleeve, and this new persona is a bit
alarming.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if in his search for a new form he has returned to the
old Italian idea of commedia, as Dante used it or as Pirandello
did: Life is ridiculous, but not always to those living it. If
``Jerusalem Syndrome'' falters as theater, it is because Maron has
not created a clearly defined character for him to inhabit and be
transformed by. Audiences as well as actors are brought to life by
roles, which they cooperate in endowing with a soul. If he can ever
step outside himself far enough to invent such a role, or if he can
find a collaborator who can write one, he and his audience will
find out at once if he is an actor. Here he has taken a step that
makes me hope he will take the leap.
</P>

   PHILADELPHIA _ The Hard Rock Cafe throbs with lobbyists,
strategists, politicians, and one journalist up way past the usual
bedtime. Compliments of corporate sponsors, there is free food,
drink, and a foot-thumping rendition of ``Mustang Sally'' in the
real Big Tent _ the money tent.
</P>
<P>
   Sad to say, that's where the serious business of American
politics gets done, whether the participants are Republicans or
Democrats. Watching just a tiny piece of that all-American
enterprise _ the buying of the president _ leaves the impression
that most everything else that is happening here is just circus.
</P>
<P>
   Circus is Arianna Huffington in a designer pantsuit talking
about poverty. It's a parade of media and political people so
important they chatter incessantly into cell phones as they walk or
mostly cab around the city. It's protesters who post their
whereabouts on Web sites so TV cameras and bicycle-riding police
officers are sure to find them.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, it's also the scene at convention headquarters
each night, where image is packaged as reality, all designed to
sell Texas Governor George W. Bush to American voters. In the
surreal bubble of the Republican National Convention, women are
important, if they come in the right package and send the correct
message, like Bush's foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice.
Diversity is prized if it looks and sounds like Colin Powell and
there is no need to commit to specific policies like affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   Against the backdrop of the omnipresent three-ring circus of
this political convention, reality comes in brief flashes and
snippets of conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone stayed on message,'' chortle delegates from the state
of Washington, congratulating themselves for sticking to a ``This
is not Houston'' theme in interviews with local media. ``I want
government out of my life,'' proclaims a female delegate from
Idaho, on the way back to her hotel on a shuttle bus provided by
the government of Philadelphia. Another female delegate from Maine,
wearing a ``W stands for Women'' sticker, explains that the
sentiment comes from the candidate's positions on education and
health care. Asked about his positions on choice and gun control,
she rolls her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the Hard Rock, where the reality of business
and politics meet in the context of hot music, an open bar, two
governors _ John Rowland of Connecticut and Paul Cellucci of
Massachusetts _ and corporate sponsors like Pfizer Inc. and Bell
Atlantic/Verizon. Getting past the watchdogs at the front door
isn't easy _ former Massachusetts state Treasurer Joe Malone didn't
pass muster _ which makes the party all the more alluring. It's
human nature, after all, to covet most what you can't have, to seek
access where it is denied.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has been written and broadcast this week about the sham of
packaged ``news'' put out by the Republicans. In truth, the
Democrats will try to pull off the same thing on behalf of Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Voters who actually watch either convention will be smart enough
to see it and understand it for what it is, political propaganda.
It is what they can't see that is more insidious and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Observes Scott Harshbarger, the former Massachusetts attorney
general who is now president of Common Cause, ``None of the action
is on the floor. All of the action is in private receptions from
which the public is excluded, with a captive audience paid for by
corporate America.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the credential requirements and security checks, it is
hard enough to get on the convention floor, which, after all, is
nothing but a stage. It is even harder and often impossible to get
to the scene of the real action referenced by Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth does trickle out. The press this week reported on
the Republican Regents, a select group of 137 people and companies
that have each contributed at least $250,000 to the Republican
National Committee for this election.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Philadelphia, they are showered with gifts that come in
leather-trimmed goodie bags. The real perk is the schedule of
private receptions with senators, governors, and House leaders _
access for a price that the average citizen could never afford.
</P>
<P>
   The system makes Bush and Gore more of a means to an end for
private interests than a leader for the masses who are the targets
of their televised propaganda. And the masses are smart enough to
know that, too, which is probably why so few of them are bothering
to watch the circus.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop: the Big Top in L.A.

POLISHED ARISTOCRATS, PROW TO STERN 
</HEADLINE>
   By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American romance with sports champions may have started in
the 1920s. ``In golf there was Bobby Jones, tennis had Bill Tilden,
in boxing there was Jack Dempsey, horse racing had the great Man o'
War, the Yankees had Ruth and Gehrig, and speedboat racing had Gar
Wood,'' writes Anthony S. Mollica Jr. in ``Gar Wood Boats: Classics
of a Golden Era'' (MBI Publishing, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Garfield Arthur Wood, creator of the handsome Gar Wood mahogany
runabout, was known as America's Speed King because he dominated
speedboat racing for decades. ``He influenced the whole direction
of motor boating,'' Mollica said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gar Wood was an inventor and a very successful
industrialist, but his passion was racing. He designed and built
his boats in his own shop, and after beating his compatriots for
several years running he successfully competed abroad. He branched
out and manufactured hand-crafted runabouts, knockabouts, launches,
commuter yachts and cruisers. Today, these antique Gar Woods are
cherished and proudly paraded around the Thousand Islands and Lake
George in New York, Harbor Springs, Mich., and Mount Dora, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Gar Wood's insistence on uncompromising quality,
superior design and outstanding performance that attracts the
classic boat collectors around the world,'' said Mollica, who took
care of his family's Gar Wood on Oneida Lake in New York, beginning
at age 13. ``The firm maintained its standards even in the worst of
times, in the Depression.''
</P>
<P>
   Gar Woods, known as ``the aristocrats of motorboats,'' were
costly. Their buyers included Gordon Hammersley, a New York tobacco
mogul who was the first to name his boat a ``cigarette''; William
Wrigley, John Dodge, William Randolph Hearst and Lord Louis
Mountbatten. Gar Woods will be on parade during Wooden Boat Week in
Tahoe City, Calif., from Thursday through Aug. 17. The Tahoe Yacht
Club, which was founded in 1925, is sponsoring the 28th Concours
d'Elegance, a show of hundreds of antique wooden boats. There will
be boat restoration clinics, boat sales, dinner dances and picnics.
Information: (530) 583-0447.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1880, Garfield Arthur Wood was the third of eight sons
of a ferryboat captain and staunch Iowa Republican. He was named
after a successful Republican presidential ticket, James Garfield
and Chester Arthur. One of 13 children, Wood grew up around boats
and was piloting an early gas engine launch in Duluth, Minn.,
before he was 20.
</P>
<P>
   In 1910, after graduating from the Armour College of Technology
in Chicago, Wood founded his own machine shop in Duluth. In 1911 he
invented the hydraulic lift, automating the dumping of loose
materials from trucks. He received a patent on the system, built a
factory in Detroit and began supplying the lifts to the trucking
industry.
</P>
<P>
   When World War I came, the War Department ordered trucks with
his hoists. He also designed and built furnaces, tank bodies for
trucks, bulldozers, cranes and tractor attachments. Totally
self-made, he amassed $50 million before 1940.
</P>
<P>
   His first love, however, was speedboat racing. In 1914 he
designed Little Leading Lady, a boat that was hauled by horses on a
wooden trailer, and he won every race he entered it in. In 1916 he
bought a majority share in a boatyard in Algonac, Mich., north of
Detroit, owned by Chris Smith, who in 1922 founded Chris Craft
boats. Until 1922, Wood and Smith together built a series of
streamlined and nearly unbeatable boats, which Wood personally
piloted, beginning with the 1917 Gold Cup in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   But style and competitiveness cannot explain all of Wood's
successes. Wood, who went to bed by 10:30 p.m. and rose at 5:30
a.m., was an inveterate inventor. He decided to try airplane motors
in boats. In 1918, he launched the first hydroplane successfully
equipped with an aircraft engine and drove it to win the Thousand
Islands Trophy and the 1918 Gold Cup. After the war, he purchased
4,500 government surplus Liberty aircraft engines and established
the Detroit-Marine-Aero Engine Co. to convert the lightweight
engines to marine use.
</P>
<P>
   By 1920, Wood had piloted the Liberty-powered Miss America to
victory at the World's Speedboat Championship in Cowes on the Isle
of Wight, the One-Mile North American Championship, his fifth
consecutive Gold Cup and the Express Cruiser Championships in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   He then challenged the Havana Special, the Miami-to-New York
express train, to a race, and won the 1,260-mile trip in 47 hours
and 23 minutes, beating the train by 21 minutes. The press ate it
up.
</P>
<P>
   In 1925, he took on the 20th Century Limited in a race from
Albany to New York City. ``Tens of thousands, perhaps even
millions, who were unable to reach the river were kept in touch
with the progress of the train and the boat by radio,'' Mollica
writes. ``Half a dozen airplanes accompanied the boat, one of them
broadcasting a minute-to-minute account.'' Again he won. He was a
national hero.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, Wood produced longer wooden boats for cruising,
exploring and sport fishing. ``One long, narrow, 70-foot prototype
had five Liberty engines in it,'' Mollica said. ``This was the
precursor of the PT boat.''
</P>
<P>
   In World War II the Gar Wood plants converted to military
production and churned out Navy boats by the hundreds. After the
war, Wood retired; the company closed in 1947. He died in 1970 at
age 90. He had built 3,300 Gar Woods between 1922 and 1947.
</P>
<P>
   James W. Ogilvie-Knowles and Justus Hayes, authors of ``Wood
Through Water: Classic Power Boats'' (Michael Friedman Publishing,
1999), write that there are two kinds of antique wooden-boat owners
today: the generation that grew up with them, for whom maintaining
and operating them is a labor of love, and the younger school, for
whom the woody represents a return to a simpler, more genuine way
of life.
</P>
<P>
   Gar Woods attract both. Not that they are easy to buy. Only
about 500 survive. The Gar Wood Society web site (www.garwood.com)
lists five for sale. There are none from the 1920s, three from the
1930s and two from the 1940s. Each costs $18,000 to $45,000.
``These prices are modest compared to what you will see in Tahoe,''
Mollica said. ``A 28-foot Gar Wood is now $100,000. The 33-footers
are $150,000 to $200,00 _ and you have to beg the owners to sell
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Demand has increased strikingly. ``Gar Wood design and overall
styling are recognized as the best of their day,'' Mollica said.
``Their materials, ride and performance are superior to all the
boats of their era and equal to or better than many modern craft.
They used real leather in every model as well as furniture-quality
mahogany from Honduras.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tahoe, there is a perfect view of the festivities from a
restaurant in Carnelian Bay on Lake Tahoe. Its name? Gar Woods:
Home of the Wet Woody.

FINALLY, REALITY BREAKS THROUGH &HT;    By MARIANNE MEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Everyone knew it wouldn't _ couldn't, shouldn't _
last. All that gooey sweetness just wasn't real.
</P>
<P>
   A presidential campaign is meant to be a brutal scrap, not a tea
dance. It's supposed to be about the conflict between deeply held
convictions, not a competition for the best superficial smile.
</P>
<P>
   For the first two days of the Republican National Convention,
party leaders were obsessed with the notion that honey attracts
more flies, or independent voters, than vinegar. But the salad
dressing of power politics benefits from a dash of tart sauce. It's
the American way.
</P>
<P>
   Mama and papa Bush promptly shook off the sugar fix, rising to
provocative bait thrown out by President Clinton and eager to
defend their son against a perceived slur. Actually, all Clinton
did was to say that Texas Gov. George W. Bush's presidential
campaign is just a ``pretty package '' based heavily on the fact
that ``daddy was president.'' A rather modest insult, as insults go
these days, and not all that far from the truth. But the
oversensitive senior Bushes took umbrage at the suggestion that
their boy wasn't a bigtime politician in his own right.
</P>
<P>
   The former Republican president grumped that Clinton was unfair
in that attack and said that ``if he continues that, I'm going to
tell the nation what I think about him as a human being and a
person.'' Actually, the nation already has a good idea of what Bush
thinks of Clinton. He is known to be resentful toward the man who
defeated him in 1992, but never mind. Few losers like their
vanquishers. That's politics.
</P>
<P>
   His wife Barbara, famous for her tart tongue, added her own sour
note by observing that she was ``disappointed'' that the incumbent
she didn't name didn't ``respect'' the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Daddy Bush said later he ``made a mistake''' in letting Clinton
get his goat, acknowledging _ surprise! _ that the race is not a
repeat of his contest with Clinton but a battle between Dubya and
Gore. Yet his son has spent more pre-convention time indirectly but
unmistakably accusing Clinton of lacking honor and integrity than
pointing out his policy differences with Gore, which are many and
are supposed to be what the campaign is all about.
</P>
<P>
   After he selected former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney as his
running mate, Dubya praised Cheney as knowing ``what the meaning of
is, is,'' a clear reference to one of Clinton's most famous
legalistic dodges in denying under oath his dalliance with Monica
Lewinsky. Bush even admitted that the jab was aimed right at
Clinton and wasn't just another one of those generalized laments
about declining moral standards in the White House that are so
popular at his convention. This rare burst of candor, however, came
in the face of the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with honeyed tones is that they can turn anything
into glop. There was Elizabeth Dole, for instance, telling
convention delegates that Bush will end ``the smashmouth politics
of recent years.'' Such sneak attacks on Clinton's combativeness
are not very satisfying. They are too inclusive, to use a favorite
convention word. Whose smashmouth politics, please? We are tempted
to think of a long list here, including those of many Republicans,
including the Bush operatives who ran mean and misleading
commercials during the New York primary that nastily, and
inaccurately, called Sen. John McCain heartless toward breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The convention delegates, however, love all the cute comments
about bringing decency back to the presidency. They go wild when
that happens. They know what it's all about. They came here to be
entertained, not uplifted. The Republicans have been dying to kick
out Clinton for more than seven years, even trying to get around
the election returns with an unpopular crusade to impeach him. To
that end, they will put up with a little subtlety if Bush insists,
but not for long.
</P>
<P>
   They'd like it even better if the Bush team simply came right
out and uttered the words ``Monica'' or ``impeachment.'' What fun.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the convention hall, out in the country where the
voters are, the strange idea is taking hold that Gore is the
opponent, not Clinton. After the Democrats make Gore's nomination
official, the truth of the matter will become inescapable. And
whatever his political failings, Gore is no Clinton. His personal
rectitude, like his intelligence, is not in doubt. Bush's chief
strategist, Karl Rove, asked his goal for Bush in the coming formal
debates with the more experienced Gore, snapped: ``survive.'''
</P>
<P>
   To get around Gore's seriousness, the Republicans are determined
to bind the vice president to the president with industrial-grade
duct tape. The message is that the two are twinned forever.
``Somehow we will never see one without thinking of the other,''
Cheney said in a forceful acceptance speech Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He skipped the treacle and gave the crowd the tough talk it
wanted. He may be an indifferent campaigner, but he can sure rise
to the occasion. ``We are all a little weary of the Clinton-Gore
routine,'' he thundered. ``It is time for them to go.'' The line
galvanized the convention crowd much the way a similar exhortation
must have aroused Oliver Cromwell's supporters as he led the
winning struggle against England's weak King Charles I in the 17th
century. ``You have stayed long enough ... to do any good any
longer. In the name of God, you should go,'' Cromwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful stuff, then as now. Very good for an introductory
performance. But much depends on whether the Republican vinegar
runs out before Election Day.

POLITICAL CRITICS SILENCED IN WAR ON FUNDAMENTALISM 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Ali Salem recently wrote the script for an
unfinished 10-minute public service announcement that encourages
his fellow Egyptians to shed their cynicism and vote in elections.
</P>
<P>
   The state now says that makes him a criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Salem, a big, rumpled, chain-smoking, 64-year-old satirist who
has 25 plays and 15 books to his name, was charged July 22 with
threatening national security and harming the national interest.
After handing over his identity card and being released on his own
recognizance, he still could not believe it. ``It's the first time
I've ever heard my name used in this way,'' Salem said, sipping
strong coffee in the hotel cafe where he holds court with his
artist and actor friends each day. ``Not the Egyptian Ali Salem,
not the playwright Ali Salem, not the columnist Ali Salem. But the
accused Ali Salem.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country that has criminalized many forms of political
criticism and debate, that sobriquet puts him in the company of
Islamic militants, journalists, union officials, human rights
activists and academics who have offended the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt boasts of having a constitution and democratic
accouterments like courts, elections, a lively private business
sector and a Parliament. Even its internal critics acknowledge that
it is more free, and more mindful of its own laws than most of its
neighbors in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last five years, the government of President Hosni
Mubarak has also frozen the funds of nearly every professional
union and trade organization in the country. It has rejected all
petitions for new political parties. It has ignored appeals to end
the 19-year state of emergency, which permits the authorities to
restrict political activity and send adversaries to jail with no
right of appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Since Mubarak won re-election in a yes-or-no referendum last
fall with more than 94 percent of the vote, his government has
stepped up its campaign. It jailed human rights activists last
winter when their reports on Muslim-Christian violence were deemed
to threaten national security, and it has continued to jail writers
when their articles are found insulting to Egyptian institutions.
</P>
<P>
   In June, it closed down a research institute, the Ibn Khaldoun
Center, which was producing Salem's get-out-the-vote film as well
as a conference on minority rights in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Saad Eddin Ibrahim, a sociologist who directed the center and
holds a U.S. passport, has been held without charge in Tora Prison
outside Cairo since June 30. His detention has spurred protests
from human rights groups around the world as well as the Middle
East Studies Association of North America and the U.S. Embassy in
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, a State Security Court judge extended his
detention for another 15 days. Ibrahim's lawyers have said he is
being accused of inciting sectarian strife through his seminars on
religious relations and defaming Egypt by mentioning public apathy
and past election fraud in the aborted film written by Salem about
voting rights.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has called on Egypt to clarify the accusations
against Ibrahim or release him.
</P>
<P>
   Many people active in public life in Cairo said that the
offensive against the Ibn Khaldoun Center, and now Salem, is the
latest example of how the Mubarak government's 10-year-long war on
Islamic fundamentalists has eroded political life, making
casualties of all independent political voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a kind of political stability, and we don't have the
luxury of miscalculations,'' said Wahid Abdel Maguid, a political
analyst with the governmental Al Ahram Center for Political and
Strategic Studies, who believes the limits on opposition political
activity are justified by a continuing threat from Islamists. ``We
have undemocratic forces here that are more undemocratic than the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other governments in the region, the Egyptian government
faced an insurgency by fundamentalists beginning in the early
1990s. It began by imprisoning thousands of suspected militants and
then turned its attention in the mid-1990s to trade unions it saw
as infiltrated by fundamentalist groups like the Muslim
Brotherhood. Hundreds of leaders of the Brotherhood and various
unions were tried in military courts and jailed. A third wave of
arrests _ some 1,300 people so far this year, by Brotherhood
estimates _ is now under way.
</P>
<P>
   Now the government is delaying scheduled union elections,
effectively maintaining its freeze on associations that once were a
forum for political activity. The Lawyers' Syndicate, for example,
which represents nearly 300,000 attorneys, has had its elections
postponed, prompting some lawyers to call for nationwide strikes
last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want no headaches, and every election brings with it a
competition,'' said Essam Elerian, a Brotherhood activist in the
nearly defunct doctors' syndicate who just completed a jail term
after being arrested in an earlier crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   To control charitable and nongovernmental organizations that
could be used by fundamentalists, Mubarak also last year pushed
through Parliament a law requiring each group to submit its board
members' names and their funding sources to the government for
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups, which are almost all organized as
nongovernmental organizations, vowed to ignore the new law, which
they said was an attempt by the government to censor and silence
them. The law was recently declared invalid by the Constitutional
Court on the technical grounds that it had not been submitted to
the proper legislative bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people didn't pay attention because they said the
government was only fighting fundamentalists, but that's not
true,'' said Abou Elela Mady Abou Elela, a former Muslim
Brotherhood official. ``Only now are others in civil society
realizing how dangerous what the government is doing can be. It's
only because of what happened to Saad Eddin Ibrahim.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Abou Elela, who has twice had his petition to form a new
political party rejected by Mubarak's government, said he is not
surprised that, as he put it, ``finally one liberal'' has run afoul
of the regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``He crossed the lines,'' he said of Ibrahim. ``He started
dealing with sensitive issues like religious minorities, democracy
and elections. The government goes wild over these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In a message sent from prison and released by his wife, Ibrahim
said he is being detained because he planned to set up a monitoring
group to observe the upcoming elections for the 444-seat
Parliament. ``Certain forces,'' he said, ``are hoping to rig
elections again in peace and quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling National Democratic Party now controls 97 percent of
the seats, a dominance that it has maintained for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is using Saad as a bogeyman to scare him and
other organizations from intervening in the coming elections,''
said Tahseen Bashir, a former Egyptian diplomat and spokesman for
Mubarak's predecessor, Anwar Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   But the battle to suppress Muslim fundamentalists, he added,
does not justify a scattershot crackdown on anyone who brings up
potentially contentious social issues or tries to create political
parties to challenge Mubarak's ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not calling for chaos, but I'm calling for studied steps
for change,'' Bashir said. ``Too much stability is deadness, a
paralysis of the political system.''
</P>
<P>
   No member of the government would comment on Ibrahim's case, and
prosecutors have not said they are investigating his
vote-monitoring project. They have, however, summarily closed down
a group related to the Ibn Khaldoun Center that was devoted to
encouraging women's participation in elections, and indicated that
the short film was the trigger for their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay that Salem wrote for the film focuses on an
Egyptian couple who reflect on how they can best assure themselves
a bright future. In one scene, a group of men are sitting in a
coffee shop in Cairo complaining. One says there is no good health
care. Another says the education system is bad. Another grouses
that there is no national dream.
</P>
<P>
   The couple ends up scolding them. ``You can become a partner in
the future by participating in elections,'' they say.
</P>
<P>
   Salem said he tried in vain to explain to the prosecutors that
the coffee shop complaints were a dramatic device to set up the
theme of the film, which was meant show that Egyptians should vote
rather than just gripe to assure themselves a good future.
</P>
<P>
   But the government interrogators, he said, just kept asking him
why he wrote all those bad things about Egypt.

   ``To explain a joke is a miserable job,'' Salem lamented, adding
that it reminded him of another joke from the 1960s, when President
Gamal Abdel Nasser was in power and suppressed political debate.
</P>
<P>
   In the joke, a man is arrested by the police for carrying a bag
of blank papers. When he asks the police why, they reply: ``Do you
think we should wait until you write something bad on them?''

ALBUM OF THE WEEK: `IN GRIOT TIME: STRING MUSIC FROM MALI' 
</HEADLINE>
   By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   `IN GRIOT TIME: STRING MUSIC FROM MALI': (Stern's Africa)
</P>
<P>
   Appreciating studio-made popular music from other countries can
be like hearing a language you're not very familiar with; each
particular culture's aesthetics of instrumentation, electronics,
mixing and pop appeal present obstacles to understanding foreign
music on its own terms.
</P>
<P>
   That's why ``In Griot Time,'' the companion CD to Banning Eyre's
new book of the same name (Temple University Press), does American
ears such a service. The book is an earnest account of Eyre's
seven-month stay in Bamako, Mali, where he had an apprenticeship
with the guitarist Djelimady Tounkara. Tounkara has transferred the
sound of traditional Manding string instruments like the kora and
the ngoni to the regular guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Both the book and CD argue that Malian music is the greatest
music in Africa, and they do it not just with polished,
commercially available work, but with the author's own field
recordings of musicians in private performance or in lesson-giving
mode. The fact that it carefully uses both sorts of documents is at
one with the book's tone of painstaking honesty. There's a section
in which Eyre humbly wonders if his interest in Malian music is
corrupt, since he seems to prefer it alone and out of context,
rather than with the obligatory electronic drum machines heard on
Malian recordings.
</P>
<P>
   The CD begins with a privately recorded 40-second excerpt from a
song called ``Sunjata,'' an important piece of music to Malians,
about the first king of the Manding empire. This is Tounkara's
style in a nutshell: a loping, folkish picking rhythm, then a fast,
delicately plucked cascade of notes. His playing is later heard
alongside the hard, leathery vocals of Yayi Kanoute, in a duet with
a ngoni (a six-string harp), and as part of the studio-clean but
complexly elastic Super Rail Band, Tounkara's group since the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Tounkara is the constant element running through the disc, but
there are a series of departures: segues from rough-diamond
rehearsal sequences to impeccably arranged album tracks by Salif
Keita, Oumou Sangare, and Kandia Kouyate, and the brooding, lovely,
pentatonic guitar music of Ali Farka Toure. Intelligently
sequenced, the disc has a mode of persuasion that's similar to the
music, light but commanding. It's enough to jump-start an interest
in Malian music, if there is within a person the slightest
possibility of doing so.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The doctor will see you now. So will the only
undisputed homegrown Democratic candidate for U.S. senator from New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Gosh, they're the same chipmunk-cheeked guy, and neither one
oozes schmooze. They're operating out of the same Park Avenue war
room, a minimal space with an ominous screen for viewing X-rays, a
manila folder for keeping track of campaign promises and, in the
tradition of doctors' offices everywhere, the sound of toilets
being flushed as you cower in the visitor's chair awaiting news
about that orthopedic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But no need now for Dr. Mark S. McMahon, 38, to drum up his
bedside manner _possibly a good thing, as rumor has it that this is
not a strong suit with him, except when he's home tending to his
three children. Two of whom _ honest! _ attend PS 6, one of the
city's A-list public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Our topic is the doctor's obsession: politics, apparently a
moth-to-flame thing with him ever since he was elected homeroom
president back in elementary school. And even if Hillary Rodham
Clinton, wearing the party's halo, treats McMahon like a nebbish _
ignoring his debate invitations and pretending he's polling-place
toast _ he's got news for her.
</P>
<P>
   He's officially on the ballot and sticking around until the
Sept. 12 primary; maybe longer. Sure, he thinks it's fishy that
there are suddenly four other insurgents on the ballot, none of
whom scraped up the required 15,000 signatures, all of whom could
undermine his effort to monopolize the anti-Hillary vote.
</P>
<P>
   But his mother, Eva, a retired nurse, and his father, Tom, a
semi-retired dentist, didn't scavenge the malls and Home Depots of
Long Island helping him collect those 44,107 signatures for
nothing. So regardless of the decision on his court challenge to
the validity of the other party-crashers, he's forging ahead with
his no-frills, no-television-commercials, $200,000 (more or less)
campaign to heal what ails the Senate by sending it a physician,
not another lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't drink, smoke, curse, golf, or philander. (Does this
fellow really meet the qualifications to be a senator from New
York?) He's never been arrested, and the closest he's come to the
fast track is skipping the 8th and 11th grades at Fordham Prep in
the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's my problem a little,'' he says about being on the
cusp of nerddom. ``I may be just sort of, ah, insipid in that
sense. I don't know. I just felt I owed it to my parents to lead
sort of an exemplary life.''
</P>
<P>
   Meet Candidate McMahon, the Harvard-educated doctor,
vanity-published medical-thriller author and self-confessed
goody-two-shoes who insists that not only is candidate Clinton not
the people's choice (``I'm shocked at the level of anti-Hillary
sentiment that exists'') but that she's absolutely the wrong
candidate to combat Rep. Rick Lazio, the Republican candidate. ``My
biggest gripe with Hillary,'' McMahon said, ``is that because of
her, this seat may end up in Republican hands. Giuliani is replaced
by an understudy candidate of limited distinction, and now he's
seven points ahead of the other candidate, the most famous woman on
the planet, quote, unquote.''
</P>
<P>
   His handshake is a limp one, but don't hold that against him.
Maybe he's saving strength to wield his scalpel _ he's already done
six operations on this particular day and, like a savvy politician
who blueprints names and faces, he demonstrates total, if a tad
disinterested, recall. One carpal tunnel release, two tumor
removals (benign), three knees scoped. The usual stuff. Frankly,
after seven years in private practice, he'd rather be in the Senate
making policy than renovating bone matter. He would, he says, be a
leader in health care reform, but not a one-issue automaton, not
with that 1985 degree from the London School of Economics.
</P>
<P>
   The McMahon mission in a nutshell: he supports expanded Medicare
and services for the elderly; increased research on AIDS and
cancer; gun control; capital punishment; rent control; higher
minimum wage and teachers' salaries; the sovereignty of Israel's
borders. He opposes prayer in public schools, school vouchers,
late-term abortion, gay marriage, eliminating affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   He did not take a cram course on the issues: this is stuff he
thinks about all the time.
</P>
<P>
   So far his patients haven't rebelled at his alternate career:
``But I could imagine somebody saying `I want to go to someone who
all he thinks about is scoping knees, not this guy who's running
for Senate, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. McMahon refuses to attack Clinton's political platform (he's
waiting for the debate that he says she owes the state's 4.9
million Democrats) and slyly says they even have something in
common: ``Neither one of us has held office.'' But he makes short
work of Lazio: ``He's the un-Hillary. What does he stand for?
What's his rationale? For example, about Israel, where's he been on
that? My sense of him is that there's no there there.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough air time for Rick Lazio. Let's talk about Mark McMahon.
What do you do for fun? ``Spend time with the kids,'' he said. ``I
can't understand parents who all they want to do is get away from
their kids.'' His are 6, 5 and almost 1 and unaware that daddy is
running for Senate. He is, he adds, opposed to ``using them as
campaign props.'' And his wife, Lynne, a radiologist at Bellevue
Hospital Center, is ``apolitical,'' so he expects no stumping from
that quadrant, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll probably vote for Hillary,'' he said. It's his first,
and last, joke of the day.

TURRELLS FOR NATIONAL GALLERY; KOONS FOR THE WWW; BOLTONSKI FOR
BOSTON; A MERGER FOR MODERN CLASSICS AND A HOTELIER FOR
CHRISTIE'S 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To beef up its contemporary-art holdings, the National Gallery
of Art in Washington has acquired four early works by the
installation artist James Turrell. After hearing of the purchase,
Turrell said he would give the gallery a fifth work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is certainly an artist whose work belongs in any museum,''
said Earl A. Powell III, the gallery's director. ``We're beginning
to focus on areas like minimalism. We had no installation pieces in
our collection.''
</P>
<P>
   The four projection pieces, bought with the help of the Brown
Foundation in Houston, represent Turrell's early classic work from
the 1960s. ``Royce'' and ``Artar'' are single-wall projections, in
which pure shapes are created with white light from a single
projector. ``Amba'' and ``Orca,'' two-projector end-wall pieces,
are among the first of many works by the artist that fill an entire
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Weiss, head of the department of contemporary art, said
the donated work would either be an existing piece or a new one
created specifically for the gallery from his ``Space Division''
series. In this series the artist divides a single room into two
sections with separate lighting and an aperture in the dividing
wall. The viewer stands in one space looking through the opening
into another.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the early works we've acquired are all black-and-white,
the `Space Division' series is all in color,'' Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery has not decided exactly when the Turrells will go on
view, said Weiss, who is aiming for 2002. They are to be installed
in the East Building, home to the gallery's collection of
20th-century art since it opened in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   NEW MARKET FOR KOONS
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Koons has always gone for mass appeal. Every day this
summer, hundreds of people have been paying homage to ``Puppy,''
the 43-foot-tall flower-covered topiary in the form of a West
Highland terrier prominently displayed at Rockefeller Center.
``Split Rocker,'' a 40-foot tall topiary shaped like a rocking toy
in the form of a half pony, half dinosaur, has been on view in the
Benoit XII Cloister in the Papal Palace in Avignon, France.
</P>
<P>
   In the same spirit of accessibility, Koons has signed a contract
with eyestorm.com to sell photographic prints in editions of 1,000
of three of his 1999 paintings: ``Hair,'' ``Cut Out'' and
``Loopy.'' They will cost $500 each and be available at the end of
the month.
</P>
<P>
   Koons was traveling and could not be reached for comment, but
Elizabeth Markevitch, the Internet company's vice president for
content, said the prints ``will give the public the chance to own a
Koons for $500.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not targeting art-market people,'' she added, ``but
rather consumers who find the art world intimidating or
inaccessible.''
</P>
<P>
   A BOLTANSKI FOR BOSTON
</P>
<P>
   The National Gallery isn't the only encyclopedic museum finally
paying attention to installation art. The Museum of Fine Arts in
Boston commissioned the French Conceptual artist Christian
Boltanski to design a site-specific installation. It will be on
view from Wednesday through Nov. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The work is meant to complement another show, ``Charlotte
Salomon: Life? Or Theater?'' which also opens on Wednesday; it runs
through Oct. 29. Salomon, a Berlin-born artist, created a
semi-autobiographical series of colorful gouaches before she died
in Auschwitz at 26. Organized by the Royal Academy in London, the
show was first exhibited in Amsterdam in 1961 and has been seen in
Germany, France, Japan and England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having both works creates a great dialogue,'' said Cheryl
Brutvan, curator of contemporary art at the Museum of Fine Arts.
``Both consider issues like memory in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   Boltanski said he had agreed to make a site-specific piece for
the museum because he admired Salomon's work and thought he could
create a good complement to it. His work uses archival photographs
of crimes from 14-year-old newspaper clippings because, he said, he
liked the images. Half the photographs show criminals, and half
show victims. They are illuminated on white fabric placed in the
middle of a gallery. Black mirrors frame the walls of the space.
``It's about memory and faces and the issue of being guilty and not
guilty,'' Boltanski said.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has other installation works on its schedule,
including one by John Borofsky, most recently known for his
large-scale sculptures, opening in the fall, and another by Sara
Sze, the Manhattan-based installation artist, planned for next
year.

<P>
   Artemis Fine Arts, the London gallery that specializes in old
master and 19th-century paintings, is joining forces with Lawrence
Greenberg van Doren, which has galleries in New York and St. Louis
showing a mixture of modern masters and emerging artists. The joint
venture, to be called Artemis Greenberg van Doren, will focus
mainly on modern American classic painters like Sam Francis, Yves
Klein and Andy Warhol. ``Everyone can benefit from this,'' said
Timothy Bathurst, a director of Artemis. ``It gives us a broader
outreach and we're keen on the American market. We do a lot of
business here.''

<P>
   HOTELIER TO THE RESCUE
</P>
<P>
   With news that Christie's is contemplating building a hotel on
the block it owns in St. James', London, it may be fitting that the
French-owned auction house has appointed an international chief
operating officer with a background in hotel management.
Jean-Claude Noel, 53, has worked at both Hilton International and
TNT Post Group, a $9 billion leader in mail, communications and
logistics. He will be based in New York, supervising the standard
of client services and operational procedures for Christie's
offices worldwide.

 &HT;    Children of the '60s and '70s who vowed never to censor their
kids' music now face the next shock wave
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eminem has ruled the charts this summer with his catchy,
melt-in-your-mouth raps _ about getting high, killing his enemies
and sleeping with his mother. His popularity with young fans has
left some parents with a messy _ and acutely familiar _ problem on
their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Brenda Moseley.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem suddenly appeared on Moseley's radar screen when she was
getting ready for work on Monday, listening to a local radio
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``The station was bleeping out the words. You couldn't hear what
he was saying, but you knew exactly what he meant,'' said Moseley,
of Ellenwood. ``I don't object to rap music, I like some of it. But
I don't want my kids listening to suggestive lyrics like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the 39-year-old mother of two had heard
``The Real Slim Shady,'' a comedic, catchy tune laced with
profanity that has been a fixture on the R&AMP;B and hip-hop charts for
two months.
</P>
<P>
   Most tracks on Eminem's latest album, ``The Marshall Mathers
LP,'' are too raunchy or violent for radio airplay. The Eminem song
Moseley heard was a ``clean version,'' with the most offensive
lyrics omitted.
</P>
<P>
   The Eminem incident conjured up a teenage memory for Moseley:
She once conned her religious mother into letting her attend a
concert at the Omni by claiming the rock band Aerosmith was a
contemporary Christian group.
</P>
<P>
   Now Moseley knows what it's like on the other side of the
musical generation gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid listening to Bobby Sherman or the Osmonds, I
wasn't paying attention to the words much,'' Moseley said. ``Now
kids are inundated with words and sexual content that is
influencing them. You can see and hear how much things have
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, things have changed. Jim Morrison's ``The End''
included a line about Oedipal sex 30 years ago, but in a punk- and
rap-influenced pop world, such psychedelic Doors songs sound almost
quaint. And in that world, Eminem stands out as someone who doesn't
just push the envelope of good taste, but folds, spindles and
mutilates it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been fighting over music across the generations since
the beginning of time,'' says Jaye Shaner, a professor at Georgia
State University who specializes in intergenerational
communication. ``But there has been a trend in recent years where
groups are being more explicit in their lyrics. Nothing is left to
the imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents trying to censor, or at least monitor, their children's
musical tastes are also fighting on a broader battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem has a top-selling CD in record stores, his hardcore
lyrics are widely available on the Internet, his sanitized singles
are played frequently on radio, he's a darling of cable's MTV. This
at a time when, thanks to tamer videos on Disney, CDs at McDonald's
and the like, younger kids are being introduced to popular music.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta fans get Eminem close-up, personal and uncensored
tonight. Teaming up with his gangsta mentor Dr. Dre, the rapper is
in the midst of a successful, multi-city ``Up In Smoke'' concert
tour, which plays Lakewood Amphitheater at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Along with fellow rappers Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg and Xzibit,
Eminem is expected to perform hit songs, some of which praise
violence and drug use, and which have been criticized for promoting
hateful attitudes towards gays and women.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem's ability to express adolescent confusion and rage is
part of his appeal, especially to younger fans. It's also what
makes him so disturbing to some adults.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the late comedian Andy Kaufman, Eminem goads audiences
into loving and loathing him at the same time, pushing them to
examine their own hypocrisy and prejudice. Or not.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wyman, a cultural critic for the online magazine Salon,
says that subtle message is often lost on younger listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's unquestionably a serious and smart artist,'' Wyman says
of Eminem. ``But I think his lyrics are the most hellaciously cruel
and hateful that we've ever heard. I think it's bad art that hurts
kids.'' Chervon Pannell, 15, of Lithonia is a big Eminem fan, and
will be at his concert tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best rapper out there right now, because he's had a
messed up life, and he's so creative the way he talks about it,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   So Chervon's mother, Cassandra Pannell, 39, pays close attention
to the songs playing on her daughters' radio.
</P>
<P>
   A native of the South Bronx, where rap was spawned, Pannell is
no stranger to slang words, such as ``bitch'' and ``ho,'' that some
rap and pop artists use to describe women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they're going to hear these words,'' Pannell says.
``But I also ask them what kind of boy would call them that, and
why would they want to date somebody who thinks of them that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Pannell is also a veteran of the generational music wars. As a
teenager, one of her favorite songs was ``Pillow Talk'' by Sylvia,
a breathy ballad in which the singer moaned and groaned as if
having sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother was like to have a stroke when she found out I
was listening to that,'' Pannell remembers. ``But when my mother
came home she was more open about it, and she talked to me. I
always said I was going to be the same way with my kids. I want to
keep things open with them, even if I'm shocked by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Barringer of Dunwoody wasn't shocked to find out that he
had an Eminem fan in his household, but he was surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Barringer, a 64-year-old retiree, is a loyal and longtime fan of
Little Richard and the Rolling Stones, performers whose lyrics and
performances once outraged grownups.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent shopping trip to Northlake Mall with his
10-year-old son, Jackson, Barringer was asked about Eminem.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean the candy?'' he asked, looking puzzled. After
learning the difference between M&AMP;M's and Eminem, Barringer said,
``Nope. My son likes 'NSync. He doesn't listen to rap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I do,'' Jackson blurted out. ``I like 'NSync, but I like
Eminem too, even though he curses on his records sometimes, and I
don't think that's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Before heading home, Barringer exacted a promise from his son
not to listen to Eminem any more _ on the radio or anywhere else.
Jackson, a mini- Eminem look-alike with a pug nose and naturally
platinum-blonde hair, sheepishly agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't watch MTV, and I thought I new the knew most of the
artists he listened to,'' said the older Barringer. ``I guess I'm
going to have to start paying more attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Moseley of Ellenwood, said it's critical for parents to stay
tuned in to the soundtrack of their children's lives. Even if you
don't share their tastes, it's important to share your values.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing ``Slim Shady'' on the radio, Moseley told her
daughter Elizabeth she didn't approve of the bad-boy rapper's
lyrics. Counter to teen stereotypes, the 14-year-old didn't argue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my mother I agree with her,'' Elizabeth says. ``When it
comes on the radio I change the station, especially if my little
brother is around.''

 &HT;    Virtual reality helps vanquish fear of flying
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only last year, Shannon Orr feared flying ``more than dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she's a pilot, who soloed for the first time last week.
</P>
<P>
   Orr mastered her flight phobia, which is shared by millions of
Americans, by confronting her fears as part of a joint study by
Georgia Tech and Emory University. At the Tech campus offices of
Virtually Better, a virtual-reality start-up partly financed by the
universities, Orr sat through four sessions in a Darth Vader-like
mask and a ``Thunderseat,'' both hooked to a computer loaded with
flight-simulating software.
</P>
<P>
   The setup works like this: Look to the left and you see the
tarmac out the window. Look up and see buttons that control lights
and air, down at your hands and knees _ even rumpled newspapers in
empty seats. Then the flight attendant comes on, reminding you to
buckle up. In an instant, the plane hurtles down a virtual runway _
you hear the noise and feel the vibrations _ and you're airborne,
zooming over a virtual Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A therapist sits nearby, asking how you're feeling and trying to
soothe frayed nerves. If you're doing OK, he'll turn on the
turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really brought out the anxieties,'' says Orr, a 38-year-old
technical writer. ``After a few sessions, I was noticing a great
improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   So were most of the others in the study, results of which were
released today.
</P>
<P>
   ``What our research shows is, it works,'' says Barbara Rothbaum,
director of Emory's Trauma and Anxiety Recovery Program. ``Ninety
percent of those in the study have reported flying voluntarily.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows for sure why so many people are petrified of
airplanes. Many terrified fliers say that fear of crashing is their
biggest concern, even though they may not worry about getting
behind the wheel of a car, which is much more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally irrational,'' says Ken Graap, president of
Virtually Better. ``If you had to fly every day of your life,
probabilities indicate it would take you 26,000 years before you
would succumb to a fatal airplane accident. The odds of being hit
by lightning are five times greater than dying in a plane crash.''
</P>
<P>
   Orr's phobia began on a return flight to Atlanta years ago. The
weather was bad, and the plane had to circle. She became
disoriented and had a strong feeling that ``something could go
wrong. I didn't know what was going on, so I got scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Scared enough to keep her off of airplanes for years. Until
recently, she says, she ``wouldn't have taken a free trip to Hawaii
with a hotel thrown in.''
</P>
<P>
   But now she'll fly anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Tech-Emory study didn't place phobic fliers in virtual
planes right away. In their first four sessions, subjects were
taught stress-reducing breathing techniques and
``thought-blocking,'' which helps them think of something besides
their fears. Then, during four more sessions, they ``took off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The therapy just has to be real enough to feel something like
the real experience,'' says Samantha Smith, a researcher involved
in the study. ``The images don't look real, but for some reason,
after a while they feel real, which is why it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Simah Benyamin, 55, a flight-phobic who works in an office near
Virtually Better, volunteered to demonstrate the therapy last week.
The simulated air journey made her knuckles turn white.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little scary,'' she said. ``But it was a lot better
than my last real flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Some psychologists use another type of exposure therapy _ taking
patients on real airplanes. The Tech-Emory study found that that
approach worked about as well as the virtual-reality therapy, but
it is much more costly and time-consuming. Therapists can buy
Virtually Better's system for $5,000 plus $400 per month; insurance
often covers the cost for patients.
</P>
<P>
   Other traditional remedies involve drugs. Many phobics resort to
alcohol or tranquilizers, neither of which is a good solution,
Rothbaum says. ``If you're sloshed at a business meeting, you're
not going to be effective. And tranquilizers can become addicting.
``We want to help people confront and conquer their fears,'' she
declares, ``not medicate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Her fears conquered, Orr can't wait until her next solo flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taken an incredible leap,'' she says. ``Some anxiety is
still there, but that's good. It helps you concentrate. And it's
really neat up there.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   As far as I'm concerned, it can't be demonstrated too often that
the aesthetic principles considered basic to modernism are neither
very recent nor especially Western. It's as comforting as it is
humbling, the idea that the 20th century didn't create modernism
from scratch, that it's not a relatively local, possibly exhausted
aberration whose death one may celebrate or mourn. Whatever it is,
the desire for simplicity, directness and abstraction is part of
our very humanity and repeatedly finds expression.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of what might be called the eternal modern can be
felt in certain great examples of African, Egyptian and early Greek
art and different kinds of Asian art. Right now this presence
hovers like a beautiful mist over ``The Arts of Honami Koetsu,
Japanese Renaissance Master'' at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, a
small miracle of an exhibition that pays homage to a late
16th-century artist who has become known to scholars and admirers
as ``the Leonardo da Vinci of Japanese art.''
</P>
<P>
   Containing 70 works in calligraphy, lacquer and ceramics, this
is the first show in the West devoted to Koetsu, who was born in
1558 and died in 1637. It comes with a sensitive installation, a
catalog detailing his achievement as never before and rarely lent
work from Japanese museums, several important cultural properties
among them. It is spread throughout three smallish galleries, where
the low light levels required by its fragile works create an almost
magical sense of time travel. (Fragility also dictates that nearly
two-thirds of the show will be rotated starting on September 19.)
</P>
<P>
   Like Leonardo, Koetsu was a polymath: versatile, erudite,
technically adept and lastingly influential. As Leonardo was
respected for his unparalleled draftsmanship, Koetsu was revered
for his calligraphy, which he mastered in several styles, both
Chinese and Japanese. The show's spine is a progression of
calligraphic works, that range from early letters and a list of
master swordsmiths _ Koetsu came from a family of prominent sword
connoisseurs in Kyoto _ to Buddhist texts made at the end of his
life, when he retreated with family and friends to Takagamine, a
small village north of Kyoto built on land ceded to him by the
shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1615.
</P>
<P>
   The show's ethereal ambience is set by several examples of the
works that Koetsu is perhaps most famous for, the poem scrolls and
little poem cards on which he collaborated with the painter
Tawaraya Sotatsu (who died circa 1640), sprinkling his flowing
calligraphy over Sotatsu's equally effortless abbreviations of
natural motifs _ a mountain slope, a stand of pines, a pair of
deer, drifting chrysanthemums, clustered bellflowers or cherry
blossoms.
</P>
<P>
   The opening work is one half of a double six-fold seasonal
screen interesting not so much for its lovely garden image, which
was painted in the late 1600s in the manner of Sotatsu, but for the
small square poem cards that are thought to be Sotatsu's and
Koetsu's first collaboration. They punctuate the surface of the
image like a series of elegant thought balloons or close-up views
of nature's calendar. These complex little addenda of script and
image (the labels translate) in particular attune the viewer to the
exquisitely nuanced responses to nature that lie at the core of
Japanese art.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, the show's first gallery includes later, more dynamic
poem-card collaborations between Koetsu and Sotatsus, mounted on
hanging scrolls or displayed in albums, that are astounding for
their off-hand power and varieties of pictorial space and scale. In
these seemingly minimal works Koetsu's calligraphy hovers above
landscapes, floats beneath waves that dance with the reflections of
trees or dangle among peach blossoms like tendrils of vine or moss.
Here, the viewer can acquire an instant initiation into the
splendors of calligraphy, up close and personal.
</P>
<P>
   Also like Leonardo, Koetsu's achievement can have an elusive
quicksilver quality, and his legacy of ideas, taste and design may
be almost as important as anything he actually touched. An
inveterate collaborator, and one suspects, something of a
charismatic, he is also sometimes called the world's first ``art
director.'' For example, it is thought that he never actually
worked in lacquer, but excelled at its design and is responsible
for the introduction of base metals, which set up a rich contrast
with the more traditional silver and gold, as exemplified by the
small writing box that features a reed boat in lead inlay in this
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Koetsu's multifaceted career thrived during the brief, brilliant
Momoyama period (1573-1615) that served as the glittering hinge
between medieval and early modern Japan. This four-decade cultural
renaissance ensued when the country was finally united under the
authority of the successive warlords Nobunaga, Hideyoshi and
Tokugawa after more than 100 years of civil disorder, violence and
social fragmentation.
</P>
<P>
   It was an age of building, recovery and revival, extensive
cultural patronage and competitive displays of ostentation. All the
arts seem to have been called up for active duty. The castles being
erected at a rather frantic pace in and around Kyoto required
lavish furnishings and decorations, especially painted screens and
panels, and the more gold leaf the better.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the mercantile elite of Kyoto, Koetsu was both
connected to artists and artisans of all kinds and trained in a
discipline, sword connoisseurship, that involved the appraisal of a
series of skills, effects and materials, both decorative and
practical. For starters, swords and their sheaths involved fine
forging, metalwork and lacquer. Even sword polishing, which was
Koetsu's specialty until his late '40s, was close to an artform.
</P>
<P>
   But Koetsu had several pans on the fire. Koetsu was a respected
practitioner of the tea ceremony, gatherings for which served as
artistic and literary salons in Momoyama Kyoto. He figured in the
upsurge in book publishing that began in the late 16th century,
working with a Kyoto-based publisher to produce high-quality
editions of literature. (His calligraphy served as a model for the
design of the woodblock typeface that made these books possible.)
He was especially familiar with the aristocratic traditions of the
Heian period (794-1185), Japan's first golden age, which saw the
founding of its calligraphy and literature and which exerted a
refining influence over the frequent exuberance of Momoyama.
</P>
<P>
   He became both a connoisseur and master of calligraphy, possibly
studying in his late 30s under Prince Soncho, less for the latter's
calligraphic talents than his hereditary position as abbot of the
Shoren-in monastery, an important repository of ancient Chinese and
Japanese calligraphy. Although records are sketchy, he was involved
enough with the production of lacquers, whether as a designer,
advisor or influence, that the phrase ``Koetsu lacquerware''
continues to connote a certain boldness of shape and surface
decoration.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at Takagamine, where he spent more and more time after
1615, he devoted himself seriously to raku ceramics, then a
relatively new form. (It had emerged in late 1570s, when Sen no
Rikyu, the period's most influential tea ceremony master _ and thus
an important arbiter of taste _ asked Chojiro, a maker of
exceptionally handsome roof tiles, to adapt his techniques to the
making of tea bowls.)
</P>
<P>
   An unusual combination of hands-on technique and aestheticism
came together in Koetsu, and it's reflected in this show, which is
noticeably low on the technical fireworks and dazzling material
display that was so central to the Momoyama period. Koetsu's art
exemplifies some of the most essential elements of the Japanese
sensibility, including its signal indifference to the distinction
between art and craft, or the migration of similar motifs from one
medium to another. Deer graze among the calligraphy in Koetsu and
Sotatsu's famous ``Deer Scroll'' and also along the slender
cylinder of a lacquer flute case. A rabbit, thought to have been
drawn by Koetsu, appears on a fan and also hides among the grasses
on a little salmon-colored incense container.
</P>
<P>
   But he also exemplifies what might be called the ``other''
Momoyama, which adhered more closely to the often rarefied ideals
of the Heian period. Gold as used here is just one of several
almost always transparent tones. The main metallic glow comes from
the covers and pages of the printed books he was involved with, for
example, Noh libretti decorated with faint natural motifs and
patterns in mica, a Heian invention, that are most visible from a
raking angle.
</P>
<P>
   Koetsu's achievement may have been to renew Heian
otherworldliness by bringing it down to earth, giving it an
understated but undeniable directness of touch. We do not gasp at
the technical prowess of these works and wonder how they were made.
Their making is always visible, in fact it is the heart of the
work: we can see the quick unlabored strokes of the brush, the flow
of ink and paint, the natural give and take between language and
form with their unending spatial interactions.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore the tactility and intimacy of Koetsu's art,
this exhibition includes two of the most ingenious uses of
interactive computers yet to worm their way into an art museum.
These enable the viewer to virtually hold and manipulate a digital
facsimile of the ``Crane Scroll,'' Koetsu's most famous
collaboration with Sotatsu (which will be part of the September
rotation) , and his black and rust raku ``Shichiri (Seven
Leagues)'' tea bowl, feeling the textures and asymmetries of its
surface while observing the pictorial subtleties of its glaze on a
small screen.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the 20 raku tea bowls attributed to Koetsu _ including
the ``Shichiri'' _ conclude the exhibition, some with the more
traditional rounded hip, others with the squarish one that he
originated. Each has a shape and surface that is completely its own
and, like so much else here, looks as if it were made yesterday.

OUT ON BAIL, MOB SUSPECTS FIND THEY CAN'T REALLY LEAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The leak in the ceiling had been there for weeks, a
nasty bruise of moldy plaster and peeling paint. Though Anthony
Spero had been trying his best to get a handyman in, there wasn't a
guy in all of Staten Island who would take the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to come out here,'' Spero, the reputed
consigliere, or counselor, of the Bonanno crime family said the
other day as he glared at the ugly water stain. ``They gotta give
their Social Security number, their date of birth and go through a
background check. No repair guy I know is gonna want to go through
that.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the domestic troubles of ``wise guys'' subjected to a
new and remarkably restrictive form of house arrest. In the last
two years, a handful of men accused of mob-related crimes have been
freed on bail before their trials and forced to live with tapped
phone lines, draconian visiting rights and round-the-clock
surveillance as their private castles are turned into virtual
jails.
</P>
<P>
   Though only a small number of people have borne the kind-of-in,
kind-of-out existence that characterizes the home-as-jail, a
judicial order issued in a Brooklyn court in June has made it
tougher for mob defendants to be freed on bail, meaning that those
who are released are more likely to wind up shuttered inside their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   The cases have piqued the interest of prosecutors and defense
lawyers, who naturally disagree on whether releasing a defendant
from custody on the condition he convert his house into Sing Sing
is fair and safe. And given that the defendants themselves must
foot the bill for the harsh security measures, questions have also
arisen about whether it is only the richest suspects who can pay
the price of freedom by creating a prison atmosphere at home.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has fought these so-called super-bail
packages every time they have been offered. To let a suspected
gangster out of custody before his trial, they say, is to invite
jury tampering, witness intimidation _ or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``At bottom, these packages have an element of trust built into
them because the guards can't watch these guys 24-7,'' said one law
enforcement official who spoke on the condition that his name not
be used. ``And if they're not watched round-the-clock, there's
always the potential that they'll call their associates and
continue committing crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers, on the other hand, repudiate the notion that a
man locked up inside his house with his phone lines tapped, his
friends kept away and his movements watched by federal agents could
manage to slip an illegal message to a crony or carry on with a
criminal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bail system itself has an element of trust built into
it,'' said Gerald L. Shargel, Spero's lawyer, who is widely
credited with devising the home-as-jail. ``Unless you put someone
in a dungeon and chain them to a wall and put tape around their
mouths, there's always the possibility of some kind of
communication being sent.''
</P>
<P>
   Spero, 70, is to go on trial in September on charges that he
ordered the deaths of four men while running what the government
has called a particularly vicious Bonanno family crew. He posted
$13.5 million in bail in May 1999 and for more than a year has been
awaiting his day in court inside his pleasant house on Edgegrove
Avenue with its airy parlor and cream-colored sofa set.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strange life, waking up in your own bedroom every morning
but feeling as though you were still in jail, he said one afternoon
last week. After all, videocameras are trained on every window and
door. Armed guards must be present when his daughter stops by.
There is a lovely pool in his small backyard, but he cannot use it.
The electronic bracelet he wears beneath a tube sock on his ankle
must not be submerged or removed.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the family complications, mainly revolving around
his live-in companion and her 26-year-old daughter, who also lives
in the house but cannot have boyfriends over or talk on the
telephone without sharing her innermost thoughts with the FBI. And,
of course, there are the challenges of living in such close
quarters with the private security guards who must accompany every
guest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cook for the guards all the time,'' said Spero's companion,
who asked that her name be withheld. ``One of them even gave me a
great recipe for stuffed escarole the other day,'' she said, over a
lunch of cheese cubes and turkey wraps.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it's all that easy, she added. ``The worst is when the
agents come over to search the house at random. I'm always
thinking, `Oh God, are the beds made? Is everything clean?' I mean,
you've got strangers walking through your home.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Spero was quick to insist that he is overjoyed to
be out of jail. He gets to see his grandchildren. He gets to eat a
sausage and pepper sandwich at any hour. He gets to sleep on a real
bed, not some back-breaking cot.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you can watch TV whenever you want when you're at home,''
he said as the Mets game blared from a nearby set. `` 'Cause when
you're in jail, they're the ones that control the switch.''
</P>
<P>
   This version of house arrest is generally reserved for
defendants charged with violent crimes or accused of having
tampered with witnesses or juries in the past. Under federal law,
defendants who apply for it must convince a judge of two things:
that they pose no danger to their communities and that they will
return to court on their appointed day.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, putting up a healthy sum of money will do the
job, but, in a handful of recent cases, high-profile mobsters have
had to subject themselves to considerably more.
</P>
<P>
   The first of these was John A. Gotti, the son of John J. Gotti,
the imprisoned Gambino family boss. The younger Gotti was freed
from jail in October 1998 after he secured his release with $10
million and oaths to wear an electronic bracelet that tracked his
every move, to allow his phones to be monitored by the FBI and to
permit a guard to be posted outside his home in Oyster Bay.
</P>
<P>
   At the detention hearings in the case, federal prosecutors
argued, among other things, that Gotti should not be released
simply because he could afford the cost of his circumscribed
freedom. Why, they asked, should a rich defendant be granted house
arrest but a poor defendant be denied?
</P>
<P>
   Shargel, who represented Gotti in the case, countered that a
defendant's pockets _ no matter how shallow or deep _ should never
be used against him. If a poor man cannot afford to outfit his
house like Rikers Island, he argued, it doesn't mean that a rich
man should be penalized just because he can.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has no centralized office that tracks
defendants who ask for and are granted highly restricted house
arrest, but, as it turns out, most do have vast resources. Some are
like Chris Paciello, a wealthy Miami nightclub entrepreneur accused
of robbery and murder, who is living under lock and key just miles
from Spero's home. Others are like Carmine Agnello, the elder
Gotti's son-in-law, who was charged with arson and extortion but
was denied bail in June even though he offered to transform his $4
million Long Island home into a comfortable sort of jail.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge who rejected Agnello's application, Nina Gershon
of U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, does not like the idea that the
rich can buy a more comfortable jail. She wrote in her order that
suspects should not be free simply because they are ``able to pay
the cost of extravagant release conditions.'' Yet legal experts say
that it would be unconstitutional to deny bail automatically to
every racketeering suspect. So the home-as-jail may be the only
option for prosecutors looking to prevent a suspect from fleeing
the country or committing more crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Spero is spending a good deal of money on house arrest, his
lawyers said, though nowhere near the $20,000 a month that the
young Gotti paid. In fact, Spero hardly thinks about the money. He
is wrapped up in more quotidian concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cleared it with the government that Anthony could take the
garbage out,'' his companion said as she showed a visitor around
the house. ``But he's always saying he can't do it. He's not
allowed past the driveway. The electronic bracelet is to blame.''

NEW AND NOTEWORTHY MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `ALICE AND MARTIN,' starring Juliet Binoche and Alexis Loret.
Directed by Andre Techine (R, 123 minutes). Techine's sprawling,
emotional love story is the kind of movie that makes you work a
little. It takes time to figure out the relationships among the
characters, to say nothing of their motives and feelings. But like
so many of Techine's movies, ``Alice and Martin'' repays the
effort. The unlikely, complicated passion between Martin, the
troubled illegitimate son of a wealthy industrialist, and Alice, a
brittle violinist, unfolds against an equally complicated and
sometimes overcrowded background of family secrets and shifting
domestic alliances. Binoche and Loret are superb in the title roles
(A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `BUTTERFLY,' starring Fernando Fernan Gomez and Manuel Lozano.
Directed by Jose Luis Cuerda (R, 96 minutes). This gentle,
devastating film, based on short stories by the Spanish writer
Manuel Rivas, tells the story of Moncho (Lozano), a sensitive young
boy coming of age in the months before the outbreak of the Spanish
Civil War. The movie touches on the usual excitements and mysteries
of childhood, but Moncho's relationship with his teacher, the
proudly Republican Don Gregorio, beautifully played by Fernan
Gomez, gives the story an unusual degree of pathos and political
complexity (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `CHICKEN RUN,' with the voices of Mel Gibson, Miranda Richardson
and Julia Sawalha. Directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park (G, 86
minutes). The first full-length feature from Aardman Animation is
immensely satisfying, a divinely relaxed and confident film that
credits youngsters' interest in a cartoon more substantial than the
standard bland musical. The movie employs modeled latex figures to
tell the story of a group of chickens desperate to escape from a
chicken farm before they are turned into pies. Park, who also
directed the fabulous Wallace and Gromit shorts, transfers all of
the deftness and imagination of his shorter films into an artful
big-screen realization. And this briskly paced epic uses Lord's
continuing satirical take on British modesty and balmy superiority.
``Chicken Run'' parodies cultural touchstones from ``Stalag 17'' to
``Star Trek'' to the loose-cannon heroics of Gibson, the voice of
Rocky, the matinee-idol flying rooster who is asked to teach the
hens to fly. Finally it shows that the hens can save themselves
through the pluck of Ginger (Sawalha) and doesn't make a big deal
of this. It's a great eggscape from banality (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `CHUCK AND BUCK,' starring Chris Weitz and Mike White. Directed
by Miguel Arteta (R, 95 minutes). At the center of Arteta's funny,
creepy and poignant new film is Buck, a 27-year-old man who
inhabits the mental world of a preadolescent boy. As played by
White, who also wrote the screenplay, Buck is needy and sensitive,
an object equally of sympathy and revulsion. The film chronicles
his attempt to rekindle his childhood bond with his old friend
Charlie (Weitz), who has grown into a distant, self-absorbed
careerist. Arteta's visual sense, White's insightful script and
strong supporting performances from Weitz and his brother Sam, as
well as from Lupe Ontiveros as a kindly theater manager, make this
one of the most unusual and affecting coming-of-age stories in some
time. ``Chuck and Buck'' is an antidote to the current epidemic of
lazy nostalgia for the innocence of childhood and therefore,
magically, one of the few truly grown-up movies you're likely to
see this year (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `DISNEY'S `THE KID,'' starring Bruce Willis, Spencer Breslin,
Emily Mortimer, Lily Tomlin and Jean Smart. Directed by Jon
Turteltaub (PG, 101 minutes). In this cloying throwback to Disney's
modest live-action comedies of old, Willis plays a smarmy image
consultant humanized by his encounter with his 8-year-old self
(Spencer Breslin), who arrives in Los Angeles via a toy red prop
plane. By rights the movie should be dreadful, and it is thick with
therapeutic cliches, but it occasionally soars to heights of not
bad, thanks to strong performances from Willis, Tomlin and Smart,
and to Audrey Wells' surprisingly clever script (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE,' directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy
Barbato (PG-13, 79 minutes). Tammy Faye Bakker Messner, the former
wife of Jim Bakker, is that most American of stories, a figure of
tragedy and a joke. This documentary walks us through her life, a
veritable catalog of bad marriages, lost televangelist empires,
squandered relationships with children and, despite it all,
indomitable optimism. ``The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' cries out for a
little more analysis of its subject. Instead, it joyfully wallows
in the backdraft of her excesses. The directors are awfully quick
to forgive Messner's lack of self-awareness, possibly because she
has a heart as big as her hair. She was one of the first in the
televangelist crowd to accept gay men with AIDS. The movie makes a
case for her because she's a survivor; it's more of a mash note
than a formal documentary, and there's nothing wrong with that
(Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `GROOVE,' starring Hamish Linklater, Lola Glaudini, Mackenzie
Firgens and Steve Van Wormer. Directed by Greg Harrison (R, 86
minutes). If you're nostalgic for chasing down a rave gig across
the city and arriving to find a pair of 16-year-olds discussing the
merits of drum and bass versus jungle, then this mostly knowing and
funny comedy is just the film for you. Even if you're not, its
seductive lack of pretension will win you over. ``Groove'' is a
comedy of moments, tracking a crowd through the ups and downs of
one night of pleasure at a rave. Harrison and his team don't try to
pretend that raves are anything new or dangerous. Rather, they're
an entrenched circuit with specific tribal complications, and this
genial picture captures them (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `LOSER,' starring Jason Biggs, Mena Suvari and Greg Kinnear.
Directed by Amy Heckerling (PG-13, 93 minutes). Admirers of
Heckerling's movies _ notably ``Clueless'' and ``Fast Times at
Ridgmont High'' _ may be disappointed in her latest effort, a
romantic comedy about two college students who overcome the
snobbery and cruelty of their surroundings to find true love. The
script could have used a few more drafts and a less perfunctory
climax, but Heckerling's characteristic wit and intelligence are
still in evidence. Fine performances by Biggs as the title
character, Suvari as the girl of his dreams and Kinnear as a sleazy
literature professor help make ``Loser'' more enjoyable than most
recent youth-targeted date movies (Scott).

   Meanwhile, New York magazine says that designer  &UR; Randolph &LR; 
 &UR; Duke &LR;  threw such an exclusive party at his estate in the Hamptons
recently that he had the invitation printed in ink that disappeared

   After her death, in 1973 in Santa Cruz,  &UR; Bart Wilson &LR;  was hired

Wilson happened to have studied art history at school, and refused
to comply. Eventually, the paintings were entrusted to his

 UNDATED: movies (Scott).  
<TEXT>
<P>
   `ME, MYSELF AND IRENE,' starring Jim Carrey, Renee Zellweger and
Robert Forster. Directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly (R,
100 minutes). If ``There's Something About Mary'' offended you with
its callous mockery of hair and pet care and its whimsical views of
stalking and serial killing, then this latest festival of vulgarity
from the Farrelly brothers will make you miserable. But ``Me,
Myself and Irene'' shares with their earlier movies a kind of dopey
boyish sincerity and a good-natured sympathy for the underdog that
may prove capable of winning over even the dourest spirits. Carrey,
in one _ or is it two? _ of his most charming and repellent
performances, plays a Rhode Island state trooper with a split
personality and a giant crush on Irene, played with winning moxie
and plausible bewilderment by Zellweger (Scott).

Janet Jackson. Directed by Peter Segal (PG-13, 105 minutes). In
this sequel, Murphy again displays enough agility to show that he
deserves to be taken seriously. Parts of the film, a variation on
the Jekyll and Hyde story, are tremendously funny. Every single
scene in which Murphy, hidden away under millions of dollars' worth
of transformative makeup, plays all the members of the Klump family
_ all of them together in some scenes _ will knock the blues right
out of you. But some of the cheap laughs to which the picture
stoops will give you the blues. This makes ``Nutty Professor II''
half a movie at best. The broad humor at times derails Murphy's
performances, but the film provides a vehicle for him to display
his reach (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE PATRIOT,' starring Mel Gibson and Chris Cooper. Directed by
Roland Emmerich (R, 158 minutes). A grueling Revolutionary War epic
that, at more than 2 1/2 hours, seems to take place in real time.
The brutality and sentimentality are effective, though the film
will leave you feeling used as you exit the theater. This sort-of
prequel to Emmerich's ``Independence Day'' stars Gibson as a gentle
farmer who leads the Colonies in wresting freedom from the Brits,
using counterintuitive methods alarmingly similar to terrorism. His
anguished masculinity is brandished like a musket. The film's chief
asset is his relationship with the young actors playing his
children; it draws on the actor's real-life feeling about his own
large brood, and his work with them is stirring (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE PERFECT STORM,' starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg,
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, John C. Reilly and Diane Lane.
Directed by Wolfgang Petersen (PG-13, 130 minutes). Impressive but
monotonously redundant special effects smother the human drama in
this true story (adapted from Sebastian Junger's best-selling book)
of a group of swordfishermen battling ``the storm of the century''
off Massachusetts in 1991. Clooney is the ship's glowering,
enigmatic captain, and Wahlberg and Lane are the appealing
lovebirds who lend the movie its stingy quotient of warmth. The
early scenes, which paint a romantic portrait of the fisherman's
life in Gloucester, Mass., promise a great deal, but the movie
becomes waterlogged once it leaves shore (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `SCARY MOVIE,' starring Jon Abrahams, Carmen Electra and Shannon
Elizabeth. Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans (R, 88 minutes). Wayans'
latest genre-film spoof doesn't so much lampoon the ``Scream''
movies as offer the latest remake, this time as gross-out comedy.
``Scary Movie'' abounds in crude, often stale jokes involving male
genitals, female pubic hair, flatulence and dismemberment. There
are a few hilarious moments, and some that will provoke guilty
laughter, but Wayans hasn't quite figured out how to parody movies
_ like the wildly popular ``Scream'' series _ that already parody
themselves (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `SUNSHINE,' starring Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Jennifer Ehle,
Rosemary Harris and James Frian. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 180
minutes). In Szabo's tale of 20th-century Hungarian history,
Fiennes plays three members of a wealthy Jewish Budapest family _
grandfather, father and son _ who endure the corruption of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire, the viciousness of Fascism and the
brutality of Communism. Fiennes' performances and those of Ehle and
Harris (playing the same character at different stages of life)
help save the film from melodramatic excess. Even though much of
the story is crudely told, ``Sunshine'' is a serious, humane and
thought-provoking attempt to make sense of complicated and painful
historical experiences (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `WHAT LIES BENEATH,' starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison
Ford. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (PG-13, 130 minutes). Zemeckis'
film takes its time in laying out the story of high-strung Claire
(Pfeiffer), who is dissolving into hysteria on a regular basis. Her
daughter has just gone off to college, and Claire is still
recovering from the trauma of a car accident. Then her house starts
showing signs of being haunted. Her husband, Norman (Ford), is a
driven research scientist with a secret. This thriller is as
implausibly chilling as any ``X Files'' episode. By the last 10
minutes, your interest will have long vanished (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE WIND WILL CARRY US,' starring Behzad Dourani. Directed by
Abbas Kiarostami (not rated, 118 minutes). The latest film by the
Iranian director _ widely considered one of the greatest living
filmmakers _ is oblique, evocative and visually stunning.
Kiarostami's views of hillsides, valleys and gnarled, solitary
trees seem almost otherworldly in their clarity and depth, and his
story, about a morose engineer who has come to a remote Kurdish
village on an enigmatic mission, is as simple and mysterious as a
folk tale. This is one of those rare movies that completely absorb
your attention _ and demand your concentration _ while you're
watching, and that stay in your thoughts, growing richer and more
powerful, for a long time afterward (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `X-MEN,' starring Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman,
Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Halle Berry and Anna Paquin. Directed
by Bryan Singer (PG-13, 105 minutes). The long-awaited arrival of
Marvel Comics' do-gooder mutants is mildly fun on a couple of
levels: for one, the acting duel between Stewart (as the mutant
telepath Professor X, the X-Men's leader) and Ian McKellen (as the
mutant nemesis Magneto, who possesses the power of supermagnetism).
As these two austere hams trill their vowels at each other you get
the feeling you really are watching members of another species in
action. And Jackman scores as the two-fisted, confrontational
Wolverine, a mutant with superstrength, an ability to heal all
wounds and metal-alloy claws that shoot out from his knuckles. He
lives to fight, a boisterous tragic hero with no complications.
Otherwise the movie is an earnest affair that is clumsy when it
should be light on its feet; it takes itself even more seriously
than the comic book does, though its fans may be overjoyed by that
devotion (Mitchell).

COLUMN: BULL MARKET MULTIPLIER: A LITTLE REVENUE WENT A LONG WAY
</HEADLINE>
  By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bull markets may not cause companies to fiddle with
their books, but they certainly increase the rewards to be gained
from creative accounting.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of the Unify Corp., which this week put its
two top officials on leave and said that its revenue for the last
fiscal year, and perhaps the one before that, had been overstated.
The company's board has begun an investigation, and trading in its
shares has been halted.
</P>
<P>
   Details are skimpy. Even if you assume that the board's audit
committee is right that the company reported revenue that it should
not have, there is no way to know how it happened or the amounts
involved.
</P>
<P>
   One fact is obvious, however: The amounts involved were
minuscule compared with the market value the company attained. For
the 15 months ending in January, Unify reported revenue of $45
million, of which $20 million came from its Internet-related
products, software that helps companies integrate their basic
businesses with their Internet sites. It was the Internet business
that impressed investors, who saw rapid growth and valued the
company on the assumption that it would continue.
</P>
<P>
   Unify's market value rose from $25 million at the end of October
1998 to a peak of $750 million last December.
</P>
<P>
   Some, probably most, of that Internet-related revenue was real.
So, the overstatement, if there was one, is likely to turn out to
be a fraction of the $20 million. But the excitement that small
amount helped to produce sent the stock soaring. Insiders got $10
million by selling shares that had been worth barely $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   All of this illustrates the pressures companies face in a bull
market. Numbers that indicated that growth was slowing would have
been devastating.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than the revenue and the accompanying profits that
made Unify a shooting star. The Internet mania helped, as did Unify
announcements, just as the Linux mini-boom was starting last year,
that it was offering Linux-compatible products. But Unify wouldn't
have moved without good numbers, and it delivered them.
</P>
<P>
   Unify's stock had already tanked before the bad news came out
this week. That reflected both the decline of Internet infatuation
and concerns over a heart attack that forced the chief executive,
Reza Mikailli, to take a medical leave in June. Whether rumors had
spread regarding accounting issues is not clear.
</P>
<P>
   The company's announcement that the audit committee believed
revenue figures had been inflated in the fiscal year that ended in
April, and perhaps in the one before that, came just as the audit
was being completed by Deloitte &AMP; Touche. It would be nice if it
turned out that the auditors had uncovered the problem and taken
the matter to the audit committee. Neither Deloitte nor the company
would discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Mikailli and Gary Pado, the chief financial officer, have been
placed on administrative leave while the investigation proceeds.
Both were heavy sellers of stock, a fact that the Securities and
Exchange Commission will no doubt wish to discuss with them if the
investigation indicates that they knew the accounting was faulty.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known if the Unify board suspects fraud or just thinks
the company misapplied complicated accounting rules. What is known
is that the greatest bull market in American history provided
phenomenal rewards to companies that investors believed were
growing rapidly. The temptation was there.

JUDY CHICAGO: GOOD CHEER AND THE HUMANIST VALUES, ALL RENDERED IN
CLICHES 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEN JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Judy Chicago's ``Resolutions: A Stitch in Time,'' an
installation at the American Craft Museum, is an excellent
candidate for worst New York museum show of the year. Chicago's
first solo venture in New York since 1987 and first museum show
since her famous ``Dinner Party'' installation was exhibited at the
Brooklyn Museum 20 years ago, this show is aesthetically vacuous,
conceptually inane and morally disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The Dinner Party,'' a vast, triangular table with place
settings designed to memorialize great women of the past,
``Resolutions'' is the product of collaboration between Chicago and
a group of craftswomen. This time it is mainly a picture show, and
the focus has expanded to embrace a whole basket of liberal,
humanist values. The spirit, unlike that of, say, Barbara Kruger,
is not adversarial; rather, the mood is weirdly cheerful, like a
visual art version of Up With People. The 19 easel-size
compositions look like posters produced by a group of unimaginative
but eager-to-please high school students for a small-town community
center.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures are arranged in seven thematic groups: Family,
Responsibility, Conservation, Tolerance, Human Rights, Hope and
Change. Each combines a familiar verbal slogan and a bland,
cartoonish illustration that calls to mind the deliberately generic
style of Mark Kostabi but without any of his mordant cleverness. In
the Family category, we have ``The hands that rock the cradle shape
the world,'' with two mothers flanking a baby in a cradle; the
image of a proud graduate in cap and gown rises up behind them like
a prophetic dream. In Tolerance we have wolves and sheep reaching
out to each other in peace and the slogan ``Live and let live.''
And Hope offers ``Hitch your wagon to a star,'' with the image of a
family of hopeful African-Americans driving an old wooden wagon
within the decorative framework of a star.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that makes these works at all worth looking at is
the embellishment added by Chicago's collaborators. For each piece,
a woman skilled in some form of needlework enhanced Chicago's drawn
and painted design through embroidery, needlepoint, macrame, petit
point, applique, quilting or some other technique. At best, as in
``Home Sweet Home,'' in which all sorts of dwellings _ an igloo, a
teepee, a wood-framed house, a high-rise apartment building _
encircle a globe, embroidery by Pamella Nesbit gives the otherwise
vapid picture a satiny, jewel-like richness. (In a sidebar to the
exhibition proper, a series of didactic text panels describes the
various techniques used and includes enthusiastic comments from
each of the collaborators.)
</P>
<P>
   The installation is set up as a spiral, the sequence of pictures
ultimately leading to a life-size statue with a beige plastic
surface. The figure is bald and has abstracted features, but its
conical, dresslike lower half suggests it is female. She holds out
muscular maternal arms and has an embroidered valentine heart
embedded in her chest, gold at the center with a purple and red
halo. Colorful embroidery spirals up around her dress parallel to
words in different languages routed into the surface. In English
the words say, ``Find it in your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's project is not, after all, without a coherent and even
audacious vision. Almost always when modern art has addressed
social issues, it has done so negatively from the point of view of
the romantically alienated individual, seldom offering an image or
a program to inspire communities of optimism and good will. Against
this background it may be radical to promote a message of love,
peace and understanding, and to do so through collaboration with
nonartists using popular crafts.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to imagine an intelligent viewer taking seriously
the bromides asserted by Chicago's glorified posters. Of course,
she knows she is dealing with cliches, and part of her purpose is
to bring back to life certain basic human values that
Postmodern-style irony has lost sight of. Nothing she does,
however, gives exhortations like ``Get into the swing of things''
or ``Do a good turn'' any social, political or moral urgency. You
have to wonder whether Chicago herself really believes in these
sentiments. There is a feeling of condescension, like that of an
insensitive schoolteacher talking down to children.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the feminism. Though not specifically feminist
in its general aims, the ``Resolutions'' project emerges from the
same feminist thinking that gave rise to ``The Dinner Party'':
against patriarchal privileging of high art and masculine genius it
pits domestic, traditionally female crafts and shared labor (with
Chicago nevertheless receiving star billing). Nonhierarchical,
cooperative and noncompetitive effort is put forth as the way to
make a better world.
</P>
<P>
   Some people may still like this 1970s-style feminism, while
others will find it old-fashioned and naive. In any event, the
actual dispiriting experience of the ``Resolutions'' project does
not make a good case for the theory's practical viability.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago Chicago made some beautiful airbrushed mandala
paintings, and some of the dishes she designed for ``The Dinner
Party,'' whether or not you liked the gynecological iconography,
were seductively lush. But her messianic ambitions have taken her
far beyond the limits of her real artistic competence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resolutions: A Stitch in Time'' will remain at the American
Craft Museum, 40 W. 53rd St., (212) 956-3535, through Sept. 3. &QL;

   SOUTHERNERS-BADRAP _ A study out of Texas says people with

Southerners were viewed as dumb, got low marks and were put in jobs
where they had little contact with the public or customers.

ART REVIEW: AN ICONOCLAST TO WHOM THE PERSONAL IS ALWAYS
POLITICAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Exhibition notes at end of review.) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you happen to be on basically OK terms with the
world, meaning that the world is doing all right by you, the alert,
irritated, combative work of the American artist Martha Rosler may
not be your cup of tea.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you find yourself nagged by a few social
questions that just won't go away _ like, why the ``haves'' have so
much, or why race and class dictate where people live and how they
die _ then her art of ideas-that-lead-to-actions is well worth
getting to know.
</P>
<P>
   There's no better chance to make its acquaintance than in
``Martha Rosler: Positions in the Life World,'' a career
retrospective of more than 30 years that is also the artist's first
major museum show and is divided between the New Museum of
Contemporary Art in Soho and the International Center of
Photography on the Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the split in venues and Rosler's long-standing habit of
dividing her energies among several media at once, the show is of a
piece. It is crowded, garrulous, agitated and funny _ the subway
ride uptown from the New Museum feels like an extension of it _ and
all but inseparable from the urban landscape that is Rosler's
native milieu.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Brooklyn and went to school there in the 1950s
and '60s, first to a yeshiva, then to Brooklyn College, where she
earned a degree in English and studied art with Ad Reinhardt. She
painted in an Abstract Expressionist vein but also took photographs
of city streets, inspired partly by socially conscious artists like
Walter Rosenblum, who was teaching in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important _ Rosler says so in the show's excellent
catalog, which was edited by Catherine de Zegher and looks like a
textbook, right down to the scuff-proof binding _ was her youthful
involvement in New York's experimental poetry scene, then in the
middle of the so-called mimeograph revolution. From this, one
guesses, she learned how art could be produced outside both the
market and academia, and she got a sense of the loaded, slippery
power of language, which plays a crucial role in her work.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to California to study linguistics in 1968, a
mind-boggling moment in American culture, equally idealistic and
bummed out. Rosler became involved in the peace movement and
feminism. She abandoned painting for other forms, to which she
brought two very American attitudes: a candid,
hey-what's-going-on-here moral brashness and a TV-generation sense
of the absurd.
</P>
<P>
   The multifarious art that resulted was based on some simple
guidelines. Aware of the co-opting power of the market, she chose
mediums that were either ephemeral (installation, performance) or
easily reproduced and distributed (video, photography). She also
opted out of developing a signature style, a decision that makes
her retrospective, organized by Elizabeth A. Macgregor of the Ikon
Gallery in Birmingham, England, and Sabine Breitwieser of the
Generali Foundation in Vienna, look less like a solo exhibition
than a lively collaborative effort.
</P>
<P>
   The show mixes all kinds of things together, with the bulk of
photography and video uptown and the large-scale installations at
the New Museum. The installations are Rosler's most didactic works,
and she continues to produce them. Each has homed in on a specific
topic _ atomic weapon production in the United States, the military
dictatorship in Chile _ and fleshes it out with a wealth of
research materials: news clips, maps and political documents
attached directly to the gallery wall or available in handouts.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a total immersion in concentrated information,
though one with little visual allure. This may not have been a
problem in the alternative spaces for which some of these
installations were originally created. But in museums _
institutions that prefer seductive objects, foster short attention
spans and have a temperamental intolerance for most conceptually
based art _ it is. On two visits, I saw people giving text collages
only the briefest scan before moving on, which is too bad: the
daily news, Rosler's greatest resource, is the weirdest, saddest,
scariest story ever told.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, people did linger over the installation titled
``Monumental Garage Sale,'' which fills the museum's basement
gallery. First presented in 1973, it's just what it says it is: a
sprawling cash-and carry bazaar of the castoff contents of
innumerable household attics and closets, including the artist's
own. (Everything is for sale, cheap. The proceeds will go to a
local charity.)
</P>
<P>
   Although it's not apparent at first, the items have been
carefully arranged. The ``best,'' most attractive objects are at
the front of the room, while at the back, which is dimly lighted,
one finds a stash of odd, disconcerting things: old underwear,
soft-core pornography, family snapshots and other abject,
embarrassing, unpresentable items; their presence undermines the
fragile barrier between private and public space, home and the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The intersection of these spheres _ the personal and the
political is another way to define them _ is at the core of much of
Rosler's most trenchant and innovative work, beginning with two
interrelated series of photomontages, ``Bringing the War Home:
House Beautiful'' and ``Bringing the War Home: In Vietnam,'' at the
ICP.
</P>
<P>
   Both series were made between 1967 and 1972, and each combines
images lifted from popular magazines: interiors from House
Beautiful and Vietnam combat pictures from Life. In one montage, a
wounded Southeast Asian child limps, as if dazed, through a chic
modern living room; in another, a suburban picture window looks out
on a battlefield. Rosler designed all the work for reproduction in
alternative journals, not for gallery display.
</P>
<P>
   She uses the same cut-and-paste technique in the feminist series
``Beauty Knows No Pain, or Body Beautiful'' (1966-72), at the New
Museum. Here she packs female body parts snipped from Playboy
magazines into ads for top-of-the-line refrigerators. She makes the
sex-sells strategy of lingerie ads explicit by pasting in genitals
and breasts, and in the piece ``Untitled (Cargo Cult)'' (1974), she
shows faces of fashion models being crated for shipping: a Western
ideal of beauty sent abroad.

 NEW YORK: sent abroad.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite her self-description as a ``ham-fisted'' artist with an
anti-style, anti-mastery aesthetic, Rosler's photomontages are full
of subtle touches. In one of the war series, a skeletal Giacometti
sculpture, an icon of 1950s existentialist despair, seems to be
striding out of the living room into the battle beyond. And in a
``Body Beautiful'' piece about domestic entrapment, one finds,
hanging on a hallway wall, a Robert Indiana poster for Virgil
Thomson's opera ``The Mother of Us All,'' which is based on the
life of Susan B. Anthony and has a libretto by Gertrude Stein.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere does Rosler tackle feminist themes with more imaginative
panache than in her videos, several of which are on continuous view
in a gallery at the International Center of Photography. One of the
earliest is ``Semiotics of the Kitchen'' (1975), a deadpan cross
between a Julia Childs demonstration and a ``Saturday Night Live''
skit, with the artist dressed in an apron and robotically wielding
cooking utensils as if they were weapons. It's six minutes long and
it's great.
</P>
<P>
   A piece like this, widely influential over the last 25 years,
has naturally begun to acquire a period feel. After all, it emerged
from a time when feminist art and the video medium were both in a
start-up phase. A text-and-photo installation completed at the same
time, however, looks as fresh today as when it was made and seems
to point the way to what Rosler is doing now.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``The Bowery in Two Inadequate Descriptive Systems''
(1974-75), it is composed of black-and-white unpeopled shots of
Manhattan's skid row, alternating with typed lists of slang words
for drunkenness. Simple as it sounds, it has a lot going on. The
piece is historically erudite, with its references to Minimalist
grids and the American tradition of Social Realist photography. The
single words in irregular stacks have the abstract insistence of
concrete poetry but also interact with the words on shop signs and
liquor bottles in the pictures. The themes are ones this artist has
dealt with repeatedly: consumption and its hazards, and the
intersection of private and public in social space. For many Bowery
residents, the doorways Rosler photographed were home.
</P>
<P>
   But far from nailing down a hard-and-fast message, the piece
stays oblique, suggestive, open-ended. The same is true of the most
recent photographs, a series of color images of shop windows and
street posters titled ``Transitions and Digressions'' (1997). All
the elements that have fascinated Rosler for decades are here _ the
female body, language, absurdist comedy and the economics of
acquisition _ but are given a haunted, poetic resonance.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Rosler has sustained her political focus and pushed
her art ahead, neither of which is easy. This doesn't make her a
prime candidate for mainstream stardom. True, she's joined a New
York gallery (Gorney, Bravin &AMP; Lee in Chelsea), a move she resisted
for decades. But most of her work will probably still have little
to say to the viewer for whom taste, style and beauty are the
essential building blocks of art.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably fine with Rosler, who, one suspects, has an
opinion or two about the present New York scene, with its big
bucks, big spaces and slightly desperate glamour fixations. (Check
out her 1978 deconstruction of the fashion industry in the video
``Martha Rosler Reads Vogue.'') At the same time, this mid-career
summary coincides with a diffuse, anything-can-happen interlude of
germination in contemporary art, one in which her practical and
deeply skeptical utopianism has an important place.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Martha Rosler: Positions in the Life World'' is on view at the
New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street,
Soho, (212) 219-1222, through Oct. 8 and at the International
Center of Photography, Fifth Avenue at 94th Street, (212) 860-1777,

 &HT;    CONGRESS MEMBERS FIND A HOME NEAR THE HALL
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It took a village to convince Rep. Jack Kingston
to come to his party's national convention.
</P>
<P>
   The four-term Republican from Savannah, Ga., skipped the 1992
and 1996 GOP gatherings to be with his family. Politics already
kept him away from his wife and children more than he wanted, and
he disliked dragging them to events where they were stuck in hotel
rooms or receptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my kids couldn't have come, I wouldn't have either,''
Kingston said. He and his wife, Libby, have four children, ranging
in age from 17 to 10.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, the Kingstons are among more than 100
congressional families staying in a ``Congressional Village''
hastily assembled in a former naval shipyard about 1,000 yards from
the First Union Center, where the Republican National Convention is
being held.
</P>
<P>
   The housing is a far cry from the luxury hotels where many
delegates are lodged. The congressional families are staying in
former Navy barracks in the former shipyard, now owned by the city
of Philadelphia and leased to private industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment-like structures have kitchens and hardwood floors
and are ``adequate,'' said Kingston. Rep. George Nethercutt,
R-Wash., described them as ``nice but spartan'' to the Washington
Post.
</P>
<P>
   But the facility is extravagantly family-friendly. There's a
dining tent, a Ferris wheel, a swimming pool, pool tables, a
basketball court, a horseshoe pit, Ping-Pong tables, a volleyball
court and video games.
</P>
<P>
   Families can ride in a hot-air balloon, view Philadelphia by
helicopter, tour an old aircraft carrier or work out in a gym. They
ride loaned bikes around the secured 1,200-acre facility.
</P>
<P>
   The site is guarded and off limits to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Since the village is within sight of the convention hall,
members avoid long commutes from hotels and spend more time with
their families. It's about a five-minute walk from to the
convention hall, but official GOP shuttle buses take twice that
long of security checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things about today's Congress ... is that most
House members with families commute to Washington'' while their
families live in the home districts, said Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get to know each other's families,'' said Kingston.
``Now I see my 12-year-old playing with Dave Weldon's
13-year-old.'' Weldon is a Republican congressman from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The village was arranged by Pennsylvania Reps. Curt Weldon, a
Republican, and Robert Brady, a Democrat. Local volunteers provide
village services, and contributors ranging from defense contractors
to a swimming pool company set up the facilities. Each lawmaker
made a token $250 contribution to the city. The arrangement was
cleared by the House ethics committee.
</P>
<P>
   The set-up has stirred controversy _ not because of the bargain
housing, but because Weldon arranged for the Pentagon to display
some high-tech weaponry at the shipyard. Weldon chairs the House
Armed Forces subcommittee on research and development.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is not supposed to be involved in partisan
politics. Weldon and Defense Secretary William Cohen responded to
criticism by describing the display as educational and well away
from the political business of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the village, there has been an assortment of parties for
members and visiting delegates. The fare has ranged from Philly
cheesesteaks to Cajun food brought in for a Mardi Gras gala
sponsored by Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La.
</P>
<P>
   Although his lodging has a kitchen, Kingston said, it hasn't
been used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently food and politics go together,'' he said. ``There's
no such thing as starving at a convention.''

THE AMERICAN PANORAMA AS DONATED TO SMITH COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   By JOHN RUSSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In high summer, when pleasure is at the prow, people
who love looking at pictures often remember the art museum at Smith
College in Northampton, Mass. Not only is the collection quite
remarkable in itself, but it represents a collective effort over
many generations by the faculty of the college, by the successive
directors of the museum and by discerning, devoted and
strong-minded alumnae.
</P>
<P>
   These three elements make a formidable combination. Anyone who
studies the catalog of the collection will find that it is very
difficult to guess at what age the donor in question came forward
with this or that gift. The museum has never hewn to any specific
line in the development of art. As the 21st century dawns, it is as
alert to the multicultural input of Betye Saar and Jaune
Quick-to-See-Smith as its founders were to the granitic severity
that John Singleton Copley, in the 1770s, could give to the
features of the Honorable John Erving, who had arrived in America
as nobody and ended as one of the most powerful men in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It is unfortunate, then, that the museum will be closed ``for
renovation and expansion'' until 2002. The good news for New
Yorkers, however, is that 74 of its paintings and sculptures are
now on loan to the National Academy of Design museum in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The Smith College Museum of Art cuts a swath of some 250 years
in American art, and here and there in the show at the National
Academy there is something particularly enticing. One such work is
Edward Hopper's ``Pretty Penny,'' painted in 1939. It was given to
the museum in 1964 by the actress Helen Hayes, who received an
honorary doctorate from Smith in 1940. As is well known, Hopper was
not one to seek out the brighter side of American life. Nor did he
want to be commissioned to do portraits, whether of people or of
houses. He saw it as a moral duty to dwell on the darker side of
American architecture, and he was rather put out to be offered
$2,500 to paint Helen Hayes' house. This was tradesman's work, and
he had had enough of that in his earlier days.
</P>
<P>
   The Hayes house, in Nyack, N.Y., was joyous, carefree,
light-inviting and altogether out of sync with Hopper. He agreed to
go see it. But he and Hayes did not exactly hit it off. After his
visit, she said: ``I had never met a more misanthropic, grumpy,
grouchy individual in my life. He was like a big hellcat of anger
and resentment at the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But these problems were resolved when Hopper finally produced,
after careful preliminary drawings, a painting that is direct,
straightforward and almost ecstatic in its rendering of the Hayes
house. It looks like a real estate agent's dream. The famed
loneliness and alienation that so often permeated Hopper's
paintings of houses were banished, and all parties seem to have
been pleased with the result.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more inventive directors of the Smith College museum
was Henry-Russell Hitchcock. Though best known as an architectural
historian, Hitchcock was fascinated by paintings that happened to
tickle his fancy.
</P>
<P>
   One of these was Florine Stettheimer's portrait of Henry
McBride, an art critic who wrote for some of the best American
journals of the 1920s. The portrait is an anthology, and almost an
alphabet, of McBride's looks, tastes and activities. When read
closely, it reveals itself as a true document of its times. It also
tells us why Marcel Duchamp organized a memorial retrospective for
Stettheimer at the Museum of Modern Art in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Exemplary as some of the museum directors have been, there is
something particularly loving and persistent about the patience
with which the alumnae of Smith College have helped to keep the
collection apart from its contemporaries in other places.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, too, a major artist has stepped in, as Frank Stella
did when he gave his ``Damascus Gate (Variation III)'' of 1969 to
the college. Ten feet high and 40 feet wide, it fulfills the wishes
and hopes of Smith's first president, L. Clark Seelye, who said in
July 1875 that he wanted every Smith student to have direct access
to ``the famous masterpieces.''
</P>
<P>
   When Seelye himself began to buy for the museum, he went
straight to what we now see as the top, with paintings by Thomas
Eakins (bought in 1879 for $100) and Albert Pinkham Ryder (bought,
probably, from Ryder himself).
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the college's art museum had some remarkable
directors over the last 125 years, but the level of gifts from
grateful alumnae has been consistently high as well. The collection
amounts, in fact, to a concise history of American art since 1880
that has been built up generation by generation.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there, a terrible poignancy strikes us among the Smith
College paintings on display at the National Academy. One of the
most haunting images in American painting is the ``Mourning
Picture'' by Edwin Romanzo Elmer (1850-1923). It is a family
portrait, with father, mother, a daughter who had died not long
before and a pet sheep against the backdrop of a house of which the
artist was clearly rather proud. When it was first shown in a post
office in 1890, the local paper said that `` Elmer is quite an
artist.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was not seen again until 1950, when the artist's niece
showed it to Hitchcock, who saw at once that it was an astonishing
achievement by an artist who had died unknown. From the moment that
Smith College acquired the painting, it made its way into one
magazine after another. Wherever it was shown, and not least in
Europe _ Frankfurt, Rotterdam, Munich, Brussels _ its elegiac power
was interpreted as expressly American. Familiar as it may now be in
reproduction, it has kept its secrets, and the delicacy of its
feelings, intact.
</P>
<P>
   The general tone of the show is, however, anything but elegiac.
There is Charles Sheeler's famous ``Rolling Power'' (1939), the
most glorious compliment ever paid in art to the steam locomotive
at the height of its power and importance.
</P>
<P>
   There is also Winslow Homer's ``Shipyard at Gloucester'' (1871),
which shows a fishing schooner on the stocks in its every least and
last detail. Nothing escaped Homer's eye in such matters, and we
can sense the prodigious speeds that these schooners could achieve.
It is in paintings like these that American art could ``accentuate
the positive'' and make us feel that in such a country anything was
possible.

THINGS WORKING OUT FOR BELICHICK, PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ Bill Belichick has worried all preseason that
the Patriots haven't gotten the most of their workouts. Prior to
this week the weather was not hot, humid, and physically taxing
enough. That has changed dramatically with muggy conditions at
Smithfield, R.I., Wednesday and equally clammy days in Canton,
Ohio, earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that Friday night's game is in the Silverdome,
which will house the Lions for two more seasons before the covered
Ford Field is ready in 2002, it is not air conditioned.
</P>
<P>
   While uncomfortable for the fans, it's perfect for Belichick,
who is trying to prevent comfort for his players.
</P>
<P>
   There are still a few Patriots who are a little overweight and
are being fined $151 per pound, per day for being over their
assigned weights. Collections of these fines (approaching the
$100,000 mark) could pay for the college education of Belichick's
children as they approach the $100,000 mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots made a strong opening statement against the 49ers,
but six of the 49ers' front seven were missing. Running back
Raymont Harris didn't have Ken Norton Jr. or Winfred Tubbs to avoid
on his way to 58 yards on nine carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll make some corrections from that game,'' said Belichick.
``We'll tell them they need to do better, how to improve and what
mistakes were made. Then, after Detroit, we need to solidify things
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lions should provide better competition, though their
outstanding defensive end, Robert Porcher _ who ended his contract
holdout Wednesday by signing a one-year deal for $4.253 million _
won't play, nor will starting quarterbck Charlie Batch, who is
recovering from a broken bone in his right leg. In his place, the
Patriots defense will look at 15-year veteram Mike Tomczak, who for
the moment is the starting quarterback on Opening Day, even though
he hasn't looked that great.
</P>
<P>
   Also out is defensive tackle Luther Elliss, who had knee surgery
Wednesday. Once again, the Patriots' young offensive line will go
up against at least two backup players in the Lions' starting unit.
</P>
<P>
   A stationary target, Tomczack could provide more ammunition for
pass rushers Willie McGinest and Chris Slade.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe will start at quarterback, but look for his
appearance to be slightly more than the one-series cameo he made
vs. the 49ers. Belichick said the rotation will be similar; Michael
Bishop relieves Bledsoe and rookie Tom Brady relieves Bishop. Brady
is returning to Michigan, where he starred in Ann Arbor, not far
from the Silverdome. Veteran John Friesz will get his first action
against the Redskins Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions have some problems in the secondary with free safety
Kurt Schultz gone after signing with Buffalo. Strong safety Ron
Rice is out with a shoulder separation, replaced by former Patriot
Corwin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   This is a pivotal game for some Patriots, because Belichick will
begin his evaluations. Since there's been so little time between
the first two games, Belichick has spent more time preparing than
evaluating. Some young members of the offensive line have caught
Belichick's eye, and that situation could potentially become
disruptive when his veteran starters return from injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far we've seen some good things, they're holding their
own,'' said Belichick. ``You have a veteran player who can perform
at a certain level and you have a younger player who isn't quite at
that level. You could see the younger player going to a higher
level. Those are decisions, and they are tough ones, that come up
every year and every coach and every team is going to be faced with
at some point in training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Things to watch:
</P>
<P>
   --Michael Bishop II: He loosened up after missing three wide-
open receivers early in his stint last week, but he's still the
show in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   --The running game: Raymont Harris has the opportunity to
distance himself from the rest of the backs with another strong
performance. J.R. Redmond practiced Wednesday, but he may be a week
away from playing. Kevin Faulk has also looked exciting as a
multi-purpose back.
</P>
<P>
   --Bledsoe: The Patriots have been filming Bledsoe extensively in
practice, focusing on his handoffs. Coaches may be trying to
improve his play-faking.
</P>
<P>
   --The linebackers: This unit is a little banged up. Tedy Bruschi
fractured a bone in his hand last Monday and is sporting a cast.
We'll see how much playing time he gets. While Ted Johnson
practiced Wednesday, it doesn't appear the veteran middle
linebacker, who has missed almost two weeks with a hamstring
injury, will suit up. The focus could be on young linebackers Marc
Megna, Casey Tisdale, and Maugaula Tuitele.
</P>
<P>
   --Brandon Mitchell, who has missed a lot of sessions with a
strained calf, may return on a limited basis. He should be a
starting defensive end and needs to have a big year to land a big
paycheck as an unrestricted free agent next season.
</P>
<P>
   --Tebucky Jones: You'll likely see more of him at free safety.
The Lions have a decent receiving corps, so this should be a good
test.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: NO, BUT I HEARD THE SOUNDTRACK

<TEXT>
<P>
   New movies come in on waves of hype and anticipation, followed,
if they're lucky, by swelling word of mouth. When the waves recede,
they leave behind something tangible: soundtrack albums. If summer
is a prime time for movie releases, it's also a good time to look
back over recent albums, some of which are better than the movies
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Soundtrack albums share a title with a movie, and they're often
marketed as souvenirs, a way to jog memories of a beloved story or
character before the video comes out. Those albums holding a
movie's instrumental score are released on the assumption that
people will want music they associate with, say, ``Titanic,'' to
accompany their own love stories.
</P>
<P>
   But for some time, soundtrack albums have been the epitome of a
multipurpose product. They are, ideally, not just a memento (and a
revenue source) but also an enjoyable experience in themselves, one
that may have little to do with the film. Many are collections of
potential hits. They can also be self-contained conceptual
statements, a repository for musical experiments, a showcase for
new talent or simply an excuse for a producer to compile a bunch of
favorite tunes.
</P>
<P>
   Once soundtrack composers were emotional stealth artists,
unheralded craftsmen who were determined to alter viewers'
perceptions without being noticed. In the silent era, music could
change at every performance, played by accompanists who quoted from
a stock of readymade tunes (and beginning a movie-music tradition
of borderline plagiarism). And while music was a central attraction
in pioneering sound films like ``The Jazz Singer,'' it was quickly
taken for granted, slipping into the background to lend tone and
subliminal structure to a film.
</P>
<P>
   Soundtracks became selfless, functional music, gracefully
finding an unheralded balance between musical imperatives and the
timing of scenes they accompanied. The scores weren't usually meant
to stand on their own, though composers as different as Bernard
Herrmann (who scored ``Psycho'') and Duke Ellington (``Anatomy of a
Murder'') turned their assignments into music that rewarded full
attention. Occasionally, instrumental themes like the ones from
``Exodus'' and ``Dr. Zhivago'' took on a second life as pop hits.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't lost on Hollywood, or the music business, that a
movie could turn a song with lyrics into a major hit, the way
``Blackboard Jungle'' boosted Bill Haley's ``Rock Around the
Clock'' in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Songs tucked into a soundtrack can pin down a historical era or
comment on characters' state of mind; they also promote the movie,
which promotes the songs, in a synergistic circle that has become
increasingly important as both recording companies and movie
studios seek blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally a soundtrack album can speak for movie characters,
conquer the pop charts and sum up an entire idiom, as the
``Saturday Night Fever'' album did for disco. And with the arrival
of music videos, every song became a potential soundtrack for its
own mini-movie.
</P>
<P>
   Soundtrack albums can be single-minded or wildly eclectic. They
test-market newcomers, and they often contain one-shots by
well-known musicians: songs that don't fit into a current album
project or that simply seemed like a good idea at the time. The
current crop of movie soundtracks includes old-fashioned orchestral
scores and pop compilations, hip-hop assortments and seamless
electronic dance music. Here's a guide to some of the soundtracks
released in recent months. (CDs range in price from $12.99 to
$18.99.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``ANY GIVEN SUNDAY'': (Warner Sunset/Atlantic). The soundtrack
album for ``Any Given Sunday,'' Oliver Stone's football film, is a
hodgepodge of 11 hip-hop tracks and five rock songs, all but one
previously unreleased. Yet it turns out to be surprisingly
cohesive, perhaps because both hip-hop and athletics depend on
merciless competition. Over somber, unhurried, minor-key vamps,
most of the rappers consider the aftermath of success in a man's
world: pressure, egomania, shattered friendships, constant
challenges. L.L. Cool J.'s ``Shut 'Em Down'' dispatches his rivals
with speed, amusement and a deliberately quiet confidence; Missy
Elliott's ``Who You Gonna Call,'' backed by orchestra and chorus,
warns that every winning streak ends; Mobb Deep insists that once
they're on top, they're ``Never Goin' Back.'' Meanwhile, Hole's
``Be a Man,'' a punky snarl in the face of machismo, is out of
place but too intransigent to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``ANYWHERE BUT HERE'': (Atlantic). Women sing about breaking
free on the ``Anywhere but Here'' soundtrack album, which is packed
with new songs. It starts out promisingly with K.D. Lang's nicely
retro theme song, full of ``doo-doo-doo'' backing vocals. From
there, the songs find places along a spectrum between country, pop
and nostalgia-tinged rock. But the concept turns into a
straitjacket. While individual songs from Patty Griffin, Sinead
Lohan, Poe, Kacy Crowley and Bif Naked have their merits, being
heard together makes them less effective. As song after song
describes starting a new life alone, the similarity of the lyrics
leads to diminishing returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE'': (So So Def/Sony). The producer,
songwriter and rapper Jermaine Dupri turns the ``Big Momma's
House'' soundtrack album into a showcase for Atlanta bounce:
stripped-down midtempo hip-hop built from chattering drum machines,
cooing female voices and a handful of melody notes. The rappers _
men, women and a boy named Lil Bow Wow _ boast about a good life of
fast cars and endless parties. The men have it easy, from the calm
arrogance of Dupri, Nas, R.O.C. and Kurupt to the happily lowbrow
details of Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz. The women rap or sing
about betrayal and gold-diggers or, in Kandi's ``What I'm Gon' Do
to You,'' calmly take revenge. There are a few ardent love songs,
too. But even the long-running battle of the sexes sounds
lighthearted.

<P>
   SEATTLE _ A few hours after yielding a walk-off, game-losing
homer to Mike Cameron, Jeff Fassero stood at his locker and got
dressed for the final game of the Red Sox western swing through
Oakland and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the makeshift nameplate atop the adjacent locker
that had ``Croushore'' scribbled in black magic marker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's that?,'' Fassero asked.
</P>
<P>
   He was informed that Rick Croushore was a pitcher acquired in
Boston's seven-player deal with the Rockies. He'd been called up to
replace Ramon Martinez, who'd been disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starter or reliever?,'' Fassero asked.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever he was told.
</P>
<P>
   No one saw the mysterious Croushore for a while. He apparently
arrived sometime during the night when Pedro Martinez was beating
the Mariners, 5-2, and saving the beleaguered Boston bullpen (18
scoreless innings Monday and Tuesday). After the game, Jimy
Williams said he hadn't seen Croushore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he here? I don't know,'' said the manager of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Red Sox clubhouse. It's quite the opposite of the
old Cheers Bar _ ``where everybody knows your name.'' The Sox
locker room in 2000 is where (itals)nobody knows your
name.(unitals) Not even some of your teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The team that returns from the 4-3 trip is not the same unit
that left town after losing two straight to the Twins. Fassero, who
pitched in relief Tuesday, starts Friday night in the first game of
a three-game Fenway set with the Royals and he'll be followed to
the mound by new starter Rolando Arrojo Saturday. Second baseman,
Mike Lansing, is another new face. Rico Brogna was picked up on
waivers Thursday. Meanwhile, Morgan Burkhart is back from the
minors and Croushore is expected to have his own nameplate at
Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's series features the much-anticipated return of
Jurassic Carl Everett, the multi-talented center fielder who Friday
night will serve the final game of his 10-game suspension. The Sox
are 4-5 since Everett began his punishment for bumping an umpire at
Fenway three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing well, no matter who goes down or goes out,'' said
shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who is hitting a torrid .393. ``We've
been playing hard and when Carl comes back, that'll be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Trot Nixon, who appears to be the new leadoff man while Jose
Offerman (bruised knee) serves time on the disabled list, said,
``We probably should have been 5-2 on that trip, but we couldn't
get a run across in that 19-inning (5-4 loss). But those were two
good teams we were playing. I think we're pretty happy. We're
getting closer to having Carl back. It may take him a couple of
games to adjust, but then again, he's so talented, he'll probably
do some damage from Day 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the stretch run now. There's no more saying,`Yeah,
plenty of games left.' We've got to play well and stay in position
to make our run. It's up for grabs in the AL East and the wild
card, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In a clubhouse that's already housed 46 players (the Sox record
is 55, set in the first-place season of 1995), Nixon and catcher
Jason Varitek are emerging as young leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek played all 19 innings behind the plate Tuesday, got to
sleep at 5 a.m., then went back to work Wednesday, catching
Martinez's nine-inning masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're playing good baseball without one of our key
hitters,'' said the catcher. ``To go out West and win the way we
did. Now we can come together and get on a good stretch and I like
our chances.''
</P>
<P>
   The schedule is not their friend. It's absurd to play seven
games in Oakland and Seattle, return to Fenway for three, then fly
to Anaheim for a three-game set that starts Monday night. After
Anaheim, the Sox play in Texas before returning home again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we could have just stayed out here,'' Martinez said
after beating the Mariners. ``But we don't make up the schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland-Seattle junket started last Thursday with a
thrilling comeback win on the same day Duquette made the
seven-player deal. The Sox trailed, 4-3, in the ninth, but battled
back and won in extra innings. Pedro won the next night, 4-1, then
Fassero was drubbed and the Sox lost, 12-1. Arrojo made his debut
in the final Oakland game and beat himself with five walks and two
gopher pitches to No. 9 hitter Sal Fasano.
</P>
<P>
   The opener in Seattle was much like the first game in Oakland.
Boston fell behind, 4-0, in the first when Ramon Martinez
surrendered a grand slam to Jay Buhner. Boston was still behind,
5-4, in the eighth, but Nixon (RBI single) and Varitek (three-run
homer) beat closer Kazuhiro Sasaki and the Sox won, 8-5.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-inning marathon was next and it can be said almost
without argument that Everett's tirade cost his team this game.
It's impossible to imagine Everett going to the plate nine times in
19 innings without helping his team score at least one run. The Red
Sox did not score in the final 16 innings and went 14 straight
frames without getting a man to second. If Everett plays, they win.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for the Sox, Pedro (13-3, 1.42; 9-0, 1.21 on the road)
pitched the next night and put a happy face on the road trip. Able
to do whatever it takes to help his team, Pedro cut back on the
strikeouts (six) and pitched an economical five-hitter (Seattle
sluggers Alex Rodriguez and Edgar Martinez combined to go 1 for 27
in three games against Boston pitching). The Sox bullpen was toast
and Martinez knew what he had to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had to go as deep as possible and pick up the
bullpen,'' he acknowledged. ``So I gave those guys a rest. They
really needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the occasion calls for,'' said pitching coach Joe
Kerrigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big performance for our club,'' said Williams.
``Going home 4-3 is good.''
</P>
<P>
   What about getting Everett back, Jimy?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not back until Saturday. Come see me then,'' stated the
manager. ``He's been working hard. There's no physical problems. We
certainly look forward to having him back this weekend I know he's
looking forward to it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Red Sox aren't saying who'll start against the
Royals Sunday. It might be Tim Wakefield. It could even be Bret
Saberhagen if Boston chooses to rush the veteran back into the
rotation. A minor league call-up (Tomo Ohka?) is an option.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it might be someone unknown to even the Red Sox
players. Such is life in the Sox clubhouse in the summer of 2000.

 UNDATED: sounds lighthearted.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``GHOST DOG: THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI'': (Epic/Razorsharp/Sony).
The only conceivable choice to provide music for ``Ghost Dog,'' Jim
Jarmusch's film about a ghetto hitman with a samurai sensibility,
was RZA, the Wu-Tang Clan mastermind who has long envisioned
hip-hop through the martial-arts prism of 1970s kung fu movies.
RZA's stark, ominous backup tracks _ minor-key samples and
wordless, melancholy voices _ connote a grim universe of mistrust,
solitude and desolation. Above them, assorted rappers (of varying
skill) rhyme about an environment where it's taken for granted that
everyone has to kill or be killed.
</P>
<P>
   RZA also updates the blaxploitation theme song with ``Walking
Through the Darkness,'' sung by Tekitha. Between tracks, Forest
Whitaker (from the film) recites parts of his character's
death-haunted samurai code. It's a bleaker, more amateurish version
of the Wu-Tang soundscape, without a glimmer of comic relief until
the Wu-Tang Clan itself shows up near the finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``GLADIATOR'': (Decca). The score for ``Gladiator'' is an
improbable collaboration by Hans Zimmer, the prolific film composer
who scored ``The Lion King,'' and Lisa Gerrard, who sang and played
early-music instruments with Dead Can Dance, a group dedicated to
creating new songs intended to sound ancient. The ``Gladiator''
score, most of it by Zimmer alone, veers between the austere and
the bombastic; on the CD, it is an unbroken hour of music, though
it is divided into 17 titles. The music narrows to Gerrard's quiet,
wordless voice, with hints of Middle Eastern modalities, or to the
reedy, mournful tone of an Armenian duduk (wooden flute), or the
delicate tapping of a hammered dulcimer.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, however, it swells with glowering late-Romantic
strings, Teutonic martial drums and the fanfaring horns that have
always signaled ``historical epic.'' Battle scenes are variations
on ``Mars'' from ``The Planets'' by Gustav Holst. Outside the
Colosseum, it sounds overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``GRASS'': (Mercury). Marijuana songs through the decades _ Cab
Calloway's 1932 ``Reefer Man,'' Peter Tosh's 1976 ``Legalize It,''
Method Man and Redman's 1998 ``How High'' _ share this soundtrack
album with warnings, from government films, about how smoking pot
can cause ``physical and moral ruin, and death.'' It's a joke that
the compilers were careful not to wear out, but with all the
marijuana songs in the annals of popular music, the collection is a
little skimpy, showing the budgetary constraints of the documentary
filmmakers behind ``Grass.''
</P>
<P>
   And the inclusion of J.J. Cale's ``Cocaine'' is inexplicable _
unless, of course, it's a confirmation of the notion that marijuana
inevitably leads to other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``GROOVE'': (Kinetic/Reprise). ``Groove'' is about the English
rave scene, and its soundtrack compresses a night of electronic
dance music into 59 minutes, mixed as a continuous disc-jockey set
by Wish FM. The selections are less songs than dance tracks:
synthesized beats and riffs that repeat, overlap and evolve. Every
so often, a voice articulates the utopian promise of the rave as a
communal ritual, with dancers and disc jockeys creating ``an
invisible force, a vibe, a shared energy.'' The album is a smart,
dud-free selection of dance tracks, all dating from 1997 to 1999
except Orbital's 1993 ``Halcyon (plus) On (plus) On''; it's a
perfect introduction to current club fare. The music is minimal but
varied, leaning toward the austerity of techno, or the genial disco
thump of house music, or the inexorable slow builds of trance.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanical propulsion of its repetitive beat is offset by
continual change. Sustained tones or a plaintive voice can turn the
music inward; ricocheting percussion can kick the beat sideways;
electronic swoops and whooshes can suddenly ratchet up the music's
drive. The music peaks, blisses out and starts pumping again. And
then again.
</P>
<P>
   ``HIGH FIDELITY'': (Hollywood). The soundtrack for a film about
obsessive record collecting had to include its share of obscurities
like the Kinks' ``Everybody's Gonna Be Happy.'' The ``High
Fidelity'' album makes a case for a direct connection between
unpolished 1960s rock and 1990s indie rock, tossing together, for
instance, the garage-rock psychedelia of the 13th Floor Elevators
with the raucous neo-psychedelia of Royal Trux, the uninflected
beat and strum of the Velvet Underground with the same elements in
Smog. But the songs aren't just style exercises; no matter what
their vintage, most of them revolve around thoughts of obsessive,
misguided love, a state of mind that isn't limited to one
generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE HURRICANE'': (MCA). Bob Dylan's ``Hurricane'' is the odd
song out on a soundtrack album that brings together politically
conscious hip-hop, vintage rhythm-and-blues and new songs
determined to unite the two with the uplift of gospel. The album
suggests a long, coherent African-American legacy of songs about
adversity, good times and a spirit of hope. It rediscovers Etta
James' party tune ``In the Basement,'' Ruth Brown's girlish
temptations in ``I Don't Know'' and the early Ray Charles' bluesy
``Hard Times No One Knows.'' It also latches on to Gil
Scott-Heron's agitprop poem with music, ``The Revolution Will Not
Be Televised,'' as an antecedent to new songs by Me'shell
Ndegeocello, Black Thought and a hip-hop group including Common,
Mos Def and the Roots, all imagining the thoughts of an imprisoned
Rubin Carter. Finally, neo-gospel songs by Melky Sedeck, K-Ci and
Jojo, Clark Anderson and Kelly Price and Aaron Hall preach that
love and determination will bring freedom. They add up to a lesson
in perseverance.

<P>
   ``MAGNOLIA'': (Reprise). Paul Thomas Anderson, who directed
``Magnolia,'' has said the film was adapted from Aimee Mann's
songs: her terse, tuneful character studies of people so
emotionally scarred that they sabotage their own chances for love
or trust, people who, for instance, spend ``a long time on the
phone/Courting disaster in an undertone.'' Her voice hovers calmly,
with a glimmer of vibrato; her not quite symmetrical melodies hark
back to pop of the 1960s and '70s, with a touch of music hall via
the Beatles. The first of the two soundtrack albums, ``Music From
the Motion Picture `Magnolia,''' includes seven songs and an
instrumental by Mann, along with her version of Harry Nilsson's
``One,'' as well as two compatible hits by Supertramp and a ghostly
waltz by Jon Brion, her occasional collaborator. The rest of
Brion's instrumental music for the film is on the second
``Magnolia'' album, ``Original Motion Picture Score.'' The waltz
theme reappears in more expansive form, along with a 44-second
big-band number and an optimistic piece that shimmers with
vibraphone and zither. But most of the score is music for strings
that moves almost glacially, suggesting tension, pathos and
resignation without forcing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE MILLION DOLLAR HOTEL'': (Interscope). The quiet side of
Bono and U2 _ where troubled longing, measured tempos and strange
resonances all drift together _ takes over for an entire album on
the soundtrack to Wim Wenders' ``Million Dollar Hotel.'' (The
movie, screened at Cannes last spring, has not yet opened in the
United States.) Bono joined a studio band including his longtime
collaborators Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, the raga-trained
trumpeter Jon Hassell and the guitarist Bill Frisell, and they
worked out full-fledged songs; U2 itself convened for two new
songs, one of which, ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet,'' has lyrics by
Salman Rushdie. Floating on Frisell's dissolving guitar notes and
Eno's eerie effects, the Million Dollar Hotel Band moves in serene
slow motion, turning folky or jazzy by turns, while Bono's new
songs are suffused with heartache. The music conjures a shadowy
grace, then blasts it away with a closing prank: a Spanish-language
version of ``Anarchy in the U.K.''
</P>
<P>
   ``M:I-2'': (Hollywood). ``Mission: Impossible 2'' has two
soundtrack albums. The would-be blockbuster album of songs ``from
and inspired by'' the movie promises slam-bang action, with one
power-chorded, battering-ram rant after another. The movie provides
perfect subject matter for hard-rock bands _ mayhem, paranoia,
duplicity, sudden death _ and for the album's first 10 songs, they
tear into it. Metallica's ``I Disappear'' sets the standard high,
with earth-shaking one-chord syncopation and a vision of secret
agents as ultimate alienated outsiders. But other bands keep up: in
frenetic, drum-machine-driven songs from Apartment 26 and Rob
Zombie; in Chris Cornell's bluesy, obsessive ``Mission 2000''; in
the fierce drone of the Butthole Surfers' ``They Came In''; in
rap-metal from Limp Bizkit (who use Lalo Schifrin's original theme
as a riff) and the Pimps, who warn, ``I never wanted to be
anybody's anything at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable duds are saved for late in the album. A nutty,
electronic, multilingual version of ``Iko Iko'' by Zap Mama
apparently didn't fit in with the rock songs; it appears on the
movie's second soundtrack album, alongside unmemorable instrumental
music by Hans Zimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE NEXT BEST THING'': (Maverick). The film, which stars
Madonna and includes two new Madonna songs on the soundtrack album,
surrounds Madonna with reflections of her: women who sing in
pensive voices, enveloped by an electronic halo. ``Time Stood
Still'' includes the movie's title in its lyrics about lost love,
and it sits easily alongside similarly restrained songs from Beth
Orton, Mandalay, the Solar Twins and Metisse, as well as Olive's
remake of 10cc's ``I'm Not in Love'' and Gabriel Yared's gently
resigned instrumental music. Sitting in for the younger, peppier
Madonna is Christina Aguilera, who fends off unwanted attentions
above a choppy beat in ``Don't Make Me Love You ('Til I'm Ready).''
Madonna's other new song, a version of ``American Pie,'' isn't as
inexplicable a choice as it might seem. The way she has rejiggered
the lyrics, they become a catalog of her fascinations _ dancing,
God, romance, fame _ while the electronic pulse decisively
separates the tune from folk-rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS'': (Def Jam/Def Soul). From its
soundtrack album, ``Nutty Professor II'' ought to be a romance;
it's full of ingenious new songs about love and lust. And while the
movie's big special effect is making its characters look fat, the
music is lean, with every note and beat delineated clearly. There
are earnest protestations of love from Janet (Jackson), Montell
Jordan, Kandice Love and Case, not to mention the determinedly
low-pressure flirtation in Musiq's ``Just Friends.'' R. Kelly and
Brian McKnight have more complex songs about being the man left
behind, while Shorty 101, like a younger Janet Jackson, has a sly
put-down of the men who would say anything to ``Get With Me.''
Sisqo's ``Thong Song Uncensored'' adds a lascivious rap by Foxy
Brown to the ubiquitous hit. Even the boasting raps by Jay-Z, Eve
and DMX have a lighthearted tone, while a shared rap by Eminem and
Redman, ``Off the Wall,'' sets out to be as obnoxiously funny as
possible. But the album is like a movie in one way: it ends with
eight minutes of coming-attractions excerpts from L.L. Cool J.'s
next album.

   ``THE PERFECT STORM'': (Sony Classical). James Horner, who
composed the score for ``Titanic,'' hasn't had enough of surging
oceanic crescendos or echoes of Irish dances. ``The Perfect Storm''
is no ``Titanic'' sequel, but the score is. It aims for wonderment
and grandeur, seeking them in undulating Debussyan stasis and, even
more, in solemn themes, grand fanfares and orchestral chimes
directly out of Ravel's orchestration of Mussorgsky's ``Pictures at
an Exhibition.'' Every so often, a jiglike theme bobs to the
surface, only to submerge under the rising and falling
string-section chords. The up-and-down motion of the music imitates
the crest and ebb of waves with such determined symmetry that some
listeners may crave Dramamine. Of course, there's a song, too: John
Mellencamp's ``Yours Forever,'' based on the movie's Celtic-tinged
love theme and hoarsely declaring, ``Tomorrow still holds out its
hand to you.'' Even if you're completely waterlogged.
</P>
<P>
   ``PRICE OF GLORY'' (New Line). The ``Price of Glory'' soundtrack
album sets out to be a sampler of Latin alternative rock, the
movement that now extends across the Americas. Gleefully ignoring
borders of style or language, Latin alternative bands demonstrate
that rock still has plenty of new hybrids left, and they're sparked
by the sense of discovery. After a calm start, the album gets more
loopy and exuberant with every song. Boleros, cumbias and mambos
collide with heavy metal, hip-hop and ska; Mexican accordions
tootle alongside G-funk synthesizers, while horn sections punctuate
distorted guitars. Brash voices sing and rap, switching between
English and Spanish and sometimes dropping into a Jamaican
dancehall patois. The majority of bands on the album are from the
United States, along with Aterciopelados from Colombia and Control
Machete from Mexico. But they're all happy to scramble any
presumptions of nationality.
</P>
<P>
   ``SHAFT'': (LaFace). The soundtrack for the new ``Shaft'' looks
back nervously at the score Isaac Hayes wrote for the original
movie in 1971, as well it might: Hayes' music was a cornerstone of
1970s funk, which in turn provided hip-hop with roots. The album
starts with Hayes' barely updated remake of his old ``Theme From
`Shaft,''' which still places its masticating wah-wah guitar
against an orchestra. Then the album lets the bad guys take over
the microphone. They croon about their troubled consciences, like
R. Kelly in ``Bad Man,'' Donell Jones in ``Do What I Gotta Do'' and
Carl Thomas in ``Summer Rain.'' Or they strike gangsta rap stances,
detailing crime and strife as in T.I.P. and Beanie Sigel's ``2
Glock 9's,'' Mil's ``How You Want It?'' and Big Gipp's ``We
Servin'.'' Women turn up in their traditional role _ the lovers on
the sidelines _ with Alicia Keys' ``Rock Wit U'' and Angie Stone's
``My Lovin' Will Give You Something.'' Blaxploitation archetypes
have turned out to be as durable in music as they are on film.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE VIRGIN SUICIDES'': (Astralwerks/Virgin). Air, the French
electronica duo, is fond of old analog synthesizers and the escape
into a streamlined future that they once promised. The duo's music
for ``The Virgin Suicides'' moves away from the arch, airy tone of
their previous albums toward something more thoughtful. The
soundtrack selections, most of them instrumentals lasting less than
three minutes, are variations on a handful of chord progressions,
recurring like a troubling memory. Using acoustic instruments,
particularly a placidly strummed guitar, along with their beloved
Moogs, Air plays minor-key elegies, close in spirit to 1970s Pink
Floyd, though every so often a swooping electronic tone proclaims
its artificiality. Unfortunately, the final selection, a synopsis
narrated above the music, is a misfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``WONDER BOYS'': (Columbia). A soundtrack album can become a
collector's item for one song that appears nowhere else. That could
be the fate of the ``Wonder Boys'' album, which includes Bob
Dylan's ``Things Have Changed,'' his first newly released song
since his magnificent 1997 album ``Time Out of Mind.'' It's a
bitter, desperate, caustic string-band stomp _ ``All the truth in
the world adds up to one big lie'' _ that makes Dylan sound as if
nothing could surprise him except good news. Other songs on the
album are baby-boom-era reflections on loneliness, loss and the
ravages of time, including some indelible songs: Tom Rush's ``No
Regrets,'' Little Willie John's ``Need Your Love So Bad,'' Tim
Hardin's ``Reason to Believe,'' Clarence Carter's ``Slip Away.''
But they all proffer at least a glimmer of consolation, something
``Things Have Changed'' calmly withholds.
</P>
<P>
   ``WONDERLAND'': (Virgin). The composer Michael Nyman writes
classical works (including the opera ``The Man Who Mistook His Wife
for a Hat'') as well as movie scores (among them ``The Piano'' and
many films by Peter Greenaway), and he brings nearly the same
approach to both: a sober balance between minimalist austerity and
the romantic promise of melody. Nyman often uses the same steady,
drumless pulse and some of the same harmonic formulas as Philip
Glass, but Nyman's fondness for melody makes his music seem more
empathetic. Graceful phrases and stately chord progressions hint at
emotional stirrings; structures of repetition and symmetry contain
them as discreetly as a stiff upper lip. His pieces for
``Wonderland,'' named after its characters, suggest affinities
(between ``Nadia'' and ``Eileen,'' or ``Molly'' and ``Darren'') by
revisiting the same chord progressions. In typically subdued
chamber music, Nyman suggests that while he could tug at
heartstrings, he prefers not to.
</P>
<P>
   ``X-MEN'': (Decca/Universal). ''X-Men'' is an anomaly: a
big-budget action movie that doesn't try to hard sell a rock
single. Its soundtrack is an orchestral score by Michael Kamen. The
music is all about jacking up the futuristic suspense. Harking back
to Bartok, Prokofiev and Shostakovich, Kamen lays on foreboding,
dissonant strings, with brasses arriving for grim crescendos. For
the science-fiction element of awe, he uses glassy synthetic
keyboard tones; for paranoia, whip-cracking drum-machine propulsion
and flashes of distorted electric guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Moments of contemplation invariably give way to ominous
pulsations and, eventually, to dissonances that can only portend a
grand clash. Despite a few corny passages _ usually when the drum
machines get too busy _ most of the score creates an enveloping
tension. It's transparently manipulative music, but it works.

   KY-SCHOOL-RAMPAGE (West Paducah, Ky.) _ After their lives were
changed by a 14-year-old killer, the parents of three girls who
were gunned down in a school shooting here sued more than 50 people
they said shared responsibility for the deaths. They sued the
killer and his parents, teachers, school officials, other
teen-agers, neighbors, and the makers of violent video games, Web
sites and movies. But, after a string of recent legal defeats in
which two judges have dismissed virtually all of the claims, there
will be just one defendant remaining: the killer himself, Michael
Carneal. He is the only one the courts have said can be held liable
for the deaths. The story of the lawsuits shows how difficult it is
to assign blame to the many people who, in retrospect, might have
been able to prevent rampage killings and it shows how hard it is
to unravel what really happened in cases that are, by definition,
unfathomable. By William Glaberson.

   NY-SCHOOLS-RACE (Undated) _ The town of Nyack, N.Y. has
unofficially done what New York state and many other states will
soon require of all school districts: It has broken down academic
achievement by race. But its experience provides a cautionary tale.
The release of the numbers divided what had been seen as a diverse
and tolerant community in a way most people thought nothing ever
could. Some black parents decried how schools were segregating and
shortchanging their kids while white parents defended the schools,
pointing the finger at what they called neglect in black families.
Many affluent black parents decried the statistics themselves for
perpetuating painful stereotypes. In the tension, car windows were
smashed, confrontations erupted on the sidewalks. By Kate Zernike.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It happened 30 years ago, but it's still one of David Link's
favorite stories.
</P>
<P>
   He was a partner at the Chicago law firm Winston &AMP; Strawn, and
the Greyhound Corp., his biggest client, had struck a deal to buy a
small company. Link discovered that the target company had
undervalued its inventory by nearly $1 million. He persuaded
Greyhound, which was at first reluctant, to increase its bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many law schools teach that a lawyer's obligation ends at
maximizing the client's profits,'' Link said. ``I say there's a
moral obligation to get justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, Link was content to promulgate that idea at the
Notre Dame Law School, where he had been the dean for 24 years. But
then, the Rev. Dennis Dease, president of St. Thomas University in
Minneapolis, asked him to design and run its new faith-based law
school, to open in September 2001. He jumped at the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a challenge!'' said Link, who is 63. ``I get to start a
new Notre Dame.''
</P>
<P>
   As Link sees it, doctors heal the body, ministers heal the soul
and lawyers heal society. ``I don't think there is a legal question
that doesn't have a moral facet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not _ but should lawyers act on those moral facets?
</P>
<P>
   Definitely not, said Mario Cuomo, the former New York governor
who is now a lawyer at Wilkie, Farr &AMP; Gallagher. He remembers once
bridling when an appeals court applied concepts of morality to a
breach-of-contract suit. ``The chief judge wrote, `The result was
unjust; the case is reversed,''' Cuomo recalled. ``My reaction was,
what standard is he applying? The Koran? The Talmud? How can anyone
use the law to make people behave in ways that are not required by
the law itself?''
</P>
<P>
   To Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard Law School professor, Link's
concept of lawyer as healer is a pragmatic impossibility. ``Clients
will say, `You are not my priest, you are not my mother; I've
decided to make money, and if you won't help me, I'll get another
lawyer,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are all professors at Catholic law schools in tune with
Link's approach. Here is how John Q. Barrett, an associate
professor at St. John's University School of Law in New York,
reacted to the Greyhound story: ``It's the seller's lawyer's
responsibility to notice that assets were undervalued.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Link does not agree. ``You can't teach law as though
it's value-free,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is setting up St. Thomas to reflect that idea. He has signed
up local lawyers whose values he likes as mentors to St. Thomas'
students. St. Thomas will help pay off the loans of students who go
into public service jobs. It will offer joint degrees in law and
social work, divinity, education or business, and will staff its
law clinic with people from those disciplines as well. ``If
someone's problem has more than a legal aspect, we can walk them
across the hall,'' Link said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has 183 accredited law schools _ three in
Minneapolis alone _ and 25 Catholic law schools, but Link is
garnering converts nonetheless. Dease says that St. Thomas has
received more than 500 letters of inquiry from prospective
students, and more than 360 letters from would-be faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   ``David believes so strongly in faith-based law that he is an
apostle,'' Dease said.
</P>
<P>
   David Link grew up in Sandusky, Ohio, the youngest of six
children in a strict Catholic home. He often visited his father, a
car dealer, at work. Early on, he was struck by how well his father
treated customers _ and how much repeat business he got.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom taught us that ethics were necessary even if they
hurt,'' Link recalled. ``My father showed me that ethics could help
make you successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Link attended Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind., and majored in
advertising and philosophy. He had expected to take over his
father's dealership with his brothers; the plan was scrapped when
his father sold the business.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief time he toyed with becoming a journalist _ after
all, he met Barbara, now his wife of 42 years and mother of his
four children, while working on his high school newspaper _ but
wound up attending Notre Dame Law School.
</P>
<P>
   When he graduated in 1961, he became a lawyer for the Internal
Revenue Service. He became friends with the IRS chief counsel,
Crane Houser _ ``He liked my JFK imitations,'' Link recalled _ and
when Houser joined Winston &AMP; Strawn, Link followed him. He took a
leave in 1970 to help Notre Dame set up a program for teaching tax
law. He never came back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technically, I'm in my 31st year of leave,'' said Link, who
became the dean of the Notre Dame Law School in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he has' stayed put since then. In the late '80s he took
a leave to set up a Catholic law school in Australia. He visits
South Africa three times a year, to consult for a law school he
helped set up there.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Link has helped to build houses for homeless people in
South Bend. He was a mentor to Notre Dame's minority students.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of African-Americans balk at going to a Catholic school
in the Midwest, but Dean Link helped us recruit,'' said Elton
Johnson, a second-year law student at Notre Dame
</P>
<P>
   Even former students who have gone into politics _ a profession
not always known for its ethical stances _ say they have been
influenced by Link's willingness to walk the walk.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Durant, a 1976 Notre Dame law school graduate, consulted
with Link before running unsuccessfully for a Michigan seat in the
U.S. Senate in 1990. ``I always valued David's counsel, his belief
that being a leader goes beyond just teaching law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph A. Cari Jr., another of his former students at Notre
Dame, was Sen. Joseph Biden's campaign manager in his bid for the
Democratic nomination for president in 1988, and when his candidate
got crushed, his first reaction was to leave politics. ``But I kept
hearing David's voice, saying you must do constructive things in
times of pain,'' Cari said.
</P>
<P>
   Cari is now finance chairman of the Democratic National
Committee. Last year, when Cari was named chairman of the Woodrow
Wilson Center for International Scholars in Washington, he invited
Link to the swearing-in ceremony. ``It just wouldn't have felt the
same without David,'' he said. &QL;

FORD RECOVERING FROM APPARENT STROKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former President Gerald R. Ford continues his rapid recovery
from a pair of mild strokes, taking a short stroll around his
Philadelphia hospital and giving GOP presidential nominee George W.
Bush some oratory pointers.
</P>
<P>
   But while the 87-year-old politician appears to be on the road
back to health _ he should be discharged by early next week _
questions were raised Thursday about his initial care. Doctors at
Hahnemann University Hospital first diagnosed Ford with a sinus
infection and quickly discharged him, a decision that thrust them
into a harsh, though likely fleeting, international spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of restless journalists, with little tangible news to
report from the heavily scripted GOP convention, peppered officals
from the 618-bed hospital with openly skeptical questions. The
Hahnemann staff defended their initial call, claiming they made the
correct decision based on the information they had.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe there was any misdiagnosis there,'' said
Michael Halter, the hospital's chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Halter said that the former president did not exhibit all his
stroke symptoms when he checked into the hospital at 1 a.m.
Wednesday complaining of pain in his tongue.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ford's spokesman said the former president was
interested only in pain relief at the time, and refused a CAT scan
so that he could return to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The activities that evening were totally controlled by the
president,'' said the spokesman, Calvin McDowell.
</P>
<P>
   It was eight hours later, after a clearly ailing Ford gave
numerous TV interviews, that it was determined he'd suffered a
stroke. The delay in diagnosis does not appear to have affected his
prognosis: Doctors said he suffered no brain damage or any other
permanent injury. The strokes, which cut off blood flow to the
balance center of his brain, slurred Ford's speech and upset his
balance. Though Ford appears to be recovering, his short-term
neurological distress continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's having some problem with his tongue and a little bit of
slurred speech,'' said Dr. Robert Schwartzman, the hospital's chief
of neurology.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Philip J. Kistler, director of stroke services at
Massachusetts General Hospital, which treats the power elite from
around the world and is the stand-by hospital when the president is
in the Boston area, said he doubts that Ford's refusal of initial
treatment was given special weight because of his stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treat everyone the same,'' he said. ``I can't imagine they
did any differently.''
</P>
<P>
   But if blatant symptoms are absent, as Hahnemann officals said
was the case, then a patient's words are all a doctor can go by,
said Kistler.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to believe what people say,'' he said. ``Sometimes
the brain doesn't recognize its own symptoms. But sometimes family
members do, especially wives.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was Ford's wife, Betty, who gave doctors the detailed
information about his odd recent behavior that allowed them to
diagnose the strokes, one on Sunday and one Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush visited Ford for about 15 minutes, saying the
political veteran told him to ``keep practicing'' his acceptance
speech for the GOP nomination, which he gave later.
</P>
<P>
   The former president also walked about 40 feet along a hospital
corridor with some assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was definitely much steadier than he was yesterday,'' said
Dr. Carole Thomas, director of neurological intensive care at
Hahnemann.

BUSH HAS DONE WHAT A PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE HASN'T DONE SINCE 1984
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB RAY SANDERS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It would be easy to say that Gov. George W. Bush,
a privileged child of an important American family, once again got
something he wanted, and that this time it was a gigantic present:
his party's nomination for president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But that would be simplistic and unfair, and it terribly
understates a man whom people have tried to label as a shallow,
inattentive ``frat boy'' whose main purpose in seeking the nation's
highest office is to avenge the defeat of his father in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Bush has had plenty of help in his bid for the White
House, and he's had lots of money. But make no mistake about it,
the governor carried his own water in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' quadrennial meeting that ended here last night
was Bush's convention. He set the stage, the tone and the agenda.
The entire event reflected his ideas and ideals.
</P>
<P>
   He proved months ago, during the grueling primary season, that
he could take a punch, that he could learn _ and learn fast _ from
his mistakes, and that, despite any distractions thrown at him by
opponents, he knew how to stay on course, stay on task and stay on
message.
</P>
<P>
   You've got to give it to him. He's been an excellent candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his Grand Old Party put on a humdinger of a convention,
one that was upbeat, more diverse than any other Republican
convention in history and one that generally made for good
television. Yes, it was scripted and programmed, with some
artificial feel-good moments, but then what major political
convention isn't?
</P>
<P>
   This candidate has been able to do what no other Republican
nominee has done since at least 1984. He unified his party.
</P>
<P>
   There are still some major philosophical differences within the
party. But because Republicans want to win so badly, they have been
able to put aside most of their differences long enough, they hope,
to get their man elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having said all that, Bush will not be a shoo-in. He still
has to convince doubters that he is capable of being the chief
executive of the world's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   He will have to make people believe that he and the party as a
whole are sincere about compassion, inclusion and diversity. And he
can't make that case by simply parading a bunch of people of color
across the television screen. There has to be some action that
speaks to their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will try to do that by touting his record in Texas. In
politics, like on the old vinyl discs, there are two sides to every
record. His opponent, of course, will be broadcasting the side that
has had the least air play.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans undoubtedly got a big bounce from their convention
and the nomination of Dick Cheney as Bush's running mate. Democrats
will need much more than a bounce. They may need one of those
rocket boosters from Cape Canaveral to help get presidential
candidate Al Gore off the ground, much less into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It can be done. Gore likes running from behind, although not
this much behind. Still, I'm convinced he will run a hard-hitting
campaign with a running mate who will offer a great contrast to
Cheney and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats already know, as was signaled here this week, that
Bush-Cheney will be running as much against Bill Clinton as Al
Gore. By election time, Republicans will want us to believe that
Clinton and Gore are joined at the hip, unable to be separated,
surgically or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to the voters to decide if that strategy will
work.

TAKING THE PARTY OUTDOORS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is summer in New York, this year a season that
jumps from muggy heat to damp chill without warning. There is
relatively little dance in pleasantly climate-controlled theaters.
So what do those mad creatures called dancers do?
</P>
<P>
   Forget about vacations or more trips to the office-temp center.
Dancers dance. So they are taking to the city's parks, rooftops,
gardens and empty buildings over the next four weeks in a surge of
activity that truly offers something for just about everyone.
Festivals and special events are everywhere, and many of them are
free.
</P>
<P>
   The granddaddy of summer series is the free 30-year-old Lincoln
Center Out of Doors festival, which opens on Saturday and runs
through Aug. 27. This year's theme is ``Celebrate Good Times.''
Does this mean there will be nonstop partying spilling out across
the plazas and into the band shell at Lincoln Center for the month?
Jenneth Webster, the festival's irrepressible director, admits she
did contemplate ``Let the Good Times Rule'' for this year's title.
</P>
<P>
   Good times, Webster said, are ``like the moment you're in, if
it's a good moment. Everything from meditation to a conga line. So
there's a whole spiritual slant to this festival.''
</P>
<P>
   The first artists to approach her about appearing in the
festival this summer were the Drepung Loseling Monks of Tibet, who
will perform chants and dances on Aug. 17 in ``Sacred Arts of
Tibet.'' Webster built a week of mystical arts around them, with
Ali Akbar Khan, the virtuoso sitar player on Aug. 13 at 8 p.m., and
``Pauline Oliveros' Deep Listening For-Tunes,'' a celebration of
the mystical composer's 50th year in music, on Aug. 17 at 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Oliveros' music is well known to audiences for avant-garde
dance, and Khan's concert promises to be a kind of performance
event, given that Webster will build a tent and provide a rug for
the musicians. Purists will be heartened to know that Donald Byrd
and his high-energy company, the Group, will be on hand that week
to shake things up, to music by Duke Ellington performed by David
Berger and the Sultans of Swing (Aug. 15 and 16).
</P>
<P>
   The festival's dance events begin Saturday afternoon with an
international family dance party featuring Estampas y Tradiciones
of Mexico, Korean Masked Dancing and Reginald Yates' Bantaba of
Africa. And that conga line may get going, at least
impromptu-style, with ``Encuentros Dominicanos'' on Sunday
afternoon. There will also be performances by established
modern-dance troupes like the Parsons Dance Company (on Aug. 8) and
the Paul Taylor Dance Company, whose program will include
``Cascade'' (Aug. 11 and Aug. 12).
</P>
<P>
   The festival is also a good place to see newer artists. Two
promising programs this year are ``Subtle Changes: Speaking the
Truth,'' an afternoon of choreography by Hope Boykin, Ayodele
Casel, Kerri Edge, Cheryl Godineaux, Jamie Philbert and Laila Sales
(Aug. 9) and a performance by the Pascal Rioult Dance Theater (Aug.
22).
</P>
<P>
   Is the experience of performing outdoors at all different from
dancing inside the three walls of a traditional proscenium stage?
Edward Morgan, a charismatic performer whose love for ballet finds
expression in his small company's joyous classicism, once performed
in the ultimate outdoor theater space, the amphitheater in Athens
while on tour with the Joffrey Ballet. And the MorganScott Ballet,
founded in 1997 with Daniel Scott, has had its share of competing
with urban distractions in outdoor performances in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   For their performance on Aug. 11 at ``Bryant Park Presents
August Dance,'' Morgan and Scott have taken into account not only
the expressiveness of their performers and the need to slightly
rechoreograph for a stage without wing space but also the angle of
the audience from the stage. They pick dancers with the extra
personality or natural projection for outdoor performances and
tailor the program for the casual observer. ``We normally start
with classical work and then go into something more contemporary,''
Morgan said. ``But outdoors, if you start with something a little
more contemporary, you may be able to draw the audience into the
classical piece that comes next.''
</P>
<P>
   The same philosophy appears to govern the dizzyingly
wide-ranging free new Bryant Park series, developed by Ethan
Lercher of the Bryant Park Restoration Corp., who operates on the
principle that the more dance the better for New York City. The
series opens tonight with Nick Palumbo and the Flipped Fedoras and
Dancers, a group of swing musicians and dancers who encourage the
audience to join in, and continues on successive Fridays with
modern dance by Nicholas Leichter (Aug. 18) and Hernando Cortez
(Aug. 25).
</P>
<P>
   Despina Stamos, the producer and curator of the free ``Deli
Dances in Times Square'' festival, chose five advisers known for
their engagingly oddball creativity in downtown dance and
performance art. ``They do interesting work for people who don't
see a lot of dance,'' Stamos said. ``We wanted to show that dance
is colorful, bold and hopefully accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival, which begins formally at 12:30 this afternoon,
will present more than 40 individuals and groups in afternoon and
evening performances through Aug. 18 at 135 W. 42nd St. The
sponsoring organization is Chasama, which puts on performances in
empty buildings managed by the Durst Organization. (The series got
its name from the former delicatessen where it was held last year.)

AMES, BRADLEES FACE TOUGH SELL AGAINST NATIONAL CHAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a world filled with such national giants as Wal-Marts and
Targets, is there still a niche for a regional discount chain?
</P>
<P>
   A year ago the answer in New England might have been yes.
</P>
<P>
   After emerging from bankruptcy protection in early 1999,
Bradlees Inc. of Braintree, Mass. showed a lot of resilience. And
as it completed its acquisition of Hills Stores Co., Ames
Department Stores Inc. of Rocky Hill, Conn., was wowing Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, nearly everything seemed to go right for Ames and
Bradlees, but in the first half of 2000, nearly everything has gone
wrong, beginning with bad weather and high gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   Gas prices in particular can be a problem for the moderate- and
low-income consumers who shop at Ames and Bradlees.
</P>
<P>
   With Thursday's release of July sales figures, both chains had
more bad news to report. At stores open at least a year, July sales
at Bradlees dipped 4.6 percent, and at the much larger Ames, July
sales fell 2.6 percent at older stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a battle,'' said Peter Thorner, Bradlees chairman
and chief executive. ``We're not anyone's darling this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent subpar performance of Ames has surprised some
investors. A strong second half is ``critical'' to ``demonstrate
the company's earnings model is back on track,'' said Steven A.
Richter, an analyst with Tucker Anthony Cleary Gull.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Ames' difficulties may be its 1999 acquisition of
Hills, of Canton, Mass.; it has not gone as smoothly as planned and
has loaded Ames up with debt, other retail analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting a solid second half, Ames chairman and chief
executive Joseph R. Ettore said: ``We're obviously going to ride
this out.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bradlees and Ames underperform, the question again arises
about the long-term future of regional discount chains.
</P>
<P>
   Giants such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. can use their size to buy in
volume and offer low prices. Giants can use their size to gain
efficiencies and get the best locations for new stores.
</P>
<P>
   Such factors put smaller retailers at a disadvantage and may
partly explain the demise of Caldor Corp., the $2.5 billion
Connecticut-based retailer that went out of business last year.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook for small regional chains is ``guarded,'' said Kurt
Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report.
</P>
<P>
   That hardly means surviving regional chains are doomed. One
scenario is that small chains will be swallowed up by larger ones.
That could be the ultimate fate of Bradlees, said Eric Beder, an
analyst with Ladenburg Thalmann.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long term, there's a potential they would be
acquired,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the last few months have been tough on many
retailers, especially those selling apparel. Ho-hum fashions, bad
weather, and interest rate hikes have hurt many chains.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the stock prices for many publicly traded
retailers have dropped sharply, but even among a group of
underachievers, Bradlees and Ames stand out.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Bradlees shares were trading just above $20 on
Nasdaq; they closed Thursday at $3.25, down 3.125 cents.
</P>
<P>
   And Ames shares were trading above $40 a year ago; Thursday they
hit a 52-week low of $5 before closing at $6, down 31.25 cents for
the day on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get stupid overnight,'' said Ettore of Ames. ``This
is the worst first half (of a year) for weather I've ever seen, and
I've been in the business since 1961.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the weather was nearly perfect, and Northeastern
retailers did a brisk business in barbecue grills, patio furniture,
fans, air conditioners, and seasonal apparel.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, however, the weather has been awful, and
seasonal merchandise has languished on store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   For a big national chain with stores from coast to coast, bad
weather in one region can be offset by good weather somewhere else.
Regional chains don't have that advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The juxtaposition of a nearly ideal 1999 with a horrid early
2000 makes for tough comparisons when it comes to monthly sales
figures, numbers Wall Street follows closely.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, both chains said they expect momentum to pick up in
the second half of 2000 when month-to-month sales comparisons won't
be so difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its size, analysts think Ames has a chance to regain
momentum and keep larger rivals at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Ames operates 467 stores in 19 states, while Bradlees operates
105 stores in seven states.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Ames earned $17.13 million on sales of $3.84 billion;
Bradlees lost $9.37 million on sales of $1.49 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The chains have slighly different customers. Ames goes after
customers with household incomes between $25,000 and $40,000,
particularly consumers 55 and older. Bradlees targets customers
with household incomes between $45,000 and $55,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ames still may be struggling to digest its early 1999
acquisition of Hills, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ames did very well up until the time Joe Ettore went out and
bought Hills,'' analyst Barnard said.
</P>
<P>
   Hills wouldn't be Ames' first bad acquisition. After acquiring
the Zayre chain of Framingham, Mass., Ames spent several years in
bankruptcy protection in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Such comparisons are unwarranted, Ettore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing about the Hills acquisition resembles the Zayre deal
in any way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradlees, according to chief executive Thorner, got a big lift
in 1999 from the demise of Caldor. The two chains competed against
each other in about 60 locations, and when Caldor closed its doors
many Caldor customers flocked to Bradlees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, many Caldor locations have been leased, and about 55
Bradlees stores find themselves with new rivals. At 32 of the
former Caldor sites, Bradlees now is near a new store operated by
Kohl's Corp., a Wisconsin chain that opened stores this spring in
New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   According to Thorner, Kohl's department stores typically appeal
to a more upscale consumer than do Bradlees stores.
</P>
<P>
   But when Kohl's opens new stores, it advertises heavily and
offers discounts and promotions that attract Bradlees customers,
Thorner said; when promotions end, customers return to Bradlees.
</P>
<P>
   While bullish on the second half of 2000, Thorner offered no
rosy scenarios for the future of Bradlees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect to break even this year,'' he said. ``It's real
difficult for me to look down the road five years from now and
predict where we'll be.''
</P>
<P>
   Ettore offered a different view. Regional chains, he said, can
compete successfully against the giants if they can carve out a
niche, as Ames has done with blue-collar seniors. That's allowed
Ames to go up against Wal-Mart in 400 locations.
</P>
<P>
   Said Ettore: ``I honestly believe that 80 percent of our
shortfall is due to the weather.''

   ``Deli Dances'' aims for an audience new to dance. Stamos hopes
that tourists and shoppers at the big theme stores in the
neighborhood may wander into this ``no budget'' event, as she puts
it. ``This is also an opportunity for choreographers to show their
work in an area they normally don't,'' Stamos said. To whet
audience appetites, a sample of dances was performed earlier in the
week in a Times Square subway station. There will also be ``open
stage'' nights on Tuesdays when anyone can sign up to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Six other far-flung festivals will present dance throughout the
city. Dancers and musicians from the Djoniba School will perform on
Aug. 9 in Summer in the Square 2000, a festival in Union Square
that runs through Aug. 30. Other dance events include a program by
performers from the Martha Graham Dance Company in works they or
guests have choreographed, on Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Central Park SummerStage and Celebrate Brooklyn! will go out on
a limb with dance that is exciting and good-looking but also
demands fully committed attention. The hard-driving, gutsy O
Vertigo Danse from Canada will share the bill with the quietly
thought-provoking Gina Gibney Dance from New York in Central Park
on Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Down in Prospect Park on Aug. 12, Celebrate Brooklyn! will stage
work by Hope Clark and Sarah East Johnson, the two choreographers
this year in the festival's forward-looking residency program. The
piece by Clark will blend voice, video, aerial movement and digital
effects. Johnson's all-female company draws on acrobatic feats,
trapeze work and even wrestling for what has been described as a
mix of circus and dance. Byrd and his company follow on Aug. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swing Week,'' designated by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani from
Aug. 14 to 20, will spill out through Manhattan, the Bronx,
Hoboken, N.J., and on the Internet. This celebration of swing, a
dance developed in the 1920's at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem, has
been organized by the producers of the Broadway musical ``Swing!''
But Marc Routh, one of those producers, makes a believable case for
the festival's having as much to do with the sheer joy of swing
dancing as with the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the dance in its simplest form has to do with that
wonderful tangible thing of holding on to a partner and trusting
another person,'' Routh said. Most swing dancers do not progress to
the kind of complicated, airborne feats that the cast performs. But
essentially swing is an uncomplicated matter of ``right, left, back
step,'' he said. ``It's a lot of fun and offers the opportunity to
hold another human being real close and laugh and enjoy yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The events, some of them free, include demonstrations, lessons
and performances, four of them outdoors in the New York Botanical
Garden in the Bronx, in Bryant Park, at Orchard Beach and in
Central Park. Archival videos will be shown on Aug. 16 in a salute
to 75 years of swing at the Sandra Cameron Dance Center in
Manhattan. There will also be six swing-club contests, with
finalists competing on the stage of the St. James Theater during a
``Swing!'' intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Dance will also be performed this month at the Hudson River
Festival and the 19th Annual Downtown Dance Festival, which opens
on Aug. 27 with the exuberant foot-stompers known as the Vanaver
Caravan.
</P>
<P>
   What should audiences get out of all this? ``What we always
hope,'' Webster said, ``is that the audience will come and leave
with a tolerance for the new and unexpected.''

   LOS ANGELES _ She won't be marching in the streets. She won't be
calling for the overthrow of capitalism and of corporate control of
the global economy (although she might be sorely tempted).
Nevertheless, if anyone is going to shake the over-rehearsed

SALOMON OFFERS TO BUY U.S. TREASURY STRIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Salomon Smith Barney on Thursday offered to buy $94.5
billion worth of the interest portion of Treasury securities, known
as strips, from institutional and retail owners.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon said it wanted to combine the interest portions with
bond principal to create whole bonds that would be eligible for
sale back to the Treasury as part of the government's buyback
program.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Treasury is expected to buy back as much as $30
billion of Treasury bonds with maturities of 10 years to 25 years
remaining. The government is reducing borrowing amid growing budget
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street firms often break up the interest and the principal
portions of a bond and sell them separately as zero-coupon bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon has an oversupply of the principal portions of existing
bonds but a shortage of the interest-rate portion. And if the firm
wants to take advantage of the premium prices the Treasury is
paying to buy back existing bonds, it needs to reconstitute the two
portions into whole bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This offer will allow us to continue to be actively involved
in the Treasury buyback program,'' said Charles Parkhurst, co-head
of the U.S. government bond department at Salomon.
</P>
<P>
   The $94.5 billion is the face value of the interest portion of
the bonds. But these would be bought at a discount to the price so
the total cost would be less than $94.5 billion. Salomon is
offering investors cash for the interest portions of the bond, or
would swap them for a principal portion.

NOMINATION RESHAPES BUSH'S OLD-SCHOOL TIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Thanks to the political alchemy that transforms
nominees at conventions, George W. Bush casts a longer shadow today
than he did yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who graduated with him from Andover in 1964, his
new stature astounds -- not for the shock of his potential
presidency but for what it says about the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of us now has his hands on the instruments of power. To
admit that he could be president is to admit that we're not kids
anymore,'' says class secretary Tom Seligson. ``It reminds me that
I'm supposed to retire ten years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may have been the first boomer president, but Bush is
the first one we watched swing a broomstick at a tennis ball. ``I
went to Florida with the guy over spring break,'' recalls Seligson.
``You think to yourself, `What did I miss?' The mythology of the
presidency is that no one I know that well could end up there. Then
you realize that's not true anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   With his acceptance speech, Bush closed the book on the first
volume of his own history. Gone will be the media obsession with
his early life. How he got here is instantly less interesting than
where he is going. His smirk is just a smirk. His reign as High
Commissioner of Stickball at Andover no longer matters. What does
is the fine print of his plan to save Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The acceptance speech was the ultimate grownup act. He now
becomes a Rorschach test for the rest of us: How we feel about him
depends on how we feel about ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start with amazement and say, `Wait a minute, why is this
guy going so far and so many of us haven't?' '' says Seligson.
``Then you step back and realize that a lot of us have done fine in
our own ways. So you can look at it as `Why him and not me?' or you
can look at him as a reflection of me in the Andover context.
Either way, it takes a lot to do what he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Randall Roden, an old friend who attended elementary school in
Midland and later Andover with Bush, notes the inherent silliness
of trying to identify, three decades after the fact, the traits at
Andover that explain his current success.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone had asked you back then if George would become
president, you'd have said, `Hell, no,' '' says Roden. ``But that
would have been equally true if you were in Bill Clinton's class. I
have come to accept George's success only because he has
demonstrated abililties I didn't know he had.''
</P>
<P>
   These are defined and validated externally. He is a social
animal who needs others to burnish his own identity. ``His skills
involve interaction, reaction, counterpunching,'' adds Roden, a
North Carolina trial lawyer. ``It is not as if he has an
overarching vision for America.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters have gotten lost in Bush's years at Andover. It's easy
to do. With the wrong context, you draw the wrong judgments, and
different players limn very different versions of that experience.
For example, one writes about George's defiant anti-intellectualism
at his peril, warns Roden. ``That part you can overdo,'' he says.
``I think he is smart and intuitive. On the other hand, George
probably sees a limited range of possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's politics at Andover were subterranean, if they existed at
all. In that sense, he was no different from the rest of us. Until
his run against Kent Hance for an open congressional seat in West
Texas, he appeared largely apolitical. If he was conservative, it
was in his lifestyle, not his politics.
</P>
<P>
   But, it turns out, something was percolating within him. ``It's
not so surprising now,'' says Roden. ``When we look back on it, he
was developing skills that were not apparent at the time. I should
have realized it sooner because he was involved in other people's
campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Bush has emerged as a fairly uncomplicated
politician. ``I think he is more or less like what he says he is --
a Reagan conservative,'' says Roden. ``There is nothing
Machiavellian going on there. I wouldn't have known that when we
were at Andover.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's run for the Oval Office is as surreal to us as it is
uncomplicated. Our mental snapshots of the boy, now sepia-toned,
vie with video footage of the man. ``You keep pinching yourself,''
says Seligson. ``And every day at work people ask, `Do you know
this guy?' ''

WHITE OUTFITS, BLACK BALLS AND THAT PERFECTLY GREEN GRASS
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRIS BALLARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All that stood between me and victory was 90 feet of
immaculate green grass. At the far end, a cluster of black balls
huddled around my target: the jack, a white ball the size and shape
of a cue ball. To win, I had to curve my ball through the globes
and nudge the jack. Misjudge it by more than an inch and I'd lose.
I might as well have been trying to sink a putt from the rough with
a broomstick.
</P>
<P>
   But then I never thought lawn bowling was going to be easy, as I
was finding out on a warm Sunday in Central Park. This sport of
kings and commoners _ an ancient relative of boccie played by Henry
VIII and William Shakespeare _ was not only enjoyable but also
quite challenging.
</P>
<P>
   My first memories of lawn bowling stem from two pre-teen years I
spent in England, where the sport is almost as popular as golf is
in America. Ever since then I've harbored a grainy home-movie image
of the game in the recesses of my brain. I recall stately older men
and women dressed in all-white outfits and wide-brimmed hats. I
remember much murmuring, appraising and bending. And I remember
thinking they were using a perfectly good soccer pitch for what
appeared to be slow-motion bowling.
</P>
<P>
   Though lawn bowling has but a minuscule following in the United
States _ there are only 160 greens in the country, according to the
American Lawn Bowls Association _ the sport has been popular in
England since the 12th century and still draws celebrities (Diana,
Princess of Wales, was a frequent bowler) and big crowds across the
United Kingdom and in Australia and New Zealand. Initially popular
in the colonies, lawn bowling didn't fare well in the United States
after the Revolution, perhaps because it was seen as a relic of
British rule.
</P>
<P>
   Here in New York the first green was built in 1664 on the parade
grounds of Fort Amsterdam, and the green at what is now Battery
Park was erected 60 years later. It was not until 1926 that bowling
came to Central Park, when the New York Lawn Bowling Club was
formed and the greens were built near the West 69th Street entrance
to the park. Recently, the club has received competition from the
Metropolitan Bowling Club, headed by a former New York Lawn Bowling
Club president, Richard Keoseian, a lively man who once tried to
arrange a celebrity lawn bowling tournament overseen by Robin
Leach, host of ``Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd never played the game while living in England, but I was
always a bit curious. So when I heard that people lawn-bowled right
here in Manhattan, in Central Park no less, I decided to have a go.
If nothing else, the game had to be more fun than cricket, for me a
soporific British sport that had tormented me as a youth. I called,
and arranged for a lesson the next Sunday with Tony Reynal,
president of the New York Lawn Bowling Club. (The Metropolitan Club
had yet to start its season.)
</P>
<P>
   I arrived at the greens, north of the Sheep Meadow in Central
Park, just after noon. Situated on a slight rise, the matching
120-foot-by-120-foot swathes of grass (one is used by a croquet
club) are enclosed by a five-foot-tall green fence and covered with
the type of pristine, short-cut grass one would find on a putting
green in Augusta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, the greens were an oasis of inactivity amid the
Frisbee fiends, sunbathers and soccer players who cluttered the
park. As I approached, I saw a solitary figure rolling balls down
the grass, placing each within a foot of the jack. It was Reynal,
looking ready for breakfast at Wimbledon in white shorts, a
white-collared shirt, white socks, and white tennis shoes. The only
sign that I was dealing with a born-and-bred New Yorker was the
Yankees cap atop his head.
</P>
<P>
   I introduced myself and he ushered me inside the fence. ``First
off, the balls are not called bowling balls,'' he said. ``They're
called bowls.'' This, it seemed, was not only a very common
misconception, but also an important point. I came to understand
that one risked calling them balls at one's own peril.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he said, ``despite appearances, this isn't much like
boccie.'' He was referring to the Italian game in which players
throw wooden balls toward a small metal one. ``We roll, not toss,
and our bowls aren't round.'' As he spoke, a white-haired woman to
our right dutifully made her way around the edge of the green,
trimming the frayed edges of the grass.
</P>
<P>
   Leading me around the green, Reynal spoke about the dimensions
of the green. It is divided into lanes, or ``rinks,'' and eight
games can take place simultaneously. Players toss the jack at least
60 feet down the rink, marked off only by posts at the end of the
green, and then take turns bowling from a small plastic mat that is
placed at the opposite end of the rink.
</P>
<P>
   Our tour complete, Reynal brought out the bowls, hard plastic
spheres each weighing three to four pounds each. They were the size
of softballs. The purpose of the game, he said as he hefted a bowl,
is simple: Put as many of your bowls as possible as close as
possible to the jack. Matches are broken up into ``ends,'' which
are similar to innings in baseball. In each end, players roll all
four of their bowls. (In singles and pairs, bowlers get four bowls;
in triples, they use three bowls, and in 4-on-4 games, each bowler
uses two bowls.)
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of each end, players (or teams) get one point
for every bowl they have placed closer to the jack than their
opponents' nearest bowl. Games are typically played to a set number
of ends, usually 12, 14 or 16, and may take a couple of hours.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded easy enough to me:Just toss that sphere down near the
jack. But the catch, Reynal said with a slight grin and a raised
eyebrow, was how the bowls rolled. They are all unevenly weighted,
heavier on one side, so that, depending on how you align them, they
will sweep in an arc that curves either to the right or the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``See how the emblem on this side is larger than the one on the
other side,'' Reynal said, pointing to the design on one side of a
bowl. ``That means that this side is heavier, so keep that emblem
on the side you want the bowl to curve.''
</P>
<P>
   I held the bowl with my thumb pointing up, as he directed, and
kept the larger emblem to the right. Sure enough, after about 50
feet, the bowl began veering right. I smiled; it was like a magic
trick. Unfortunately, the bowl did not end up anywhere near the
jack. That would have to be the next trick.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   I rolled again. Not much closer. Reynal reminded me to keep my
arm straight and step into the bowls. After about 10 practice
rolls, I began to get the hang of it and even put four in a row
around the jack. Not too hard, I thought, especially when there
aren't any other bowls in the way.
</P>
<P>
   That, he told me, is the real challenge. Your opponent _ or
opponents if you are playing in a threesome or foursome _ will
often block your path with their bowls or send them into the jack.
(This is the closest the sport comes to matching the thunder of its
offspring, 10-pin bowling.) And considering that depending on how
many people play, there can be up to 18 bowls on the green at one
time, it can become nearly impossible to find a path to the jack.
</P>
<P>
   Reynal left me practicing. I focused on the jack and worked on
estimating my ``draw,'' the amount of curve on my rolls. ``Hey, 10
bucks says you can't hit it.'' I turned around to see three thick
men carrying a cooler toward the Sheep Meadow. They had stopped to
watch. I felt as if I were in a zoo. I nodded at them, as if to
say, ``Oh yeah, watch this,'' and then promptly rolled the bowl
four feet to the right. The men laughed and walked on. I had a way
to go.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, the other club members arrived, 11 in all on
this day. (Reynal said there were ``about 60'' in the club.) Like
the 60-year-old Reynal, a retired computer programmer, most members
were dressed in white and eligible for the senior citizen movie
discount, or at least closing in on it. In the group there were a
teacher, an actor, an investment banker and a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   I watched as Reynal split up teams and the games started. As
they rolled, partners stood at opposite ends of the rink, directing
one another's bowls using an elaborate system of hand signals,
similar to a third-base coach's signs to a hitter, indicating to
their teammates the score, where the jack was and where the
opponents' bowls were.
</P>
<P>
   Talking is discouraged in the game, hence the tradition of hand
signals, The conversation, what there was of it, was limited.
``Right down the middle, Frankie!'' exhorted one bowler. ``You got
it, Frankie, you got it!'' Frankie did not have it; his bowl
drifted to the right. Oh, well.
</P>
<P>
   After witnessing most of one game, I was ready to go up against
Frankie, or at least try my hand in competition. Fortunately for
me, David Fainkich, a 31-year-old Brooklyn lawyer who has been
bowling for three years, had arrived late. He lent me a spare set
of four bowls and we began a game of singles. We played with four
bowls each, trading off rolls, and decided to play to 12 ends.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, I managed to take an early lead on Fainkich, going
up 4-1 by finishing closer to the jack in four of the first five
ends. But he answered right back with a three-point end, clustering
three of his bowls closer to the jack than any of mine. On the
fourth end, Fainkich pulled out a pocket tape measure to determine
whose ball was closer. On the fifth end, he moved the mat forward _
the winner of each end gets to place the mat and roll the jack in
the next end _ effectively shortening the distance by 15 feet and
throwing me off.
</P>
<P>
   ``A common strategy, but you'd be surprised how often it
works,'' he said, proving his point by making one. The score
wavered back and forth _ 8-7, 9-8, 11-9 _ until we came to the
final end. Fainkich was up 12-9 on me; I needed a few monster
rolls. Fortunately for me, his first three bowls were off the mark.
If I could get to the jack on my fourth bowl, I could take the
game. It was all-or-nothing time. I bent down and sent my final
bowl spilling onto the carpet of grass. It sailed down the right
side and began slowly curving back to the left. I hopped on one
leg, exerting all kinds of body English from 60 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just as I was preparing to stifle a shout of ``Boo-yah!''
(there's absolutely no gloating allowed in lawn bowling), I heard a
sickening clank. I'd hit one of his bowls; the gantlet _ and my
opponent _ had won. Fainkich smiled and shook my hand. ``Good game,
especially for a beginner,'' he said. ``You should come back some
time.'' I just might, I told him, I just might.

BLACKOUTS LOOM AS CALIFORNIA STRUGGLES TO PROVIDE POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the state facing the threat of rolling
blackouts, the California Institute for the Arts has voluntarily
cut its power three times this week.
</P>
<P>
   To help save the power grid from failing, drawing classes at the
Valencia-based institute have met outside under shady trees, while
others have gathered around sunlit windows. But even with thousands
of schools, office buildings and industrial plants across the state
agreeing to pull the plug during peak hours in exchange for lower
electric rates, California's power system appears to be in danger
of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a precarious situation, to say the least,'' said
Steven Hansen, a spokesman for Southern California Edison, which
has 4.2 million customers. ``This is the tensest we've ever seen
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Already this summer, the state's power manager has declared a
``Stage 2'' emergencies a record nine times, including Thursday,
meaning reserves had fallen below 5 percent of demand statewide.
That's just one step short of mandatory rolling blackouts for all
customers _ a move that would interrupt everything from home air
conditioners to traffic lights in the nation's most populous state.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the California Independent System Operator, the
nonprofit, state-chartered manager of about 75 percent of the
state's deregulated power grid, said a ``Stage 3'' alert is highly
unlikely. That level emergency has never been declared before. But
no one is ruling one out, either.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland-based Bonneville Power Administration, which
markets power from the massive federally owned hydropower dams in
the Pacific Northwest, said it was warned Tuesday that blackouts in
California were imminent, but the ISO denied that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good news that it didn't happen, but we were under the
impression that it was a virtual certainty it would go this way,''
said Bonneville spokesman Edward Mosey. The discrepancy ``is
mysterious to us, unless our engineers misinterpreted the warning
from California, and they tend to be sticklers for details.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, President Clinton ordered federal agencies in the
state to cut their power use by an estimated 5 percent, and told
the federal power marketing administrations to maximize the amount
of electricity available in the state.
</P>
<P>
   No plant failures or downed power lines are behind the latest
crisis, utility officials said. Temperatures have been high, but
not at record levels in most cities, although a San Francisco area
heat wave did leave more than 90,000 customers without power in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a number of factors have combined to bring California _
as well as several other states _ to the edge of a power outage.
</P>
<P>
   Utility specialists said that deregulation of the industry,
intended to benefit consumers, caused uncertainty over future
profits that kept private investment in new power sources low. At
the same time, California's economy has been booming, raising the
demand for power by high-technology companies that use enormous
amounts of electricity and individuals whose homes are increasingly
filled with electric-powered gadgets. Increasing demand in other
states has also made importing power more difficult. The warm
weather only contributes to the power crunch, as air conditioners
become another drain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short-term, California has got a serious problem,'' said
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers Action
Network, a San Diego-based consumer group. ``It's garbage that no
one saw it coming. They knew it last year. Power consumption is no
greater than expected.''
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, the first city where uniform electric rates were
lifted under deregulation, electric bills have doubled or even
tripled this summer. On Tuesday, the ISO cut the wholesale price of
power in an attempt to reduce consumer bills.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities also continued to encourage businesses and homeowners
to sign up for a program that lowers rates in return for cutting
use during peak demand periods. More than 1,000 large businesses
and 130,000 residential customers participate in Southern
California Edison's program, Hansen said.
</P>

 &HT;    Brewer `likes to obsess on things'
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Charles Brewer's resignation as chairman of EarthLink
Inc. Wednesday raised questions about the direction of the firm
without him at the helm. EarthLink President Michael S. McQuary,
who also was MindSpring president, is a close friend of Brewer. He
addressed some of the concerns in an interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Charles seems to have made a complete break from EarthLink.
He didn't just resign from the board, but he sold most of his stock
in the company. Should other shareholders be wondering what they
should do with their stock?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think (the stock sale) says anything about the
company in this instance. It says something about Charles as an
individual. I think I have a unique perspective about Charles; I've
known him since 1982, and we were roommates when I moved to
Atlanta. He likes to obsess on things one at a time and then move
on. The last few years his obsessive focus has been on EarthLink,
and now he wants to make a completely clean break.
</P>
<P>
   Charles goes through obsessions. There was a six-month health
obsession. It was ``Operation 5'' _ he wanted to run the
five-minute mile, and that was what he was focused on and nothing
else mattered. Then it was ``Operation Washboard,'' and he was
doing all these sit-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what is he obsessed with now?
</P>
<P>
   A: His obsession has moved to his family. We'll see how long
this passion for crying babies and changing diapers will last, then
he'll move on to the next thing. It's Charles' manner to always
make a clean break.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you or any of the other former MindSpring executives feel
extra pressure to ``carry the torch'' now that Charles is gone _ to
make sure that the core values and beliefs are still a priority
even at such a large company?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is a feeling among some of the MindSpring old-timers
that we have to talk about what the core values mean to the new
hires. We were there in the early days when we could see how
effective core values and beliefs were in inspiring a company. If
you go way back in the history of MindSpring when Charles moved me
into the president position, he placed a lot of trust in me to not
waiver from his vision. I still carry that mantle, and it's my
responsibility and I don't take it lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will his departure change anything about how EarthLink is
structured as a company?
</P>
<P>
   A: Charles' goal was always to build a great company, and we are
a great company. He can be very satisfied that he set out what he
wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   Sky's (Dayton, EarthLink's new chairman) passion has always been
to harness the power of the Internet to change people's lives and
make things happen. He still has a long way to go to make his
vision happen. We're lucky to be able to replace one icon with
another icon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But for EarthLink employees and customers it's business as
usual.
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely. With all this talk about Sky and Charles and
visionaries, (EarthLink CEO) Garry Betty gets overlooked. We spend
so much time on that fact, I don't think Garry gets his due. It's
easy to overlook him because he's the guy who's happy being under
the deck shoveling the coal. But I really want to say it's the CEO
who's the most important person in any company. He's unflinching in
his resolve to make this company great, and I don't think we are
going to miss a beat.

BUSH HAS DONE WHAT A GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE HASN'T DONE SINCE
1984
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BOB RAY SANDERS 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It would be easy to say that Gov. George W. Bush,
a privileged child of an important American family, once again got
something he wanted, and that this time it was a gigantic present:
his party's nomination for president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But that would be simplistic and unfair, and it terribly
understates a man whom people have tried to label as a shallow,
inattentive ``frat boy'' whose main purpose in seeking the nation's
highest office is to avenge the defeat of his father in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Bush has had plenty of help in his bid for the White
House, and he's had lots of money. But make no mistake about it,
the governor carried his own water in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' quadrennial meeting that ended here last night
was Bush's convention. He set the stage, the tone and the agenda.
The entire event reflected his ideas and ideals.
</P>
<P>
   He proved months ago, during the grueling primary season, that
he could take a punch, that he could learn _ and learn fast _ from
his mistakes, and that, despite any distractions thrown at him by
opponents, he knew how to stay on course, stay on task and stay on
message.
</P>
<P>
   You've got to give it to him. He's been an excellent candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his Grand Old Party put on a humdinger of a convention,
one that was upbeat, more diverse than any other Republican
convention in history and one that generally made for good
television. Yes, it was scripted and programmed, with some
artificial feel-good moments, but then what major political
convention isn't?
</P>
<P>
   This candidate has been able to do what no other Republican
nominee has done since at least 1984. He unified his party.
</P>
<P>
   There are still some major philosophical differences within the
party. But because Republicans want to win so badly, they have been
able to put aside most of their differences long enough, they hope,
to get their man elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having said all that, Bush will not be a shoo-in. He still
has to convince doubters that he is capable of being the chief
executive of the world's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   He will have to make people believe that he and the party as a
whole are sincere about compassion, inclusion and diversity. And he
can't make that case by simply parading a bunch of people of color
across the television screen. There has to be some action that
speaks to their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will try to do that by touting his record in Texas. In
politics, like on the old vinyl discs, there are two sides to every
record. His opponent, of course, will be broadcasting the side that
has had the least air play.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans undoubtedly got a big bounce from their convention
and the nomination of Dick Cheney as Bush's running mate. Democrats
will need much more than a bounce. They may need one of those
rocket boosters from Cape Canaveral to help get presidential
candidate Al Gore off the ground, much less into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It can be done. Gore likes running from behind, although not
this much behind. Still, I'm convinced he will run a hard-hitting
campaign with a running mate who will offer a great contrast to
Cheney and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats already know, as was signaled here this week, that
Bush-Cheney will be running as much against Bill Clinton as Al
Gore. By election time, Republicans will want us to believe that
Clinton and Gore are joined at the hip, unable to be separated,
surgically or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to the voters to decide if that strategy will
work.

AFTER DEADLY SCHOOL SHOOTINGS, COMPLEX CIVIL LITIGATION OVER
BLAME 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PADUCAH, Ky. _ After their lives were changed by a
14-year-old slayer, the parents of the three girls he killed in a
school shooting here sued more than 50 people they said shared
responsibility for the deaths. They sued the killer and his
parents, teachers, school officials, other teen-agers, neighbors
and the makers of violent video games, Web sites and movies.
</P>
<P>
   But by this week, after two judges had dismissed virtually all
the claims, there was just one defendant remaining: the killer
himself, Michael Carneal, who is serving a life sentence after
pleading guilty but mentally ill to murder. He is the only one the
courts had said could be held liable for the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, saying they would appeal all the rulings against
them, the families of the three girls accepted a settlement of
their claims against Carneal in which he acknowledged liability for
the deaths and set damages at $42 million, an amount the families
are never likely to collect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's symbolic,'' said Gwen Hadley, whose daughter Nichole was
one of those killed. ``He is finally having to take some
responsibility for what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carneal has no assets, and his family's insurance company is
already fighting claims, saying it is not responsible for criminal
acts.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was a punctuation mark in a long legal battle
that has already produced one of the most extensive public records
in the country on a school shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the legal battle shows how difficult it is to
assign blame to the many people who, in retrospect, might have been
able to prevent rampage killings and it shows how hard it is to
unravel what really happened in cases that are, by definition,
unfathomable.
</P>
<P>
   In pretrial testimony and in hundreds of documents, the lawyer
for the families of the three girls has put together a catalog of
the mistakes, the missed warning signs and the provocations that
often contribute to rampage killings.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of the three girls say their legal setbacks show
that the courts are turning their backs on the schoolhouse
tragedies. ``They just want to be like an ostrich and pretend it
will all go away,'' said Sabrina Steger, whose daughter Kayce was
killed in the shooting when Carneal fired into a prayer group at
Heath High School on Dec. 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Carneal is the only one who killed the girls and injured
five other students, said Judge William L. Shadoan of McCracken
County Circuit Court, who has been handling one of the cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kid stole all the guns himself,'' Shadoan said in an
interview. ``He took them to school and he took the gun out of his
backpack and he started shooting.'' Whatever else happened, the
judge said, no one else did that.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Judge Edward H. Johnstone of U.S. District Court in
Paducah reached a similar conclusion in April when he dismissed a
separate case the families had filed against what called they
contended was the influence of the violent media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reasonable people,'' Johnstone wrote, ``would not conclude
that it was foreseeable to defendants that Michael Carneal, a boy
who played their games, watched their movies and viewed their Web
site materials would murder his classmates.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, evidence gathered by the parents' lawyer shows that none
of the many people who could have taken action to stop Carneal or
get him help did so. He was a boy, the court files show, who kept
knives under his mattress, flashed guns at school and wrote
homicidal and suicidal fantasies in school papers. In his room
after the killings, the police found instructions on ``butchering
the human carcass.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the crime, the testimony of other teen-agers shows,
Carneal warned many people that ``something big'' was going to
happen. But no matter what sinister possibilities others suspected,
legal experts say, bedrock principles generally hold people
responsible only when they play a role in placing someone in
danger.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' lawyer argued that the law is moving toward
encouraging people to try to prevent mass tragedies. But, however
the cases end, they have already cast unusual light on the
evolution of a school shooting.
</P>
<P>
   THE TEEN-AGERS
</P>
<P>
   It was not hard for the plaintiffs' lawyer, Mike Breen, to prove
that many of the teen-agers at Heath High had been warned. Some of
them said they expected water balloons. Some said Michael had told
them that Monday would be a ``day of reckoning.'' The court file
contains a letter from one teen-age girl to another. ``I knew
Michael was bringing a gun,'' it says, ``and that he was going to
shoot at the prayer circle Monday morning.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers' lawyers argued they had expected a prank.
Shadoan agreed. ``There may have been a moral duty or Christian
duty to do something,'' he said in court, ``but there was no legal
duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the strongest claims were against a smaller group of
teen-agers who the plaintiffs' lawyer called co-conspirators. None
of them were charged with any crime but the sheriff here said
publicly that he suspected teen-agers had helped plan the shooting
and lost their nerve.
</P>
<P>
   But what had seemed to be evidence of collaboration had become
muddied by the time of the testimony. Events that had seemed
sinister were explained away.
</P>
<P>
   A police report showed that one boy said, ``Let me in on it,''
when Michael had warned a table full of teen-agers. In a deposition
this winter the young man was asked if he had said that.
``Jokingly,'' was the answer that was difficult to disprove.
</P>
<P>
   A larger problem for the plaintiffs was that the ``conspiracy
theory'' was based in part on Michael Carneal himself, and he had
recanted it. Shortly after the killings, Michael had told an
investigator that he had planned the violence with other
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carneal said that the plan was that he would start shooting,
causing a distraction,'' a police report said, ``so that the other
boys could pick up their guns and go to their points.'' That
morning, Michael had brought four long guns wrapped in a blanket in
addition to the handgun in his backpack that he would use in the
shooting.

 WEST PADUCAH: the shooting.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By this February, Michael Carneal testified in a deposition. He
was no longer the scrawny 5 feet 2 inches he was at the time of the
crime. Now, he was 17, 6 feet 1 inch and 243 pounds, nearly an
adult, who had had time to think about consequences.
</P>
<P>
   No one else had been involved, he said. He said he had invented
the conspiracy story to tell the police ``what they wanted to
hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers following the case say appeals courts could well reverse
Shadoan on the dismissals against these teen-agers and say a jury
should decide if there is enough evidence that others participated
in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, the judge said he had not seen evidence that
any of the teen-agers other than Carneal believed there was a plan.
When the shooting started, he said, ``These kids ran, just like all
the other kids.''
</P>
<P>
   THE PARENTS
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the killings, John T. Carneal, a prominent
Paducah lawyer, went to see the principal of the school where his
son had committed murder. ``I am the head of the house, I am
responsible,'' he said, weeping, the principal testified.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of the murdered girls came to agree. Michael was a
``ticking time bomb,'' Hadley said.
</P>
<P>
   After the killings, Michael told psychiatrists he had sometimes
sobbed for no reason before the crime and was so fearful at home
that he had sometimes walked from one piece of furniture to another
at so he would not risk having some imagined person cut off his
feet.
</P>
<P>
   He once stabbed himself with a sewing needle, leaving a bruise
the size of a silver dollar but had told his parents he had been in
a bike accident. He testified that he was suicidal, ``mad at the
world,'' and hated being compared with his older sister, a model
student. The year before the killings, his mother knew, he had been
humiliated when a gossip column in the school newspaper speculated
that he and another boy had feelings for each other.
</P>
<P>
   But his father testified, ``I saw no evidence that Mike had any
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carneal's lawyer, Michael D. Moore, said, ``Michael never
did anything in front of them to indicate he had even the potential
for violence.''
</P>
<P>
   THE TEACHERS
</P>
<P>
   The picture of Michael at school is a chilling portrait of a boy
unraveling. In one school paper he said other children ``mocked and
slaughtered my self-esteem.'' In another he described a fantasy of
mutilating ``preps'' and described a boy opening fire on a group of
schoolmates.
</P>
<P>
   Michael's father testified that no one at the school had
mentioned those troubling papers. The teachers were unaware that
the boy had brought a gun to school and that he had courted
attention by giving away stolen property and talking about taking
over the school or a mall.
</P>
<P>
   But in Kentucky, as in many states, school officials are
generally protected from suits by rules of sovereign immunity that
shield government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   When he dismissed the cases against the teachers and school
officials last year, Shadoan cited those rules. ``We cannot expect
those teachers and administrators to be psychiatrists, lawyers,
psychologists, or physicians,'' he wrote. ``They are to educate our
children. Nothing more and nothing less.''
</P>
<P>
   PLANNING APPEALS
</P>
<P>
   As the lawsuits have ground on, fury over them has grown here.
Some people say the three families have blamed too many people who
did nothing wrong. Nancy C. Holm, the mother of a boy who was
injured in the shooting, wrote a letter to the editor of The
Paducah Sun last year that drew widespread comment here. It
suggested that the three families had been influenced by their
lawyer in a search for dollars. ``Things are getting out of hand,''
Holm wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In recent interviews, all three sets of parents said they were
too troubled by what they had learned about the missed chances to
avoid the killings to drop their suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``No amount of money could bring back our kids, and we would
rather have our kids back than any amount of money,'' said Judy
James, whose daughter Jessica was killed. ``All we're asking for is
for people to be accountable and responsible for what happened.''

GOP CONSERVATIVES PLEASED WITH BUSH, CHENEY CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ They haven't heard one attack on abortion, gay
rights or affirmative action. They never had a chance to cheer
their impeachment champion, Representative Henry Hyde of Illinois.
Yet most conservatives left the Republican National Convention
Thursday smiling.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day meeting was full of talk about traditionally
Democratic themes such as better schools and Social Security
reform, but bedrock conservatives feel their nominee, Texas
Governor George W. Bush, and his running mate, Dick Cheney, will be
true to their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very solidly conservative platform. Delegates are
overwhelmingly conservative and Reagan Republicans,'' said Gary
Bauer, the conservative commentator and former GOP presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a little bit of political strategy: Bush has
put together, for now, the Reagan coalition, and so he's trying for
a couple of voting groups that are part of (Al) Gore's base, but
this is going to be a fairly clear-choice election between a
pro-family, pro-life conservative and a liberal Democrat,'' Bauer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment, while widespread, was not universal.
</P>
<P>
   Willam Safire, a conservative columnist for The New York Times,
wrote Thursday that in avoiding controversial positions,
Republicans sapped vitality from the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is politics without the clash of ideas?'' he wrote.
``What's the use of a great political showcase without a partisan
show?''
</P>
<P>
   William Kristol, co-authoring an editorial in The Weekly
Standard, a conservative magazine, complained that the party's
impeachment warriors like Hyde should have been saluted.
</P>
<P>
   Under the banner ``Amnesia with a Purpose?'' Kristol and David
Tell wrote: ``Bush needn't dwell on impeachment, but he ought to
address it. Not so much to defend the honor of his party (though it
would be nice if he introduced Henry Hyde to a standing ovation),
but to define, as nothing else could, the presidency he hopes to
give us.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Bob Barr of Georgia was an impeachment manager
under Hyde on the House Judiciary Committee. During a break in a
radio show, he said Thursday that the convention was neither the
time nor the place to air congressional gripes. Conventions, he
said, are about the chosen thoughts and themes of the nominee. In
this case, conservatives known Bush is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is I feel very, very comfortable with George W.
Bush as a conservative,'' Barr said. ``I believe he is
conservative, he believes in those sort of mainstream issues that
are important to my constituents and me as conservatives, so I'm
not worried.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressman said Bush's decision to pick Cheney as his
running mate was also reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps in two regards. One, in terms of the substance of the
man, he couldn't have picked somebody with more substance and
credibility. Secondly, he has picked somebody who is a mainstream
conservative, so I think it sends a very tangible signal,'' Barr
said.
</P>
<P>
   While conservative rhetoric may have been absent from the
convention hall, it permeated the platform the party adopted last
weekend. There were traditional calls for tax cuts and more charter
schools, and the party maintained the 1996 plank flatly opposing
abortion even though Bush would allow the procedure in cases when a
woman was raped, victimized by incest or risked her life by
continuing a pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, chairman of this year's
platform committee, said Bush and conservatives were able to strike
a balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans have their voice in articulating the platform.
The candidates then come in and put their own philosophical views
into play, and we are trying to make sure that we are not as
contentious and as harsh as the '96 platform was, and we're trying
to articulate this new vision for Republicans across America,''
Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Those outside the party took a different message from the lack
of conservative distress at the short-shrifting of their causes and
heroes on the convention floor. Joe Andrew, chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, set it shoed that the convention was
nothing more than a charade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If conservatives did not think this was a show, that this
somehow was really a rebirth of the Republican Party into the
Democratic Party, conservatives would stand up and rebel and make
their views known,'' Andrew said. ``But they believe this is just
showbusiness, it's not real, this isn't the real Republican Party
anyway, so don't worry about it.''

CANDID CAMERON: BEHIND THE SCENES ON `DARK ANGEL'

weekly science-fiction column with color and black-and-white art.)
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of
producer/director/screenwriter James Cameron.) 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Science fiction is to James Cameron what the Mafia was to
Michael Corleone _ an irresistible force that pulls him back in
time and time again.
 &HT;    Cameron rewrote the sci-fi-film playbook with ``The
Terminator,'' ``Aliens,'' ``The Abyss'' and ``Terminator 2,'' and
this fall he will return to the genre with ``Dark Angel.''
 &HT;    But ``Dark Angel'' unfolds on the small screen, and Cameron
isn't directing. Instead he's co-creating the series and
co-writing/co-executive-producing a two-hour pilot with Charles
Eglee, a longtime Cameron crony who penned the director's infamous
1982 debut, ``Piranha 2: The Spawning.''
 &HT;    ``Dark Angel,'' set to launch Oct. 3 on Fox, introduces Max
(Jessica Alba), a genetically engineered young woman trying to
understand her past, hide from a dark-hat military sort named
Lydecker (John Savage) and get by in post-apocalyptic Seattle,
circa 2020. All of Max's plans are scuttled, however, when she
meets Logan Cale (Michael Weatherly), a cyberjournalist toiling
beneath the radar in a high-minded effort to right wrongs and make
a difference.
 &HT;    ``The opportunity to have a young female protagonist in a future
urban environment intrigued us,'' Cameron says by telephone from
his Los Angeles production offices. ``But we didn't want it to be
futuristic in a `Blade Runner'' sense, but in a plausible,
post-info-calypse, new-Depression, new-dustbowl era in America.
That was appealing.
 &HT;    ``Everybody projects out on a curve, as if economic prosperity
will continue, as if we'll build these great, gleaming edifices and
these starships, and all that,'' Cameron says. ``Nobody embraces
the lessons of history. The Chaos Theory shows these things can
reverse trends very rapidly.
 &HT;    ``What if there was a depression?'' he asks. ``Things in the
1920s felt very much like they feel right now. 2020 Seattle can
easily be 1932 Chicago. How you get to that could have been a
computer virus or something like that. We chose a terrorist attack
with an EMP (electro-magnetic pulse) device, which would certainly,
plausibly, do exactly what we say.''
 &HT;    Weekly hours will delve into Max's history as she seeks other
like her. The show will also follow Lydecker as he pursues Max, and
shadow Max and Logan as they deal with a mutual attraction that
circumstances, guilt and shame prevent them from pursuing ... for
now.
 &HT;    Cameron, who will likely write future episodes and might even
direct one, asserts that ``Dark Angel'' will push the envelope,
that it will make people think. Already he's catching flak for the
fact that Max's best friend is a lesbian.
 &HT;    ``We wanted to say, `Look, there are different ways to do
sci-fi,''' he says forcefully. ``You can show the future with
people walking around in silver jumpsuits, or you can show the
future as a society that has evolved down a certain road.
 &HT;    ``One of the roads, despite the fact that we show a lot of
negative evolutionary trends back to a much more corrupt society,
is that we're beyond it being an issue what your gender preference
is,'' Cameron says. ``It's just not an issue anymore.
 &HT;    ``Some people may say, `Well, that's not positive evolution.'
But you know what? Screw them. We're saying it is.''
 &HT;    While genre fanatics are intrigued by ``Dark Angel,'' they're
distressed that Cameron has dropped out of various other projects,
including ``Terminator 3,'' the ``Spider-Man'' movie and a remake
of ``Planet of the Apes.'' All three projects are now moving
forward, with others calling the shots.
 &HT;    Cameron has given his blessing for Arnold Schwarzenegger to star
in ``T3,'' but he himself won't be involved.
 &HT;    ``There are other things I want to be doing,'' he says simply.
 &HT;    ``Spider-Man'' got lost in a web of legal difficulties, Cameron
adds, while ``Planet of the Apes'' fell victim to creative
differences.
 &HT;    ``I thought I had a pretty good take on it, and I was going to
write it and produce it,'' Cameron says. ``I brought that
presentation to Fox, to (ex-film division boss) Bill Mechanic, and
Bill Mechanic disagreed with my choice of director. I said, `All
right. Fine. If we disagree, we disagree,' and that was that.
 &HT;    ``It was just one of those things where I sensed it was their
baby,'' the filmmaker says. ``At that time, it was like their
zero-billion-dollar franchise, because they'd done dick with it for
30 years or 20 years, whatever it's been.
 &HT;    ``I thought I had a way of creating something interesting, but I
got a real strong sense it was theirs,'' Cameron says. ``Having
gone through that with `Terminator,' I went, `You know what? Let it
be yours.'''

BUSH LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN WITH APPEAL TO SWING VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   By STEWART M. POWELL   
 c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
PHILADELPHIA _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush accepted the Republican
nominatof for president Thursday night by seeking to appeal to
independent voters and crossover Democrats in his quest to become
the first son to follow a father to the White House since 1824. 
Bush, an affable, pragmatic Republican, told cheering,
placard-waving delegates and guests packed into the 22,000-seat
convention center that the nation ``can begin again'' led by a
party of ``idealism and inclusion.'' The 54-year-old son of former
President George Bush urged the nation to ``seize this moment of
American promise'' and ``use these good times for great goals.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bush sketched plans to overhaul public schools, strengthen
Social Security and add prescription drug benefits to Medicare _
themes that are more often invoked by Democratic candidates than
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time for Republicans and Democrats to end the
politics of fear, '' Bush declared. ``I want to change the tone of
Washington to one of civility and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush vowed to ``confront the hard issues'' such as threats from
abroad and problems besetting Americans' health and retirement
systems at home before ``the challenges of our time become crises
for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush voiced regret about the impact of the Clinton-Gore years,
citing ``so much promise to no great purpose.'' Karen Hughes, his
campaign spokeswoman, said the two-term governor hoped to inspire
more than criticize. &QC; 
``I know the tone I want to set,'' Bush said before taking the
podium to deliver remarks that he crafted to court swing voters in
his battle with Vice President Al Gore as well as lay to rest
voters' residual concerns about his heft as a leader. ``We're going
to do things differently if given the chance to lead the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush emphasized that his brand of ``compassionate conservatism''
would reach out to disadvantaged Americans who feel left behind by
the longest economic boom in American history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are their country too,'' Bush told delegates, adding:
``Each of us must share in its promise or that promise is
diminished for all.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest bipartisan Voter.com-Battleground public opinion
survey, conducted by Democratic pollster Celinda Lake and GOP
pollster Ed Goeas, showed that the four-day GOP convention that
emphasized diversity had given the Bush-Cheney ticket a sizable
14-percentage point edge over a Gore-led ticket. Bush leads Gore,
48 percent to 34 percent. &QC; 
The survey showed Bush seizing an 18 percentage point edge over
Gore among independents and a 6 percentage point edge among women _
both constituencies won by the Clinton-Gore ticket in the last two
presidential elections to enable the elected Democrats to hold the
White House for two successive terms for the first time since
1936. &QC; 
Gore hopes to begin a comeback with his scheduled announcement on
Tuesday of his Democratic running mate. In 11 of the 12
presidential elections since 1952, the candidate who led in the
polls on Labor Day won the election. Only Ronald Reagan came from
behind in 1980 to beat President Jimmy Carter. &QC; 
Bush and Cheney planned to storm out of the GOP gathering on Friday
for a three-day campaign trip by train through Midwest swing states
including Ohio and Illinois. Republicans closed out their sixth
convention in Philadelphia since 1856 with a new GOP anthem,
entitled ``We the People,'' a blend of rock &QC;
</P>
<P>
   , blues and country written and released by country singer Billy
Ray Cyrus.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, grandson of the late Sen. Prescott Bush, R-Conn., has been
governor of the nation's third most populous state for
five-and-a-half years _ making the Republican standard bearer the
least experienced politician to lead the party since former World
War II allied commander Dwight D. Eisenhower sought the presidency
in 1952. &QC; 
Bush's running mate has been away from the political fray since
1989, serving as the Bush administration's defense secretary and
later as chief executive of Halliburton Corp., a worldwide energy
services firm based in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush tried to turn his shortage of national experience into a
political asset in his address. Bush said that while he ``may lack
the polish of Washington'' he wasn't burdened by ``a lot of things
that come with Washington experience'' such as ``enemies to fight''
or a ``stake in the bitter arguments of the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush seeks to become the first presidential son to capture the
presidency since John Quincy Adams followed his father, John Adams,
to the White House 24 years after his father's term ended. Bush
hopes to win back the White House from which his father was ousted
by then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton and then-Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn.,
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his speech ``speaks from my heard,'' adding that he
hoped his national audience would come away saying, ``This is a man
who sees a positive America _ an America for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush lightly brushed off any suggestion that his address would
be the most important of his life, quipping: ``The most important
speech was when I asked my wife to marry me _ and that went okay.''
</P>
<P>
   Before exercising on a stationary bicycle and reviewing his
speech, Bush stopped by Philadelphia's Hahnemann University
Hospital to visit former President Gerald Ford, who was admitted on
Wednesday following two minor strokes. Bush spent 20 minutes with
the 87-year-old former president, who told Bush, ``I'll be
campaigning for you in a couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said Ford was expected to make a full recovery. &QC; 
Bush said ``it did my spirits good to see that he had good color
and was alive and active and anxious to talk about the
convention.'' &QC; 
Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway fired a salvo at Bush even before
the GOP candidate had mounted the podium to deliver his address. &QC; 
``Given the high praise his father received in 1992, George junior
has a lot to live up to tonight,'' said Hattaway. ``Tonight,
America will see if there is any substance behind the smirk.''

 &HT;    Formula One event solidifies Indy's mystique
 &HT;    By Dave Lance
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The inscription on the Hall of Fame Museum at
Indianapolis Motor Speedway that calls IMS the ``Racing Capital of
the World'' is now accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, the declaration was debatable. Sure, since 1911
the track has annually hosted the most storied race in the country,
the Indianapolis 500. And in 1994, track officials added the
Brickyard 400, a race that's part of the NASCAR circuit, the most
popular racing league in America.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Brickyard 400 is Saturday, but IMS officials have
Sept. 24 circled on their calendars. That's when the fabled track
moves to a higher level _ an international level _ by hosting a
Formula One race, the United States Grand Prix, for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some may say (the inscription on the museum) is presumptuous
with just one race,'' said Fred Nation, IMS' vice president of
corporate communications and public relations. ``But the Brickyard
400 solidified that reputation and we have underscored it with the
Formula One Grand Prix.''
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate Formula One, IMS has undergone a face-lift the
past two years, erecting a pagoda at the start-finish line to serve
as a control tower, a suite on the top of it, a media center
directly next door and pit-side garages to house the 22 Formula One
cars.
</P>
<P>
   The road course for the U.S. Grand Prix is 2.6 miles long, 1
3/10 of which winds through the infield and the other half the
actual oval.
</P>
<P>
   For officials at IMS, adding Formula One and NASCAR races was
the culmination of talks that began in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``(NASCAR founder) Bill France Sr. started attending the
Indianapolis 500 in the late '40s,'' Nation said, ``and he and
(former IMS owner) Tony Hulman had a lifelong commitment to
bringing NASCAR and Winston Cup to IMS. The same is true with
Formula One.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Hulman's position was he was always open to doing
additional races here, but it had to be a big event. When Tony
George became president, one of his goals was to add a second
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Nation said George first approached Formula One officials in the
early '90s about adding a second race. He said the two parties
talked feverishly, but George decided the time wasn't right because
the last time Formula One had raced in the United States, it wasn't
overwhelmingly successful.
</P>
<P>
   Still, hosting Formula One remained a priority for George, who
instructed golf-course designer Pete Dye to make room for a grand
prix when Dye touched up the IMS' links in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   George shifted his attention to NASCAR and renewed talks with
the circuit's officials. In 1992, NASCAR tested at the track and
two years later, the Brickyard 400 was held there.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR may have its Daytona 500, a race that challenges the Indy
500 as most prestigious, but NASCAR drivers say winning at IMS is
the ultimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put it in perspective,'' said driver Ricky Rudd, who won
the Brickyard in 1997, ``I think we've won 20 Winston Cup races,
but I don't think anybody would probably remember any of them with
the exception of maybe the Indy race.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's just because there's something about Indy. What
probably makes Indy so neat is that it would be like going to a
museum or historical landmark and being able to race around in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers, like CART's Juan Montoya, are awed by the track.
Montoya made his first trip to IMS a good one, winning the Indy 500
in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot being here,'' Montoya said. ``I think what
makes this place special is the people. The people who come here,
how do you say it? They're alley cats. The people have been good
and it's a friendly place.''

 &HT;    Wallace maneuvers to contend for title
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Rusty Wallace won at Pocono Raceway two weeks ago
and raced into contention for the Winston Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the Pennsylvania 500, Wallace jumped from ninth to
fifth in the points standings. The 1989 Winston Cup champion now
trails leader Bobby Labonte by 268 points with 15 races remaining.
</P>
<P>
   At Indianapolis Motor Speedway, site of Saturday's Brickyard
400, Wallace has five top-10 finishes, but he has not won it in the
six years of the event. He was fourth in the 1994 inaugural event
and second the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The importance of track position will be at an all-time high
this weekend at Indy,'' Wallace said. ``Like I've said so often
this season, these cars are so sensitive to track position, it's
unreal. If you get behind a car, you lose all your downforce on
your front end, and you can't hardly pass cars. So even if you put
four tires on and think you're gonna have better tires than
everybody else, you get so hurt in aerodynamics that it really
doesn't show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where all the big-time importance with pit strategy
comes into play, and, hopefully, (crew chief) Robin (Pemberton) and
our team will make the best decisions on race day.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's performance at Pocono made up for a bad decision in
the June race there. He ruined his chance to win when he insisted
on taking four tires instead of the two tires the rest of the
leaders took. Wallace finished a disappointing 10th and later
second-guessed his stratethat the in-house teams were getting. I
understood that going in, and you have to accept that, but I got to
the point where I needed to improve the performance of my race
teams, so we switched to Ernie Elliott engines. He's in the
business to provide engines to race teams, and I felt like I was
going to get a better piece of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't do it in house and you're not a multi-car team, you
need to look for the best technology and the best information
that's out there. We're looking to partner with another Ford team
so we can make sure that we're gaining as much information as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your restrictor plate and aerodynamics program is lacking.
What can you do to change that?
</P>
<P>
   A: We have not been able to get in the wind tunnel with our
restrictor-plate cars, and that has just shot us in the foot. We're
going to work very hard to get better prepared for Talladega this
year and for the 2001 Daytona 500. We've got to spend a lot more
money on that part of our program _ money that was not in the
budget for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you rate the Brickyard 400 in importance to the sport?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's probably No. 2 behind the Daytona 500. But as far as
testing, you only go there once a year, so you question putting the
money and resources into it for one race. But there's a lot you can
learn there because there is so much on-site timing and other data
available. Indianapolis is the best-known race track in the world,
and it's an honor for NASCAR's Winston Cup Series to be racing
there.

   WINSTON CUP NOTES
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth leads rookie battle
</P>
<P>
   Matt Kenseth holds a 21-point lead over Dale Earnhardt Jr. in
the NASCAR Winston Cup Series Rookie of the Year standings. Most
figured ``Little E'' would be a shoo-in for the award, but
Kenseth's steady driving has gained the low-key rookie plenty of
respect from other drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth is his own toughest critic, saying ``The beginning of
the year, toward the first third, we were pretty fast but not very
consistent. The one thing I've really worked hard on since
Rockingham and Atlanta is to be consistent. We have improved over
the last few months, finishing regularly in the top 20; we just
haven't been as fast as we needed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for `Mr. Excitement' to be singing the praises of
Indy
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to describing the world's most famous race track,
most Winston Cup drivers speak with respect. One driver who doesn't
consider Indianapolis Motor Speedway to be paradise, though, is
Jimmy Spencer. Let's just say it has to do more with two wrecks in
six starts at the historic 2.5-mile oval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never had a good finish here _ I've been in the hospital so
many times in Indy, they know me personally,'' Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
   In the inaugural Brickyard 400 in 1994, Spencer's ride blew a
tire and wrecked into the wall. It hit so hard that Spencer broke
three ribs and his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996, I was put into the wall and spent three days in the
hospital and three weeks out of the car,'' Spencer recalls. He
blames his history at the track, which includes no top-10 finishes,
as ``tough luck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go in thinking that the track owes you, that's a
mistake,'' Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
   Good memories of Indianapolis
</P>
<P>
   Buckshot Jones will be racing just down the street from
Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Friday's Busch race, the Kroger 200
at Indianapolis Raceway Park. Jones won his last pole at IRP in
July 1998. His only other career pole was at Rockingham in October
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Qualifying is crucial at IRP,'' Jones said. ``If you don't
start up front you may get stuck having to put on two tires instead
of four during pit stops just to gain track position.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin a favorite in IROC race
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Saturday's Winston Cup race, Mark Martin also
will be competing in Friday's IROC race. Martin is the clear
favorite, winning both of the previous IROC races at Indy. He
started 10th last year, but led the most laps and won the race. He
ended up finishing second by one point in the final IROC standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was disappointing,'' said Martin, who will be starting
11th in the 12-car field Friday. ``I did everything I had to do,
but sometimes that just isn't quite enough. I'm in a little better
shape this year to win a fifth championship. I don't have quite as
much ground to make up in just one race.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin holds the ninth spot in the Winston Cup standings with
2,487 points.

 &HT;    Georgia Power taking racial bias suit 'very seriously'
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Juanita Baranco, the Atlanta businesswoman who will
co-chair Georgia Power Co.'s new diversity council, says she will
approach racial discrimination charges against the company with an
open mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking it very seriously,'' Baranco said of the lawsuit
filed last week by three Georgia employees against the utility and
its parent Southern Co.
</P>
<P>
   Baranco is out of town this week and said she has not seen the
lawsuit and will reserve comment on the particulars until she has.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in Fulton Superior Court, alleges that
Georgia Power fosters a ``pattern of discriminating against
African-Americans'' who work there and shows ``reckless
indifference'' to a racially hostile workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Power President David Ratcliffe responded immediately,
naming Baranco, one of the company's three African-American board
members, to co-chair with him a Diversity Action Council that
includes senior company executives.
</P>
<P>
   Baranco, speaking by telephone from Minneapolis, said she was
surprised, ``very much so,'' by many of the allegations in the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Power is committed to diversity, she said. ``Their track
record is pretty open and pretty accessible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Baranco said, ``we need to make sure we have an open-door
policy all the way to the top'' for workers to make complaints of
racial discrimination. ``Having an open, honest forum so employees
will feel completely comfortable in expressing their opinions will
be critical,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Baranco is co-owner with her husband and executive vice
president of Baranco Automotive Group.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Power has until Aug. 28 to file its response to the
complaint. Ratcliffe has said the company is open to a settlement,
but lawyers for the two sides have not reported any meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both in the beginning stage of litigation,'' said Steven
J. Rosenwasser, attorney with Boudarant, Mixon &AMP; Elmore, which is
representing the three Georgia Power employees. The Atlanta firm is
also one of the firms representing Coca-Cola Co. employees in a
similar suit.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for a costly settlement or judgment against the
company does not seem to have registered on Wall Street. Southern
Co. stock, following a trend in the utility industry, has risen by
more than $1 a share since the suit was filed Thursday. ``We have
not been considering it in our evaluation of Southern Co. stock,''
said Barry Abramson, an analyst with PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   But the suit has attracted notice in the U.S. Virgin Islands,
where Southern Energy Inc., Southern's international subsidiary, is
negotiating with the government to purchase 80 percent of the
island's water and power company for $400 million. The legislature
votes on the deal a week from today. Two local newspapers published
stories about the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our sister company that the suit was filed against. We
have never had an incident like that at Southern Energy,'' an SEI
spokesman was quoted by the Independent newspaper as saying. ``This
is something we just won't put up with. We are a multinational
company. We have to deal with multiple cultures, races and
religious beliefs of our employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Kuemmel, a reporter for the Independent, said politicians
who are critical of the hotly-debated sale have been talking about
the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the fact that Georgia Power is a sister company of
SEI means the issue probably ``won't have much weight'' when the
legislature votes.

CHENEY FIRM FINANCED SPONSORS OF BILL TO LIMIT ASBESTOS-SUIT
LIABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER and LISE OLSEN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Cheney and the giant energy company he will leave to run
for vice president have contributed more than $150,000 to members
of Congress who sponsored legislation that would limit the ability
of workers to sue companies for asbestos exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The Halliburton Co., an oil field services company based in
Dallas, and its subsidiaries have had about 273,300 suits filed
against them since 1976 by workers suffering from asbestos-related
disease. Many of those suits were filed before Cheney became
chairman of the board and chief executive officer in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1999, 107,650 suits for damages were still
pending, including 46,400 new suits filed against the corporation
last year, according to the firm's annual report filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, 59, says he will resign on Aug. 16 to concentrate on the
Republican campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton's political action committees and Cheney contributed
$494,452 to congressional candidates from 1997 through mid-2000. Of
that, $157,000 went to members of Congress who co-sponsored the
asbestos legislation _ 59 Republicans and three Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, as an individual, donated $12,500 to members who
sponsored or co-sponsored the asbestos bills.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions from Cheney and the political action
committees of Halliburton and its subsidiaries went to 48 of the 77
lawmakers who co-sponsored the Fairness in Asbestos Compensation
Act in the House of Representatives and 14 of 29 co-sponsors of
similar legislation in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton defended their contributions and noted that they
were made in full compliance with campaign laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our PAC has made contributions without regard to the pending
asbestos legislation. Any similarities between the supporters of
such legislation and the recipients of contributions from our PAC
is purely coincidental,'' Zelma Branch, a company spokeswoman said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Gribbins, Halliburton's vice president for government
affairs, added: ``We give money to candidates for a variety of
reasons, usually to those who are supportive of the business
agenda, the things that are important to us, like taxes, trade or
something specific like this asbestos issue.''
</P>
<P>
   A controversial bill
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is a highly controversial package promoted and
financed by the GAF Corp. and others in the asbestos industry. This
year, for the third straight year, the bill didn't make it to the
floor for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the House Judiciary Committee narrowly approved the
legislation by a vote of 18-15, with most Republicans supporting it
and most Democrats opposed.
</P>
<P>
   But seeing dwindling support, Illinois Republican Henry Hyde,
the Judiciary Committee chairman, did not send the bill to the full
House for a vote. Had the bill passed, few believed that President
Clinton would have signed it.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 committee members who received the contributions from
Halliburton, 10 voted in favor of the bill. The 11th member missed
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The bill calls for the establishment of an Office of Asbestos
Compensation under the Justice Department. Government-approved
doctors, using criteria defined in the law, would be gatekeepers,
issuing a pass to qualifying victims who wished to sue or seek a
government-determined settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side disputes there is a problem that needs to be
addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Public interest groups estimate that over the past 25 years,
settlements have been made in more than 1 million asbestos cases
industrywide, and 450,000 more may be pending.
</P>
<P>
   $99 million for suits
</P>
<P>
   Although Halliburton is an enormous operation with more than
100,000 employees in 120 countries, it is a relatively small player
when it comes to asbestos litigation, at least when compared to
W.R. Grace &AMP; Co., GAF and the Johns Manville Corp. Nevertheless,
Halliburton has spent $99 million to settle or dispose of 129,650
asbestos suits, according to company records.
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos was used for decades in protective clothing,
insulations, pipe coatings, fireproofing and many other industrial
uses. Millions of workers in hundreds of industries, including the
oil business, were exposed to the deadly fibers. Fatal
asbestos-related diseases often take more than 20 years after
exposure to manifest themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some citizens groups were critical of the industry's efforts to
push the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   USAction, a health care consumer group affiliated with
organizations including the American Federation of State, County,
and Municipal Employees; the Communication Workers of America, and
the Service Employees International Union, opposes the legislation
and didn't mince words when asked for its view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cheney-led Halliburton Co. has been an integral part of an
asbestos industry which knowingly poisoned its own workers for
years and is still trying to get off the hook. That industry _
which is counting on special treatment from a Bush-Cheney
administration _ has publicly vowed that it will be bringing its
bailout legislation back to Congress next year,'' said William
McNary, president of USAction.
</P>
<P>
   McNary said Halliburton should have settled its claims with the
workers. ``Instead, Cheney chose to gamble that federal legislation
could be passed to allow his company to escape its responsibility
to the people it harmed,'' McNary said.
</P>
<P>
   A blizzard of suits
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court said something had to be done
to break the logjam of asbestos cases clogging the court system.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist said the situation cries out for
a legislative solution.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsors insist it will end the backup of hundreds of
thousands of victims waiting for their day in court and prevent
personal-injury lawyers from pocketing large chunks of the
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition _ mostly unions, victim groups, consumer
coalitions and personal-injury lawyers _ called the legislation the
``Asbestos Industry Relief Act'' because it will prevent thousands
of terminally ill victims from filing suit or holding the industry
accountable for their asbestos-related disease.
</P>
<P>
   The committee debates often turned into an angry circus with
asbestos-industry lawyers accusing the attorneys for those with
asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma with being ambulance
chasers who oppose the legislation because it will eliminate
millions of dollars in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the battle centered on the medical criteria that
the government would use to screen applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The criteria, developed for the most part by asbestos-industry
consultants, was soundly criticized by nationally recognized
pulmonary and cancer specialists, who called the proposed standards
``antiquated,'' ``exclusionary'' and ``barbaric.''
</P>
<P>
   Tears were shed in the committee hearing room as asbestos
victims from Libby, Mont., some clutching tanks of oxygen, told how
hundreds in their tiny town were killed or sickened from asbestos
that contaminated the vermiculite dug from a mine owned by Grace.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, denounced the
legislation, saying it would relieve corporations of their
responsibilities to fairly compensate workers injured by their
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   `Wait 'til next year'
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait 'til next year,'' was the headline of a full-page ad in a
Capitol Hill newspaper for lawmakers. The ad was bought by the
Coalition for Asbestos Resolution, a Washington-based lobbying
group supporting the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing the old Brooklyn Dodgers' battle cry, the coalition
told lawmakers reading Roll Call last week that the industry-funded
group would be back next year to push for passage of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition is funded by the asbestos and construction
industries, with most of its money coming from the GAF Corp., a
private company owned almost entirely by Sam Heyman of Westport,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   GAF Corp., which is leading the lobbying effort against the
bill, has made about $178,500 through its PAC and its employees in
donations to federal candidates from 1997 to the present, of which
about $66,250 went to co-sponsors of the asbestos legislation.
Although Grace has been the target of hundreds of thousands of
suits, its political action committee donated nothing to the bill's
supporters, according to Federal Elections Commission documents.
</P>
<P>
   Millions were spent by both sides _ the asbestos industry and
the trial lawyers _ in lobbying for and against the bill. The
battle got down to the glitzy television ads saturating the home
states of key members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a high-profile, prolonged legislative face-off
over the past year, not only in the Congress but on the airwaves in
Montana, Minnesota and the metropolitan Washington area,'' said
John Bell, a spokesman for the Association of Trial Lawyers of
America. ``We've calculated that Sam Heyman and the asbestos
industry have invested some $20 million in their campaign _ and
although unsuccessful so far, they've outspent us and our allies by
more than 10-to-1.''
</P>
<P>
   Direct donations to the bill's sponsors represent only a part of
the effort to influence Congress. Far more dollars are given for
lobbying expenses, and in ``soft money'' _ donations to party
political action committees that are often funneled to campaigns.
Halliburton has donated at least $282,050 in ``soft money,'' mostly
to state and federal Republican Party committees.

LAURA BUSH PROMISES TO WORK ON EDUCATION &HT;    By DAN FREEDMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspaper
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Laura Bush told an audience of 2,200 Republican
women Thursday that if her husband, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, is
elected president, she will be an advocate for preparing young
children to go to school.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing members of the National Federation of Republican
Women, she talked about her effort as first lady of Texas to ``help
preschoolers develop skills to begin school ready to read and
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   The other goal of her ``early childhood initiative'' in Texas
was to help parents understand ``the importance that early love and
nurturing'' have on a child's future prospects, she said, adding
that if she becomes first lady, ``I'll expand my committment to
helping children and families all over America.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush spoke at a $150-a-plate luncheon tribute to her
organized by the federation, which netted about $100,000 for its
grassroots effort to promote Republican ideas on education during
the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way you and I raise our children today will profoundly
impact our society tomorrow,'' she said. ``My experience as a mom
and as an elementary school teacher taught me how smart children
really are, how eager they are to learn and how easily we can fail
them ... if we don't have high standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribute included a biographical video on Laura Bush in which
her mother, Jenna Welch, talked about how she read books to Laura
as a child and how Laura practiced teaching before her dolls.
</P>
<P>
   The governor introduced his wife's speech just hours before
delivering his own acceptance speech at the Republican National
Convention. Comparing her convention speech Monday night with his,
Bush said, ``Laura certainly raised the bar, if you know what I
mean.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Monday night speech, Laura Bush gently tried stealing
some of the Democrats' thunder on education. Referring to Vice
President Al Gore, she said, ``George's opponent has been visiting
schools lately and sometimes when he does, he spends the night
before at the home of a teacher. Well, George spends every night
with a teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   She was a teacher and librarian in Austin and Houston before her
marriage to Bush in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   He has declared that education is a cornerstone of his campaign.
He often mentions that test scores of minority students in Texas
have gone up in the five years since he was elected governor.
</P>
<P>
   In his prepared acceptance speech, he pledged to make ``Head
Start an early learning program, teach all of our children to read,
and renew the promise of America's public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's education program stresses high standards and
accountability for student learning. Under his plan, federal funds
earmarked for schools in academic trouble could be diverted into
vouchers for parents who want to send their children to other
schools, including private ones.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches, he uses phrases such as ``there are no second-rate
children, and there are no second-rate dreams,'' and says he wants
to make sure that ``every child is educated and no child is left
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also stresses high standards and accountability but focuses
on school construction and on hiring more teachers to make class
sizes smaller. He has proposed spending $115 billion of the budget
surplus to create an Education Reform Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most polls showed Gore leading Bush on the issue
of who would do a better job on education. But Bush has been
closing the gap. In a Los Angeles Times poll released earlier this
week, Gore led by one percentage point on education, 42 percent to
41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Education ranks high as a campaign issue. The Battleground Poll,
taken during the convention by Republican pollster Ed Goeas and
Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, showed education in second place
behind ``restoring moral values'' as a key concern to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are aware of the extent to which education has been
an Achilles heel for them in past elections.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's luncheon, Florence Shapiro, a Texas state senator
from Plano, Texas, who preceded Mrs. Buksh at the podium, said,
``For too long, Democrats have acted like they own the issue of
education.,'' But she added that now, ``the message is clear: From
this day forward, education is our issue.''

 &HT;    Terrapins looking to rebound from disappointing '99 season
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Last year, Maryland started 5-2, its best beginning
since 1984. The Terps weren't wondering whether they were going to
bowl but what their choices might be. But a funny thing happened to
the Terps on the way to postseason play. They didn't make it.
</P>
<P>
   After the auspicious start, Ron Vanderlinden's crew was
dispatched by Duke, N.C. State, Florida State and Virginia in the
last month of the season and went home with a 5-6 mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 5-2, we thought we were pretty secure with a bowl spot,''
said senior free safety Shawn Forte, an all-America candidate. ``It
was so close last year and it actually came down to the last drive
in the last game of the year against Virginia. That was a
heart-breaker. We left everything on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryland has several things going for it this time around.
</P>
<P>
   The first is senior tailback LaMont Jordan, who is being touted
as a Heisman Trophy candidate. Jordan rushed for 1,632 yards last
season, averaged 6.1 yards per carry and rushed for 148.4 yards per
game, fifth in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The only potential problem is that Jordan must do well in summer
school to be eligible. Although the Maryland folks are playing down
Jordan's situation, the word is that the coaching staff is holding
its breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``LaMont's situation is going to be fine,'' Forte said. ``Look,
we're ready to get it on, move on to 2000. LaMont is a vital part
of our team, and I'm not worried. He's working out, and he looks
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is a legitimate Heisman candidate, Forte said. ``The
first thing you notice about him is his feet,'' he said. ``He's
really shifty for a person his size. I think it's everybody's dream
to be on the same field with a Heisman Trophy candidate. This is
great for us, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's quarterback, freshman Cal McCall, might not be the
starter this fall. McCall completed 52 percent of his passes for
1,264 yards and rushed for 256 yards. But transfer Shaun Hill was
rated one of the top junior-college quarterbacks in the nation at
Hutchinson Junior College in Kansas, and Hill is listed as a
co-starter on the Terp depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta native Latrez Harrison, the quarterback who rejected
Auburn to go to Maryland, is no better than No. 3 on the depth
chart.
</P>
<P>
   The Terp defense was in the middle of the ACC in 1999, but it
might suffer from the absence of All-American cornerback Lewis
Sanders, who went early to the NFL. Maryland's defensive line is
being rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   But Forte said Maryland has strengths. ``Linebacker is going to
be a strong suit,'' he said. ``We're going to put more emphasis on
throwing the ball. Losing our last four games last year has been
nothing but a motivator. There's been a steady progression, and
we've gotten better every year. We're right on course.''
</P>
<P>
   Forte has set his own goal. ``Our students tore down the goal
posts last year after a big basketball win,'' he said. ``Maybe we
can get a football win for them.''

MASSACRES MAR TALKS BETWEEN INDIA, KASHMIRI SEPARATISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATTISINGHPORA, India _ This week an end to a half century of
violence finally seemed within reach in the Kashmir Valley, the
strategic Himalayan region over which nuclear rivals India and
Pakistan have fought two wars.
</P>
<P>
   After the largest group of separatists fighting Indian rule
declared a ceasefire last week, India reciprocated, and Thursday
sat down with the militant group for the first peace talks since a
deadly rebellion erupted in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But even before negotiations began, powerful forces struck, in
an attempt to derail an armistice. In nine attacks over a 24-hour
period that ended Wednesday night, more than 100 people lay
slaughtered across Jammu and Kashmir state _ the worst single day
of massacres of unarmed civilians in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   As with so much of the violence that has wracked this verdant
valley, there is scant proof of who is behind the bloodshed. But,
by Indian army and Kashmiri estimates, from 29,000 to 70,000
civilians have been killed in the uprising.
</P>
<P>
   India blamed bands of Pakistan-supported Muslim militants who
opposed last week's ceasefire declared by the largest guerrilla
group, the Hezb-ul Mujahedeen. The militants denied it, saying
their targets are military, not civilian. Pakistan accused
``renegade elements'' of India's security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee vowed to go forward
with peace efforts, even as his military forces announced a major
assault Thursday to rout out the suspected killers. Vajpayee's
envoy held historic, first-time talks with the Hezb-ul Mujahedeen,
but Hezb-ul's leadership threatened to revoke the ceasefire by
Tuesday if India refuses to include Pakistan in negotiations, a
condition New Delhi has long opposed.
</P>
<P>
   New Delhi regards Kashmir _ a former princely state whose Hindu
ruler acceded to Indian rule after an invasion by armed Pakistanis
_ as a part of the Indian state. Pakistan sees Kashmir, India's
only Muslim-majority state, as part of the Islamic nation of
Pakistan born out of the partition of India in 1947. A large number
of Muslim Kashmiris used to favor Pakistan, but many are by now so
disillusioned and tired of the carnage that they want independence
from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   With each new massacre, more Kashmiris lose trust in authorities
who claim to represent their interests _ Indian security forces,
Kashmiri separatists, and Pakistanis who raise a battlecry for a
free Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   In Chattisinghpora, just a few miles from two of this week's
attacks, residents can feel the pain of the newest victims more
acutely than most. It was here one night in late March that men in
fatigues burst into the isolated village at the end of muddy
hilltop road brandishing weapons. They went from one
earthen-floored home to another in this village of 300 families,
and hustled out 36 Sikh men _ a religious sect that has been
neutral and previously untouched by the insurgency. Along a fence
next to the Sikh temple and in front of a shrine, the attackers
lined up the men and shot them.
</P>
<P>
   The shoes of the victims lie in silent testimony beneath the
brick temple wall where bullet holes are still visible. At the end
of a rugged path where the other 18 were slain, a blackboard lists
their names.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, on a visit to New Delhi when the massacre
occurred, denounced the violence, and Prime Minister Vajpayee
immediately blamed Pakistan-backed militants intent on disrupting
Kashmir. Pakistan accused Indian agents of disguising themselves as
militants to tarnish the image of Muslim separatists and their
supporters in Islamabad during Clinton's visit. Residents of this
traumatized village still don't know who to blame.
</P>
<P>
   The signs are confusing and contraditory. Witnesses say the
attackers wore military-type uniforms, but civilians shoes. They
spoke Urdu, the language of Pakistan _ not the local Kashmiri
dialect, nor Hindi, the language of most Indian security forces _
but they shouted ``Long live India!'' One attacker brandished a
liquor, unimaginable for an Islamic jihad warrior. But the one man
whom locals recognized was a local Muslim militant.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurriyat, a coalition of separatist leaders, ``say the
government is behind the attack. The government says Pakistan is
behind it. We have been betrayed and we don't know who did this,''
said Ravinder Paul Singh, 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were Afghan militants helped by Kashmiri guides,''
declared an inspector with India's Border Security Forces, who was
one of the first to respond to the crime scene. ``Ask yourself: why
would Indian security forces come to attack in uniform? Whey would
they shout pro-India slogans? Why wouldn't they dress in civilian
clothes and shout slogans for Pakistan?''
</P>
<P>
   Bitti Kour, 25, lost her husband, Karnal Singh, a 30-year-old
businessman. Her head covered with a black shawl, she recounted in
a halting voice that the attackers went from house to house at
dusk, rounding up the men of the village and telling their wives
they would be playing a game with them. Fifteen minutes later, she
heard shots and screams, and she rushed out to see the bleeding
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Asked who she believed was responsible, Kour abruptly ended the
conversation when a neighbor interjected that she should keep quiet
to protect herself and her two children. ``We don't suspect
anyone,'' she said curtly.
</P>
<P>
   Local newspapers have their own ideas. The Kashmir Observer
called the string of massacres ``a deep conspiracy against the
people and the state.'' The paper implied Indian forces were behind
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only those on the embattled Indian side of Kashmir who
have been slain under mysterious circumstances. Tens of thousands
who live along the heavily-militarized line separating Indian
Kashmir from Pakistani Kashmir are caught in daily crossfire
between the two militaries, losing their limbs or their lives. Some
villages have endured ambushes. Almost anyone who lives along the
line believes the army on the other side targets civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Abdul Hamid, 70, a farmer from Lanjot village in the
Kotli sector of Pakistan-held Kashmir who lost 14 family members,
including his wife, two sons, one daughter, and four grandchildren
in a midnight assault this year on his tiny home less than 100
yards from Indian military posts.
</P>
<P>
   Hamid had gone to the Pakistani city of Rawalpindi for an eye
operation, and was not at home asleep like the rest of his clan
when green-uniformed murderers attacked. His eyes still go
bloodshot and wet with tears when he is asked to speak about the
attacks months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family has been slaughtered!'' he cried, beating his chest
with fists as he crouched over the 14 graves _ mounds of earth clad
with white sheets, strands of colored tinsel and plastic flowers,
five of them miniature-sized because the victims were children.
Every morning, Hamid prays for an hour over the bodies, raising his
open palms heavenward to ask for God's guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Hamid and soldiers from the nearby Pakistani military posts are
sure Indian commandos were responsible for the dastardly act.
Indian officers say they would never target civilians, and blame
Pakistani soldiers and militants for killing their own civilians to
sway Kashmiri opinion against peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever is behind them, the recurrent massacres have served to
entrench public opinion against soldiers and authorities on both
sides, and the militants who have made life miserable, hardening
most Kashmiri people's resolve that their land will be safe and
peaceful only when it is free.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want independence until death,'' declared Muhammad Yunus,
40, who lost his wife and two children and was himself injured in
the Lanjot massacre. ``I had only one son and he was sacrificed for
Kashmir. If I had 10 sons, I would sacrifice them all. Till the
last drop of blood, we want independence.''

 &HT;    Wallace maneuvers for position
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Rusty Wallace won at Pocono Raceway two weeks ago and
raced into contention for the Winston Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the Pennsylvania 500, Wallace jumped from ninth to
fifth in the points standings. The 1989 Winston Cup champion now
trails leader Bobby Labonte by 268 points with 15 races remaining.
</P>
<P>
   At Indianapolis Motor Speedway, site of Saturday's Brickyard
400, Wallace has five top-10 finishes, but he has not won in the
six years of the event. He was fourth in the 1994 inaugural event
and second the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The importance of track position will be at an all-time high
this weekend at Indy,'' Wallace said. ``Like I've said so often
this season, these cars are so sensitive to track position, it's
unreal. If you get behind a car, you lose all your down force on
your front end, and you can't hardly pass cars. So even if you put
four tires on and think you're going to have better tires than
everybody else, you get so hurt in aerodynamics that it really
doesn't show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where all the big-time importance with pit strategy
comes into play, and, hopefully, (crew chief) Robin (Pemberton) and
our team will make the best decisions on race day.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's performance at Pocono made up for a bad decision in
the June race there. He ruined his chances to win when he insisted
on taking four tires instead of the two that the rest of the
leaders took. Wallace finished a disappointing 10th and
second-guessed his strategy. After his win in the next Pocono race,
two weeks ago, Wallace was so excited in the post-race news
conference that he said the team could have five victories by the
end of the season. He has two, with the other coming in the first
Bristol race.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace has had excellent qualifying runs, with seven poles this
season. But he has not won after starting first.

 c.2000 The Chicago Sun-Times  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you dropped from another planet or a distant time zone into
the United States of the year 2000, the first thing you'd ask would
be: where is everybody going, and why are they using so many weird
contraptions to get there?
</P>
<P>
   We've never had so many options when it comes to getting around.
As I roamed the Chicago metropolitan area over the weekend, I
tallied up nearly 20 different modes of transportation, from the
radical to the relaxing to the ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   It started when I was strolling downtown Chicago on Saturday
morning and I encountered a family of five on Wabash Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Mom and Dad were holding long cardboard boxes; each of their
three children was carrying a shiny metal device. At first I
thought they had golf clubs _ but when they began to unfold the
contraptions, I realized the excited kids were new owners of those
lightweight scooters that have been popping up everywhere on city
and suburban streets in the last several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Made of aluminum or stainless steel, these non-motorized
scooters weigh only about 6 pounds and can be collapsed into a
tight bundle that resembles a folded-up telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent research revealed that stores from Wal-Mart to Jewel
Osco to Sharper Image have been stocking various models with names
like the Razor Rollerboard, which retails for about $75-$125. (More
advanced versions can go for several hundred dollars.)
</P>
<P>
   The lightweight scooter craze was launched a couple of years ago
in Asian cities like Tokyo and Hong Kong. Now there are more than
1.2 million scooters on the streets of Japan, while in Hong Kong
there's been an outbreak of counterfeit scooter sales _ cheap,
unsafe knockoffs.
</P>
<P>
   By late last year, the fad had spread to Europe; now it's
sweeping North America. Huffy's Micro Scooter, for example,
currently is the top-selling sporting goods product in the United
States. In Calgary, one store sold its entire supply of 600 Oxygen
scooters in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   The other day I tried to navigate some side streets with one of
these scooters _ a top-level, $279, K2 Kickboard, on loan from a
Chicago dealer who told me he gets 20 calls a day from prospective
scooter buyers, and can barely keep up with demand.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after I started pushing and gliding, I was accosted by
three hair-dyed boys on their bikes who were begging to try it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go to your room,'' I told them.
</P>
<P>
   I felt like an idiot as I zigged and zagged down the block, and
eyewitnesses confirmed that I looked like an idiot. For kids and
twentysomethings, though, I think these things are great. It's sort
of like surfing on pavement.
</P>
<P>
   So now the scooter-cruisers have joined the parade of busy
travelers jamming our sidewalks, roads and waterways. Try to walk _
just walk _ along any lakefront or popular tourist area in a major
city these days. It's an exercise in dodging, weaving, bumping,
stopping, starting, stopping again, starting again and reacting to
the warnings of ``On your left!'' and ``Right behind you!'' from
bicyclists and in-line skaters and, I don't know, goofs on Pogo
sticks and unicycles.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the streets of the city, you have pedestrians,
power-walkers, parents with strollers, joggers, joggers who push
their babies in three-wheeled devices, skateboarders,
motorcyclists, more in-line skaters, bicyclists, buses,
automobiles, taxis, vans, SUVs, construction trucks,
horse-and-carriage drivers, motorized scooters and roaming bands of
hacky-sackers.
</P>
<P>
   I'm still waiting for my personal jet-pack to be invented, as
was promised by the futurists of the 1960s and 1970s, and it better
happen soon. We're running out of room on the ground and in the
water.

 &HT;    ARMEY MAKES ANTI-GAY JOKE WITH HOMOSEXUAL LAWMAKER AS THE PUNCH
LINE
 &HT;    Eds: Note language in 6th graf.
 &HT;    By MARK SHERMAN
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, made
an anti-gay joke to a group of journalists at a party here that
used Rep. Barney Frank's, D-Mass., homosexuality as the punch line.
</P>
<P>
   The remark was the second time Armey has referred to Frank's
sexuality to journalists, and it occurred in the context of a
Republican convention that was tightly scripted to highlight the
GOP's inclusiveness. The convention, which ended Thursday, featured
an openly gay speaker, Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Armey spokeswoman Michelle Davis said the comment was taken out
of context. But, after talking to her boss, she confirmed that
Armey had made a joke to five political cartoonists and humorist
Dave Barry when they met at a crowded late-night party on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mike Luckovich, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Atlanta
Journal-Constitution's cartoonist, the following exchange occurred:
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you really Dick Armey?'' Barry asked.
</P>
<P>
   Armey replied, ``Yes, I am Dick Armey. And if there is a dick
army, Barney Frank would want to join up.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry reported in his own column today (Friday) that Armey told
a dirty joke linked to his name, but omitted any reference to
Frank.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the Armey spokeswoman, was not at the party. But she got
Armey's account before returning a telephone call for this story.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said Armey anticipated that someone in the group would use
the joke and decided to utter it first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad joke and he was just trying to get it over with,''
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Armey called Frank ``Barney Fag'' in an interview with
broadcast journalists. Armey immediately apologized, saying, ``I
don't use the word in personal conversation. I would not use such
an expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank was traveling Thursday and could not be reached for
comment, said Maria Giesta, an aide in his Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he told Armey that he understood the remark had not
been intended. But Frank said the episode disturbed him. ``But I
could not accept that it was wholly accidental. . . . I just had to
believe that it was somewhere in the back of his mind,'' Frank
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin-themed party Wednesday was a hot ticket among
politicians and journalists covering the convention. It was hosted
by Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla.

MOST MASS. UNITED WAYS TO RETAIN FUNDING FOR SCOUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Despite national concerns about the Boy Scouts of
America's effort to secure the right to bar gay scout leaders, most
Massachusetts United Way organizations have decided to continue
funding scout troops.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 30 United Way chapters in Massachusetts, only
Massachusetts Bay has so far cut funding to local Boy Scouts, while
Greater Fall River stands poised to end its scout support next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The moves by the United Way, a leading financial supporter of
the Boy Scouts, follows a US Supreme Court decision in June
allowing the scouts to bar gays as troop leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Council of Massachusetts United Ways said
Thursday that most of the independent local agencies, while
reviewing policies and meeting with scout leaders, decided to
continue funding their local troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a neutral policy. We believe that these are personal,
moral decisions and the United Way does not have a role in deciding
those things for individuals,'' said Paul Mina, the chairman who is
also president of the United Way of Tri-City, based in Framingham.
His agency donated $130,000 to two scout councils last year.
</P>
<P>
   The two scout councils funded by Tri-City, he said, ``do not
exhibit any homophobic behavior. They are anything but exclusive.
To punish them for the national organization's position is not our
job.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Mina said, only 20 of the nation's 1,400 United Ways
have decided to stop funding scout troops since the highest court
found that Boy Scouts of America, a private organization, has the
right to define homosexuality as hurtful to children and ban gays
as troop leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the United Way of Massachusetts Bay has cut $288,000 from
five local scout councils because of the discriminatory policy of
the Boy Scouts of America. But the funding agency has agreed to
give $240,000 to a popular school-based program traditionally run
by Boy Scouts called Learning for Life, since the scouts agreed to
turn it into a separate entity.
</P>
<P>
   In southeastern Massachusetts, the United Way of Greater Fall
River has told the Moby Dick scout council, as well as 34 other
agencies the United Way supports, that it must sign a revised
anti-discrimination agreement in April 2001 that will specifically
include sexual orientation, or forfeit funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be their decision,'' said Bob Horne, Greater Fall
River's executive director. ``If they do not sign, they are saying
they do not want to be a member of our United Way.'' For the Moby
Dick scouts, that would mean losing $49,000. The Moby Dick council
executive did not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Boy Scout membership has grown nationally from 4.3 million in
1997 to nearly 5 million. For 90 years, the organization has
enjoyed a reputation for giving young people a taste of adventure
while promoting personal growth and values, like honesty.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other council leaders, Brock Bigsby, scout executive
for the Boston Minuteman Council, said his council has a
``don't-ask policy'' when it comes to sexual orientation, and has
never discriminated.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the United Way of Massachusetts Bay cut means losing
$220,000, or 10 percent of the council's operating budget, he said.
Minuteman serves 18,300 youngsters in South Boston, Dorchester and
other neighborhoods, as well as 27 neighboring Boston towns, like
Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can imagine the impact that will be felt'' on low-income
children, Bigsby said Thursday. ``I don't know when we will feel
it, but it's coming. I want to make clear that we have always been
in compliance with United Way's policy on diversity and
non-discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Chase, United Way of Massachusetts Bay's senior vice
president for community investment, agreed with Bigsby. But she
said her agency is caught in a dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had two very strong values in conflict,'' Chase said.
``One is the value that no organization should be discriminatory,
and the other is the value that we have as a priority services that
support youth, particularly disadvantaged youth.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the decision to fund the Learning for Life education
program ``mitigates that conflict to some extent.''

LAURA BUSH PROMISES TO WORK ON EDUCATION &HT;    By DAN FREEDMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspaper
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Laura Bush told an audience of 2,200 Republican
women Thursday that if her husband, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, is
elected president, she will be an advocate for preparing young
children to go to school.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing members of the National Federation of Republican
Women, she talked about her effort as first lady of Texas to ``help
preschoolers develop skills to begin school ready to read and
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   The other goal of her ``early childhood initiative'' in Texas
was to help parents understand ``the importance that early love and
nurturing'' have on a child's future prospects, she said, adding
that if she becomes first lady, ``I'll expand my committment to
helping children and families all over America.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush spoke at a $150-a-plate luncheon tribute to her
organized by the federation, which netted about $100,000 for its
grassroots effort to promote Republican ideas on education during
the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way you and I raise our children today will profoundly
impact our society tomorrow,'' she said. ``My experience as a mom
and as an elementary school teacher taught me how smart children
really are, how eager they are to learn and how easily we can fail
them ... if we don't have high standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribute included a biographical video on Laura Bush in which
her mother, Jenna Welch, talked about how she read books to Laura
as a child and how Laura practiced teaching before her dolls.
</P>
<P>
   The governor introduced his wife's speech just hours before
delivering his own acceptance speech at the Republican National
Convention. Comparing her convention speech Monday night with his,
Bush said, ``Laura certainly raised the bar, if you know what I
mean.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Monday night speech, Laura Bush gently tried stealing
some of the Democrats' thunder on education. Referring to Vice
President Al Gore, she said, ``George's opponent has been visiting
schools lately and sometimes when he does, he spends the night
before at the home of a teacher. Well, George spends every night
with a teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   She was a teacher and librarian in Austin and Houston before her
marriage to Bush in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   He has declared that education is a cornerstone of his campaign.
He often mentions that test scores of minority students in Texas
have gone up in the five years since he was elected governor.
</P>
<P>
   In his prepared acceptance speech, he pledged to make ``Head
Start an early learning program, teach all of our children to read,
and renew the promise of America's public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's education program stresses high standards and
accountability for student learning. Under his plan, federal funds
earmarked for schools in academic trouble could be diverted into
vouchers for parents who want to send their children to other
schools, including private ones.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches, he uses phrases such as ``there are no second-rate
children, and there are no second-rate dreams,'' and says he wants
to make sure that ``every child is educated and no child is left
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also stresses high standards and accountability but focuses
on school construction and on hiring more teachers to make class
sizes smaller. He has proposed spending $115 billion of the budget
surplus to create an Education Reform Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most polls showed Gore leading Bush on the issue
of who would do a better job on education. But Bush has been
closing the gap. In a Los Angeles Times poll released earlier this
week, Gore led by one percentage point on education, 42 percent to
41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Education ranks high as a campaign issue. The Battleground Poll,
taken during the convention by Republican pollster Ed Goeas and
Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, showed education in second place
behind ``restoring moral values'' as a key concern to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are aware of the extent to which education has been
an Achilles heel for them in past elections.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's luncheon, Florence Shapiro, a Texas state senator
from Plano, Texas, who preceded Mrs. Buksh at the podium, said,
``For too long, Democrats have acted like they own the issue of
education.,'' But she added that now, ``the message is clear: From
this day forward, education is our issue.''

JAPANESE TELECOMMUNICATIONS GIANT PLANS LOCAL PHONE SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan Telecom, one of this country's largest
telecommunications companies, plans to offer local phone service,
which would put it into direct competition with Nippon Telegraph &AMP;
Telephone Corp., the former government phone monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Japan Telecom joins a growing number of phone companies eager to
offer local services in the wake of a new trade agreement with the
United States that can significantly reduce the costs of doing
business in a market that had long been dominated by NTT. DDI,
Japan's second-largest telecommunications company, is also reported
planning to offer local services, some time next year.
</P>
<P>
   Haruo Murakami, president of Japan Telecom, said at a news
conference Thursday that his company had applied to NTT for the
right to tap into its local network, which controls 98 percent of
the lines connecting directly into homes and businesses. Depending
on how quickly NTT responds, Japan Telecom could offer the new
service in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, connecting to those lines was expensive, consuming
roughly 40 percent of most competitors' revenue and making local
service an unprofitable business prospect for everyone but NTT.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new telecommunications agreement, those costs will be
lowered by an average of 35 percent in two years and by at least 40
percent over the next three years, according to the U.S. trade
representative's office, making it more feasible for competitors
that previously limited their activities to long-distance or
cellular phone services to expand into fixed-line local service.
</P>
<P>
   Until the agreement was signed, only Tokyo Telecommunication
Network Co. offered local service in competition with NTT. The
company, which sells three minutes of local phone service for 9 yen
_ currently 8.3 cents _ has never said whether its local services
were profitable, but the profitability of its business as a whole
has declined since it began them.

COMMENTARY: THE WORLD ACCORDING TO BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Give George W. Bush credit. He may still believe that the Greeks
are Grecians. He may still leave the impression that he has not
read the World section of the newspaper for the last 20 years. But
it doesn't matter, and Al Gore is not going to be able to use W.'s
global gap against him in this election.
</P>
<P>
   That's over. Because if the Bush team has been good at
disguising the true, merciless underbelly of the Republican Party's
domestic policies, it has been absolutely brilliant at disguising
the fact that your average TWA pilot knows more about the world
then the Republican nominee for president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has overcome his global gap through two strategies. First,
by cloaking himself in the A-team of Republican foreign policy wise
men. It's hard for Gore to keep asking ``Would you turn the
nation's car keys over to this kid?'' when Bush has Dick Cheney as
his nanny, Colin Powell riding shotgun and Brent Scowcroft, George
Shultz and Henry Kissinger all advising from the back seat. True,
Bush's likely national security adviser, Condy Rice, gave a
cliche-ridden speech to the convention that declared, in the same
breath, that America under Bush would not be the world's 911 or
global cop and that America under Bush would lead the world in a
way Bill Clinton did not. But hey, the A-team will sort that out by
November.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also deftly blunted Gore's attacks by separating
himself from the true isolationists among congressional
Republicans. There is a hard core of Republicans in Congress whose
motto on foreign policy could be summed up as ``Stupid and proud of
it''` or ``Dumb as we wanna be.'' This is the crowd that favors
everything from nonpayment of U.N. dues to further cuts in foreign
aid to outright isolationism. But when Bush forcefully repudiated
Republican congressional efforts to fix a September 2001 deadline
for the withdrawal of U.S. troops in Kosovo, it was the sort of
adult, commander-in-chief-style move that nullifies Gore's charge
that Bush's global gaps will be filled by ``the right-wing,
partisan isolationism of the Republican congressional leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   So is there any path left for Gore to gain traction on foreign
policy? Well, if you assume that the public still cares a whit
about foreign policy in this age of prosperity, then the most
fruitful attack Gore might make on Bush would not be for his
isolationism, but for his unilateralism. For instance, to listen to
the Bush advisers, they are going to just tell Russia, China and
the NATO allies they have to accept a scrapping of the ABM treaty
and U.S. missile defense plans. Like it or lump it. Such
unilateralism is either going to blow up the alliance, and trigger
an arms race with Russia and China, or it is going to lead to an
embarrassing backdown by the Bushies, if they get in office.
</P>
<P>
   Gore could also play on the fact that the Bush wise men are all
wise in the ways of a world gone by. The Republicans like to stress
that they are into power geopolitics _ issues with hair on them _
while Democrats are caught up in the soft stuff, the stuff that the
first Bush administration labeled ``globaloney,'' such as the
environment, AIDS, debt relief, population control. The truth is,
this globaloney will probably kill us long before a North Korean
missile does, but there isn't a single senior Bush adviser who has
written anything interesting on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   But there probably aren't two voters who care. In which case,
Gore might have to acknowledge that we live in an era when
Americans are obsessed with personal opportunity, not national
security. And the key to enhancing personal opportunity is keeping
the Clinton economic expansion going, and stressing the biggest
national security issue for people today _ which is education. Bush
has smartly pressed the education button, but he's vulnerable on
the economy. He has no reassuring economic wise men, and his
tax-cut numbers don't add up.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Gore should counter Bush-Cheney-Powell with his own
triumvirate: Al Gore, Bob Rubin and whoever Gore chooses for vice
president. In an age when people are more worried about the Nasdaq
than NATO, one Rubin equals two Powells. If Gore has any hope, it's
by projecting Bush as a man who hasn't been reading the business
section of the paper, not the World section. That World section
thing won't work anymore _ not when most Americans haven't been
reading it either.

AMTRAK TRYING TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE AND BUILD GOODWILL AFTER A
NIGHT OF DELAYS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Pa.)  By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing its first widespread service problem since
adopting a new ``satisfaction guarantee,'' Amtrak says it has had
to give more than 400 passengers coupons good for a free trip,
because of delays of up to five hours on 22 trains on its Northeast
Corridor on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad, trying to build confidence, is throwing extra
equipment into service on Friday to help get people home from the
Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a tree fell south of Baltimore and knocked power
cables into the signal system, zapping the fuses for a distance of
40 miles. But passengers' reaction to the disruption indicates that
the railroad may not face enormous penalties when widespread delays
occur. While there were approximately 10,000 people on the trains,
only 446 of them, or about 5 percent, asked for coupons good for a
free repeat trip. The railroad announced the ``satisfaction
guarantee'' policy on July 6.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad said it was sending out coupons worth $30,275 in
total, with an average value of about $68.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to put too good a spin on it,'' said William
Schulz, a spokesman for the railroad. ``Clearly this was very
difficult for us, and there are still many people who found this to
be a dreadful situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Train crews gave out free food and beverages from the cafe cars
but ran out of food on many trains; one train that left
Philadelphia at 7:15 p.m. did not reach Washington until nearly 1
a.m., Schulz said. The scheduled time is 1 hour and 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But, Schulz said, the railroad hoped that issuing the service
guarantees would build customer loyalty. ``We have gone out of our
way to publicize what we think is a very bold commitment to our
customers,'' he said. ``We think if you treat them right, they'll
come back. This hasn't changed our thinking one inch.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the railroad believed it had done better than in
previous incidents in keeping passengers informed about the
problem, but was still reviewing what it could do better. One
improvement under consideration, he said, is making it easier for
passengers to leave the train, if dispatchers know that long delays
are likely. For example, he said, passengers bound for home in
Washington but stuck near the station at Baltimore-Washington
International Airport might have chosen to get off and call for
someone to pick them up.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of violent thunderstorms and high winds, a tree
between Baltimore and Washington struck the overhead catenary
system, which provides electricity at 12,000 volts for the trains'
motors, and pushed one of the lines into the signal system. ``It
blew 300 fuses over a 40-mile stretch,'' said Schulz. The railroad
had to dispatch diesel engines to pull some electric trains, and
those had to creep along because of lack of a signal system. In
addition, in some places the tracks were under water, he said.

CHENEY FIRM FINANCED SPONSORS OF BILL TO LIMIT ASBESTOS-SUIT
LIABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER and LISE OLSEN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dick Cheney and the giant energy company he will leave to run
for vice president have contributed more than $150,000 to members
of Congress who sponsored legislation that would limit the ability
of workers to sue companies for asbestos exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The Halliburton Co., an oil field services company based in
Dallas, and its subsidiaries have had about 273,300 suits filed
against them since 1976 by workers suffering from asbestos-related
disease. Many of those suits were filed before Cheney became
chairman of the board and chief executive officer in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1999, 107,650 suits for damages were still
pending, including 46,400 new suits filed against the corporation
last year, according to the firm's annual report filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, 59, says he will resign on Aug. 16 to concentrate on the
Republican campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton's political action committees and Cheney contributed
$494,452 to congressional candidates from 1997 through mid-2000. Of
that, $157,000 went to members of Congress who co-sponsored the
asbestos legislation _ 59 Republicans and three Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, as an individual, donated $12,500 to members who
sponsored or co-sponsored the asbestos bills.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions from Cheney and the political action
committees of Halliburton and its subsidiaries went to 48 of the 77
lawmakers who co-sponsored the Fairness in Asbestos Compensation
Act in the House of Representatives and 14 of 29 co-sponsors of
similar legislation in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton defended their contributions and noted that they
were made in full compliance with campaign laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our PAC has made contributions without regard to the pending
asbestos legislation. Any similarities between the supporters of
such legislation and the recipients of contributions from our PAC
is purely coincidental,'' Zelma Branch, a company spokeswoman said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Gribbins, Halliburton's vice president for government
affairs, added: ``We give money to candidates for a variety of
reasons, usually to those who are supportive of the business
agenda, the things that are important to us, like taxes, trade or
something specific like this asbestos issue.''
</P>
<P>
   A controversial bill
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is a highly controversial package promoted and
financed by the GAF Corp. and others in the asbestos industry. This
year, for the third straight year, the bill didn't make it to the
floor for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the House Judiciary Committee narrowly approved the
legislation by a vote of 18-15, with most Republicans supporting it
and most Democrats opposed.
</P>
<P>
   But seeing dwindling support, Illinois Republican Henry Hyde,
the Judiciary Committee chairman, did not send the bill to the full
House for a vote. Had the bill passed, few believed that President
Clinton would have signed it.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 committee members who received the contributions from
Halliburton, 10 voted in favor of the bill. The 11th member missed
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The bill calls for the establishment of an Office of Asbestos
Compensation under the Justice Department. Government-approved
doctors, using criteria defined in the law, would be gatekeepers,
issuing a pass to qualifying victims who wished to sue or seek a
government-determined settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side disputes there is a problem that needs to be
addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Public interest groups estimate that over the past 25 years,
settlements have been made in more than 1 million asbestos cases
industrywide, and 450,000 more may be pending.
</P>
<P>
   $99 million for suits
</P>
<P>
   Although Halliburton is an enormous operation with more than
100,000 employees in 120 countries, it is a relatively small player
when it comes to asbestos litigation, at least when compared to
W.R. Grace &AMP; Co., GAF and the Johns Manville Corp. Nevertheless,
Halliburton has spent $99 million to settle or dispose of 129,650
asbestos suits, according to company records.
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos was used for decades in protective clothing,
insulations, pipe coatings, fireproofing and many other industrial
uses. Millions of workers in hundreds of industries, including the
oil business, were exposed to the deadly fibers. Fatal
asbestos-related diseases often take more than 20 years after
exposure to manifest themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some citizens groups were critical of the industry's efforts to
push the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   USAction, a health care consumer group affiliated with
organizations including the American Federation of State, County,
and Municipal Employees; the Communication Workers of America, and
the Service Employees International Union, opposes the legislation
and didn't mince words when asked for its view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cheney-led Halliburton Co. has been an integral part of an
asbestos industry which knowingly poisoned its own workers for
years and is still trying to get off the hook. That industry _
which is counting on special treatment from a Bush-Cheney
administration _ has publicly vowed that it will be bringing its
bailout legislation back to Congress next year,'' said William
McNary, president of USAction.
</P>
<P>
   McNary said Halliburton should have settled its claims with the
workers. ``Instead, Cheney chose to gamble that federal legislation
could be passed to allow his company to escape its responsibility
to the people it harmed,'' McNary said.
</P>
<P>
   A blizzard of suits
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court said something had to be done
to break the logjam of asbestos cases clogging the court system.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist said the situation cries out for
a legislative solution.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsors insist it will end the backup of hundreds of
thousands of victims waiting for their day in court and prevent
personal-injury lawyers from pocketing large chunks of the
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition _ mostly unions, victim groups, consumer
coalitions and personal-injury lawyers _ called the legislation the
``Asbestos Industry Relief Act'' because it will prevent thousands
of terminally ill victims from filing suit or holding the industry
accountable for their asbestos-related disease.
</P>
<P>
   The committee debates often turned into an angry circus with
asbestos-industry lawyers accusing the attorneys for those with
asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma with being ambulance
chasers who oppose the legislation because it will eliminate
millions of dollars in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the battle centered on the medical criteria that
the government would use to screen applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The criteria, developed for the most part by asbestos-industry
consultants, was soundly criticized by nationally recognized
pulmonary and cancer specialists, who called the proposed standards
``antiquated,'' ``exclusionary'' and ``barbaric.''
</P>
<P>
   Tears were shed in the committee hearing room as asbestos
victims from Libby, Mont., some clutching tanks of oxygen, told how
hundreds in their tiny town were killed or sickened from asbestos
that contaminated the vermiculite dug from a mine owned by Grace.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, denounced the
legislation, saying it would relieve corporations of their
responsibilities to fairly compensate workers injured by their
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   `Wait 'til next year'
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait 'til next year,'' was the headline of a full-page ad in a
Capitol Hill newspaper for lawmakers. The ad was bought by the
Coalition for Asbestos Resolution, a Washington-based lobbying
group supporting the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing the old Brooklyn Dodgers' battle cry, the coalition
told lawmakers reading Roll Call last week that the industry-funded
group would be back next year to push for passage of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition is funded by the asbestos and construction
industries, with most of its money coming from the GAF Corp., a
private company owned almost entirely by Sam Heyman of Westport,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   GAF Corp., which is leading the lobbying effort against the
bill, has made about $178,500 through its PAC and its employees in
donations to federal candidates from 1997 to the present, of which
about $66,250 went to co-sponsors of the asbestos legislation.
Although Grace has been the target of hundreds of thousands of
suits, its political action committee donated nothing to the bill's
supporters, according to Federal Elections Commission documents.
</P>
<P>
   Millions were spent by both sides _ the asbestos industry and
the trial lawyers _ in lobbying for and against the bill. The
battle got down to the glitzy television ads saturating the home
states of key members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a high-profile, prolonged legislative face-off
over the past year, not only in the Congress but on the airwaves in
Montana, Minnesota and the metropolitan Washington area,'' said
John Bell, a spokesman for the Association of Trial Lawyers of
America. ``We've calculated that Sam Heyman and the asbestos
industry have invested some $20 million in their campaign _ and
although unsuccessful so far, they've outspent us and our allies by
more than 10-to-1.''
</P>
<P>
   Direct donations to the bill's sponsors represent only a part of
the effort to influence Congress. Far more dollars are given for
lobbying expenses, and in ``soft money'' _ donations to party
political action committees that are often funneled to campaigns.
Halliburton has donated at least $282,050 in ``soft money,'' mostly
to state and federal Republican Party committees.

CBS NEWS REVISES PLANS FOR DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Officials at CBS News said Thursday that they would slightly
revise their coverage plans for the first night of the Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles, after television critics and
their own employees complained about the way the opening night of
the Republican gathering in Philadelphia was handled.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Genelius, a spokeswoman for CBS News, said that while the
hours and structure of the coverage would not change for Los
Angeles, the content of the news program ``48 Hours'' would be
modified.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do stuff that's more compatible with the
convention programming,'' Genelius said.
</P>
<P>
   CBS's prime-time coverage on Monday was confined to a portion of
``48 Hours,'' from 10 to 11 p.m. The news division was taken to
task by, among others, the anchor Dan Rather, for running a repeat
of a piece on medical news that night, and for not covering the
speech of Laura Bush, the wife of the presidential candidate, in
its entirety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the feeling is to make the flow of the hour feel a
little smoother,'' Genelius said.

GAY GROUPS DIFFER OVER WHETHER GOP WAS GOOD FOR THEIR CAUSE &HT;    By ERIC ROSENBERG
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ As Republicans wrapped up their convention
intended to highlight inclusiveness, gay political organizations
squared off Thursday over whether the party has a newfound
moderation toward homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the nation's largest gay political organization said
the GOP national convention demonstrated ``meanness'' toward gays
and that the election of presidential nominee George W. Bush and
his running mate Dick Cheney would be a setback for gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The verdict is in,'' Winnie Stachelberg, political director
for the Human Rights Campaign, said as Bush prepared to deliver his
acceptance speech. ``A Bush-Cheney administration has the potential
to be very harmful for gays and lesbians. ... It is clear that the
kinder, gentler face we see at the convention is nothing more than
a facade.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Birch, the group's executive director, said that the
four-day affair was disappointing, even though the GOP sought to
soften hard-line opposition to homosexual rights by allowing Rep.
Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., to address delegates. Kolbe is openly gay.
</P>
<P>
   The gay rights officials spoke at a news conference in
Washington, D.C. The Human Rights Campaign already has endorsed
Vice President Al Gore for president.
</P>
<P>
   Birch said she was ```very disturbed'' by the GOP platform,
which included language gay Republicans wanted removed. Birch said
``a kind of meanness won out'' when the platform was finalized on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The platform defines marriage ``as the legal union of one man
and one woman.'' It says that ``federal judges and bureaucrats
should not force states to recognize other living arrangements as
marriages.'' And the platform further says that homosexuals should
be exempt from anti-discrimination laws and that homosexuality is
incompatible with military service.
</P>
<P>
   Stachelberg said a low point for gays at the Republican
convention was on Tuesday as Kolbe spoke to delegates in a
four-minute speech on international trade. Several members of
Bush's own Texas delegation removed their cowboy hats and bowed
their heads in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Birch noted the irony of the Republican position, saying that
Cheney's daughter Mary is openly lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence of Mary Cheney as an openly lesbian person shines
a light on the fact that George W. Bush and Dick Cheney have
positions of grave concern to gay and lesbian people in this
country,'' Birch said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Ivers, a spokesman for the Log Cabin Republicans, the
country's largest organization for gay Republicans, said despite
the Kolbe incident and the platform, the convention was by far the
most successful ever for homosexual Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Ivers said that the ``old social conservative paradigm'' in the
Republican party this week ``is showing signs that is is
crumbling.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We've seen real advances this week,`` he said, pointing to a
platform committee that had initially removed the anti-gay
language, only to be overruled by conservatives. The fact that
Kolbe was asked to speak by Bush was a significant attempt at
reaching out to gay Republicans, he said, adding that most of the
2,066 convention delegates applauded Kolbe heartily.
</P>
<P>
   One other indication that the party is warming to gays: there
were more openly gay convention delegates (19) to this GOP
convention than at any previous. There were five gay delegates in
1996 and two alternates in 1992, Ivers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week was a success. We are at a turning point (in the
Republican Party) on gay and lesbian issues,'' Ivers said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's relationship with gays and lesbians has been strained.
During the Republican primaries, Bush at first refused to meet with
gay rights groups. But in April, he met with gay Republicans saying
afterwards that he was ``a better man'' for it.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also note that Cheney, while secretary of defense in
1991, supported his spokesman, Pete Williams, when he announced he
was gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have operated on the basis, over the years, with respect to
my personal staff that I don't ask them about their private lives.
... As long as they perform their professional responsibilities in
a responsible manner, their private lives are their business,''
Cheney said.

COMMANDOS SEIZE ROGUE FREIGHTER LOADED WITH MUNITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Helicopter-borne Canadian Navy commandos Thursday
stormed and seized of a rogue American superfreighter in waters
south of Newfoundland, ending a 2 1/2-week high-seas standoff in
which the GTS Katie held hostage a cargo of fighting vehicles,
troop carriers, and other war gear representing 10 percent of
Canada's armored might.
</P>
<P>
   There were no casualties as the 14-member boarding force
rappelled onto the pitching upper deck from a Sea King helicopter
launched from the destroyer HMCS Athabaskan. Freed in the ship's
capture were three Canadian soldiers assigned to guard the
equipment being returned from peacekeeping operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's captain, Vitaly Khlebnikov, in a bid to thwart the
landing, ``violently maneuvered'' the Katie and radioed
international distress signals, said Navy Captain Drew Robertson,
commander of the Athabaskan and operational head of the boarding
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sea King pilot held rock steady and the team was able to
gain control of the vessel within 45 or 50 minutes,'' Robertson
said from the Canadian warship. ``The captain was quite theatrical
in his objections, but otherwise there was no resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Katie was seized in international waters outside Canada's
maritime jurisdiction. Khlebnikov accused Canada of acting
recklessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very dangerous what they do,'' he said by satellite
phone as a Canadian helicopter swooped over the stern. ``We have
500 tons of explosives aboard and my crew is placed in danger by
these Canadians.''
</P>
<P>
   But Canadian officials said the government had no choice but to
act, especially given that the ``hijacked'' cargo included
highly-sophisticated electronics surveillance gear and other
sensitive weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being held hostage, having our equipment held hostage, was
simply unacceptable,'' Defense Minister Art Eggleton told reporters
in Ottawa shortly after the 1:45 p.m. boarding of the cargo ship.
``In the end we had no choice but to take the military option.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the freighter that so stubbornly refused to head
for harbor was steaming across the Gulf of St. Lawrence under close
escort by Canadian warships, bound for a port near Montreal. The
Katie's captain remained at the helm, but course and speed of the
freighter were directed by the Canadian military and the vessel was
expected to dock at Becancouer, Quebec, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States raised no objection to the capture of the
American-owned vessel since the Katie flies under a flag of
convenience, registered in the tiny Caribbean nation of St. Vincent
and Grenadines, and thus is not entitled to US protection in a
commercial dispute. The 23 crew members of the Soviet-built ship
are Ukranians, Russians and Croats.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a private shipping company and there is no US military
involvement,'' said Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   The US Embassy in Ottawa said Washington had been given
assurance that St. Vincent and the Grenadines approved Canada's
plan to board the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Canada acted after being held up to international ridicule for
its reluctance to rescue its military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been made to look fairly ridiculous,'' said retired Col.
Brian MacDonald, a Canadian military analyst. ``It's low comedy _
the country that can't defend the very equipment upon which it
depends for national defense.''
</P>
<P>
   What started as a business bluff by Third Ocean Marine
Navigation Co. of Annapolis, Md. _ owner of the Katie _ had by this
week escalated into a tense showdown involving shipping companies,
the US State Department, the government of St. Vincent and the
Grenadines, and legions of Canadian military personnel, diplomats,
justice ministry lawyers and international commerce officials.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien, after two weeks
of more or less shrugging off the situation, finally slipped into
crisis mode as the standoff turned into a national embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   But the American owners of the Katie refused instructions to
head to port even after Canadian warships arrived on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it took three Canadian warships, an Aurora
surveillance aircraft, helicopters, and, finally, the naval
boarding party to bring the Katie to bay. Before the raid the
750-foot freighter, with its unarmed crew, was shadowed by a trio
of Canadian warships, including the Athabaskan and frigates HMCS
Montreal and HMCS Ville de Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff began on July 18, two days after the Katie was
scheduled to arrive in Becancour, Quebec, to begin unloading the
cargo of 580 armored vehicles and sea container packed with weapons
and more than 500 tons of ammunition. The estimated value of the
cargo is approximately $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Katie, one of the largest and fastest ships in the
world, started tracing giant circles in the fog-shrouded North
Atlantic, refusing to enter Canadian waters for fear, according to
its owner, that the ship would be confiscated in a complicated
financial wrangle with the Canadian firms that acted as
subcontractors for the military.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. ``Flip'' Walters, chief executive for Third Ocean, said the
company was caught between debt and the deep blue sea, with
creditors poised to seize the ship the instant it docked in
Montreal because of payments owed not by Third Ocean itself but
Canadian shipping firms that subcontracted the ship.
</P>

   ``There are two victims here, the Canadian government and Third
Ocean,'' Walters said. ``We're not pirates, we are not hijackers,
we're a reputable company that has transported (equipment for) the
British Army, the German Army and the US Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If this was cotton bales or Toyotas, we could head
to France or somewhere and auction off the cargo'' to satisfy the
debts apparently owed Third Ocean by a Montreal shipping firm,
Andromeda Navigation. ``But since the cargo belongs to Her
Majesty's Canadian Forces, we're in a desperate spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada once boasted one of the most formidable navies in the
world, but massive budget cuts over the past decade have
drastically reduced the NATO member's military power.
</P>
<P>
   The country is still an enthusiastic participant in UN
peacekeeping operations, but it no longer possesses the heavylift
ships or cargo aircraft to carry its troops to foreign trouble
spots, so it relies on hired civilian vessels, such as the Katie.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Eggleton announced that the Canadian government
is now considering building a fleet of military transport vessels.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ On the final night of the Republican National
Convention, Gov. George W. Bush will argue that the nation's
current wealth provides an opportunity to accomplish reforms and to
transform the nation's politics.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush will try to use his acceptance speech Thursday
night to present himself as a bipartisan leader who can get things
done, he is also likely to use the opportunity to pursue his fight
with his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, in an effort to further
delineate the contrast between them.
</P>
<P>
   Bush officially became the party's nominee during Wednesday
night's roll-call vote when delegates from Wyoming _ the home state
of his running mate, Richard Cheney _ put him over the 1,034
convention votes needed for a majority. But the big
balloon-dropping celebration will come Thursday night when the last
of the 2,066 delegate votes will be delivered from the floor of the
First Union Center by the Texas delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will seize this moment of American promise,'' Bush planned
to say, according to excerpts of his speech released by the
campaign. ``We will confront the hard issues _ threats to our
national security, threats to our health and retirement security _
before the challenges of our time become crises for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night will be a defining moment in Bush's political
career. He and his speechwriter have been working for weeks on the
acceptance speech that the governor will deliver before a
nationwide audience, albeit one that is likely smaller than in past
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I believe, I know what I want to say, I know what
I want America to hear, and I'm going to give it my best shot and
see what happens,'' Bush told reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides have said he will lay out five priorities for his
presidency on which he will campaign, including reforming Social
Security, increasing military readiness, cutting taxes, improving
education and expanding prescription drug benefits for Medicare
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,900-word speech has been through at least 17 drafts, said
Karen Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman. The campaign hopes the remarks
will signal to the nation that Bush is a different kind of
conservative who has transformed his party so that it can appeal to
groups not traditionally receptive to the Republicans' message.
</P>
<P>
   Although his aides have emphasized the positive themes of Bush's
speech, Hughes acknowledged Bush will needle Gore and lament the
current administration's failure to accomplish critical tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much promise, to no great purpose,'' he was to say,
according to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign said he would also call for improving character and
responsibility, a call meant to be an implicit reminder of the
impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to his arrival here, Bush has become
increasingly aggressive in his criticism of Gore, his Democratic
rival for the presidency, and of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While the attacks on the Clinton-Gore administration are popular
with the Republican rank and file, the Texas governor is also
trying to convince independent voters, who in recent elections have
embraced the centrist position, that Bush has transformed his party
in the same way that Clinton changed his. But Bush must also be
careful not to alienate the conservatives who are the Republicans'
bedrock.
</P>
<P>
   A great deal of time in the opening days of the convention was
devoted to projecting a centrist image, with issues like
immigration and education dominating, and the stage filled with
racially diverse speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush planned to pick up on these themes as well, arguing that he
would reach out to Americans who feel left out of the current boom
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will extend the promise of prosperity to every forgotten
corner of this country,'' he was to say.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in many previous conventions, candidates in hard-fought
congressional races _ like Rep. Rick Lazio of New York, who is
battling Hillary Rodham Clinton, the first lady, this fall for a
Senate seat from New York _ were kept out of the spotlight. So too
were many elements of the Republicans' battles with President
Clinton over the last six years. Issues like family values,
abortion rights and the culture wars were not showcased.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush used the week leading up to the convention to pacify
conservative delegates. He allowed a plank opposing all abortion
rights to stand and chose a conservative running mate with a voting
record to match.
</P>
<P>
   But he is also making a point of courting people outside the
party. Thursday afternoon, Bush appeared at a luncheon rally for
his wife, Laura, in downtown Philadelphia. At the gathering, Bush
made a point of thanking not only Republicans but also Democrats
who had worked with him and his wife on education issues in Texas.
He said that if he was elected president he would bring a more
positive and bipartisan approach to government.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's campaign said that in his speech, Bush also would
promise to work with Democrats to improve Social Security and early
childhood education. Bush planned to suggest that, as an outsider
to Washington, he could help change the way politics is conducted
in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have enemies to fight,'' the excerpts said. ``And I
have no stake in the bitter arguments of the last few years. I want
to change the tone of Washington to one of civility and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, promises of bipartisanship and civility are not getting
in the way of attacks on his opponent. On Wednesday night, right
after Cheney emphasized Bush's ability to work with the other side,
the vice presidential candidate began a lengthy attack on the
current administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all a little weary of the Clinton-Gore routine,''
Cheney told cheering Republicans. ``But the wheel has turned.''

KODAK MOVES INTO HIGH-TECH IMAGING BUSINESS

<P>
   The Kodak name is showing up in a lot more places these days.
</P>
<P>
   It sits above Lexmark International's logo on an inkjet printer,
one of the first to print photographs directly from a digital
camera.
</P>
<P>
   It is on Duralite, Kodak's pricey new untearable photographic
inkjet paper, and on Kodak Picture Processing, a new retail service
that gives customers the option of paying more for prints made on
Duralite.
</P>
<P>
   And it is all over the World Wide Web. Eastman Kodak has not
only beefed up the photo-related services it offers on its own but
has also taken stakes in numerous Internet companies that put
Kodak's name on their sites. Then there are the partnerships with
other dot-coms that trumpet their use of Kodak processing and
papers.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak-branded printers, papers, Web services? ``They are feeling
things out to see which channels will ultimately be the most
valuable for extending their brand,'' said Lia M. Schubert, an
analyst at the Boston-based Infotrends Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the unifying theme of the latest products to carry the
Kodak brand is that they have nothing to do with capturing images,
Kodak's traditional forte, and everything to do with
``repurposing'' them _ industry parlance for the many high-tech
ways that people now view, swap, manipulate, store, print and
display images. And they are all part of the company's full-court
press to associate its brand as much with the output side of
digital photography as it has been with the input side of silver
halide film.
</P>
<P>
   It is no small task. While consumers often ask for Kodak film by
name, they usually associate the prints they get back with the
retail store where they dropped the film off. ``No one looks at the
back of a photo for the Kodak watermark,'' said Ulysses Yannas, an
analyst with Buckman, Buckman &AMP; Reid.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the output process confined to simple prints. Today, with
scanners, stand-alone kiosks that let consumers doctor photos and
print them, and digitally savvy photo-processing stores, even users
of the most basic cameras can opt for electronic prints on a
compact disc or delivered by e-mail, or prints uploaded to a Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bricks and mortar, clicks and mortar, just clicks _ online
photo activity is so embryonic that we want to be a part of all of
it,'' said Robert J. Keegan, president of Kodak's consumer imaging
unit.
</P>
<P>
   For Kodak, that means a choppy sail through uncharted, and
possibly shark-infested, waters. When Kodak offers photo services
on its Web site or invests in photo-services start-ups, it is
competing with its retail customers. When its brand is on a
dot-com's Web site, it risks being tarnished if the dot-com
provides less than stellar quality or service.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kodak is putting 65 percent of its research budget into
various digital technologies, hoping that at least some of its bets
are on winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``People free-associate Kodak's brand with photography, but we
want them to associate it with pictures in all their forms,'' said
Daniel A. Carp, Kodak's chief executive. ``Still, we can't know
what consumers want because consumers don't yet know what they
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Kodak had best learn fast. Its sales of film remain strong, but
digital cameras are quickly gaining share. And though Kodak's
digital cameras sell well, cameras are not where it makes most of
its money. Most photography companies get the bulk of their revenue
from consumables like chemicals, papers and, most of all, film _ a
product that digital cameras make obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Carp promised investors that Kodak's revenue, which was
$14 billion last year, would hit $24 billion in 2005. But he
conceded that the faster digital technologies sweep through the
photography world, the slower Kodak's profits will grow.
Shareholders seem wary. Kodak's stock, which closed unchanged
Thursday at $57.75 , is mired at less than 11 times earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the digital revolution is not all doom and gloom for
Kodak. Study after study shows that people who use digital cameras
take more pictures and make more prints. The same studies show that
all but the most diehard hobbyists are having prints made in the
conventional way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sweet spot in this market isn't the guy with the $4,000
digital camera, but the people who are just learning about
e-sharing photos,'' said Daniel P. Palumbo, Kodak's chief marketing
officer for consumer imaging.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when Tom Cruise's character in ``M:i-2,'' the ``Mission
Impossible'' sequel, used a Kodak digital camera, it gave a shot in
the arm to digital camera sales _ and to conventional photo
processing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since that movie opened, more people are asking us to make
prints from their new digital cameras,'' said Mitchell B.
Goldstone, who owns 30 Minute Photos Etc. in Irvine, Calif. ``
`M:i-2' is doing for digital photography what `Men in Black' did
for Rayban sunglasses.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is a big leap from the halo effect on digital
photography in general to a boost for Kodak specifically. And Kodak
is not just battling Fuji or its other old economy nemeses; in the
digital space it is up against Sony, Hewlett-Packard, Panasonic and
other electronics experts.
</P>
<P>
   Lesser-known players are often happy to piggyback on the Kodak
name. ``What better way to build a photo-printer business than to
tie up with the best-known name in photos?'' asked Gary E. Morin,
Lexmark International's chief financial officer.  &QL;

   GOP-CONVENTION (Philadelphia) _ Roundup on final night of the
GOP convention, when George W. Bush accepts the presidential
nomination.

   GOP-ANALYSIS (Philadelphia) _ The Republican National Convention
ended Thursday right on time and right on message. As delegates
filed out of the First Union Center for the last time, they were
unified, enthralled and breathless, much like the crowd after Super
Bowl halftime show. And that suited Republican leaders just fine.
In many ways, the four-day convention resembled an extravagantly
produced show more than a political instrument, relying on a quick
tempo and non-politicians to make political statements. The
questions left to be answered are, will it work? And will the 2000
convention become a model for the future?

   GOP-WA-DELEGATES (Philadelphia) _ They're calling themselves
``Generation W'' _ a new breed of young Republican activists who
appear captivated by George W. Bush much as their parents fell for
John F. Kennedy or their older siblings were wowed by Ronald
Reagan. The informal group of young Seattle-area professionals,
many new to politics, have met separately from the delegation and
have even held modest fundraisers for their man. They may be the
future of the Republican Party. But what will that future hold?

</P>
<P>
   But the digital world's leading lights are competitors first and
partners second, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak and Hewlett-Packard, for instance, just introduced a
jointly branded miniphotography lab that lets photo processors make
prints from digital cameras. But Hewlett, which once had a
cobranding agreement with Kodak on printer paper, now sells its own
branded paper. It is a competitor in digital cameras and inkjet
printers. It is also offering numerous photo-related services on
its Web site _ including a free service for creating online photo
albums _ and is establishing links to its site from other Internet
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll work with whoever we think has a world-class product,''
said Vyomesh Joshi, general manager of HP Inkjet Imaging Systems.
</P>
<P>
   So will Adobe Systems, which makes photo-related software. It
has links from its Web page to various photo-related companies. It
does not disdain brand names, but it does not seek them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to find the most compelling services, whether from
established companies like Kodak or from one of those start-ups
that pop up like mushrooms after a rain,'' said Dennis A. Marshall,
Adobe's director of consumer digital imaging.
</P>
<P>
   The growing competition has spurred Kodak's marketing mavens to
action. In November, they began to set a strategy for
disassociating Kodak's brand with emotional but mundane
picture-taking and linking it instead to high-tech innovations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old economy our branding strategy revolved around
making familiar things desirable,'' said Carl E. Gustin, Kodak's
chief marketing officer. ``In the new economy, we have to make
novel things familiar.''
</P>
<P>
   Kodak now has 105 people working exclusively on building
Kodak.com, the company's interactive Web site; most of them report
to Robert L. LaPerle, director of operational excellence for
Kodak.com _ a position just created last month.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak's researchers, meanwhile, are looking into ways to let
solid state image sensors, the piece of silicon that works as a
digital camera's ``film,'' capture more than just images _ to, say,
embed the photographer's name for copyright protection, or include
key information that makes it easier to retrieve the image from an
electronic archive.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also have combined the company's age-old
knowledge of dye chemistry with its growing knowledge of electrons
to create an Organic Light Emitting Diode, called the Oled
(pronounced OH-led), which provides a sharper electronic image than
the liquid crystal diodes normally used in cell phone displays,
automotive dash boards and the like. The Oled already is the guts
of the display on Pioneer Electronic's car audio systems.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak's name is nowhere on those items now. But Kodak has
prototype Oleds that can display games, movies and other complex
images on cell phones and hand-held digital devices. And when those
are ready for market, the company has every intention of fighting
to get its technology noted, a la ubiquitous Intel Inside stickers
on computers that use Intel chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``First we must nurture the technology, prove that it works,''
said James C. Stoffel, Kodak's chief technology officer. ``But down
the road, we see this enhancing our brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Kodak is nurturing the technologies of numerous Web-based
start-ups, too. It has invested in Snapfish.com, which offers
online photo processing; ememories.com, an online photo archivist;
MyFamily.com, which helps families set up home pages; IFilm, a Web
service for filmmakers; and Weave Innovations, which makes a
picture frame that displays photographs downloaded from the Web
without a computer.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Kodak is walking a customer-relations minefield:
many of these companies offer free film, developing or other
services that Kodak customers sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kodak is taking equity in companies that give away everything
on which our revenue models are based,'' said Gary Tashjian,
marketing vice president for PhotoWorks Inc., a photo services
company that has long used Kodak papers _ and that itself offers
archiving and other online freebies.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak's archrival in conventional photography, Fuji Photofilm
USA, has taken a different tack, promoting fujifilm.net, its online
page of Web services, more as a service for retailers than for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want retail customers to use our online photo finishing and
storage to promote their own brands,'' said Rod H. King, Fuji's
vice president for consumer markets.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak executives insist they feel the same, saying that the
company will not sell film online or offer discounts for online
printing services ordered on its Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Its much-ballyhooed ``You've Got Pictures'' agreement with
America Online enables Kodak-affiliated photoprocessors to deliver
electronic versions of pictures to customers via e-mail. And Kodak
designed and runs the photo services section of CVS.com, the
drugstore chain's interactive Web site. Kodak would certainly love
it if CVS's photo-processing customers registered their names on
Kodak's own Web site, but it realizes that it must sometimes remain
behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers aren't fools _ they don't give away customers
capriciously,'' said Philip Gerskovich, chief operating officer for
Kodak's digital and applied imaging unit. ``We're establishing an
infrastructure for handling images on the Web, and for now, we're
not going to get hung up on who owns the customer.''  &QL;

COMMENTARY: UNDER THE BIG TENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ What can you say about a Republican Convention
that featured at least three speeches on combating AIDS but not a
single reference to combating abortion? That it's a changed party?
A conflicted party? A sneakier party?
</P>
<P>
   ``The platform is solid,'' shrugged Gary Bauer, the former
pro-life presidential candidate. You will remember him as the guy
who fell off the stage during a pancake-flipping contest before the
New Hampshire primary. He added, ``Anybody who's pro-life on
Election Day will vote for us, and anybody who's pro-choice will
vote for the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong message. Under George W. Bush the Republican Party is one
big, huge, enormous, humongous tent. Bush is asking for the vote of
every single American who supports restoring dignity to the
presidency and not leaving a single child behind. Those yearning
for an undignified chief executive and a pile of children stranded
without transportation are just going to have to go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Coming to grips with the Bush candidacy is tricky, since there
is so much that goes unsaid in this campaign. Until Dick Cheney
gave his red-meat speech on Wednesday night, the Republican
Convention had gone for three days without ever mentioning Bill
Clinton's name. We were in Harry Potter land, and the president was
Lord Voldemort, the villain so villainous he can be referred to
only as ``You-Know-Who.'' (Cheney was an incredible hit with the
delegates, who had been languishing on topics like ``Prosperity
With a Purpose: Keeping America Prosperous.'' However, many people
who saw him on TV felt the new vice-presidential candidate had all
the warmth and charm of an armadillo.)
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Convention was full of delegates who had become
party activists so they could combat abortions and gun control, yet
Bush managed to drag them through this entire convention without
one televised peep about the right to bear arms, or even about
prayer in school. Every black Republican who's ever been elected to
a county road commission was given a speaking role, but Alan Keyes,
the black presidential candidate who's the darling of the
anti-abortion movement, was nowhere in sight. The only person I
heard bring up abortion was a Senate candidate from Nebraska who
said that if a Republican president could just get one more
pro-life justice in there, his state would be able to get its
abortion restrictions past the Supreme Court. It was distinctly off
message, but also distinctly off prime time.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, this isn't much different from what Bill Clinton did
in 1992, when he pulled his party to the center while placating its
left by muffling Robert Casey, the pro-life governor of
Pennsylvania. But at least the Democrats didn't keep their
positions secret. You'd have had to be living in a cave not to know
what Clinton intended to do about abortions and gun control. Bush
is less forthcoming. Watching the convention, all you might be able
to deduce is that whatever he plans, it's going to be accomplished
to the music of Motown.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's easy enough to read his intentions. His surrogates
forcefully stripped the platform of all signs of immigrant-bashing,
and made an unsuccessful attempt to moderate the plank opposing
gays in the military. The convention's rainbow coalition of
speakers did at least send a message that Bush is going to have
blacks in his cabinet and regards immigrants as a group worthy of a
well-placed pander. One of the very, very few middle-aged white men
who got on stage was the Republican Party's only openly gay
congressman.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no effort to change the party's sweeping
declaration of war against all forms of abortion, and no hint Bush
ever intended to do battle with his core constituency on that
issue. ``He does not want to fight,'' said Tommy Thompson, the
long-suffering chairman of the platform committee, who kept
demanding credit for having allowed pro-choice Republicans to speak
at the hearings. ``The Republican Party is a pro-life party, but
it's never been so open,'' he said repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to abortion, George W. Bush's move to the center
consists solely of his willingness to accept the votes of people
who disagree with him. The tent is huge, but the ringmaster is only
listening to the folks who entered from the right.

ANALYSIS: BUSH PORTRAYS TAX CUTS AS BOON TO ALL, NOT JUST THE
RICH 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ What Gov. George W. Bush is trying to do with
Republican economic orthodoxy resembles in many ways what President
Clinton has tried to do for Democrats over the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   By emphasizing elimination of the federal budget deficit and the
national debt, Clinton sought to soften the perception, if not
erase it, that Democrats are the party of profligacy and high
taxes. In the end, doing so gave him more freedom to press for
substantially more spending on the issues at the core of the
Democratic agenda, especially health and education.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, Bush is looking to counter the idea that
Republicans stand for sweeping tax cuts that are fiscally reckless
and a boon only to the country club set. As showcased at the
Republican National Convention this week, tax cuts are a prudent
way to spur entrepreneurship, give a boost to people looking to
reach the middle class, and provide an economic pick-me-up should
the long business expansion begin to flag.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal to create individual investment accounts within
Social Security is packaged not as a gift to Wall Street but as an
opportunity for all workers to build wealth in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is the Republican call, much heard after Newt Gingrich led
the party to take control of the House in 1994, to shrink the size
and influence of government by starving it of revenues through tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of the emphasis here on single mothers, struggling
family farms and aspiring Hispanic small-business owners _ and
although his plan does contain elements intended to help the
working poor _ Bush's tax proposals vary little from traditional
conservatism in giving the biggest tax cuts to those who pay the
most in taxes, by definition the people who make the most money.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than backing off from any of the tenets of supply-side
economics, Bush seems intent on demonstrating that helping people
who have not yet made it economically is perfectly consistent with
helping those who have.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats look at the Bush tax plan and see 43 percent of the
benefits going to the top 1 percent of households by income, those
making more than $319,000 a year, according to Citizens for Tax
Justice, a liberal-leaning research group.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence B. Lindsey, Bush's chief economic adviser, said
Republicans remained focused on the incentives that tax cuts
provide to earn and save more, whether for a waitress earning
$18,000 a year or the entrepreneur who wants to be able to pass a
painstakingly built business along to her heirs without being
subject to a hefty federal estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   So the spotlight at the convention has not been on the usual
parade of supply-side sales people from the ranks of elected
Republican officials, but on working people struggling to attain
some financial security.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my surprise, I discovered the road to financial success had
a toll booth,'' said Kim Jennings, a single mother who was chosen
by the campaign to bring its economic message to life on Wednesday
night. ``The more I worked, and earned, the more the government
took from me in higher taxes. That is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   To Democrats, it is all bunk. They say that Republican economic
policies, whether those offered by Bush or those pursued over the
last six years by the Republican majority in Congress, are mostly
about rewarding the wealthy people and powerful interest groups
that finance Republican campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, they say, Republicans are going about it in a way that
would squander the projected federal budget surpluses and leave
nothing for priorities like adding prescription drug coverage to
Medicare benefits or modernizing schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time there's an option to choose between targeting low-
and middle-income people and giving most of the benefits to the top
20 percent,'' said Laura Tyson, an economic adviser to Vice
President Al Gore, ``the Republican leadership has revealed its
position through its actions,'' by choosing the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Recasting an ideology without sacrificing its core is a tricky
business. In Bush's case, it is made trickier by the prosperous
environment in which he is trying to do it.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Thursday night, Bush emphasized how much more
could be done to take advantage of prosperity, and he suggested
that Clinton and Gore have squandered their chance. And Republicans
are heartened by polls showing that tax cuts are picking up support
from voters as the budget surplus swells.
</P>
<P>
   But to the extent that he emphasizes the substance of economic
policy _ and all signs this week were that he is more interested in
emphasizing character and leadership _ Bush risks not only an
onslaught from Gore over class politics and fiscal rectitude, but
also focusing voters on the fact that the Clinton-Gore years have
been pretty good for most people.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney, Bush's vice presidential running mate, illustrated
that risk, no doubt inadvertently, in his speech to the convention
on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does anyone, Republican or Democrat, seriously believe that
under Mr. Gore, the next four years would be any different from the
last eight?'' Cheney asked.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment at 4 percent, inflation under control, incomes
rising across the board and most indicators of social well-being
improving, Democrats will no doubt be eager to make the case when
they gather for their convention in Los Angeles that the next four
years will in fact be exactly like the last eight if Gore is
elected.

URI GORDON, 65, ZIONIST LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Uri Gordon, an Israeli official and Zionist leader who played
important roles in the resettlement of thousands of Ethiopian and
Russian Jews in Israel in the 1980s and '90s, died on Sunday in
Israel. He was 65.
</P>
<P>
   He had suffered for months from a number of illnesses, said
Deborah Lipson, a spokeswoman for the Jewish Agency, a
quasi-governmental organization that oversees immigration to
Israel, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   The craggy-faced Gordon was long known as Aliya _ the Hebrew
word that in this context means immigration by Jews to Israel. The
Jerusalem Post recalled in 1998, when admirers gathered to pay
tribute to him, that he had been behind the airlifts ``from the
former Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Ethiopia, Yemen, Syria, Albania
and elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   David Sommer, a member of the World Zionist Organization's
20-member governing body and a member of the board of the Jewish
Agency, said: ``In many ways he believed in applied Zionism,''
meaning ``to do anything possible to bring people to come to
Israel.'' Sommer added: ``He always believed that the climax of
Zionism is to live in Israel. He was involved in people's lives. He
participated in the new immigrants' arrival.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon played a central role regarding immigration on behalf of
the Jewish Agency after rising to prominence there in the 1970s. He
was involved in the planning the airlifting of tens of thousands of
Ethiopian Jews in 1984 and 1993. He also helped prepare for Israel
to accommodate hundreds of thousands of Russian Jews after the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon directed the Jewish Agency's immigration and absorption
department and its youth aliya department. For part of his career,
he was active in Labor Party work with young adults.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, while he was representing the Jewish Agency in the
United States, he founded an American youth organization, Telem,
also known as the Movement for Zionist Fulfillment, which required
its members to commit themselves to emigrate to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's intensity was recalled by Avi Granot, an Israeli
Embassy official in Washington. Granot described being in a Los
Angeles hotel elevator with Gordon one day in 1980. Gordon was then
a Jewish Agency emissary to the United States and Granot a consular
official in New York. Both were involved in developing Telem.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Uri, when he got to be talking about what should be done,
he wouldn't stop,'' said Granot, who is also a former Israeli
ambassador to Ethiopia, ``and we ended up spending over two hours
in the elevator going up and down, down and up.'' They were
discussing Zionism.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet influx was complicated and difficult. From 1989
through late 1994, roughly 500,000 immigrants from the former
Soviet Union had flooded into Israel, at a time when its total
population was only about four million .
</P>
<P>
   By then, Israeli officials were acknowledging that an estimated
one-third of the immigrants were distant descendants of Jews who
did not consider themselves Jews and had non-Jewish spouses.
</P>
<P>
   These immigrants had been allowed in because of an amendment to
a 1950 measure called the Law of Return. The law, which specified
who could immigrate, was altered in 1970 to extend immigration
rights to any person with a single grandparent who was Jewish, even
if the connection to Judaism ended there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amendment to the Law of Return, which was meant to deal
with a few exceptional cases, turned with time into an automatic
entry ticket into Israel for non-Jews in numbers beyond acceptable
proportion,'' Gordon said in October 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1992, the flow of Soviet immigrants to Israel sank to
its lowest level in almost two years, Israeli officials reported.
Jewish Agency workers said the drop was caused by acute problems
facing those already in Israel _ lack of jobs and adequate housing.
These troubles were reported back to relatives and friends in the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has no answer to the question of employment,''
Gordon said at the time. ``Until now it hasn't formulated a
national plan for absorption.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was the author, with Menachem Michelson, of the 1998 book
``Zionism Is Not a Dirty Word.''
</P>
<P>
   Uri Gordon was born in Tel Aviv and later handicapped by polio.
``He was a short person who had a hard time walking,'' Granot
recalled, but added that because of his powerful personality,
nothing stood in his way.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s, Gordon led Labor Party Zionist youth groups.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife and three daughters.

ADVERTISING: SHIRTLESS HUNKS PEDDLING SHOES 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An offbeat new campaign embraces the philosophy of the comedian
Jeff Foxworthy in declaring: ``No shirt. No shoes. . . . No
problem!'' What in the world are the shirtless hunks and hunkettes
peddling in the ads? Shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The shoes in question are made by the Rockport Co., a division
of Reebok International known for selling comfortable footwear that
is, as the brand name implies, rock-solid, rock-steady _ and about
as stylish as Plymouth Rock. The campaign, by AG Worldwide in New
York, an agency that specializes in fashion advertising, seeks to
change perceptions of the Rockport label as the company embarks on
a redesign of its offerings to make them seem less stodgy.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign begins with print advertisements, photographed in
arty black and white, that depict bare feet being massaged,
caressed and nuzzled by attractive nude young men and women. There
will be outdoor posters in a similar vein, followed by a revamped
Web site and television commercials. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rockport account has been more peripatetic than a hiker
climbing a mountain range in the company's shoes, moving in less
than six years from Bartle Bogle Hegarty in London to the Leo
Burnett unit of the B Com3 Group in Chicago to Kirshenbaum Bond &AMP;
Partners in New York to AG. The most recent previous campaign came
from Kirshenbaum Bond, which handled the account for three years
before resigning in September. Those ads, featuring personages
ranging from Muhammad Ali to Ru Paul to Spalding Gray, carried this
theme: ``Be comfortable. Uncompromise. Start with your feet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of `uncompromise' was a strong one,'' said Stefanie
Lucas, recently named vice president for marketing at Rockport in
Marlborough, Mass., `because it talked about being uncompromising
in the way you act and think.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We did research showing consumers knew the brand was practical
and well made, but there was really no emotional connection,'' she
added. ``We knew that's what we needed to build and that's what
drew us to AG and Peter Arnell.''
</P>
<P>
   Her reference was to Arnell, chairman and executive creative
director at AG, which in March became part of the Draft Worldwide
unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. AG, also known for
developing and burnishing brand identities for marketers like
Banana Republic, Hanes hosiery, Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan,
Ray-Ban and Samsung, will introduce the theme ``Don't just walk''
to embody the new image of Rockport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're establishing a lifestyle versus pushing a shoe,'' said
Arnell, who joined Lucas for a recent interview to offer a preview
of the campaign, which is to be accompanied by a redesign by AG of
the Rockport corporate identity including its logo, packages and
stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign is not driven by the seasons'' like other
fashion-oriented advertising, Arnell said, ``but by a bigger idea,
adoring the foot, expressing love for the foot.''
</P>
<P>
   The footwear category ``is getting a lot more crowded,'' he
added, ``and the company felt it needed to break through.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing its second-quarter earnings last week, Reebok
reported that sales at Rockport fell 6.9 percent, to $96.8 million,
compared with $104 million in the period a year earlier. In a
statement, Paul Fireman, chairman and chief executive of Reebok,
directed the attention of analysts to Rockport's plans to introduce
footwear that will ``comprise a significant portion of the Rockport
product line and provide the consumer with new and refreshed looks
while still adhering to Rockport's heritage of engineered comfort
and fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping customers who like Rockports for those features while
attracting shoppers who buy footwear on looks is a trickier task
than Sarah Jessica Parker faces when walking in high heels on ``Sex
and the City.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would want people to say Rockport is modern but still
comfortable,'' Lucas said. The budget for the campaign for the rest
of 2000 is about $3 million; spending is to increase significantly
next year, when four TV commercials featuring unclad and unshod
models like the print ads and posters are to begin running.
</P>
<P>
   While the folks in the spots will be as barefoot as Robert
Redford at the end of the Neil Simon film set around Washington
Square Park, two will include shots of Rockport shoes.
</P>
<P>
   If one model in the Rockport campaign looks familiar, Arnell
said, it is because he appeared in ads, posters and packages that
Arnell designed and produced for Samsung. The model, Charles
Andrews, was also shirtless then, toting a microwave oven.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe someday, Andrews will land a campaign for Arrow. &QL;

GORE NARROWS LIST OF RUNNING MATES TO 7 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FIGURE EIGHT ISLAND, N.C. _ Winding up a weeklong vacation by
the sea, Vice President Al Gore on Thursday said that he had
narrowed his list of potential running mates to six plus one ``wild
card,'' for a total of seven.
</P>
<P>
   The list, according to Democratic officials, consists of Sens.
John Kerry of Massachusetts, Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, John
Edwards of North Carolina and Evan Bayh of Indiana, as well as Rep.
Dick Gephardt of Missouri and Gov. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's down to six, with one wild card that I haven't completely
eliminated,'' Gore told reporters who gathered on the beach for a
quick photo opportunity of him and his wife, Tipper, walking
hand-in-hand along the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the six are believed to be on the list for strategic
purposes _ that is, to suggest that Gore is looking at a woman, for
example, when in fact he is not. Both Shaheen and Gephardt have
said they are not interested in the job.
</P>
<P>
   Officials close to the campaign said that all six had spoken
with Warren Christopher, who is heading Gore's search process, and
had been fully vetted.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also said that clearly off the list at this point
were former Sen. George Mitchell of Maine, Sen. Bob Graham of
Florida and Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa. All three are in their 60s and
the selection of any one of them would run counter to the Gore
campaign's assertion that it wants to present an energetic ticket
that is oriented toward the future.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been hashing over his possibilities and looking for
political feedback from his family, Christopher, Bill Daley, his
new campaign chairman, and Alexis Herman, the secretary of labor.
It is not clear how much actual winnowing he has done while on
vacation, since he said on the way here that his list contained
fewer than 10 people, and now it contains barely seven.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it clear whether there really is a serious ``wild card''
candidate. Gore would not say whether the ``wild card'' was someone
whose name was in the public mix of possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   But Daley said that there would be no surprises. ``Nobody's
sneaking under the radar,'' Daley said in an interview. Another
Democratic official suggested that the purpose of mentioning a wild
card at this point was to allow Gore to ``keep his options open.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley said that he expected Gore, who is to leave North Carolina
on Friday morning for a campaign stop in Chicago before heading
back to Washington, was close to making up his mind. ``He's going
to come back Friday, and in my opinion, if he's not 100 percent
there, he'll be 80 percent there.'' He added: ``I know he hasn't''
made a decision. The announcement is scheduled for noon on Tuesday
in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Daley also dismissed a plea by Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota,
the minority leader, to steer clear of naming a Democratic senator
whose replacement would then be picked by a Republican governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will not stop him from going with somebody who he thinks
he's comfortable with and is the best candidate,'' Daley said of
Daschle's entreaty. ``Be great if he could pick somebody from a
Democratic state, but as you know, there aren't a hell of a lot of
Democratic states out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley shrugged off the daily boomlets of different names,
attributing those to lobbying done on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not based upon anything that's coming from Gore,
okay?'' Daley said. ``Those of us who are involved in this sort of
suck it in and analyze it and pass it on to him and say, `Here are
three people who called saying they really think the Bob Kerrey
idea is a great idea, here's why, so if you're still open to
people, figure this in.' So it bounces within him, but this boomlet
is not coming from him or coming from us.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those with an edge in the lobbying department is Edwards.
A number of his advisers in his successful 1998 Senate race, in
which he ousted the incumbent Republican, Lauch Faircloth, are
among Gore's top campaign officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Edwards supporters say that the 47-year-old trial lawyer is
the candidate who would most reinforce Gore's message against the
Republican ``old guard.'' He also happens to come from a state with
a Democratic governor.
</P>
<P>
   The major drawback to selecting Edwards is his relative
inexperience. He has been in the Senate only two years, and his
selection could undermine Gore's repeated assertion that the most
important criterion in a running mate is that the person be ready
to take over from Day One.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore operatives are working on a way to sell Edwards
instantly to voters as someone who is capable of becoming
president. One suggestion is that immediately upon the
announcement, a number of longtime Democratic senators make
testimonials to Edwards's brilliance and how he represents a
once-in-a-generation talent.

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Tom Selleck

 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    'Tis the season of balloons, straw hats, streamers and confetti,
of elephants and donkeys, of smoke-filled rooms and gas-filled
speeches.
 &HT;    In short, it's political-convention season, and sandwiched
between the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia and the
Democratic gathering in Los Angeles, a new presidential candidate
is stepping up to the microphones: Gov. James Reynolds Pryce of
Michigan.
 &HT;    Never heard of him? Well, he looks a lot like Tom Selleck minus
the mustache.
 &HT;    He's a fictional character, of course _ the protagonist in
``Running Mates,'' the Turner Network Television original movie
that will air on Aug. 13, starring a clean-shaven Selleck as a
40-something Harvard Law School graduate, former congressman and
current governor, a man who has spent his entire adult life in
politics.
 &HT;    Pryce has a reputation for up-front honesty _ as a congressman,
he even voted to close an Army base in his own district. He's also
pretty smart, though _ he saw to it that a factory opened on the
site of the closed base, bringing three times as many jobs to the
area as the closing had lost.
 &HT;    Now Pryce is a presidential candidate focused on
campaign-finance reform, and has emerged from the primaries with a
lock on the nomination. The only question left: Who will be his
running mate?
 &HT;    It's down to the wire between two senators, one a Washington
insider in the pocket of big business, dead set against finance
reform, and the other an idealist who refused to take
special-interest money for his own presidential campaign and,
unsurprisingly, was forced to drop out for lack of funds.
 &HT;    Will Pryce stay true to his principles and pick the straight
arrow, or will he compromise with the forces of ``politics as
usual'' in the interest of winning the presidency?
 &HT;    ``I think most people run for office for good reasons and noble
purposes,'' says the very electable-looking Selleck, still sans
mustache as he visits a hotel in Pasadena, Calif., to promote the
movie _ he doesn't wear one in the film because politicians rarely
do, recalling that the last presidential candidate to sport a
mustache was Thomas Dewey, who beat Harry Truman only in the
newspaper headlines.
 &HT;    ``Pryce does a couple of things differently from the norm that
are extremely refreshing,'' Selleck continues. ``For one, he does
not claim to have the magic bullet or the magic solution. He also
doesn't say that the sky will fall if his opposition wins.
 &HT;    ``But he knows that people running for office have been put in
situations where they have to choose between the money and the
influence of the large corporations and what the people want,'' the
actor says. ``Ultimately candidates need to decide how much they
are willing to compromise themselves and their agendas to get into
office.''
 &HT;    Helping Pryce stay on the straight and narrow are four powerful
women _ each of them, coincidentally, past or present romantic
partners. His wife Jenny (Nancy Travis) apparently doesn't mind his
continuing professional relationships with his campaign manager
(Laura Linney), a Hollywood mogul's powerful wife (Teri Hatcher)
and the slightly hysterical wife (Faye Dunaway) of the powerful
senator (Robert Culp) who is Pryce's mentor.
 &HT;    At the very least, the arrangement testifies to the governor's
political skills! Even if it isn't very plausible.
 &HT;    Executive producer Al Ruddy, himself a veteran of the Hollywood
political trenches, says while these four and women like them are
the faces, the brains and often the brawn behind political success
stories, they virtually never win power in their own right.
 &HT;    ``The fact that has always intrigued me about women in politics,
especially in Hollywood, is that they have no power,'' Ruddy says.
``They throw all the parties, like the `Come to Barbra Streisand's
home to hear her sing' fund-raiser for the Democratic National
Committee. But the truth in fact is, come the first of December,
the women are out for another four years. It was a fascinating idea
to develop in this movie.''
 &HT;    If ``Running Mates'' seems to have a better grasp of political
realities than a typical television movie, that's probably because
of Ruddy's partner, executive producer Gerald Rafshoon. After all,
Rafshoon has been there: He ran Jimmy Carter's successful campaign
for the presidency, then became Carter's White House communications
director.
 &HT;    ``I can personally vouch for some of the incidents that happen
in the picture that have their match in real life,'' Rafshoon says.
``The film was actually developed before I came along, but I added
to it some personal reminiscences of conventions. I did two of them
for Governor Carter and then President Carter, and there were some
actual incidents that we were able to put in there and just sort of
add the real feeling, as well as some current issues.''
 &HT;    Rafshoon says that even before the success of NBC's ``The West
Wing,'' nominated for 18 Emmys this season, Hollywood was
comfortable with politics and politicians. Actors understand
politicians, he says, and vice versa.
 &HT;    ``You get to the pinnacle of politics or of show business, and
there's a lot of people you can't run around with,'' Rafshoon says.
``You're comfortable with these people, because you don't have to
worry about a sense of awe. You don't have to worry about not
understanding when the cameras are around.
 &HT;    ``And the Hollywood people are not like the fat cats who want to
give $100 million to do away with environmental concerns,'' he
adds. ``They are political activists who are sincerely interested
in issues that really don't do anything for them personally.''
 &HT;    The film is obviously timely, with Pryce choosing his running
mate just as George W. Bush and Al Gore are doing the same.
Neither, however, is using the criteria that Selleck _ who says
he's been a registered independent for 10 years _ would apply to
such a search.
 &HT;    ``The answers I want to hear from a political candidate in
today's world are `I don't know' and `That's none of your
business,''' Selleck says. ``I'd probably vote for that person.''

   KY-SCHOOL-RAMPAGE (West Paducah, Ky.) _ After their lives were
changed by a 14-year-old killer, the parents of three girls who
were gunned down in a school shooting here sued more than 50 people
they said shared responsibility for the deaths. They sued the
killer and his parents, teachers, school officials, other
teen-agers, neighbors, and the makers of violent videogames, Web
sites and movies. But, after a string of recent legal defeats in
which two judges have dismissed virtually all of the claims, there
will be just one defendant remaining: the killer himself, Michael
Carneal. He is the only one the courts have said can be held liable
for the deaths. The story of the lawsuits shows how difficult it is
to assign blame to the many people who, in retrospect, might have
been able to prevent rampage killings, and it shows how hard it is
to unravel what really happened in cases that are, by definition,
unfathomable. By William Glaberson.

The release of the numbers divided what had been seen as a diverse

could. Some black parents decried how schools were segregating and
shortchanging their kids while white parents defended the schools,
pointing the finger at what they called neglect in black families.

UP FROM OBSCURITY, THEY HELD THE GOP SPOTLIGHT

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Frank Ellis. Gayle White. Jack Crowley. Leilani
Durate. Kenny Gamble. Hector Barreto. Kim Jennings. Christina
Jones. Raul Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   These were some of the prime-time speakers at the Republican
convention. The obscure lineup helped paint a picture of diversity,
but this week's event did little to promote the careers of rising
political stars within the party.
</P>
<P>
   National conventions have often been launching pads for future
presidents. A young senator from Massachusetts, John F. Kennedy,
burst out of the Democratic ranks with a spontaneous bid for the
vice presidential nomination in Chicago in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   With a strong presence in Kansas City in 1976, Ronald Reagan
laid the groundwork for his victory four years later.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton managed to turn a disastrously long speech at the
1988 Atlanta convention into helpful notoriety in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Cuomo, governor of New York at the time, delivered an
electrifying speech at the Democratic convenion in San Francisco in
1984 that kept his name in running speculation through two more
election cycles.
</P>
<P>
   But this year in Philadelphia, no stage was offered to the
Republican reserves and little jockeying took place among ambitious
figures who might be looking ahead to 2004. It was as though the
GOP is confident George W. Bush, whose campaign dictated the
convention schedule, will be running for reelection that year.
</P>
<P>
   No valuable exposure was given to this year's also-rans, Steve
Forbes, Alan Keyes, and Gary Bauer, or to such TV talk-show
favorites as Representative John Kasich of Ohio, Senator Fred
Thompson of Tennessee, and Representative Lindsey Graham of South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the familiar voices heard from the podium belonged to
past political wars and former President Bush's era: the retired
generals, Colin Powell and Norman Schwarzkopf; former Senator Bob
Dole and his wife, Elizabeth; even the new vice presidential
nominee, Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds of receptions and after-hours parties were also
free of overt base-building. Usually, delegations from states
hosting the early contests in the primary season are wooed four
years ahead of time by prospective candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Houston, Senator Gramm really romanced our delegation,''
said former Iowa governor Terry Branstad, recalling Phil Gramm's
spadework at the 1992 convention for the Iowa caucus in '96. At the
last convention in San Diego, former Tennessee governor Lamar
Alexander did the same thing, courting the Iowa crowd months before
the party's nominee, Bob Dole, went down to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, we haven't had any contact with a potential
national candidate,'' Branstad said. ``We're optimistic that we've
got a winner in George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire delegates were also spared. ``We've had parties
and receptions, but we haven't heard anything from anyone,'' said
Bobbie Coffin, a delegate from the Granite State.
</P>
<P>
   The only alternative figure enjoying any celebrity this week was
Senator John McCain of Arizona. Though he had a coveted speaking
spot Tuesday night, appeared at numerous events, hosted private
parties for friends in journalism, and kept a pace consistent with
a candidate considering another race in 2004, McCain was careful to
emphasize only his loyalty to the Bush-Cheney ticket. Nearing 64,
he said he knew it would be difficult to capture again the magic of
this year's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   So Philadelphia offered no other portent for 2004 than the
current governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   As Tim Fitzpatrick, the convention's press secretary, said, the
goal was always ``to personify the priorities the governor has
placed at center stage.''

TAIWAN'S PRESIDENT CALLS FOR PURCHASE OF MILITARY PLANES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Taiwan's president, Chen Shui-bian, said
Thursday that the island should begin considering new fighter
aircraft purchases, warning that in five years China could threaten
Taiwan's ability to control the skies over the Taiwan Strait, a key
factor in repelling a mainland invasion.
</P>
<P>
   That Chen, who spoke during an inspection of Taiwan's air force
headquarters in Taipei, would make the politically charged
suggestion during the Republican Party's convention suggested to
some analysts that he hoped to interject the issue into the U.S.
presidential campaign. The United States is the most likely
supplier of any advanced fighter jets to Taiwan. But such a sale
would be hotly contested by Beijing, which regards the island as a
province separated from the mainland by civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chen may be trying to smoke out the United States and have
some sort of bidding war on reassurances from both candidates,''
said Jonathan Pollack, a China specialist at the Rand Corp. in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Support for Taiwan is always an emotional issue in the United
States, but this year it became particularly so with Chen's
election, which drew threats of war from Beijing. China distrusts
Chen because of his past support for Taiwan's formal independence
from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the 1992 presidential campaign, President Bush
decided to sell Taiwan 150 advanced F-16 fighter aircraft after it
became clear that China had bought advanced Sukhoi-27 fighters from
Russia. The F-16 sale, the last major American arms sale to Taiwan,
infuriated Beijing and complicated already difficult relations
between the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, the United States is
obligated to help Taiwan maintain its defenses. But in a 1982 joint
communique with Beijing, Washington pledged not to increase the
quantity or quality of arms sold to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, though, China has ordered as many as 40 advanced
Sukhoi-30 fighters from Russia as part of a steadily growing arms
procurement program intended to give China an edge over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   One mainland military official here said this week that air
force personnel have been told to expect the first of the planes to
arrive in China later this year. The Sukhoi-30 is capable of
carrying air-to-surface guided anti-ship missiles and has a longer
range than the Sukhoi-27 fighters.
</P>
<P>
   China has already fielded 48 of the Sukhoi-27 fighters at bases
around the country and first deployed them over the Taiwan Strait
during war games last year. It has plans to assemble as many as 200
more with help from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Bates Gill, a Chinese military expert at the Brookings
Institution, said it is natural that the reports of Sukhoi-30
purchases from Russia should inspire Taiwan's air force to look for
a next generation aircraft itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the aging of the F-16 and the lead times needed to get
next-generation aircraft in fighting shape, these decisions need to
be made within the next three to five years at the latest,'' said
Gill.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts said Chen may simply be raising the issue
generally to put the next U.S. administration on notice that the
shopping list will be longer than usual when the island makes its
annual arms purchase requests in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Taiwan enjoys clear air superiority over the
100-mile-wide body of water separating the island from the
mainland, thanks to its F-16's and 60 French-made Mirage 2000-5
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   While China has the largest air force in the world with about
6,000 planes, nearly half of those date from the 1950s and only a
few dozen of the rest are viable machines for modern warfare. Even
with its Russian purchases, military analysts say China is a long
way from dominating the skies over Taiwan because few of its pilots
have received aggressive training in the advanced fighter aircraft.
China is believed to have lost several Sukhoi-27 jets in training
exercises already and Beijing is reluctant to push the training
harder for fear of losing more of the expensive planes.
</P>
<P>
   The country also lacks the sophisticated battlefield command
technology necessary to deploy its jets effectively. It had hoped
to meet that need with help from Israel, which agreed to sell China
a Phalcon advanced-warning and air-control system mounted atop a
Russian jet. Israel canceled that sale last month in response to
American pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen warned that Taiwan must not be complacent and should
start planning for the next generation of fighters now. He said
Taiwan should look into fighters for 2010 to 2020 and upgrade its
weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
   China's modernization drive will ``dramatically boost the
Communist Chinese air force's overall air combat capability,
seriously affecting the military balance between the two sides''
after 2005, Chen said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon evidently concurs. It told Congress in its annual
report on the Chinese military this June that ``if projected trends
continue, the balance of air power across the Taiwan Strait could
begin to shift in China's favor'' after 2005, unless Taiwan
enhances its air power. The report estimated that China would have
150 advanced fighter jets by then along with the ability to refuel
many of those aircraft in the air, extending their range.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear where Taiwan would turn to upgrade its air
defenses if not to the United States. France is unlikely to sell
aircraft to China after having been severely chastised by Beijing
for its sale of Mirage jets to Taiwan in 1992. Taiwan has talked
about upgrading its F-5E aircraft, but experts say that will not
maintain the island's superiority in the face of China's arms
purchases. And Taiwan is not expected to build more Indigenous
Defense Fighters, a costly home-built jet that has been plagued
with problems. Last month, the island's air force commissioned the
final fleet of jets built, bringing the number in service to 130.
</P>
<P>
   But it is equally unclear how Washington would respond to a
request for more jets. ``It depends on whether the next president
is prepared to do battle again with the Chinese on major new
aircraft deliveries to Taiwan,'' said Rand's Pollack.

TWO POLITICAL VETERANS VIE FOR GEORGIA'S VACANT SENATE SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The unexpected race to replace the late Sen. Paul
Coverdell has become a contest between two of the best-known names
from Georgia's political past, both of whom are nearing 70 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, former Sen. Mack Mattingly became the leading
Republican in the race after Lewis Jordan, an airline executive,
announced he would not run. Mattingly, 69, will face former Gov.
Zell Miller, 68, a Democrat who was recently appointed to fill
Coverdell's seat until the Nov. 7 election.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, 61, a Republican, died of a brain hemorrhage on July
18. Gov. Roy E. Barnes persuaded Miller to assume the seat last
week, hoping that Miller's lingering popularity with voters would
keep lesser-known Republicans from entering the race.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy worked _ a large group of the state's Republican
congressmen spent 10 days wrestling with the risk of giving up safe
seats to challenge Miller, and none decided to make the race. Party
leaders turned to Mattingly, hoping his name recognition would help
raise money quickly to compete against Miller's head start.
</P>
<P>
   But Mattingly, who served one term in the Senate before being
defeated in 1986, was never as popular in the state as Miller.
Several national Republican leaders urged the state party to hold
out for a younger, more forceful candidate, which led to Jordan's
brief interest in the job.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, chairman of the National
Republican Senatorial Committee, said earlier this week that Jordan
was the stronger candidate because he was willing to spend $3
million of his own fortune on the race. In a television interview,
he said Mattingly could not win, and would not get any financial
help from the national party.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, 56, was the founder of ValuJet Airlines, which later
changed its name to AirTran Airways. He has spent the week in
Philadelphia at the Republican National Convention, hoping to win
over Georgia's delegation. But given Mattingly's firm decision to
run, Jordan was eventually convinced that having two Republicans on
the ballot would increase Miller's chances of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the interest of party unity, and after careful
consideration of what I believe is in the best interest of my
family, I have chosen not to run,'' he said in a written statement
issued by his office late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The special election is technically nonpartisan, with no party
affiliations listed on the ballot. Three other lesser-known
candidates have also entered the race, and if no one gets more than
half the vote, there will be a runoff between the top two
candidates on Nov. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly, a member of the party's conservative wing, ran a
lackluster re-election campaign in 1986, for which he apologized
six years later in a letter to supporters. ``I am not a good
politician,'' he said in the letter, written when he was briefly
considering another run for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   He decided not to run for the Senate that year, saying he did
not feel committed to the race, and has otherwise kept a low
political profile. In 1987, he was named NATO's assistant
secretary-general for defense support, and in 1992 President George
Bush appointed him to be ambassador to the Seychelles. Last summer,
he became a paid lobbyist for the defense contractor Lockheed
Martin, urging former colleagues in the Senate to help preserve the
company's $65 billion F-22 stealth fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Clay, the chairman of the state Republican Party, said he
was relieved that the party had settled on a single candidate, but
made it clear he was aware of the difficult road ahead for
Mattingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a tough situation, but Mack knows how to run a race,
and that's important when you've only got 90 days against a 45-year
political veteran like Zell Miller,'' Clay said. ``Hey, there ain't
no perfect candidate, but at least we're all behind one candidate
now.''

IRANIANS FIGHT COUNTRY'S POLITICS, IN PUBLIC  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ It was a Rip van Winkle moment.
</P>
<P>
   Mohsen Kadivar, a mid-ranking cleric, had just been released
after serving 18 months in jail for ``disturbing public opinion''
because he had branded Iran a religious despotism. As some 1,000
students gathered to honor him, Kadivar could not believe his ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religion has performed badly when it has gone along with
power,'' said Hashem Aghajeri, a Tehran University professor, in an
outspoken and emotional speech in which he effectively called for
an end to religious control that has dominated social and political
life for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Aghajeri, speaking in a university auditorium last Sunday, even
touched upon one of the most sacrosanct tenets of the Islamic
government and insisted that the people of Iran must be able to
choose the supreme leader, whose word here is law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who believe Islamic jurisprudence is a kind of divinity
on earth, that it cannot be criticized, or judged by the law, must
enter debates with Islamic thinkers and let voters to choose,'' he
said. The audience applauded vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governments that suppress thinking under the name of religion
are not only not religious governments but are not even humane
governments,'' he added. ``It is time for the institution of
religion to become separated from the institution of government.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting that shocked Kadivar is illustrative of how much
more boldly Iranians are expressing their political discontent in
public, even though conservatives led by the supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have shut down 20 newspapers and jailed
seven journalists since April.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the reformist-dominated Parliament that was elected
in February is scheduled to give the new boldness a public face by
debating what analysts here describe as its first measure
challenging the hardliners: to amend the repressive press law.
</P>
<P>
   The former Parliament, dominated by hard-liners who opposed
reform, passed a law in March that imposed new restrictions on the
press. It requires newspaper publishers to submit the list of their
staff to the judiciary, which is dominated by hardliners, and
allows the judiciary to jail journalists and close newspapers
without a court verdict. The press court can also overrule its

   Ayatollah Khamenei, who favors a strict religious society,

   Now, Parliament is challenging the right to crack down on the
independent newspapers that emerged after the election of President
Mohammad Khatami in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament's decisions have to be vetted by the Council of

   But Hamidreza Jalaipour, publisher of five newspapers that were
successively banned in the last three years, said the debate on the
press law is ``a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parliament itself is under enormous pressure,'' Jalaipour
said. ``The new changes would allow the closed newspapers to
publish again and that is very positive for the reform movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of the new parliament, Mehdi Karoubi, told a meeting of
the Association of Newspapers this week that the way the media have
been treated is ``worrisome.''

<P>
   ``I hope that by eliminating obstacles we create an opportunity
for intellectuals and journalists to pave the way for more
democratic participation,'' he said.

 &HT;    Party activist raises profile again as Senate candidate
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Former U.S. Sen. Mack Mattingly took the scenic route
back to St. Simons Island after losing his seat in Washington 14
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A stint in Belgium as a NATO official, then an ambassadorship to
the Seychelles, an island nation off the eastern coast of Africa,
capped off a resume filled with roles as a GOP party-builder in
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But once back in coastal Georgia, where the Indiana native has
lived for four decades, Mattingly was expected by his friends to
stay put, content to continue his role as a behind-the-scenes
player in Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to ask him, 'Mack, when are we going to run another
campaign?' `` said Betty Jones, a former vice chairman of the state
GOP who worked in Mattingly's successful 1980 Senate bid. ``He'd
say, 'Been there, done that.' He didn't have a clue about getting
back into politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the man who defeated Democratic icon Herman Talmadge two
decades ago to become the first Republican elected to the U.S.
Senate from Georgia since Reconstruction is hoping to vanquish
another venerable Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly, 69, was one of the first candidates to qualify
Wednesday to challenge newly appointed U.S. Sen. Zell Miller in a
Nov. 7 special election to fill the remaining four years of the
late Sen. Paul Coverdell's term. Coverdell died July 18 from a
brain hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   Even state and national GOP leaders admit Mattingly faces an
uphill climb against the popular former governor.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly's name hasn't been on the ballot in Georgia since the
1986 Senate race he narrowly lost to Democrat Wyche Fowler. Since
then, thousands of new residents have moved to Georgia and the
Atlanta suburbs, where Mattingly found much of his support for the
1980 upset against Talmadge. And most of those newcomers are
unfamiliar with the former office equipment salesman.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time, though, that Mattingly has faced a
tough race.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Mattingly was a political novice running against
four-term incumbent Talmadge, the last of a Georgia political
dynasty who'd been tarnished by alcoholism, a messy divorce and a
Senate investigation into his finances.
</P>
<P>
   Talmadge entered the general election campaign damaged, from a
bitter Democratic primary with Miller, to face Mattingly. It wasn't
until the last suburban votes were counted the morning after the
election that Mattingly seized victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody really thought we'd win,'' said Matt Towery, a
political analyst and former state legislator who began his
political career writing speeches for Mattingly. ``But Mattingly
never, ever believed he'd lost. I can understand why he believes
this is doable because he's faced more daunting odds.''
</P>
<P>
   But that 1980 victory was short-lived. After one six-year term,
Mattingly's Senate career ended in a loss to Fowler, whom he'd
tried, unsuccessfully, to brand as a liberal congressman from
Atlanta who skipped too many votes in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing Fowler's voting record, however, meant Mattingly had
to spend time in the Capitol casting votes himself in the weeks
before the election, rather than campaigning in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got bad advice, and he took it,'' said Jay Morgan, a former
GOP state director. ``The thing that is discomforting to a lot of
GOP leaders is they don't know which Mattingly they will get on the
ballot this time. Will it be the insightful Mattingly or will we
get the Senate candidate we had in 1986?''
</P>
<P>
   The defeat didn't end Mattingly's political career. He was
appointed to NATO as the assistant secretary general for defense
support, helping U.S. allies coordinate arms programs. Later,
President Bush tapped Mattingly as the U.S. ambassador to the
Seychelles.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1990s, Mattingly has spent much of his time
serving on a handful of public and nonprofit boards. But in
Republican circles his name was never forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   A former state party chairman installed during the Gerald Ford
years, Mattingly is one of the GOP's most reliable workers.
Applauded for his political instincts, he was among the triumvirate
_ including Coverdell and Newt Gingrich, the future U.S. House
speaker _ who met regularly during the late 1970s and early '80s to
guide the embryonic party in Georgia toward grass-roots organizing
rather than an emphasis only on presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   A low-key figure with a dry sense of humor and gift more for
organization than oratory, Mattingly continued regular briefings
with Coverdell after Republicans seized power in Congress in the
mid-1990s. Dot Burns, who headed Coverdell's campaign committee,
said Mattingly talked with the late senator weekly and would have
been Coverdell's choice for a successor.

 &HT;    MindSpring founder ponders next move
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Former EarthLink Chairman Charles Brewer seemed in a
chipper mood Thursday as he was leaving the Commerce Club monthly
board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   His sudden departure from EarthLink on Wednesday appeared to
have lifted a burden on his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited to be freed up to do something new,'' Brewer said.
``For me, this is a good thing, not a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer, the charismatic founder of MindSpring _ which merged
with EarthLink in February _ has become one of Atlanta's leading
citizens of the new economy. How his departure from the Internet
service provider will affect Brewer's involvement in the community
and EarthLink's commitment to Atlanta are understandable concerns.
</P>
<P>
   As for his role in Atlanta, Brewer said he's not going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not bailing,'' he said, adding that he plans to have a
Midtown office close to his home.
</P>
<P>
   As for his plans for the future, Brewer said, ``I want to
accomplish something that's worthwhile, important and makes a
difference. That might be starting another business or something
else. It might be more than one thing. I'm at a point now where I
can choose to do something. And making money is not a big
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed more about his next move in life, Brewer, 41,
acknowledged that he probably will start a new business, just like
he started MindSpring in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably better at starting something than managing,'' he
said. ``I have a lot of advantages that I didn't have when I
started MindSpring. I'm a lot smarter in business than I was then.
I have a lot more capital. And I have a lot more relationships and
contacts. That would definitely give me a good head start.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer really did not want to discuss the particulars of what
happened after the merger with EarthLink that prompted him to
leave, sell all his stock and have no official role with the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to make a clean break,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer did say he had placed a portion of his stock before the
sale into his charitable foundation, and that he and his wife,
Jenny Brewer, will work on philanthropy together.
</P>
<P>
   As to the future of EarthLink in Atlanta, Brewer said, ``I would
be shocked if the headquarters didn't stay in Atlanta.'' And he
said he would expect Gary Betty, EarthLink's chief executive who
has a home in Atlanta and intends to move his main office here, to
take on a larger community role.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of good, capable people working in management
at EarthLink,'' Brewer said. ``I certainly wish them well.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Brewer is busy with his two young children (one of 13
months and one a week old) and negotiating a lease for his new
office.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: Brewer's laid-back style is not going to
change despite his estimated worth of nearly $100 million as
reported in Forbes magazine. His three-legged dog, Louie, will
continue to be his trusted companion, and expect his office to have
some of his trademark junk furniture he bought when he first went
in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no new office that does not allow Louie. That's
nonnegotiable,'' Brewer said. ``The plastic chairs broke. But I
still have the plastic table. I think they will let me keep that.''
</P>
<P>
   After the board meeting at the Commerce Club, he drove away in
his electric vehicle _ yet one more example of Brewer's independent
and progressive style.
</P>
<P>
   So while EarthLink will lose Brewer's charming and humorous
personality, Atlanta will not.

CHENEY FALTERS AS CONVENTION SPEAKER, GIVING BUSH EASY ACT TO
FOLLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARYN JAMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush had an on-screen audition Thursday night for the
role of president, and his performance was helped by an unwanted
piece of luck. The previous night's acceptance speech by the vice
presidential nominee, Dick Cheney, gave Bush an easy act to top.
</P>
<P>
   Speeches rarely make good television, but there are ways to
overcome that. The speaker can be dynamic enough to leap off the
screen (think of how well Bill Clinton plays to the camera,
long-winded though he is). Or the words can reveal something about
him as a leader. Cheney flopped spectacularly on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected Cheney, with his placid and deliberate manner,
to display rock-star charisma. David Letterman has done as much to
define the Cheney style as anyone. ``He's a babe magnet,''
Letterman often says with a straight face, playing sounds of
squealing women whenever anyone on ``Late Show'' says ``Dick
Cheney.'' It's hard for a politician to shake off that kind of
on-target satire.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers might have expected a more television-friendly speech,
though. The lines that jumped out (Bush ``will restore decency and
integrity to the Oval Office'') echoed like a rerun of a year of
impeachment television. Such campaign lines may have stirred up the
loyalists on the convention floor (they were roused to what Tom
Brokaw on NBC called a ``not-so-spontaneous demonstration''), but
did nothing to grab an audience wondering whether to watch more,
flip to HBO or just give up and go to bed.
</P>
<P>
   In a television-driven campaign, lame speeches are not minor.
With every network and cable channel covering the acceptances, this
was the first chance the candidates had to speak directly and at
length to an audience so large. (Though viewers have sensibly fled
from this convention, even low ratings add up. Nearly 11 million
people watched Cheney on ABC, CBS and NBC combined. While that
would be a modest number for an entertainment show on just one
network, it is many millions more than have seen him on the air
before.)
</P>
<P>
   The Cheney speech was typical of what the Republicans did
throughout this convention. For four days they had the kind of
television time campaign contributions cannot buy, and largely
wasted it. Many commentators have called the choice of Cheney a
``first, do no harm'' approach, but a safe strategy is bound to
backfire if the point is to get eyeballs to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans staged a complacent show, assuming the audience
would be theirs. And they outfoxed themselves with a convention so
scripted that all anyone could talk about was its lack of surprise.
Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, was kept off the
podium, so he turned up on every talk show, defending his record.
The celebrity bookers seemed to be slacking off, too, settling for
Bo Derek and the wrestling star The Rock, star power of dim
wattage.
</P>
<P>
   The one true star was the candidate's nephew, George P. Bush,
telegenic, astonishingly smooth for a 24-year-old, proud of his
half-Mexican heritage. He was scheduled to deliver a bilingual
speech just before his uncle's acceptance, and for days before
turned up in dozens of profiles and interviews. One profile
included a clip of him being introduced to a crowd as ``the hottest
member of the Bush family.'' He even charmed interviewers. When
Brokaw asked whether his grandfather, former President Bush, had
warned him about journalists, the young Bush smoothly said, ``He
loves you guys, don't believe the hype.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of four days, this fresh face had turned familiar,
but surely the Republicans didn't go to all this trouble just to
make George P. a star.

DRUG MAKER FIRES BACK AT MAINE OVER LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Maine certainly fired the first shot. Under a law
passed in May, it became the first state to threaten the
pharmaceutical industry with price controls on prescription drugs,
and it created a program to negotiate lower prices for about half
its residents.
</P>
<P>
   But now, it appears, the pharmaceutical industry is beginning to
fire back. SmithKline Beecham, the drug manufacturer, said Thursday
that concerns about the new law's potential effects were prompting
it to shift its supply routes and that it would now ship its drugs
directly only to wholesalers based in other states.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for SmithKline, Thomas Johnson, said that because
the company already supplied Maine through ``multiple
wholesalers,'' some in-state and some out-of-state, the shift in
wholesalers would affect neither the availability nor the price of
the company's drugs in Maine. Among its best-known products are
Augmentin, an antibiotic; Paxil, for mood disorders; and Avandia,
for diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   But Maine's commissioner of human services, Kevin W. Concannon,
said SmithKline's decision could cause prices to rise for consumers
in Maine because reshipping the drugs from other states would cost
more, though he did not foresee any effect on availability.
</P>
<P>
   ``On behalf of the people of Maine,'' he said in a statement,
``I am angered at today's actions by SmithKline Beecham because it
looks like a purposeful attempt to avoid Maine law, and I intend to
continue to put into place all the elements necessary to achieve
lower prices for Maine people.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson of SmithKline described the shift in supply as ``a
business decision driven by the fact that this was a vague law and
difficult to interpret.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had no figures on the volume of sales that would be
shifted, or on the company's sales volume in Maine. He also said he
did not know the names of the wholesalers affected.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the anger Concannon expressed, Johnson said: ``Our
intent is really not to punish anyone. We're just taking measures
to make sure our products remain available as always while we have
a chance to understand the implications of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   When Maine was still considering its drug-pricing law,
pharmaceutical industry lobbyists had warned that price controls
could chill research efforts, discourage the state's fledgling
biotechnology industry and hinder Mainers' access to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But SmithKline's decision appears to be the first concrete
response from a drug company to the law, which will take effect in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many threats were made by the pharmaceutical industry as the
Legislature deliberated on this issue,'' said Chellie Pingree, the
Democratic majority leader of the state Senate, ``and now the
citizens of Maine will see the results of a business putting
profits before the health and welfare of our citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Other legislatures, particularly those in New England, are
considering laws similar to Maine's and are watching the situation
closely.
</P>
<P>
   Top lawmakers and officials from the Northeastern states have
been meeting regularly to plot strategies on banding together to
bring down prices by various methods, including laws like Maine's,
the creation of regional drug-buying pools and a series of other
measures.
</P>
<P>
   The law created a program known as Maine Rx, which is designed
to negotiate lower drug prices for the 325,000 residents whose
prescriptions are not covered by insurance, along with 200,000
people in Medicaid and in drug programs for the elderly. The state
has a total population of about 1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The law also created $100,000 ``profiteering'' penalties for
manufacturers or distributors caught overcharging or restricting
drug supplies. And if, by January 2003, drug prices have not
dropped considerably, then the law allows the state to impose price
controls the next July.

study in contradictions. On the one hand, GOP leaders express their
disgust with the president's behavior and speak longingly of having
a president worthy of their respect. On the other hand, their
decision to transform the GOP's image by opening the party's doors
widely to African Americans, Hispanics and gays copies the type of
strategy that twice won the presidency for Clinton and the
Democrats. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON. (For release Sunday, Aug 6.)

POLITICAL SURFING: SCENES OF BUSH, PREPARING FOR HIS SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the themes of the Republican National Convention began to
coalesce on its final day _ we're not your grandma's Republican
Party, everybody's welcome now, let's wash the Clinton-Gore stain
out of the White House _ the cable television pundits and Internet
commentators seemed visibly relieved that they finally had a firm
idea of the agenda they will be bickering about for the next three
months.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they were just relieved that it was time for them to
go.
</P>
<P>
   All over the dial Thursday there were scenes of Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas visiting former President Gerald R. Ford in the
hospital, or making his final preparations for Thursday night's
acceptance speech. A lot of channels were cleaning out their stash
of leftover features about the wonders of Philadelphia (Jane
Clayson of CBS' ``Early Show'' went rowing on the Schuylkill River
with octogenarians, for instance). There were some lingering
arguments about how well the vice-presidential nominee Dick
Cheney's throw-the-bums-out line would play with moderates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are going to join Clinton-Gore at the hip,''
promised CNN's Robert Novak. But mostly it was wrap-up time.
</P>
<P>
   And not a moment too soon, to listen to the reports on
television and the World Wide Web. People have not been watching
the convention in droves, a subject of much concern to the people
who have paid a fortune to cover the event. While the major
networks had chipped their prime-time coverage down to an hour or
less, shifting the bulk of the work to cable, the cable all-news
channels were attracting viewership numbers that looked more like
the circulation for a medium-sized newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   This is mass media? Perhaps the crowds have moved to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not. One of the most interesting Web projects at the
convention was the partnership between Speakout.com and MSNBC,
which allowed viewers to rate the convention's major speakers, in
real time, while listening to the speech. Afterward, compiled
results were to be posted on the Internet, broken down by gender
and political preference. On Tuesday night, when Sen. John McCain
of Arizona was the featured attraction, only 426 people bothered to
take part, about the size of many high-school graduating classes.
It will never be know how many might have taken part on Wednesday
night, when Cheney delivered his blast at the Democrats, because
the whole thing went kaflooey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to substantial network failure, we were unable to conduct
the scheduled Instant Viewer Response on Wednesday,'' said a notice
on the Web page.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cause of the failure is currently under investigation,''
it added, ominously, before concluding with a more upbeat,
``However, full service has been restored and new results will be
posted immediately following George W. Bush's speech on Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations that resulted in mass arrest on Tuesday in
downtown Philadelphia also seemed to have vaporized by Thursday, at
least as far as television images were concerned. Perhaps it proved
difficult to rally people to the barricades with the slogan: The
whole world's not watching.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, from the Democratic campaign: Every channel had
Thursday's shot of Al Gore walking along a beach in North Carolina,
shaking hands, waving to folks, but saying nothing. On Wednesday,
he was barefoot and his wife, Tipper, was with him. She had shoes
on. On Thursday, he had shoes on, too, but then it did seem a
little windier.
</P>
<P>
   Both CNN and Fox presented Generation X panels to talk about how
young people were reacting to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith Bagby, author of ``We've Got Issues,'' said the whole
thing seemed like a big pep rally. ``I would give the Republicans
an A in terms of the pep rally,'' she said. ``In terms of talking
about the issues affecting young people, they did a very cursory
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Alison Fields of Rock the Vote said she was disappointed that
McCain had not pushed his campaign finance reform message in his
speech on Tuesday. ``He wussed out big time,'' she decided.
</P>
<P>
   The National Journal decided to find out what the convention's
official theme _ ``Renewing America's Purpose. Together.'' _ might
possibly mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say it four times quick,'' the article by Burt Solomon on The
Journal's Web site said. ``Mean anything yet?''
</P>
<P>
   Their reporter went onto the convention floor to ask people what
the slogan meant to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back to basics,'' decided Dan Crowley, a Maryland alternate
delegate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work together,'' said Pat Harvey, a volunteer from nearby
Bucks County, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to get spiritual on you,'' warned Cindy Costa, a
national committeewoman from South Carolina. ``America has a
destiny, purposed by God Almighty, and we have gotten away from its
precepts, starting in the '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayson capped her week in Philadelphia with a montage of images
from her first-ever national political convention. Yes, a
cheesesteak was involved. Did she have any lessons to bring back to
co-host Bryant Gumbel in New York? ``Even though this was a highly
staged event,'' she said, ``the people behind it were still very
passionate about their politics.''

MILLER REVIEW: JUST SIT TIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's been in a self-imposed exile, experimenting with such
things as using pork rinds as an herbal colonic, analyzing the
stock potential of ostrich farming and writing insurance policies
for UFO abductions _ all from his secret retreat cottage, otherwise
known as the custodial quarters of the Shangra La Motor Inn just
this side of the Al Davis Landfill in Irwindale.
</P>
<P>
   But the other day, after adjusting his satellite dish an extra
two degrees southeast to graze the edge of the RPD-6 satellite
hovering in space directly above Bowlegged Bay, Ark., that's being
used exclusively to help government surveyors strategically plan
the next trailer park multiplex, a strange phenomenon occurred on
his TV set.
</P>
<P>
   Something besides the highlights of Anna Kournikova upsetting
Lindsay Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it was, it caused Mr. Wise Guy _ yup, the all-knowing,
all-seeing sage of sports television who in the past often took
time to give his smart-aleck responses to your moronic questions
about the business _ to not only leap out of the heavily duct-taped
La-Z-Boy but temporarily emerge from his darkened existence and
actually respond to the burning issues of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   So, before he changes his mind or any of his other
undergarments, fire away:
</P>
<P>
   __ Question: All right, since everyone else seems to have an
opinion on it, and they're still talking about it, what was your
take on . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Answer: I knew that was coming, so let's get it out of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Dickerson _ stinky-poo.
</P>
<P>
   Next question.
</P>
<P>
   __ Q: No, what about . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ A: Melissa Stark? Stark-ravin' weak.
</P>
<P>
   __ Q: OK, but then there's . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ A: Grizzly Adams? Oh, right Dan Fouts . . . as exciting as a
low-grade headache. Take the ``F'' and the ``S'' out of his last
name and you've got that one nailed. Boomer, stop laughing.
</P>
<P>
   __ Q: You know, if you just let me finish a question . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ A: The ``ump cam'' _ it'll only work when a QB throws over
the middle and drills the suicide-seeking official right in the
coconut. Then we'll see some interesting footage _ of the trainer
hovering over him with smelling salts . . .
</P>
<P>
   OK, no more stupid stalling. This isn't building toward
anything. But you're after the same thing everyone else is _ more
instant analysis about the funny guy paid to give us scripted groin
jokes on ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   Only we ain't gonna get caught in that trap again.
</P>
<P>
   We got a lot of opinions, sure. Sometimes, we're forced to give
them because everyone else seems to be talking about it, and we
don't want to look like we're out of the loop.
</P>
<P>
   So before we all get hyperventilated over the moment that's apt
to permanently mark our strange place in pop-culture history
somewhere between Andy Warhol's soup cans and genetic
reconstruction for fun and profit, let's review a few key things:
</P>
<P>
   1) That was an !ital!exhibition game last Monday night.
Completely different flow, completely different storytelling, than
a !ital!non-exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you'll get a sense of what Dennis Miller _ OK, I said his
name _ can do on the broadcast _ and he made it worth watching. But
you aren't going to get the full monty, nor should you.
</P>
<P>
   2) That was Miller's !ital!first NFL live broadcast. Give him
until November or December before Denny's Grand Slam puns start
satisfying your appetite.
</P>
<P>
   3) That was the ``Monday Night Football'' telecast with a new
producer, new director and a new set of broadcasters. Al Michaels
is about the only holdover from last year's gang, except for a few
cameramen and one or two redundant graphic machines.
</P>
<P>
   4) Of course, the ratings were miserable. The game started at
four !ital!freakin' o'clock out here. At that time of day, I'm just
trying to figure out which undersized value meal I'm gonna pick for
lunch down at the Micky D's over at Haskell and Ventura in Encino _
you know, the one with the drive-thru window on the wrong side of
the building. (I drive a refurbished U.S. Mail truck, so it works
for me.)
</P>
<P>
   5) There is no No. 5. Besides, I'm weary from all this.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to hear about it from the guy himself, watch his HBO
show tonight. Surely, he'll confess it wasn't perfect, then get off
on a rant about whatever them nouveau intellectual types like to
talk about.
</P>
<P>
   That's his job. Yours, for the time being, is to sit tight, you
little sea monkeys. Go vote on ESPN.com's Web site if it's that
important to you (more than 200,000 did, with more than a third
giving Miller a ``B'' grade).
</P>
<P>
   Cosell ain't coming back and there's still a long hot summer
ahead of us, so if you start blowing your stack over something like
this, you'll lose sight over the fact you're about to elect a new
president who might or might not have enough arm to throw out the
first pitch on Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   And that, friends, will be much more embarrassing in the big
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Next question.
</P>
<P>
   __ Q: Have you been watching the . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ A: Uh, hey, love to help you with that one, but there's a
dead armadillo in the parking lot I need to tend to. You know, the
more you run over it with a car, the flatter it gets.
</P>
<P>
   Kinda like Dennis Miller critiques.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Heavy rumors _ again _ of Mike ``Mayor McCheese'' Thompson
bailing out at AM-1150 as its programming director to take a job
with a budding all-sports station in Atlanta. Thompson wants to get
his mitts on some of the new programming scheme for the Fox Radio
Network, scheduled to launch . . . who knows when. But if he does
for that what he's already done for the 1150 lineup, it's probably
best he does exit, stage left. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ The International Olympic Committee has released a statement
predicting that the record 3.7 billion viewers who watched the 1996
Summer Games from Atlanta will be broken when the world focuses on
Sydney next month. An IOC survey released Thursday indicates 88
percent of the people in Japan responded that they are
``interested'' or ``very interested'' in watching the Games on TV.
The United States (72 percent) fell in behind South Korea (81),
Ireland, Finland and Lithuania (80), China and Greece (79) and
Australia (78). You think the U.S. numbers would be higher if the
folks here knew there'd at least be an hour of live programming
during those two weeks? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Some final shots at KCOP-Channel 13 sports anchor Michelle
Bonner. On Ron Fineman's ``On The Record'' media-review Web site
(www.ronfineman.com), he tried to drum up some pro-Bonner responses
after a week's worth of those that supported an original posting
about how extremely difficult the station's camera people find her
to work with. Fineman didn't receive any supportive e-mails, so he
hesitantly posted the latest two from cameramen who worked with her
in other TV markets, and the sentiment was pretty much the same.
Fineman writes that he doesn't want his ``Inside L.A. TV'' link to
be a weekly Bonner bashing session _ but it has been. And that's
even without any responses from the former KCOP sports anchors who
privately are thankful they don't have to work with her any longer,
either.

KERRY'S TIME MAY HAVE COME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is cloistered these helpless days at his wife's mountainside
estate mourning the recent death of his father, at the same time
facing what must undoubtedly be one of the longest, tensest
weekends of his life.
</P>
<P>
   At any point over the next few days, the telephone might ring
for Senator John Kerry. Vice President Al Gore might be on the
other end. And Gore might begin that conversation with the words,
``John, I want you as my running mate.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, a career that has been overshadowed by others will
suddenly be thrust into the clear and open light. John Kerry, for
the first time in a long time, will be the junior senator no more.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility is growing with each passing hour, such that
Kerry intimates who have surveyed the field of vice presidential
prospects privately say his chances of being selected are better
than 50 percent. It is an analysis deemed modest by many Washington
veterans, who increasingly view Kerry, with his Vietnam medals,
proven campaign skills, and strong Senate record, as the likely
choice. Gore has scheduled an announcement for Tuesday in
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, all public proclamations and private whispers had
it down to six possibilities _ Kerry, Senators Evan Bayh of
Indiana, John Edwards of North Carolina, and Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut, House minority leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, and
Governor Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Of those candidates, Gephardt and Shaheen have flatly said they
are not interested in the job. Edwards, first elected just a
year-and-a-half ago, is seen as too inexperienced and unknown. And
Bayh is too short of that undefinable political quality of
gravitas.
</P>
<P>
   Smartly, Kerry has sequestered himself. He is making no pleading
telephone calls to mutual strategists and friends. He has
restricted his public appearances so as to not be seen campaigning
for the job. He has avoided cameras like the plague.
</P>
<P>
   It took him a while, but the man whose unflattering moniker was
``Liveshot'' has learned his lessons well, raising the questions:
Do we have a new John Kerry, a better one at that?
</P>
<P>
   The faults of the old one have been well chronicled. He is, by
many accounts, aloof and arguably arrogant, enraging to local
officials who say he only pays them heed every six or so years,
coincidentally right around election time.
</P>
<P>
   He complains more than most politicians of his stature, feels
more slights, even whines to reporters about coverage that he seems
to constantly deem unfair. Even some allies view him as
opportunistic, and in a business in which self-centeredness is the
dominant gene, Kerry is virtually without peer.
</P>
<P>
   Don Imus calls Kerry a ``pretty man,'' and indeed, even at 56
years of age, he has the type of face that other men want to
dislike, including me. Yet I can't.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why. First off, he's smart _ smart enough to fashion a
prosperous Senate career with a distinct identity in the shadow of
the most influential legislator this state has ever known: Ted
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   He has moved steadily toward the middle in his 14 years in the
Senate, providing definition to the oft-sought but ethereal concept
of centrism. In 1992, Kerry highlighted problems with affirmative
action before any Democrat dared speak ill of it. And in 1998, he
denounced the tenure system in public schools, imperiling his
relationship with powerful teachers' unions.
</P>
<P>
   He is secure enough intellectually to not only withstand
challenges, but also to invite them from a talented group of aides
and advisers. He can be personable, even engaging, obsessed about
such random activities as the Boston restaurant scene and his
fledgling golf game. His long antennae for slights have given him
valuable insights into life's pitfalls and setbacks _ no small
matter for anyone, but especially someone with a Forbes lineage.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry has grown and, more importantly, matured. And come
Tuesday, Massachusetts and the nation may see him in a light he's
never been seen in before. His time may well have arrived.

 By PETER BROOKS    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ Though George W. Bush admits he is not an
avid reader, his wife is a serious lover of literature. Laura Bush
has read widely, from Greek tragedy to William Faulkner to Truman
Capote. When asked to name her favorite book, on the long list she
has read, she selected the ``The Grand Inquisitor'' section of
Dostoevsky's ``The Brothers Karamazov.'' This is an interesting and
suggestive choice, of a chilling and troubling chapter in a
challenging novel.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Bush's choice of reading has nothing to do with
Republican philosophy. But since her husband is the party's nominee
for president, one might speculate about the messages the
Republicans could find in this literary work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Grand Inquisitor'' is actually a story told by Ivan
Karamazov to his brother Alyosha, in which Ivan imagines the return
of Jesus to earth in Seville at the height of the Spanish
Inquisition. Jesus is taken prisoner by the 90-year-old Grand
Inquisitor who then _ like police interrogators before and since _
details the suspect's crimes. The return of Jesus after 15
centuries of absence from the world interferes with the work of the
church. Jesus preached a message of freedom, but the church has
discovered that it is not freedom that humankind desires; it is
authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we shall convince them that they will only become free
when they resign their freedom to us, and submit to us,'' says the
Inquisitor. ``The most tormenting secrets of their conscience _
all, all they will bring to us, and we will decide all things, and
they will joyfully believe our decision, because it will deliver
them from their great care and their present terrible torments of
personal and free decision.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Jesus, he has no place in a well-regulated society. He is
a troublemaker, a scandal: ``For if anyone has ever deserved our
stake, it is you. Tomorrow I shall burn you.'' He is sent to the
auto-da-fe.
</P>
<P>
   Dostoevsky's creation of 1880 is hauntingly predictive of the
inquisitors of the 20th century who all, from whatever political
faith and ideological position, claim their authority to dispose of
human freedom in the name of authority. Only the inquisitors know
what humanity really wants and needs. We must surrender to the
inquisitors for the sake of our salvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Grand Inquisitor'' comes to us in a dialogue between the
tormented, doubting Ivan and the Christian Alyosha, and it is
itself a dialogue between the Inquisitor and Jesus _ who remains
silent, but whose presence makes the speaker shape his words to his
presence, to his views and unvoiced objections.
</P>
<P>
   No novelist has ever been more fully committed to open-ended
dialogue than Dostoevsky. As the Russian critic Mikhail Bakhtin put
it, ``Every thought of Dostoevsky's heroes ... senses itself to be
from the very beginning a rejoinder in an unfinalized dialogue.''
The novelist eschews his own authority as creator to let his
characters dramatize radically different positions. He refuses
certainty, dogma, conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Who wins in the dialogues between the Inquisitor and Jesus,
between Ivan and Alyosha? ``The Grand Inquisitor'' in fact has two
different endings. In the first, the Inquisitor sends Jesus to be
burned at the stake. Then, as Ivan continues his debate with
Alyosha, he suggests another ending: Jesus kisses the old
Inquisitor on the lips, and the Inquisitor tells him: ``Go, and do
not come again ... never, never!'' The prisoner walks free and
disappears.
</P>
<P>
   And in ``The Brothers Karamazov'' as a whole, it is impossible
to say what final, authoritative meaning the novel leaves with us.
If Alyosha speaks the final, joyful words of faith, for most
readers they don't cancel out Ivan's ``damned questions,'' his
wrestling with the darkness of the soul in a grim world where it
seems reasonable to say that ``everything is permitted.''
</P>
<P>
   As a political and spiritual parable, ``The Grand Inquisitor''
is ambiguous. It offers no authoritative answer. It suggests that
truth lies only in the dialogue, open-ended, anguishing. It might
be recommended reading for writers of party platforms, which tend
toward self-righteous authoritative pronouncements on anguishing
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric of ``compassionate conservatism'' is belied by a
smug claim to truth on a host of social issues. The Republicans
might also ponder another moment in ``The Grand Inquisitor,'' when
the Inquisitor imagines still another voice in the dialogue _ the
voice of the utopian protester, like some of those heard outside
the Philadelphia convention hall: ``Do you know that centuries will
pass and mankind will proclaim with the mouth of its wisdom and
science that there is no crime, and therefore no sin, but only
hungry men? `Feed them first, then ask virtue of them!'''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Republicans have chosen a ticket that seems
certain to win one state _ Texas _ almost effortlessly. But at the
December balloting of the Electoral College, could the Texas
electors really vote for both George W. Bush and Dick Cheney? They
will have to ask themselves where Cheney is an ``inhabitant.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12th Amendment to the Constitution says the presidential
electors shall ``vote by ballot for president and vice president,
one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state
with themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past eight years Cheney has lived in Dallas, where he
was chief executive of an oil services company. Though two weeks
ago Cheney transferred his voter registration back to Wyoming, this
scarcely seems sufficient to change his habitation. Could the
electors vote for both Bush and Cheney?
</P>
<P>
   They could abstain, but that could change the result. If neither
vice presidential candidate had a majority in the Electoral
College, the Senate would have to choose between them.
</P>
<P>
   Since President Clinton's attempt to parse words in answering
charges that he lied under oath, Republicans have gotten political
mileage from saying that only obfuscating lawyers could question
the meaning of ``is.'' Is the meaning of ``inhabitant'' any more
complicated? Most people _ whether nonlawyers or the constitutional
law professors with whom I participate in a nationwide e-mail
discussion _ have little trouble recognizing that Cheney's
last-minute change of voting registration has almost literally
nothing to do with what state he currently inhabits.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush appears to be confident in the assurances of his
lawyers that the 12th Amendment will not be a problem. But if it is
a mere technicality to be overcome by clever legal manipulation,
then constitutional interpretation is a more complex exercise than
the simpleminded reading of the text _ or dubious historical forays
into recapturing the intentions of the Founding Fathers _ favored
by two Supreme Court justices whom Bush says he admires: Antonin
Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   One might well argue, of course, that no rational citizen should
care which state Cheney lives in. But the Framers no doubt thought
they were doing something important in discouraging any all-New
York or all-Virginia tickets and encouraging recognition that the
country was made up of quite different states and regions.
</P>
<P>
   If they are strict constitutionalists, the Texas electors could
find themselves required to abstain when asked their choice for the
vice presidency.

KERRY'S TIME MAY HAVE COME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is cloistered these helpless days at his wife's mountainside
estate mourning the recent death of his father, at the same time
facing what must undoubtedly be one of the longest, tensest
weekends of his life.
</P>
<P>
   At any point over the next few days, the telephone might ring
for Senator John Kerry. Vice President Al Gore might be on the
other end. And Gore might begin that conversation with the words,
``John, I want you as my running mate.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, a career that has been overshadowed by others will
suddenly be thrust into the clear and open light. John Kerry, for
the first time in a long time, will be the junior senator no more.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility is growing with each passing hour, such that
Kerry intimates who have surveyed the field of vice presidential
prospects privately say his chances of being selected are better
than 50 percent. It is an analysis deemed modest by many Washington
veterans, who increasingly view Kerry, with his Vietnam medals,
proven campaign skills, and strong Senate record, as the likely
choice. Gore has scheduled an announcement for Tuesday in
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, all public proclamations and private whispers had
it down to six possibilities _ Kerry, Senators Evan Bayh of
Indiana, John Edwards of North Carolina, and Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut, House minority leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, and
Governor Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Of those candidates, Gephardt and Shaheen have flatly said they
are not interested in the job. Edwards, first elected just a
year-and-a-half ago, is seen as too inexperienced and unknown. And
Bayh is too short of that undefinable political quality of
gravitas.
</P>
<P>
   Smartly, Kerry has sequestered himself. He is making no pleading
telephone calls to mutual strategists and friends. He has
restricted his public appearances so as to not be seen campaigning
for the job. He has avoided cameras like the plague.
</P>
<P>
   It took him a while, but the man whose unflattering moniker was
``Liveshot'' has learned his lessons well, raising the questions:
Do we have a new John Kerry, a better one at that?
</P>
<P>
   The faults of the old one have been well chronicled. He is, by
many accounts, aloof and arguably arrogant, enraging to local
officials who say he only pays them heed every six or so years,
coincidentally right around election time.
</P>
<P>
   He complains more than most politicians of his stature, feels
more slights, even whines to reporters about coverage that he seems
to constantly deem unfair. Even some allies view him as
opportunistic, and in a business in which self-centeredness is the
dominant gene, Kerry is virtually without peer.
</P>
<P>
   Don Imus calls Kerry a ``pretty man,'' and indeed, even at 56
years of age, he has the type of face that other men want to
dislike, including me. Yet I can't.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why. First off, he's smart _ smart enough to fashion a
prosperous Senate career with a distinct identity in the shadow of
the most influential legislator this state has ever known: Ted
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   He has moved steadily toward the middle in his 14 years in the
Senate, providing definition to the oft-sought but ethereal concept
of centrism. In 1992, Kerry highlighted problems with affirmative
action before any Democrat dared speak ill of it. And in 1998, he
denounced the tenure system in public schools, imperiling his
relationship with powerful teachers' unions.
</P>
<P>
   He is secure enough intellectually to not only withstand
challenges, but also to invite them from a talented group of aides
and advisers. He can be personable, even engaging, obsessed about
such random activities as the Boston restaurant scene and his
fledgling golf game. His long antennae for slights have given him
valuable insights into life's pitfalls and setbacks _ no small
matter for anyone, but especially someone with a Forbes lineage.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry has grown and, more importantly, matured. And come
Tuesday, Massachusetts and the nation may see him in a light he's
never been seen in before. His time may well have arrived.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A Mercedes-Benz brochure of the 1980s described the marque's
philosophy thus: A Mercedes should not inspire aggressive driving,
but if you find yourself in a bind _ say, roaring into a tight turn
too fast _ the car will get you through. That, at least, was the
gist. The Mercedes was an automotive Clark Kent, serious and
sedate, but ready to fling off its eyeglasses and soar to the
rescue.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing mild-mannered about the Mercedes-Benz of today.
The company boasts of having the fastest sport utility on the road,
the ML55, alongside V-12 sedans and luxury hot rods tweaked by AMG,
its high-performance-tuning operation. Still, the cutting-edge Merc
of today, the CL500 coupe, seems in many ways an evolution of that
previous thinking, not a break with it.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the car is gorgeous, the only true pillarless hardtop in
showrooms today; its roofline is a graceful curve and the
traditional Mercedes grille is swept back into a long hood. The car
that I tested, in almandin black with light java leather, garnered
admiring glances on interstates and even on the jaded streets of
New York.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, it was powerful. Car and Driver magazine found that
the 302 horses of the 5-liter V-8 pushed the two-ton chariot to 60
miles per hour in a scant 6.2 seconds, and through a quarter-mile
in 14.7 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   For those who would dare yawn at that, the CL600 is now arriving
at dealerships, with a supersophisticated V-12 generating 362
horsepower. In November there will be a CL55, a souped-up AMG
version of the V-8 that makes 355 horsepower. Ergo, the car is
striking and fast, and destined to be faster.
</P>
<P>
   So where's Clark Kent?
</P>
<P>
   His legacy lives in the CL500s emphasis on intelligence over
brawn or beauty. If BMW celebrates driving, and Jaguar promotes
sensuality, Mercedes venerates technology _ and its showcase is the
CL. My pleasure in guiding the car on winding, rude backroads of
the Endless Mountains in Pennsylvania came not from speed or
cornering force, though these I tried, but from the way the
electronics and engineering anticipated and mastered every
maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Turn as sharply as you dare, then stomp brutally on the brakes,
and the big machine remains almost mystically level and composed.
The feat is achieved by sophisticated hydraulic plungers at the
four corners that react in split seconds to keep the car
unflappably level no matter what the laws of physics try to do _
there is no dive, no squat, no roll, no wallow, no pitch, no sweat.
</P>
<P>
   When the paving runs out, a gentle nudge of a button nestled in
the burled walnut raises the starship an inch or two above the
nasty pebbles. As you accelerate back onto the highway, the car
snuggles down again to hug the pavement, ready to negotiate
whatever speed you dare.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes calls this system ``active body control,'' or ABC, and
it comes with ESP (electric stability program) and ASR (automatic
slip control). These are only the most impressive of a host of
electronic innovations that put the CL500 at the sharpest edge of
automotive technology.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking here of gizmos that do little besides twinkle
little red lights, but of stuff that really is useful, like the
ultra-low-profile windshield wipers that go on automatically, and
at the right frequency and speed, when they're needed; like the
ventilated and heated seats that can be adjusted 14 ways and _ get
this _ will give front-seat passengers a pulse massage; like the
doors and trunk lid that pull themselves closed; like the
five-speed automatic transmission that can figure out how sporty
the driver is, or that cedes the shifting to him or her. Not all of
this is unique to the CL500, of course, but it's all there in one
car, along with an automatic climate control with charcoal filter,
auto-dimming mirrors, Xenon headlamps, air bags everywhere and
laminated windows that filter infrared rays.
</P>
<P>
   The driver is not even aware of many touches, like aerodynamics
that channel water from the rear window, or the plastic fenders,
aluminum hood and roof and magnesium inner doors that keep the
weight far below that of previous big Mercedes coupes.
</P>
<P>
   To continue in this vein, I should describe how the 10 speakers
of the Bose audio system soothe the soul and whatnot, but that
would be premature. You do not learn on your first spin, or even on
the second, how to manipulate the ``Comand'' system _ the screen
and knobs that control the stereo, navigation computer, telephone
and probably many other things. Even a dedicated gadget lover will
find the centralized controls frustratingly unintuitive. Besides, I
wonder if the best of such systems _ like those operated by
touching the screen _ is truly safe. The glowing maps, messages and
instructions all require looking away from the road for at least a
few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, only the Comand system can be accused of being
distracting. What is impressive is how unobtusive, intuitive and
forgiving the rest of the electronics are. That, I think, is the
true link to the Mercedes philosophy of the 80s, the notion that
one could put more faith in the car's intelligence than in the
driver's. Some of these smarts are discreetly concealed, in the air
bags, the air filters, the adaptive transmission. In other matters,
the driver can override the automation _ by shifting the gears,
turning on the lights, turning off the wipers, switching off the
traction control. But in every instance, the CL500 demonstrates
what electronics can do _ and what, before long, they may be doing
in far lesser cars.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not pretend the ride is cheap. That terrific back massager
is $1,550 extra, and the multicontour seats add $1,050. The rest is
standard, and with $1,000 in gas-guzzler tax and $595 for shipping,
the CL500 I drove came within $300 of $90,000. (The SL600 is
$117,200 plus add-ons; the CL55 will be around $10,000 below that.)
</P>
<P>
   But then, many electronic features that we take for granted,
from engine management to air bags, were exotic extras not so long
ago. Traction control, antilock brakes, electronically controlled
transmissions have become commonplace in inexpensive cars. So who's
to say that a $20,000 sedan won't be giving massages before long?
</P>
<P>
   More intriguing, where will Mercedes go from here? Next year,
the CL is expected to have a cruise control that keeps track of
what the car you are following is up to, and automatically slows
down or speeds up to keep you at a safe distance behind. &QL;

 &HT;    Airline exec quits senate quest, avoids crash taunts
 &HT;    By Alan Judd and Jim Galloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lewis Jordan flew to Philadelphia this week confident
in his plans to run for the U.S. Senate. He finished with a lesson
in how political life can be rougher than the corporate boardroom.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican activists attending their party's national
convention advised Jordan, the former chief executive of ValuJet
Airlines, that he would be compared with fellow Atlanta businessman
Guy Millner, who lost three statewide elections despite spending
millions of his own money.
</P>
<P>
   And they warned that the taunting could escalate.
</P>
<P>
   Already, they said, Democrats were alluding to the ValuJet plane
that went down in the Florida Everglades in 1996 and referring to
the potential GOP candidate as ``Crash'' Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   So the political newcomer quickly got off the stage. Late
Wednesday evening, a day after declaring he was ready to run ``in a
big way,'' Jordan issued a statement announcing he would not seek
the seat formerly held by the late Sen. Paul Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Jordan attributed his sudden change of
heart to the needs of his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I weighed this thing as a businessman,'' Jordan said. ``I
talked to all my advisers and my friends. The feedback I got,
overwhelmingly, was, 'Yes, you could' `` get elected. But after
considering the effect a campaign would have on his family, Jordan
said, ``we chose to step aside with, I think, honor and dignity and
go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan denied a report in an online political newsletter that
quoted him as complaining about ``political trickery'' by
supporters of another GOP candidate, former Sen. Mack Mattingly.
</P>
<P>
   But the newsletter's publisher, Bill Shipp, stood by the report,
saying that Jordan's comment was captured on tape. And Georgia
Republican leaders acknowledged that discussions about potential
Senate candidates sometimes turned harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a short time frame,'' Chuck Clay, the state
Republican chairman, said Thursday. ``Everybody needed to get their
views out on the table. You don't have time to be Mr. Nice Guy.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Philadelphia, Jordan received numerous calls from
Republican leaders ``stressing the importance of unity and of
issues that might be raised,'' said state Sen. Tom Price. Among
those issues, Price said, was the 1996 Everglades crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an unbelievable 72 hours,'' Price added. ``And they
began to appreciate what a political campaign was all about. The
implications of an intraparty struggle became very clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The rawness of politics shocked Jordan's family, said John
Sours, a convention delegate from Smyrna, Ga., who supported the
former airline executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they did was take one last look at it and back away,''
Sours said. ``Politics is a nasty business. It's a contact sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, 56, the largest shareholder in AirTran Airways, as
ValuJet is now known, had pledged to spend $3 million of his own
money on the race. Initially, Republican leaders encouraged his
candidacy, saying his personal resources would make him competitive
against former Gov. Zell Miller, the Democrat appointed to
temporarily fill Coverdell's seat. In a single day last week, 18
Republican congressmen called to urge Jordan to run, said Tom
Perdue, an Atlanta political consultant advising Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an honest-to-God draft,'' Perdue said Thursday.
``There was a groundswell like I've never seen in my life for this
man. The time just wasn't right for this man and this family.''
</P>
<P>
   But state Republican leaders worried that an intraparty contest
in the nonpartisan election would allow Miller to waltz to victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have said all along that two strong Republicans would
inevitably put guns on each other,'' Clay said. `` . . . We have
avoided that.''
</P>
<P>
   Shipp's web site quoted Jordan as saying the experience had
given him ``a Ph.D. in political trickery. I never knew people
would do what some of these people have done. . . . This experience
has taught me why many good people are afraid to serve.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan said Thursday that the actions of others had not
swayed his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``In politics, there are many people who have their different
ideas about what should be done,'' he said. ``But I'm not aware of
any trickery. I received no pressure from anybody. To the contrary,
I received resounding support from people who said, 'You would be a
fine candidate.' ``

TREASURY ISSUES BOLSTERED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bond prices were higher Thursday but well off their
highs of the day after technology stocks recovered from an earlier
slide and investors reversed a flight to quality into government
securities.
</P>
<P>
   While sliding stock prices early in the session were the main
catalyst in lifting Treasury prices, the Federal Reserve also
bolstered prices by staging a coupon pass, in which the central
bank buys Treasury securities and adds permanent reserves to the
banking system. On Thursday the Fed bought maturities ranging from
Aug. 15, 2020, through Nov. 15, 2028.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year bond, the onetime benchmark for
Treasury interest rates, rose 11/32, to 107 9/32, while its yield,
which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.74 percent from
5.76 percent on Wednesday. The closely followed 10-year note,
meanwhile, gained 5/32, to 103 31/32. Its yield dropped to 5.95
percent from 5.97 percent. The government reported Thursday that
factory orders surged 5.5 percent in June, the largest increase
since 7.3 percent in July 1991. The report helped to cap Treasury
gains. But, excluding a record increase for aircraft and other
transportation equipment, orders rose 0.3 percent. The government
also revised the gain in June durable goods orders down slightly,
to 9.7 percent from the staggering 10 percent reported two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said its July
nonmanufacturing business index sank to 55.5 in July from 64 in
June, while the Labor Department said jobless claims rose to a
seasonally adjusted 276,000 in the week ended July 29, slightly
less than forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations are that Friday's July unemployment report will
show little job and wage growth, providing the central bank with
more information as the Federal Open Market Committee heads toward
its next meeting on interest rates on Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Reserve is carefully perusing the continual flow
of economic statistics in order to determine the best course of
action at the upcoming FOMC meeting,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief
market analyst for Chase Asset Management. ``Using real GDP as a
yardstick, the year-over-year trend rate of economic growth now
stands at a prodigious 6 percent, so obviously the expectation of a
slowdown in the economy's pace is not a particularly heroic
assumption.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What really matters,'' he continued, ``is the extent, timing
and sustainability of the slowdown, and most importantly, whether
or not an impending slackening of economic growth will be enough to
definitively forestall inflationary pressures in the eyes of the
Fed.'' In this regard, Friday's July labor market data will play a
crucial role. Fine said that if the numbers were weak, market
participants would conclude that the Fed was finished raising
rates, but if they were strong, the future course would be
uncertain.  &QL;

BUSH HAS DONE WHAT A GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE HASN'T DONE SINCE
1984
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BOB RAY SANDERS 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It would be easy to say that Gov. George W. Bush,
a privileged child of an important American family, once again got
something he wanted, and that this time it was a gigantic present:
his party's nomination for president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But that would be simplistic and unfair, and it terribly
understates a man whom people have tried to label as a shallow,
inattentive ``frat boy'' whose main purpose in seeking the nation's
highest office is to avenge the defeat of his father in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Bush has had plenty of help in his bid for the White
House, and he's had lots of money. But make no mistake about it,
the governor carried his own water in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' quadrennial meeting that ended here last night
was Bush's convention. He set the stage, the tone and the agenda.
The entire event reflected his ideas and ideals.
</P>
<P>
   He proved months ago, during the grueling primary season, that
he could take a punch, that he could learn _ and learn fast _ from
his mistakes, and that, despite any distractions thrown at him by
opponents, he knew how to stay on course, stay on task and stay on
message.
</P>
<P>
   You've got to give it to him. He's been an excellent candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his Grand Old Party put on a humdinger of a convention,
one that was upbeat, more diverse than any other Republican
convention in history and one that generally made for good
television. Yes, it was scripted and programmed, with some
artificial feel-good moments, but then what major political
convention isn't?
</P>
<P>
   This candidate has been able to do what no other Republican
nominee has done since at least 1984. He unified his party.
</P>
<P>
   There are still some major philosophical differences within the
party. But because Republicans want to win so badly, they have been
able to put aside most of their differences long enough, they hope,
to get their man elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having said all that, Bush will not be a shoo-in. He still
has to convince doubters that he is capable of being the chief
executive of the world's only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   He will have to make people believe that he and the party as a
whole are sincere about compassion, inclusion and diversity. And he
can't make that case by simply parading a bunch of people of color
across the television screen. There has to be some action that
speaks to their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will try to do that by touting his record in Texas. In
politics, like on the old vinyl discs, there are two sides to every
record. His opponent, of course, will be broadcasting the side that
has had the least air play.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans undoubtedly got a big bounce from their convention
and the nomination of Dick Cheney as Bush's running mate. Democrats
will need much more than a bounce. They may need one of those
rocket boosters from Cape Canaveral to help get presidential
candidate Al Gore off the ground, much less into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It can be done. Gore likes running from behind, although not
this much behind. Still, I'm convinced he will run a hard-hitting
campaign with a running mate who will offer a great contrast to
Cheney and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats already know, as was signaled here this week, that
Bush-Cheney will be running as much against Bill Clinton as Al
Gore. By election time, Republicans will want us to believe that
Clinton and Gore are joined at the hip, unable to be separated,
surgically or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to the voters to decide if that strategy will
work.

GORE'S VP LIST DOWN TO FOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Vice President Al Gore has narrowed his list of
possible running mates to four candidates with four days remaining
until he introduces his choice to the world, Gore campaign sources
say.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Senator John F. Kerry remains under serious
consideration, and as Kerry's record is being vetted by Gore
staffers the Massachusetts Republican Party is searching its own
files for ammunition Texas Governor George W. Bush's campaign could
use should Kerry be tapped.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Kerry, Connecticut Senator Joseph Lieberman, Indiana
Senator Evan Bayh, and North Carolina Senator John Edwards are on
the short-list as Gore ends a North Carolina beach vacation to
return to the campaign trail in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   While some campaign officials have suggested that Gore is still
eyeing New Hampshire Governor Jeanne Shaheen and House Democratic
Leader Richard A. Gephardt, sources acknowledged that Shaheen and
Gephardt are not really in contention given their repeated and
emphatically stated opposition to taking the job.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in an aside during a stroll on the beach, raised the
possibility Thursday that a ``wildcard'' candidate could still
enter the mix. But almost as quickly he seemed to take it back:
``There are a couple of people who aren't on the great
mentioners...well, I don't know. The great mentioners have them
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is said to be looking for a running mate in the New
Democrat, one who will complement his own centrist views. Each of
the four short-listed candidates generally shares Gore's outlook,
though each come with unique strengths and shortcomings as possible
nominees:
</P>
<P>
   --Edwards, a trial attorney, has only served in elective office
for 18 months. Against Dick Cheney, Bush's vice presidential
nominee, Republicans could make the case that Edwards does not have
the experience necessary to take over the presidency at a moment's
notice - one of Gore's stated criteria.
</P>
<P>
   --Lieberman, an orthodox Jew, does not work -- or campaign -- on
Saturdays and religious holidays, such as Rosh Hashanah and Yom
Kippur, both observed during the prime of the fall calendar. And
some Democrats have questioned whether the nation yet open to the
possibility of a Jewish vice president.
</P>
<P>
   --Bayh is the first Democrat to represent Indiana in the Senate
since his father was voted out in 1980. Evan Bayh has also served
as Indiana governor and secretary of state. But he has made some
Democratic constituencies nervous with his support for the ban on
the so-called partial birth abortion procedure, and his desire to
cut taxes and slash government spending.
</P>
<P>
   --Kerry, a decorated veteran of Vietnam, comes from
Massachusetts, considered by many Americans to be a liberal
bastion. And because Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci is a
Republican, a Kerry pick would mean the governor appoints his
successor, altering the balance of power in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerry is viewed within the Gore campaign as a talented
campaigner and war hero who would provide a vigorous image in
contrast to the avuncular Cheney. And a number of top Gore campaign
officials have worked with Kerry on past campaigns, providing him
with advocates in the vice president's inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Republicans are taking the Kerry candidacy
seriously, compiling opposition research used in past campaigns and
preparing it for Bush operatives. Already they are portraying Kerry
as out of step with the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the bread and butter issues that people across
America think are common sense, like cutting taxes, mandatory
minimums for criminals, school choice in education and a work
requirement for welfare. . . . John Kerry opposes (them) all,''
said John Brockelman, executive director of the state party.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd be a perfect choice for Al Gore. They have similar
debating and campaign styles -- they're willing to say anything to
get elected. And they're not afraid to distort the facts in debates
or on the campaign trail,'' Brockelman continued.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Jordan, a Kerry adviser, scoffed at Brockelman's assertions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing the Massachusetts Republican Party knows is
that he kicks their pathetic butts every six years,'' said Jordan.
Kerry beat former Massachusetts Governor William Weld by 52 to 45
percent in a high-profile and combative race that received national
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's list was notable not just for the names on it, but
those left off. Former Maine Senator George J. Mitchell is
apparently no longer being considered. Neither it would seem is
Iowa Senator Tom Harkin, a populist who worked tirelessly for Gore
during the primaries. And though Gore has designs on Florida this
November, he will apparently campaign there without Senator Bob
Graham as his runningmate.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Shaheen and Gephardt, neither of whom want the job
but are being mentioned anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire governor said in an interview that she would
turn down the offer, if asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very flattering to appear on that list,'' Shaheen said.
But she said she is running for reelection and more focused on
making a difference for people in her state.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Nichols, a spokesman for Gephardt, said the House Minority
Leader still hopes to elect a Democratic majority and become
Speaker of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``His position's unchanged and there's not been any new
overtures of late,'' Nichols said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore plans to announce his runningmate on Tuesday in Nashville.

GEORGE P.'S COMPARISON OF UNCLE GEORGE TO CESAR CHAVEZ FALLS FLAT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BUD KENNEDY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The biggest name in town this week does not
include a ``W.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest name in town _ yes, even the biggest Bush _ has been
chased everywhere by adoring groupies and spying news cameras. He
is the No. 1 topic at every party and the No. 1 rumored sighting in
every restaurant. His daily habits are covered in
hors-d'oeuvre-devouring detail on a daily page in a Philadelphia
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of three guys here named George Bush. But he is George
P. Bush, 24, the potential First Nephew of a George W.
administration.
</P>
<P>
   He turned down a lot of interviews this week. Now we see why.
</P>
<P>
   The kid was trusted to introduce Uncle George at a ``Bienvenidos
a Filadelfia'' party Wednesday morning on the Philadelphia Museum
of Art steps.
</P>
<P>
   So what does he do?
</P>
<P>
   He says his Uncle George is a hero just like Cesar Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech that was a stretch even by political convention
standards, Nephew George told how his mother, Florida first lady
Columba Bush, cried when the peaceloving hero of California farm
boycotts died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   George P. Bush was 17 then. He said his mother, a native of the
city of Leon in the Mexican state of Guanajuato, told him to find
somebody who ``represents what you believe _ who represents our
people, who represents our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That person,'' he said, pausing, ``is my uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the pro-Bush welcome crowd responded with stunned silence
and weak cheers.
</P>
<P>
   I bet not many Republicans could accurately identify Cesar
Chavez, a peacekeeping leader of workers in California and an early
civil rights champion for working Americans and Americans of
Hispanic descent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has loaded up this convention with Hispanic and Latino
culture, choosing U.S. Rep. Henry Bonilla of San Antonio as a
co-host. Yet the Republicans are still new at this cultural
sensitivity thing.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them probably don't know as much about Cesar Chavez as
they know about baseball's Cesar Cedeno.
</P>
<P>
   The United Farm Workers quickly offered to help. Chavez's
son-in-law is now president of the union, and Chavez's widow, Helen
Fabela Chavez, still lives close to his grave at the union
headquarters near Keene, Calif., where the UFW quickly issued a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Without going too hard on Nephew George, son-in-law Arturo S.
Rodriguez basically said the Texas governor is no Cesar Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   The family and the union welcome Bush's ``sentiments'' about his
mother's instilling the values of Chavez: ``Cesar's messages about
nonviolence, self-sacrifice and social justice certainly transcend
partisan politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the partisan politics: ``We believe that policies are
more important than rhetoric and we question whether George W. is
that leader.''
</P>
<P>
   George P. Bush did not show yesterday at a flashy luncheon for
Hispanic Republicans. But again, he was a popular topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the comparison'' with Chavez, Mary Helen Cantu of
rural Webb County said delicately. Her husband, Fernando Cantu, is
chairman of the Republican National Hispanic Assembly of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he meant that George W. Bush is somebody who is proud
to bring Hispanics to the table,'' she said, switching targets.
``The Democrats all tell us, `Vote for me!' _ but they never bring
us to the table to share the success. George W. Bush has proven
that he will bring us to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncle George calls his nephew ``el Bush guapo'' _ the
``handsome'' Bush.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he would have been better off just making all the
tables.

CITRUS CANKER WAR FOUGHT YARD BY YARD 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK BRAGG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For 40 years, more than half her life, Kitty Field
nurtured her trees. There was one orange, one lime, one grapefruit,
and the blossoms and fruit filled the yard with fragrance and
color. It just looked like Florida somehow, and she and her
husband, Ernest, grew old under their leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaves are green,'' said Field. ``The fruit is perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   What could be more harmless, she wonders, than her tiny grove?
</P>
<P>
   But recently, state inspectors searching for the dreaded citrus
canker disease came into their yard in North Miami Beach and
painted a red ``X'' on all three trees, marking them for
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``These trees are like our children,'' she said. ``We have
watched them grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of citrus trees, mostly in commercial
groves, in South Florida have already been chopped down to stop the
spread of canker, a disease that threatens Florida's citrus
industry, which is second only to tourism in the money it takes in.
But it is the house-by-house eradication of the canker that seems
to be causing the most pain.
</P>
<P>
   Most people, like Catalina Leal, 86, of Miami, and Elvia Perez,
69, of Hialeah, only wept in their yards as Florida Department of
Agriculture workers chopped down old citrus trees. But others are
more determined. Five times this year, South Floridians met state
inspectors with guns or threats of guns.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent was on Tuesday. The police said Carl E. Lawson,
62, fired his shotgun after two state inspectors approached his
home. No one was hurt, but Lawson was charged with two counts of
attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   The saddest case came in March, in the city of Tamarac in
Broward County. State inspectors had already chopped down three of
95-year-old Nelson Edwards' grapefruit trees.
</P>
<P>
   When they came for the last one, Edwards, who can barely see and
does not hear well, came to his door with a rifle. It was not
loaded, but he worked the rifle's bolt, once, anyway, to try and
scare them off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just an old man,'' said Edwards, when he was asked why he
did that.
</P>
<P>
   It did not save his tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's history,'' he said. ``It's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Such cases are an extreme. Most people here fire off letters,
instead. ``We have written our political representatives,'' said
Field. ``We will do what is necessary to keep our trees.''
</P>
<P>
   But yard by yard through South Florida, where citrus trees had
stood for decades, there are just stumps now. ``They gave me
shade,'' said Perez, of her trees. ``They gave me happiness. Every
morning, I would throw the leftover coffee grounds around the
trees. Now, I just throw it in the garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been three outbreaks of canker in Florida since 1913,
and the most recent was detected in 1995. ``That one tree has
spread to 700,000,'' said Richard Miranda, public information
director for the state's Citrus Canker Eradication Program.
</P>
<P>
   When state inspectors find a tree with canker, they condemn all
trees within 1,900 feet. Trees that show no signs of the disease
still must be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The state offers $100 to compensate the owners of the trees, to
help offset the costs of planting new trees.
</P>
<P>
   But what good will it do, ask some of the elderly homeowners, to
plant a new twig in the ground this late in their lives? It will be
years before the trees really bear fruit, and decades before they
grow tall and full enough to shade them.
</P>
<P>
   For people in their 70s and 80s, what good is that?
</P>
<P>
   ``For them to plant a new tree now won't help them much,''
conceded Miranda. But, he said, ``if it actually gets into the
groves, it can be crippling to the economy of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Canker manifests itself on the fruit in raised, brown, corky
lesions, surrounded by yellow rings. ``It attacks the immune system
of a tree the same way that HIV affects humans,'' and eventually
kills the tree.
</P>
<P>
   While those whose trees have signs of the disease hate to see
them chopped down, those whose apparently healthy trees are within
the 1,900-foot kill zone are livid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones that were sick were next door, not mine,'' said
Perez. ``My daughter tells me, `Mami, get over it, it's just
plants,' but I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Leal planted her trees, oranges and other citrus, 23 years ago.
She pruned them with a machete, and used boards studded with nails
to keep cats off them.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing she could do to keep the inspectors away,
though she let them know how it hurt her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried in front of them, because I felt very bad,'' Leal
said. ``But they went ahead and cut them down anyway. I figured I'd
have to let them because they're the government.''
</P>
<P>
   She cannot get used to the sight of the stumps. Her trees were
so giving, she said, of fruit, of shade. ``I grew to love them.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing that some here will miss most is the simple act of
reaching up and plucking a fresh orange or grapefruit or lime, and
the taste _ as different from a store-bought fruit as a
made-from-scratch meal is from a microwave dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the mornings, we put on a pair of slippers and go out to
pick oranges, and have them for breakfast,'' said Gil Muratori, 61,
a pharmaceutical sales manager in Miami whose trees are under the
state's death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of being in Florida, of being Floridian. Chopping
them up, to many people here, is as wrong as setting fire to a
flamingo.

MINORITY DELEGATES FEEL WELCOME AT GOP CONCLAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ As Dylan Glenn, 31, a Georgia delegate strides
through a media tent and onto sprawling floor of the First Union
Center, he gives a tight-fisted hand shake to an African-American
television producer. Then, he pats the back of an elder white
politician from Georgia before espousing the conservative ideology
of his party to a passerby.
</P>
<P>
   The son of two African-American educators, he says his values
are reflected here at the National Republican Convention, among a
sea of white faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am comfortable here. This is my party. They share my own
values,'' he said. ``The reason I am a Republican today is because
my daddy always preached individual hard work and responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, the president of South Georgia Economic Development
Corp., is among a small pool of minorities who are delegates _
African-American, Hispanic and Asian who call themselves the new
messengers of the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first day of the convention, the Republicans have
assiduously emphasized inclusiveness. Five out of 12 speakers
during the opening night of the convention were minorities. Outside
the convention halls, African-Americans, Asian and Latino delegates
who makeup less than 5 percent of the delegation have been courted
at luncheons especially for them. This week, Republicans ran
Spanish radio ads in some of the nation's largest markets.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the television lights, the politically-correct
advertisments and emotional speeches, minority delegates like Glenn
say they were drawn to the Republican Party's strong positions on
free enterprise, family values and military defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I belong,'' said Texas delegate Juntas Poderno,
42, who is Hispanic-American. ``I am a new Republican. Young and
inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gil Medina, a prominent businessman and New Jersey
delegate, ``I truly believe that the GOP will be the party of the
future for minorities _ black, white and Hispanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Others like Dan Lewis, a Native-American delegate from Arizona
and Mary Torres from Guam said the GOP's hardline pro-defense
position is the reason more minorities are turning to the
Republican Party, which minorities have long accused of ignoring
them. Torres said additional closings of military bases could
economically hurt Guam. While Lewis says Native-Americans believe a
weak military that could result in a high number of American
casualties could leave tribal reservations without leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But even optimistic Republicans concede that George W. Bush and
other party leaders have a long road ahead of them if they really
want to capture more minority votes. Prior to the New Deal, blacks
voted predominantly Republican, the party of Abraham Lincoln. And
as Condoleeza Rice reminded the delegates Tuesday night,
Republicans signed up black voters when the Dixiecrats turned them
away.
</P>
<P>
   But that hold the party once had on the African-American vote
disappeared a long time ago. Since the 1960s, Africans-Americans
have been the most loyal of all Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have along way to go,'' said Senator Orrin Hatch, the Utah
Republican. ``But personally I am tired of the Democrats thinking
they own the black vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 12 percent of black voters supported Bush's father in 1992.
That same year Bill Clinton won 72 percent of the black vote. While
Clinton also brought in a whopping 61 percent of the Hispanic vote
eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats now say the Republicans' display of diversity this
week was a mirage since only 4 percent of the delegates are
Hispanic and 5 percent are African-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our convention takes place, you won't only see a stage of
minorities, but you will be able to look across the the audience to
see delegates that look like America,'' said Fred Humphries, a
political director for the Democratic National Convention, which
opens Aug. 14 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics question if Bush really is interested in minority
isssues after chosing Dick Cheney as a running mate. Cheney, while
a congressman in the 1980s, voted against freeing Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   Humphries said the Democrats' support of affirmative action,
civil right's issues and empowerment zones is hard proof that the
party is truly interested in minority issues.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Medina, who was born in Puerto Rico but grew up in
Camden, N.J., said the lessons of hard work and self reliance
taught by his parents reflect the ideology of the Republican Party
not the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Medina said when he began asking Democrats in New Jersey to
invest in businesses in the area's poorest communities, they
refused. He said it was Republican businessmen and GOP civic
leaders who began providing loans and grants to struggling minority
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Medina became New Jersey's first and only Hispanic
commerce secretary under Republican Governor Christine Todd
Whitman. He points to himself, as well as former General Colin
Powell and Rice, who is Bush's foreign policy adviser, as shining
examples of how Republicans are providing gifted minorities with
opportunities while also using their skills to shape the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a child my family was dirt poor, and yet under a Republican
I was chosen to become secretary of commerce,'' said Medina.
</P>
<P>
   Already, he said, Bush's popularity is growing among Hispanic
voters. In Texas, Bush won 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in 1998.
Part of the appeal, said Medina, is the fact that Bush speaks
Spanish, has a Mexican-born sister in law and has promised to
improve relations with Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Others say Bush's appearance at the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People convention in July was a clear sign
he is working to bridge a long-standing gap between black voters
and the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   At the NAACP, Bush chided his party for ignoring black issues
and declared that civil rights would be the cornerstone of his
presidency.

GEORGE P.'S COMPARISON OF UNCLE GEORGE TO CESAR CHAVEZ FALLS FLAT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The biggest name in town this week does not
include a ``W.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest name in town _ yes, even the biggest Bush _ has been
chased everywhere by adoring groupies and spying news cameras. He
is the No. 1 topic at every party and the No. 1 rumored sighting in
every restaurant. His daily habits are covered in
hors-d'oeuvre-devouring detail on a daily page in a Philadelphia
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of three guys here named George Bush. But he is George
P. Bush, 24, the potential First Nephew of a George W.
administration.
</P>
<P>
   He turned down a lot of interviews this week. Now we see why.
</P>
<P>
   The kid was trusted to introduce Uncle George at a ``Bienvenidos
a Filadelfia'' party Wednesday morning on the Philadelphia Museum
of Art steps.
</P>
<P>
   So what does he do?
</P>
<P>
   He says his Uncle George is a hero just like Cesar Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech that was a stretch even by political convention
standards, Nephew George told how his mother, Florida first lady
Columba Bush, cried when the peaceloving hero of California farm
boycotts died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   George P. Bush was 17 then. He said his mother, a native of the
city of Leon in the Mexican state of Guanajuato, told him to find
somebody who ``represents what you believe _ who represents our
people, who represents our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That person,'' he said, pausing, ``is my uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the pro-Bush welcome crowd responded with stunned silence
and weak cheers.
</P>
<P>
   I bet not many Republicans could accurately identify Cesar
Chavez, a peacekeeping leader of workers in California and an early
civil rights champion for working Americans and Americans of
Hispanic descent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has loaded up this convention with Hispanic and Latino
culture, choosing U.S. Rep. Henry Bonilla of San Antonio as a
co-host. Yet the Republicans are still new at this cultural
sensitivity thing.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them probably don't know as much about Cesar Chavez as
they know about baseball's Cesar Cedeno.
</P>
<P>
   The United Farm Workers quickly offered to help. Chavez's
son-in-law is now president of the union, and Chavez's widow, Helen
Fabela Chavez, still lives close to his grave at the union
headquarters near Keene, Calif., where the UFW quickly issued a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Without going too hard on Nephew George, son-in-law Arturo S.
Rodriguez basically said the Texas governor is no Cesar Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   The family and the union welcome Bush's ``sentiments'' about his
mother's instilling the values of Chavez: ``Cesar's messages about
nonviolence, self-sacrifice and social justice certainly transcend
partisan politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the partisan politics: ``We believe that policies are
more important than rhetoric and we question whether George W. is
that leader.''
</P>
<P>
   George P. Bush did not show yesterday at a flashy luncheon for
Hispanic Republicans. But again, he was a popular topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the comparison'' with Chavez, Mary Helen Cantu of
rural Webb County said delicately. Her husband, Fernando Cantu, is
chairman of the Republican National Hispanic Assembly of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he meant that George W. Bush is somebody who is proud
to bring Hispanics to the table,'' she said, switching targets.
``The Democrats all tell us, `Vote for me!' _ but they never bring
us to the table to share the success. George W. Bush has proven
that he will bring us to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncle George calls his nephew ``el Bush guapo'' _ the
``handsome'' Bush.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he would have been better off just making all the
tables.

CHENEY FIRM FINANCED SPONSORS OF BILL TO LIMIT ASBESTOS-SUIT
LIABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
 Rewrites first 7 graphs to correct figures   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dick Cheney and the giant energy company he will leave to run
for vice president have contributed more than $150,000 to members
of Congress who sponsored legislation that would limit the ability
of workers to sue companies for asbestos exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The Halliburton Co., an oil field services company based in
Dallas, and its subsidiaries have had about 273,300 suits filed
against them since 1976 by workers suffering from asbestos-related
disease. Many of those suits were filed before Cheney became
chairman of the board and chief executive officer in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1999, 107,650 suits for damages were still
pending, including 46,400 new suits filed against the corporation
last year, according to the firm's annual report filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, 59, says he will resign on Aug. 16 to concentrate on the
Republican campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton's political action committees and Cheney contributed
$494,452 to congressional candidates from 1997 through mid-2000. Of
that, $157,500 went to members of Congress who co-sponsored the
asbestos legislation _ 59 Republicans and four Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, as an individual, donated $12,500 to members who
sponsored or co-sponsored the asbestos bills.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions from Cheney and the political action
committees of Halliburton and its subsidiaries went to 49 of the 77
lawmakers who co-sponsored the Fairness in Asbestos Compensation
Act in the House of Representatives and 14 of 29 co-sponsors of
similar legislation in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton defended their contributions and noted that they
were made in full compliance with campaign laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our PAC has made contributions without regard to the pending
asbestos legislation. Any similarities between the supporters of
such legislation and the recipients of contributions from our PAC
is purely coincidental,'' Zelma Branch, a company spokeswoman said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Gribbins, Halliburton's vice president for government
affairs, added: ``We give money to candidates for a variety of
reasons, usually to those who are supportive of the business
agenda, the things that are important to us, like taxes, trade or
something specific like this asbestos issue.''
</P>
<P>
   A controversial bill
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is a highly controversial package promoted and
financed by the GAF Corp. and others in the asbestos industry. This
year, for the third straight year, the bill didn't make it to the
floor for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the House Judiciary Committee narrowly approved the
legislation by a vote of 18-15, with most Republicans supporting it
and most Democrats opposed.
</P>
<P>
   But seeing dwindling support, Illinois Republican Henry Hyde,
the Judiciary Committee chairman, did not send the bill to the full
House for a vote. Had the bill passed, few believed that President
Clinton would have signed it.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 committee members who received the contributions from
Halliburton, 10 voted in favor of the bill. The 11th member missed
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The bill calls for the establishment of an Office of Asbestos
Compensation under the Justice Department. Government-approved
doctors, using criteria defined in the law, would be gatekeepers,
issuing a pass to qualifying victims who wished to sue or seek a
government-determined settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side disputes there is a problem that needs to be
addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Public interest groups estimate that over the past 25 years,
settlements have been made in more than 1 million asbestos cases
industrywide, and 450,000 more may be pending.
</P>
<P>
   $99 million for suits
</P>
<P>
   Although Halliburton is an enormous operation with more than
100,000 employees in 120 countries, it is a relatively small player
when it comes to asbestos litigation, at least when compared to
W.R. Grace &AMP; Co., GAF and the Johns Manville Corp. Nevertheless,
Halliburton has spent $99 million to settle or dispose of 129,650
asbestos suits, according to company records.
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos was used for decades in protective clothing,
insulations, pipe coatings, fireproofing and many other industrial
uses. Millions of workers in hundreds of industries, including the
oil business, were exposed to the deadly fibers. Fatal
asbestos-related diseases often take more than 20 years after
exposure to manifest themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some citizens groups were critical of the industry's efforts to
push the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   USAction, a health care consumer group affiliated with
organizations including the American Federation of State, County,
and Municipal Employees; the Communication Workers of America, and
the Service Employees International Union, opposes the legislation
and didn't mince words when asked for its view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cheney-led Halliburton Co. has been an integral part of an
asbestos industry which knowingly poisoned its own workers for
years and is still trying to get off the hook. That industry _
which is counting on special treatment from a Bush-Cheney
administration _ has publicly vowed that it will be bringing its
bailout legislation back to Congress next year,'' said William
McNary, president of USAction.
</P>
<P>
   McNary said Halliburton should have settled its claims with the
workers. ``Instead, Cheney chose to gamble that federal legislation
could be passed to allow his company to escape its responsibility
to the people it harmed,'' McNary said.
</P>
<P>
   A blizzard of suits
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court said something had to be done
to break the logjam of asbestos cases clogging the court system.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist said the situation cries out for
a legislative solution.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsors insist it will end the backup of hundreds of
thousands of victims waiting for their day in court and prevent
personal-injury lawyers from pocketing large chunks of the
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition _ mostly unions, victim groups, consumer
coalitions and personal-injury lawyers _ called the legislation the
``Asbestos Industry Relief Act'' because it will prevent thousands
of terminally ill victims from filing suit or holding the industry
accountable for their asbestos-related disease.
</P>
<P>
   The committee debates often turned into an angry circus with
asbestos-industry lawyers accusing the attorneys for those with
asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma with being ambulance
chasers who oppose the legislation because it will eliminate
millions of dollars in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the battle centered on the medical criteria that
the government would use to screen applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The criteria, developed for the most part by asbestos-industry
consultants, was soundly criticized by nationally recognized
pulmonary and cancer specialists, who called the proposed standards
``antiquated,'' ``exclusionary'' and ``barbaric.''
</P>
<P>
   Tears were shed in the committee hearing room as asbestos
victims from Libby, Mont., some clutching tanks of oxygen, told how
hundreds in their tiny town were killed or sickened from asbestos
that contaminated the vermiculite dug from a mine owned by Grace.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, denounced the
legislation, saying it would relieve corporations of their
responsibilities to fairly compensate workers injured by their
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   `Wait 'til next year'
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait 'til next year,'' was the headline of a full-page ad in a
Capitol Hill newspaper for lawmakers. The ad was bought by the
Coalition for Asbestos Resolution, a Washington-based lobbying
group supporting the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing the old Brooklyn Dodgers' battle cry, the coalition
told lawmakers reading Roll Call last week that the industry-funded
group would be back next year to push for passage of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition is funded by the asbestos and construction
industries, with most of its money coming from the GAF Corp., a
private company owned almost entirely by Sam Heyman of Westport,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   GAF Corp., which is leading the lobbying effort against the
bill, has made about $178,500 through its PAC and its employees in
donations to federal candidates from 1997 to the present, of which
about $66,250 went to co-sponsors of the asbestos legislation.
Although Grace has been the target of hundreds of thousands of
suits, its political action committee donated nothing to the bill's
supporters, according to Federal Elections Commission documents.
</P>
<P>
   Millions were spent by both sides _ the asbestos industry and
the trial lawyers _ in lobbying for and against the bill. The
battle got down to the glitzy television ads saturating the home
states of key members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a high-profile, prolonged legislative face-off
over the past year, not only in the Congress but on the airwaves in
Montana, Minnesota and the metropolitan Washington area,'' said
John Bell, a spokesman for the Association of Trial Lawyers of
America. ``We've calculated that Sam Heyman and the asbestos
industry have invested some $20 million in their campaign _ and
although unsuccessful so far, they've outspent us and our allies by
more than 10-to-1.''
</P>
<P>
   Direct donations to the bill's sponsors represent only a part of
the effort to influence Congress. Far more dollars are given for
lobbying expenses, and in ``soft money'' _ donations to party
political action committees that are often funneled to campaigns.
Halliburton has donated at least $282,050 in ``soft money,'' mostly
to state and federal Republican Party committees.

   LATIN-MUSIC (Undated) _ Last year was a great year for Latin

accepts that the enthusiastic reception of Latin music by
non-Latinos was a true indication of the music's health. By Peter

   LATIN-ROCK-MUSIC (Bogota, Colombia) _ Rock may have been born as

   DIESKAU-MUSIC (Undated) _ Who would suspect, this late in the

Records, of Milan, advertising the first release ever of
Fischer-Dieskau's first-ever operatic appearance. By Matthew
Gurewitsch.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTRONIC-MUSIC (Undated) _ The Lincoln Center Festival's
five-concert Electronic Evolution series last month surveyed the
history of electronic music, starting with the 1920 invention of
the theremin, the electronic instrument that looks like a radio
transmitter and was once a staple of sci-fi movie soundtracks.
These rewarding concerts showed where electronic music has come
from. But a free preconcert event in the Low Library at Columbia
University showed where electronic music, maybe music as a whole,
could be going. By Anthony Tommasini.

   &UR; FILM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AFFAIR-OF-LOVE-FILM (Undated) _ ``I lived a powerful love story,
I understood nothing about it, and I needed to delve into my
questions in a film,'' said the Belgian director Frederic Fonteyne,
by way of explaining his tender, unconventional and emotionally
charged movie about middle-aged romance, ``An Affair of Love.''
Written by his longtime friend and collaborator Philippe Blasband,
it depicts a 40-something woman and a slightly younger man who meet
in Paris through a personals ad that the woman has placed in order
to fulfill a particular sexual fantasy. The characters never tell
each other their names, nor do they (or we) have any information
about their respective backgrounds. By Laura Winters.
</P>
<P>
   AIMEE&AMP;JAGUAR-FILM (Undated) _ Felice Schragenheim was a
high-spirited, educated, sensual, witty and wily young lesbian,
whose dangerous misfortune was to have been born Jewish in
pre-World War II Germany. During the war she lived in Berlin under
an assumed name and worked at a Nazi newspaper, feeding information
to the underground resistance. Lilly Wust, the young wife of an SS
soldier, was the mother of four boys, and for her effort in
producing such strapping young specimens of Aryan youth, she was
awarded the Nazi's Maternal Cross in bronze. She had reportedly
once said that she could ``smell Jews,'' a comment that, when it
reached Felice via a mutual friend, challenged the playful Felice
to arrange a meeting with such a person. ``Aimee and Jaguar,''
which opens August 11, is based on the true story of Felice
Schragenheim and Lilly Wust. By Nancy Ramsey.

   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JEWISH-TV (New York) _ You don't get much banter in the four
Hebrew horse operas being screened August 8 at the Jewish Museum in
Manhattan. Billed as ``Wild Wild West: The Jewish Experience,'' the
program is comprised of hourlong TV episodes with Jewish themes,
including a 1963 episode of the historically dubious ``Bonanza.''
``We want audiences to look critically at the way Jewish ethnicity
has been represented on TV,'' said Andrew Ingall, the museum's
broadcasting archivist. ``The Jewish characters on these shows are
basically stereotypes. But then, all four teleplays are products of
their time.'' By Franz Lidz.

   AFRIQUE-DANCE (Undated) _ ``Le Coq Est Mort,'' an earnest but
problematic production that will open on August 9 at the Jacob's
Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass., sheds light on some of the
tensions inherent in working with people from other cultures, a
practice that is gaining favor among performing artists. By
Christopher Reardon.
</P>
<P>
   STREB-DANCE (Undated) _ At a recent dance forum, Elizabeth Streb
introduced herself with considered clarity: ``Ten years ago I
thought of myself as someone who had a dance company. Today I think
of myself as someone who creates wild actions and movement moments
in a show that I sell.'' Streb, artistic director of Streb, has
never been a typical choreographer. For her new show, ``Action
Heroes,'' Streb has pumped up the spectacle with a music-sound
score and at least the semblance of a story. Streb has gone Vegas.
Or, at least, that's where she's headed. By Ann Daly.

   EXPLORATORIUM-ART (San Francisco) _ Since the Exploratorium was
founded here 31 years ago as an innovative ``museum of science, art

museum rules. Mixing science exhibits and artworks with little
concern about which is which, the Exploratorium encourages a
giddily high level of interactivity, inviting visitors not just to
stand and contemplate but to touch, pump, spin or otherwise mess
around with most of the 600-plus items on display. This summer,
however, a few distinguished visitors are being treated with
decidedly old-fashioned formality. By Tessa DeCarlo.
</P>
<P>
   NY-SKYSCRAPER-REFORM (Undated) _ In the absence of alternatives,
there may be no more important project under way in New York right
now than David Childs' restoration of Lever House, the
International Style skyscraper on Park Avenue. Designed by Gordon
Bunshaft and completed in 1952, Lever House was the first glass
curtain wall tower to rise in New York. It remains among the 20th
century's major landmarks. By Herbert Muschamp.

   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FAUST-THEATER (Hanover, Germany) _ There are also two souls
within ``Faust.'' ``Faust,'' Part 1, published in 1808 and a work
of both Goethe's youth and maturity, contains the well-known plot _
the bargain of the learned Doctor Faust with Mephistopheles, the
seduction of the innocent Gretchen _ that has been echoed in
novels, movies, puppet shows and several operas. ``Faust,'' Part 2,
written in Goethe's old age and published shortly after his death
in 1832, is more abstract, disjunct, and hardly ever staged. So
when one of Germany's most celebrated theatrical directors, Peter
Stein, determined to mount a production of the complete uncut
``Faust,'' Parts 1 and 2, it became an event of national magnitude.

   TRAVEL-OLY-TICKETS (Undated) _ Time, something that many Olympic
athletes compete against, has turned out to be a friend to
Americans thinking of going to the Summer Games in Sydney next
month. Those who have waited before buying package tours to the
Games, which officially open Sept. 15 and continue to Oct. 1, will
find cheaper plans than were available several months ago. In some
cases, the savings are about 50 percent. By Joseph Siano.

   TRAVEL-OLY-SYDNEY-QUEENSTREET-ART (Undated) _ Visitors to the
Olympics who need an antidote to the events and the crowds can
spend a few hours wandering along Queen Street in Woollahra. The
quiet, tree-lined area is filled with antiques stores and a few
smart restaurants. Much of Sydney has become overwhelmed with new
building and brash architecture, but Woollahra, one of the early
settlements of the colonial city, has retained its original terrace
houses, shady trees and village atmosphere. By Jane Perlez.

   TRAVEL-OLY-SYDNEY-ARTS-ART (Undated) _ Australia has
well-deserved credentials as one of the great sporting nations of
the world, but its reputation in the arts is a more recent
phenomenon. For visitors to the Olympic Games, the Sydney Olympic
Arts Festival, with its roster of dance, music, art, theater and
film, offers an enticing bonus, a way to appreciate the rich and
diverse culture of this antipodean nation and place Australia's
artistic achievements in an international context. The
six-week-long festival actually starts a full month before the
Games commence, to set the stage and to showcase the full scope of
arts offerings. By Susan Gough Henly.

years, residents from Philadelphia to Los Angeles have watched
Tenet buy their long-standing community hospitals, streamline
operations, and downsize staff. How long, people wondered, before
Tenet would cut the hospital's traditional role of caring for the
poor? So far that hasn't happened _ despite a $205-billion-gash in
Medicare payments over the past two years. Instead, Barbakow has
managed to lift corporate profits in this battered industry while
maintaining and, sometimes improving, patient care. By Kathleen

U.S. BEACH CLOSINGS SOAR WITH FOCUS ON POLLUTION

 By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The number of pollution-related beach closings and
advisories increased by 50 percent nationwide from 1997 to 1999,
according to a report released on Thursday by the Natural Resources
Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental group's 10th annual report on water quality at
vacation beaches, Testing the Waters 2000, showed that more than
half of those closings or advisories were in California.
</P>
<P>
   And while the overall numbers from 1998 to 1999 dropped
nationwide _ a trend the organization attributed to drier
conditions last year _ California's numbers continued to increase,
jumping to 3,547 in 1999 from 3,273 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers do not necessarily mean there was an increase in
pollutants flowing into the ocean here. Rather, the council's
lawyers said, the increase reflects an increased amount of testing
to reveal the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``California's record number of beach closures and advisories in
1999 suggests that the more you look for pollution at the beach,
the more you find,'' said David Beckman, a senior council lawyer
here, noting that the state began a comprehensive monitoring
program that year.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, monitoring and reporting have also increased over
the last 10 years, said Sarah Chasis, a senior lawyer with the
council in Washington who has overseen the report since the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the good news,'' she said. ``The bad news is that with
that increased monitoring and reporting, we have more closings and
advisories indicating we have serious coastal water problems that
remain to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the first year the survey was published, 484 closings
or advisories were reported nationwide. In 1999, there were 6,160,
about two-thirds of which resulted from bacteria levels that
exceeded health standards.
</P>
<P>
   While the overall number was down from 7,236 in 1998, a year
when the El Nino weather pattern produced heavy rainfall, the trend
has been upward over the 10-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the problem more prevalent than in Southern
California. With vast amounts of paved lands and storm water
systems that were designed to speed runoff directly to the ocean,
beach closings have become a fact of life, particularly during the
rainy winter months.
</P>
<P>
   The rainwater picks up contaminants, everything from oily
residue on city streets to lawn fertilizer to animal waste, on its
way to the ocean. But even when there is no rain, swimming near
storm drains in Southern California can be hazardous. Last summer,
for example, Huntington Beach was closed because of high bacteria
counts that could not be explained.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, 11 states had comprehensive monitoring. This year,
Florida and Massachusetts passed laws establishing comprehensive
monitoring programs.
</P>
<P>
   The group lists Louisiana, Oregon, Texas and Washington as
``beach bums'' because they have limited or no monitoring of
beaches and no public notification programs.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that the primary cause of the closings was
sewage and polluted storm water runoff. Seventy percent of the
closings and advisories were the result of monitoring showing that
bacteria levels exceeded beach water quality standards. Pathogens
contained in polluted water can result in a range of illnesses,
from gastroenteritis and dysentery to hepatitis and ear and upper
respiratory infections.
</P>
<P>
   The report was based on statistics provided to the Environmental
Protection Agency by states and some individual surveys done by the
council.
</P>
<P>
   Now that an expanded picture is beginning to emerge, Beckman
said, it is time to start taking action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to start doing some grass-roots intervention with
respect to the problem and not greet it every year with `It's a
regrettable development' kind of an attitude,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week in California, state officials announced a
15-year plan to curb runoff pollution. The program, which is viewed
as the first of its kind in the country linking efforts to clean up
inland runoff along with beach pollution, will be carried out in
three phases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've recognized and our cities recognize that what runs off
streets in the High Sierras winds up in our coastal waters and foul
our beaches,'' said Mary D. Nichols, California's secretary for
resources.
</P>
<P>
   She estimated it would take 30 years to get full compliance with
the new measures and would cost about $14 billion dollars.
Compliance is required under the federal Clean Water Act and
coastal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating runoff problems at farms, logging operations and
marinas will be emphasized in the first phase of the program, said
Ken Harris, chief of the Watershed Pollution Prevention Section. In
later phases, cities and developers will be expected to take steps
to control polluted runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, most offenders will be given an opportunity to make
changes on their own. Enforcement measures and penalties will be
phased in.
</P>
<P>
   Several coastal cities in Southern California most affected by
urban runoff problems, including Los Angeles, are already regulated
separately under the Clean Water Act.
</P>
<P>
   The new program will offer them an opportunity to refine their
existing regulatory processes and provide additional public
education, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Beckman praised the plan as a step in the right direction, but
voiced concern about the lack of regulatory features.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to say the impact of the plan right now is at
best uncertain,'' he said. ``In order to be successful, it will
have to be funded and enforced. It remains to be seen whether
that's going to occur to the extent necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal environmental agency has given the state $10.6
million for the first year of the program and the state has about
$290 million in bond money that will be used over the next three to
four years, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols defended the state's approach to compliance saying, that
the plan would give industries a chance to ``become partners in the
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't 1970 and in the year 2000 we have a much higher
degree of public awareness of the significance of the pollution
problem,'' she said. ``Everyone owns the problem and has a stake in
cleaning it up.''

 &HT;    Undrafted, but not unnoticed
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Doug Johnson could have been a quarterback with the
Cowboys, Packers or Cardinals. Maurice Smith nearly became a
running back for the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite radically different college backgrounds, Johnson and
Smith are wearing black and red in Japan today because the Falcons
offered the best sales pitch to each in the spring. The Falcons
beat out Saturday's American Bowl opponent, the Dallas Cowboys, and
several other teams to get Johnson after his Florida career. NFL
teams don't offer scholarships, but they sometimes recruit like
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Before the draft even each year, team officials work the
telephones furiously, letting agents know that if their clients
don't get drafted, there's an NFL team interested in signing them
as a free agent. As with colleges, it often comes down to which
team has the most to offer _ or the best connections. Johnson and
Smith both liked the idea of staying close to home. The
relationship between Falcons national scout Mike Hagen and
Johnson's high school coach, John Hunt, also helped.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt, a member of the Florida staff, was Johnson's coach at
Gainesville (Fla.) Buchholz High. Years ago, Hunt worked in the
Cowboys organization with Hagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I place a lot of stock in what John says, and he had good
things to say about the Falcons and coach (Dan) Reeves,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Smith came with sterling recommendations from Hagen,
Tampa-based area scout Boyd Dowler and Atlanta-based area scout Ken
Blair.
</P>
<P>
   RIGHT PLACE FOR SMITH
</P>
<P>
   While Johnson routinely played in front of SEC crowds of 85,000
and more, Smith toiled in front of crowds sometimes one-tenth that
size at Division I-AA North Carolina A&AMP;T in Greensboro, N.C. But
his 6.1-yard average per carry did not go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   After the draft, Falcons officials told the 6-foot-1,
225-pounder that ``they wanted a bigger guy because they weren't
sure what was going to happen with (running back) Jamal
(Anderson),'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   That Atlanta is close to Smith's hometown of Palmyra, N.C.,
where he grew up with four brothers and three sisters, was
important. The Falcons' offense was a nice match, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Reeves obviously likes to run the ball, and when I was
researching the teams that were interested in me, that stuck out,''
said Smith, who is a few courses short of a degree in agricultural
and biosystems engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the team worked out a two-year deal with Smith by
telephone on draft day, Falcons vice president of football
operations Ron Hill was worried that he might change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a long time ago working with (former Cowboys general
manager) Gil Brandt that when you want to do something, you do it
now,'' Hill said. ``So I said, `Get on a plane and go sign him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Pro personnel assistant Mark Olson caught a plane to Greensboro
and signed Smith in a Waffle House near midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``About five or six teams called after the Falcons,'' said
Smith, who led all rushers in Saturday's 20-13 win over the Colts
with 58 yards on nine carries. ``I'm in the right place.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has been asked to ``get close'' to Smith and take him
under his wing. But Smith already has shown that he doesn't always
need help.
</P>
<P>
   Early in training camp, after linebacker Keith Brooking hit him
hard, Smith shot back, ``I'm coming to get you.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Smith, rarely asked to block in college, jacked
Brooking in blitz-pickup drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a rookie, undrafted no less, calls out a veteran, you got
to respect that,'' Brooking said. ``Rookies are going to get tested
to kind of see what they're made of. He plays hard.''
</P>
<P>
   OVERCOMING A REPUTATION
</P>
<P>
   Playing hard was one of the question marks about Johnson. An
inconsistent college career convinced NFL teams that he was too
risky to draft.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's tenuous relationship with Florida coach Steve Spurrier
was well documented. The low point of his career came when he was
the starting quarterback as a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the top-ranked Gators were upset at LSU, a game
in which Johnson completed just 3 of 6 passes for 46 yards, a
caller to a local sports radio show said he had seen the
quarterback at a bar after curfew before the game. Johnson was
suspended for a game and the rest of his Florida career was like a
yo-yo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought I was a head case,'' Johnson said when asked what
scared away the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of things that went on inside the program
that you couldn't see from the outside,'' he said. ``There wasn't
anything I could do, except shut up and play. People probably just
thought I was immature, inconsistent and couldn't be counted on.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagen's relationship with Hunt helped the Falcons look deeper.
The team also got a start with Johnson when they were the only team
that paid to fly him in for a workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody else did that,'' said Johnson, who visited Atlanta the
same weekend the Florida basketball team played in the SEC
championship game in the Georgia Dome. ``And I wanted to go to a
team that had a good, veteran quarterback to learn from.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, with Troy Aikman, and the Packers, with Brett
Favre, met some of the criteria, too. But not all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are close to home,'' Johnson said of the Falcons.
``They're in the Southeast, and I wanted to stay in this part of
the country. I love Georgia.''

 &HT;    Weary team hits Tokyo
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Atlanta Falcons arrived in the Land of the Rising
Sun on Thursday looking at a setting sun.
</P>
<P>
   As players, coaches and staffers staggered off buses and into
their hotel in Japan, it was the Atlanta equivalent of 6:35 a.m. It
was 7:35 p.m. in Tokyo. The team's charter flight left training
camp in Greenville, S.C., Wednesday about 12:30 p.m. Including a
stop in Atlanta to pick up cheerleaders, the team spent 18 hours on
a plane.
</P>
<P>
   The bus ride from Narita airport east of Tokyo took nearly two
more hours, because highways were choked with rush-hour traffic in
the early evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons should be rested by the time they play the Dallas
Cowboys in the American Bowl NFL exhibition. The game is at 11 a.m.
Sunday in Tokyo, which is 10 p.m. Saturday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday morning _ or night _ they were whipped. ``That bus
ride was the worst,'' equipment manager Brian Boigner said.
``(Assistant Thom) Kaumayer said we should have taken the train.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaumayer, who is new to the Falcons' staff, has coached in the
Japanese football league.
</P>
<P>
   Players and coaches were subjected to a series of lectures from
coaches, customs officials and, finally, the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons had to hear about the Japanese jail system and other
odd pieces of information that they hope they won't need to use.
Upon arriving at the Tokyo Dome Hotel, which opened just two months
ago next to the Tokyo Dome, or ''Big Egg,'' as they call it here,
the Falcons went through another briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Then, some of them went in search of food. Wide receiver Terance
Mathis was on his way out with rookie wide receiver Mareno Philyaw
and rookie cornerback Darrick Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   They looked chipper after taking showers. ``The bus ride didn't
bother me,'' Mathis said. ''I was asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Players and coaches had the option of taking medication to help
them sleep on the Japan Air Lines 747 that the NFL chartered for
the team.
</P>
<P>
   Left tackle Bob Whitfield was surprised to see Falcons super fan
Col. Joe Curtis, a longtime supporter who claims to have attended
all but one Falcons home game since 1966.
</P>
<P>
   He might be the only fan who made the 6,600-mile trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd known you were coming, I'd have stayed home,''
Whitfield said. ``I'd have let you take my place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will have two days to tour Tokyo. They practiced at
10 a.m. Friday (9 p.m. Thursday, ET) and will practice again at
10:30a.m. Saturday (9:30 p.m. today, ET).
</P>
<P>
   Tickets still are available for the game, at prices ranging from
5,000 to 50,000 yen. That's about $48.50 to $485.

IN BEIJING, STUDENT ENTREPRENEURS FORGE A CHINESE-STYLE SILICON
VALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Anyone searching for the soul of China's Silicon
Valley can find it here, up four flights of concrete stairs, past
walls with peeling paint and ledges strewn with beer bottles, down
a darkened hallway and inside what was once the student activity
room at Qinghua University Dormitory No. 20.
</P>
<P>
   It is here that a visitor will find the makeshift research and
development offices of the fledgling company called Beijing East
Doctors Information Technology (``doctors'' as in Ph.D.'s, not
medical doctors).
</P>
<P>
   With the blessing of the administrators at Qinghua, China's
leading technical university, six graduate students are sharing
their pursuit of a legend borrowed from the opposite side of the
Pacific Ocean, in the original Silicon Valley _ the birthplace of
companies like Hewlett-Packard and Yahoo, whose roots lie deep in
the student life of Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   As Yang Diange, a 27-year-old computer science student who is
the chief executive of Beijing East, put it: ``That is our dream _
to be just like a Cisco or a Sun Microsystems.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the best and brightest technology companies in
Silicon Valley, Hewlett-Packard, Sun and Cisco were founded by
students, faculty and staff members at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Beijing East, which is developing a Web site that will
match technology experts with Internet users, is one of perhaps 500
or 600 recent home-grown Internet start-ups in Zhongguancun, a
chaotic Beijing neighborhood that is both the site of some of the
nation's best universities and the Chinese government's designated
high-technology industrial zone.
</P>
<P>
   Zhongguancun, in the Haidian district in northwest Beijing, is
home to a fledgling Internet industry as well as better-known
Chinese computer and telecommunications companies like Legend
Computer Systems, Founder Computer Systems and Huawei Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Internet arrived in China only in 1997, Beijing
students, when their experience is measured in ``Internet years,''
have already weathered a boom-and-bust cycle. Many tiny start-ups
here have gone out of business in the months since the April
decline of the Nasdaq stock market.
</P>
<P>
   For the young founders of Beijing East, however, Zhongguancun is
the perfect incubator. Next year the company plans to move off
campus and commercialize its Internet computer support Web site.
</P>
<P>
   And though they work half a world away from the world's
better-known high-technology mecca, this group of graduate students
is in many ways closer to the authentic entrepreneurial spirit that
drives Silicon Valley than many of the world's ersatz Silicon
Deserts, Mountains, Glens and Forests, which are most frequently
the public relations products of overzealous economic development
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been remarkable to me how similar the entrepreneurial
high-tech Chinese are to their American counterparts,'' said Kai-Fu
Lee, an American-educated computer scientist who is director of a
research laboratory that Microsoft has established in Zhongguancun.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the oppressive humidity that visits Beijing each summer,
the Qinghua students spend 15 to 18 hours a day packed into their
dormitory room with six personal computers hooked to their campus
network.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the students have drawn no salaries and raised about
$36,000 from friends and family that was spent mostly on computers
and the wages paid to some undergraduate students for programming
help.
</P>
<P>
   They are now adding the finishing touches to their Web site,
which is intended to take advantage of the latest Internet trend, a
peer-to-peer service and support network. In their case, it is
meant to bring together China's best technology experts with what
they hope will be tens of thousands of Internet and PC novices
hungry for online help in everything from surfing the Web to
questions about both the Windows and Linux operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Yang expects the company to need as much as $500,000
to start its business. Despite some concerns about a recent cooling
down in venture capital investment in China, he foresees no
difficulties in raising the funds.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he feels the group needs to be picky even in choosing
its investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not very difficult for us to find an investor for our
next stage,'' he said. ``But we don't want to cooperate with common
investors; we'd like to find some famous investors. We will grow
faster with the help of famous investors such as International Data
Group, Softbank, CMGI, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Yang's confidence is echoed by other Zhongguancun start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have venture capitalists coming to our door every week,''
said Jia Enchen, general manager of eefind.com, a Chinese-language
search-engine technology development company in an office park just
south of the Qinghua campus.
</P>
<P>
   Like Beijing East, eefind is a clear example of why the Chinese
start-ups should be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have access to sophisticated software technology
and bright programmers, and they are operating on a shoestring
compared with their Silicon Valley counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Although eefind's extremely cramped two-room office on the top
floor of the 10-story Qinghua Pioneer Park building makes even the
most crowded Silicon Valley office or garage look spacious, the
company has spent only about $130,000 so far in developing its
search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, eefind.com exemplifies a second significant aspect of
the Chinese technology boom.
</P>
<P>
   Many entrepreneurs who are founding companies are technologists
who are moving here because they see the Internet boom here as
real. A sense seems to prevail that in the 21st century the
Internet will increasingly be dominated by the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Eefind's founder, Ming-Jer Lee, is computer science graduate
student from Taiwan who moved to Beijing to found the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where the Internet market will be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the recent growth of the Chinese Internet suggests that
he may even be understating the future. July survey statistics
reported by the China Internet Network Information Center show that
the number of Chinese Internet users has almost doubled, to 16.9
million from 8.9 million, in just seven months.
</P>
<P>
   By one estimate, the annual value of e-commerce could pass $1
billion by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   That the Internet is catching hold in urban China can easily be
seen by even a casual visitor to Beijing. A majority of the
billboards that bracket the city's freeways now come equipped with
Internet addresses.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the first U.S. companies to realize that the spirit of
the Zhongguancun Internet boom was a resource to be exploited was
Microsoft. Nearly two years ago, it set up a research laboratory
here and tapped as its director Kai-Fu Lee, who had previously
served as a vice president at both Apple Computer and Silicon
Graphics, where he worked on voice recognition and 3-D software.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft laboratory, now well established, is beginning to
contribute to Microsoft products under development. Lee has
recruited a number of American computer experts to lead the
laboratory's research teams and has hired leading Chinese
scientists, programmers and mathematicians.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his research group leaders are ethnic Chinese who agreed
to return from the West, or to move from Taiwan, to build the new
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, the laboratory, which occupies a single floor
of a new office building in the Zhongguancun zone, plays host to
180 student interns who are developing software programs for
Microsoft. The laboratory is scheduled to expand to a second floor
of the building in August.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite his optimism about the potential Chinese
technologists, Lee is still cautious about the possibility that
Zhongguancun could rival Silicon Valley for sheer entrepreneurial
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent article in People's Daily, he asserted that cultural
differences remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the `real' differences between Silicon Valley and
Zhongguancun are: culture, different types of talent, different
definitions of innovation, different types of venture capital and
different involvement of academic institutions,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley has evolved a culture that is tuned to
market-driven innovation, Lee noted, while in China, innovation is
still largely driven by technology.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote that venture capital is not playing the same role
in China that it plays in Silicon Valley, where investors are
frequently an integral part of a company's day-to-day operations.
Things are changing in China, but until recently venture investors
had been used only as a source of financing.
</P>
<P>
   There may be another crucial difference as well. Despite an
intensifying housing shortage, highway traffic problems and
declining quality of life in Silicon Valley, it still seems like an
earthly paradise compared with the rapidly industrializing Beijing,
with its chronic pollution.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent lunchtime meeting at the Microsoft lab here, a
visitor asked seven of the American computer experts recruited by
Lee what they missed most about the United States. In unison the
group answered, ``Fresh air!''

 &HT;    State making education standards tougher for Texas schools &HT;    By KATHY WALT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle &HT;    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Texas schools will have to meet tougher standards to
get high marks under the state's school rating system, Education
Commissioner Jim Nelson announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this new blueprint will allow us to build on a very
strong system to make it even stronger,'' Nelson said in announcing
the changes, some of which take effect this fall.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Under the state's school accountability system, schools are
rated exemplary, recognized, acceptable or low-performing. The
ratings are based primarily on standardized test scores and dropout
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The changes will be phased in over several years, starting this
fall when dropout rates will be lowered and fewer campuses will be
exempted from being held accountable for minority students'
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The dropout standards are not as stringent as Nelson had
originally outlined, but he said he agreed to back off his proposal
after weighing concerns from superintendents and other school
district officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many felt that it was too much too fast,'' Nelson said of his
original plan to require schools to reduce their dropout rates by 1
percent each year for the next two years. ``But they can anticipate
a continuing move toward more rigorous dropout standards in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he has warned school administrators to get ready
now, ``because it will come to pass. They should start looking at
how they can strengthen their dropout prevention and recovery
programs and look at ways that they can keep more kids in school.''
</P>
<P>
   Under current standards, the dropout rate must be no more than 1
percent for a school to claim the exemplary rating, a figure that
remains unchanged this fall and next year.
</P>
<P>
   For the recognized rating, the current dropout rate is 3.5
percent or less; for an acceptable rating, the dropout rate is 6
percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, those who seek recognized or acceptable
status will have to reduce their dropout rates by half a percentage
point this school year and another half-percentage point in the
next school year. So by 2001-02, ``recognized'' schools must have a
dropout rate of 2.5 percent or less and ``acceptable'' schools must
have a rate of 5 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   New passing rates on the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills,
the state's controversial high-stakes testing program, will kick in
during the 2001-02 school year, Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning that school year, officials will require
``acceptable'' schools to post a 55 percent passing rate for all
students. Social studies will be added to the test, with a 50
percent passing rate required in that category for an acceptable
rating.
</P>
<P>
   TAAS passing rates for exemplary and recognized schools will
remain unchanged at 90 and 80 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   School districts and campuses will get a break from the ratings
_ a system that has caused angst in some districts that have failed
to make the grade or show improvement _ in the 2002-03 school year.
</P>
<P>
   No school ratings will be reported for that school year, Nelson
said, because that will be the first year Texas administers a new
series of standardized tests. The Legislature has mandated that the
skills tests be made even more difficult, increasing the academic
areas tested and moving the high school exit test from the
sophomore to junior year.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he has not decided whether to raise the TAAS passing
standard for 2004 and beyond because he wants to see how students
do on the new exams first.
</P>
<P>
   None of the changes will affect the 1999-2000 school performance
ratings, which are scheduled to be announced Aug. 17, Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement drew criticism from State Board of Education
member David Bradley, R-Beaumont, who complained that board
members' advice was not sought by Nelson in setting the new
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some authority over (these issues) but once again the
TEA has ignored the input of the board,'' Bradley said.

RACIAL GAP IN TEST SCORES POLARIZES A DIVERSE DISTRICT

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NYACK, N.Y. _ Set above the leafy banks of the Hudson River,
this cluster of villages north of New York City has long cultivated
a reputation as an idyll of diversity and tolerance. Blacks and
whites mingle easily in the shops lining the quaint main street.
Interracial families seek out the town as a place where they can
live without issue.
</P>
<P>
   The charge, then, hit right at the heart. Armed with previously
unreleased statistics broken down by race, a group of parents,
black and white, accused the school district of systemic
segregation: Steering blacks away from honors classes and into
special education, disciplining blacks at disproportionate rates,
allowing test scores of blacks to lag far behind those of whites
for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the numbers divided the community in a way most
people here thought nothing ever could. White parents defended the
schools, pointing the finger at what they called deviancy and
neglect in black families.
</P>
<P>
   While some black parents said the statistics confirmed the
discrimination they suspected, others denounced the group's report
as perpetuating painful stereotypes. In the tension, car windows
were smashed and sidewalk confrontations erupted.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict here offers a cautionary tale. Closing the gap
between black and white achievement has become the nation's
thorniest education challenge. Impressed by success in Texas, many
states hope to do what the parents here did: Release scores by
race. California began doing so this year; New York, Connecticut,
Massachusetts and Florida all recently announced plans to do so.
</P>
<P>
   This places a new onus on diverse and well-off suburban
communities like this, which have long been able to disguise poor
performance by blacks in averages lifted by higher scores of
whites. The idea, state officials say, is that exposing the
disparity it forces school districts to seek to eliminate it. But
Nyack's experience suggests that the path from releasing numbers to
improving schools can be exceptionally rough terrain, that merely
acknowledging the existence of a gap, even in well-meaning
communities, is a process filled with pain and controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has polarized our community like no other issue,'' said
Kim Raso Stewart, a white parent of two children. ``It's like us
against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nyack would seem to have exactly the kind of schools parents
expect to find in the suburbs. With about 3,000 students, the
district spends about $13,000 per student _ some $4,000 more than
the state average. Of the class that graduated in June, 92 percent
passed the English Regents exam, and 85 percent passed the Math
Regents, both scores well above the state average. As Brenda Ross,
a black parent, said, ``I thought that part of life in the suburbs
was all set.''
</P>
<P>
   But the report released by the local chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People and a group
called Nyack Partners in Education in February 1999 exposed a
deeply troubling pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Among pages of findings and statistics were these: Honors
classes had nine times as many whites as blacks, even though the
district overall had about twice as many whites as blacks. Black
students were about 2 1/2 times as likely to be suspended and
almost three times as likely to be in special education. While 63
percent of whites passed the Math I Regents in 1997-98, only 31
percent of blacks did.
</P>
<P>
   The gap mirrors one in national statistics. While low
achievement among blacks was once written off as the consequence of
poverty and disadvantage, statistics show it exists across class;
children of the most well-off, well-educated blacks perform only
about as well as the children of the poorest whites.
</P>
<P>
   In Nyack, some of the gap could be explained by differences in
income. Blacks earn on average about half what whites do. But much
as there are pockets of white poverty, there is a significant black
middle class in Valley Cottage, the largest of the school
district's five villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has a reputation as an artsy, enlightened community,''
said Daniel Wolff, a white parent who led the effort. ``The truth
is, there are these really visible lines between groups of people.
The only place the groups are together is in the public schools,
where they have to be, only they've set up this system where they
don't have to be, because black kids are on different tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   The school district objected to the implication that anyone
discriminated intentionally. Honors classes, for example, were
based on merit, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Other parents rushed to join the defense, insisting that
teachers do not treat children differently because of skin color.
Ninety-six percent of Nyack students go on to college, they said.
What better indicator of excellent schools? Some acknowledged a gap
in achievement, but said it was a national problem. Why expect
Nyack to solve it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we're very forward thinking,'' said Meg Ferrazano, a
white parent. ``We have multicultural events, we have kids who are
friends with each other. I see the kids all get along.''
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent, Roberta P. Zampolin, said the problems are
in the home, not the schools, and others picked up that theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nyack schools and its professionals are not responsible
for the failures of the home, the conduct of absent child bearers
or irresponsible, immoral and criminal parents,'' Raso Stewart and
her husband, James T. Stewart, wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a lot of support for saying that,'' she said in an
interview. ``The numbers don't lie, but is there an attempt to keep
black children back? There's so much more. What are the homes like,
what are the parents like? Do the kids get a hot meal at the end of
the day?''
</P>
<P>
   Many black parents, especially among the more affluent in Valley
Cottage, lashed out at the parents' group for releasing the
numbers, ridiculing them as liberal do-gooders trying to co-opt
blacks in their crusade.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Davis, a school board member who is black, said that when
his daughter heard about the report, she started saying it meant
she was ``stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent all this time talking to my kids about `you can be
anything you want to be,''' he said. ``For some folks, this is just
going to prove the point: `Hey, I told you those folks weren't too
bright.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The school district, too, resisted talking about a gap.
Officials commissioned their own study of the issue. But the
consultant who produced it, David Tulin, said that when he showed
his report to school officials, the superintendent asked him to
remove his conclusions describing the schools as ``functionally
segregated'' and threatened to withhold his fee if he did not.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Burrell, the school board chairman, said officials were
only trying to limit Tulin to their original request:
recommendations, not conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Tulin wrote the incident off as defensiveness. ``They felt they
were good-hearted people, they're helping to change the world,'' he
said. ``And when there's a challenge to what they've accomplished,
it's a slap in the face.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1991, Texas graded its schools in part on how much
scores improved for different racial groups. Next year, New York
plans to grade schools as meeting or falling below standards based
on data broken out by race. Even traditionally good schools could
earn a subpar grade if the black population, no matter how small,
does not score well. ``The issue for suburban districts is, once
you go past the aggregate scores, being able to see that there are
pockets of kids who have never done well,'' said Frederick J.
Frelow, a black Nyack parent and an official on the National
Commission on Teaching and America's Future at Teachers College at
Columbia University. ``It's no longer OK to put these kids in the
nonacademic track, and it's going to be very disturbing to a lot of
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of separating out data argue that it does not have to
be controversial. The danger, they say, is in releasing only
numbers about outcomes. Without some sense of why the problem
exists, it is too easy for people to reduce the problem simply to
blacks' not being as smart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the data have been so often reported in that context,
when black folks hear it, their almost knee-jerk reaction is
defensive,'' said Edmund W. Gordon, professor emeritus of
psychology at Yale University, who led a College Board task force
on the achievement gap. ``I think that Nyack school people probably
thought they were doing as well as any other school district, but
they didn't know what to do about it, so why open up this can of
worms?''
</P>
<P>
   He and others say the key is to hold up models of schools that
are defying the national statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Osnato, superintendent of schools in Montclair, N.J.,
agreed. In Montclair, one of 14 racially integrated communities
that set up a network to compare strategies on closing the gap, the
discussions were difficult at first, he said. With more talk, more
solutions _ creating intensive study groups for black students, and
demanding that they take tougher courses _ begin to emerge, and the
easier it becomes to talk about a gap.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also a key difference in those communities: the
school administration, not renegade parents or state officials,
pushed to talk about the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is painful,'' Frelow said, ``which is why it's all the more
important that the leadership say, `We know it's hard, we don't
feel good about it, but moving in this direction is important for
our future. This is a small community; folks just didn't step up to
do that.''

EDITORIAL: THE MAN FROM MIDLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Aug. 4:
</P>
<P>
   It will be 96 days before Republicans know if Gov. George W.
Bush was right to bypass standard GOP ideological fare and center
this convention on the twin themes of inclusion and personal
testimony. The shape of the convention, like Bush's highly
autobiographical acceptance speech, reflected his determination to
incite a public appetite for change and emphasize the personalities
of the candidates over issues and experience.
</P>
<P>
   Bush delivered a spirited case for a change of style and values
in the White House in spite of the generally sunny national mood
right now. The underlying invitation was for voters to take a leap
of faith on the promise that Bush will develop into a more
effective, resolute and likable leader and role model than Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   This presentation of an admittedly late-blooming candidate as a
work in progress carries certain risks. Not since Jimmy Carter in
1976 has there been a presidential candidate to whom the act of
introducing himself to the American people _ of making himself
known, trusted and familiar as well as simply famous _ was more
important. The speech marked the toughest test for the new nominee
before the debates this fall, when he and his aides expect a
swarming attack from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of Bush's situation right now is that, despite his
familiar name and the seasoned characters surrounding him as policy
advisers, he is actually not very well known even to many who
support him and voted for him in the primaries. His six-year stint
as governor of Texas is one of the briefest times in public life of
any recent presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But serving in Austin probably has less meaning to the voters
than the associations they bring to him because of his family
background and his distance from the Washington world epitomized by
Gore and President Clinton. In speaking of being a ``different''
kind of Republican, Bush hopes to communicate that he will stand
for a broad change in the political culture in the direction of
``civility and respect'' and actually deliver on the ``kinder and
gentler'' Republican policies promised some years ago by his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Running a campaign for change is complicated by the fact that
Americans are satisfied with the economy, and the polls show them
broadly supporting the Democrats' approach on budget issues, as
well as abortion, guns, health care and Social Security. The
oratorical doorway for Bush has been to speak from, and about, his
heart, and Thursday night he charged that the Democrats had used
prosperity ``to no great purpose.'' Tactically, he attempted a
Clinton-like trick of putting a rhetorical lasso around the other
party's issues _ in this case, Social Security, Medicare and Head
Start.
</P>
<P>
   But the glue that holds all this together is the promise of
personality suited to the office, yet free of historical baggage.
In service of that theme, Bush invoked the values of Midland and
boasted that he would come to Washington without inherited enemies
and with ``no stake in the bitter arguments of the last few
years.'' He asserted that his would be an administration guided by
convictions and character rather than polls and focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   A world of difference lies between Bush and Ronald Reagan, the
last Republican Convention nominee to stir the kind of hope among
Republicans that could be heard Thursday night. But like Reagan,
Bush promised that if given a chance he would rise above
expectations, and like Reagan, he is attempting to create a market
for change in the summer convention and then cash in this fall.
Also like Reagan, he promised a regime of homespun values in place
of the policy sophistication or taste for legislative maneuvering
of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, this down-home emphasis is sharply at odds with the
privileged educational and financial background of Bush and many of
the delegates here _ a condition that has led some to say this
ought to be known as the illusion convention instead of the
inclusion convention. But Democrats should make no mistake about
the themes laid down here or the stump performance of George W.
Bush and even that of his running mate, Dick Cheney. They represent
a considerable danger for Gore and his party this fall.

<P>
   Dick Cheney and the giant energy company he will leave to run
for vice president have contributed more than $150,000 to members
of Congress who sponsored legislation that would limit the ability
of workers to sue companies for asbestos exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The Halliburton Co., an oil field services company based in
Dallas, and its subsidiaries have had about 273,300 suits filed
against them since 1976 by workers suffering from asbestos-related
disease. Many of those suits were filed before Cheney became
chairman of the board and chief executive officer in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1999, 107,650 suits for damages were still
pending, including 46,400 new suits filed against the corporation
last year, according to the firm's annual report filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, 59, says he will resign on Aug. 16 to concentrate on the
Republican campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton's political action committees and Cheney contributed
$494,452 to congressional candidates from 1997 through mid-2000. Of
that, $157,500 went to members of Congress who co-sponsored the
asbestos legislation _ 59 Republicans and four Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, as an individual, donated $12,500 to members who
sponsored or co-sponsored the asbestos bills.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions from Cheney and the political action
committees of Halliburton and its subsidiaries went to 49 of the 77
lawmakers who co-sponsored the Fairness in Asbestos Compensation
Act in the House of Representatives and 14 of 29 co-sponsors of
similar legislation in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton defended their contributions and noted that they
were made in full compliance with campaign laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our PAC has made contributions without regard to the pending
asbestos legislation. Any similarities between the supporters of
such legislation and the recipients of contributions from our PAC
is purely coincidental,'' Zelma Branch, a company spokeswoman said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Gribbins, Halliburton's vice president for government
affairs, added: ``We give money to candidates for a variety of
reasons, usually to those who are supportive of the business
agenda, the things that are important to us, like taxes, trade or
something specific like this asbestos issue.''
</P>
<P>
   A controversial bill
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is a highly controversial package promoted and
financed by the GAF Corp. and others in the asbestos industry. This
year, for the third straight year, the bill didn't make it to the
floor for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the House Judiciary Committee narrowly approved the
legislation by a vote of 18-15, with most Republicans supporting it
and most Democrats opposed.
</P>
<P>
   But seeing dwindling support, Illinois Republican Henry Hyde,
the Judiciary Committee chairman, did not send the bill to the full
House for a vote. Had the bill passed, few believed that President
Clinton would have signed it.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 committee members who received the contributions from
Halliburton, 10 voted in favor of the bill. The 11th member missed
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The bill calls for the establishment of an Office of Asbestos
Compensation under the Justice Department. Government-approved
doctors, using criteria defined in the law, would be gatekeepers,
issuing a pass to qualifying victims who wished to sue or seek a
government-determined settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side disputes there is a problem that needs to be
addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Public interest groups estimate that over the past 25 years,
settlements have been made in more than 1 million asbestos cases
industrywide, and 450,000 more may be pending.
</P>
<P>
   $99 million for suits
</P>
<P>
   Although Halliburton is an enormous operation with more than
100,000 employees in 120 countries, it is a relatively small player
when it comes to asbestos litigation, at least when compared to
W.R. Grace &AMP; Co., GAF and the Johns Manville Corp. Nevertheless,
Halliburton has spent $99 million to settle or dispose of 129,650
asbestos suits, according to company records.
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos was used for decades in protective clothing,
insulations, pipe coatings, fireproofing and many other industrial
uses. Millions of workers in hundreds of industries, including the
oil business, were exposed to the deadly fibers. Fatal
asbestos-related diseases often take more than 20 years after
exposure to manifest themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some citizens groups were critical of the industry's efforts to
push the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   USAction, a health care consumer group affiliated with
organizations including the American Federation of State, County,
and Municipal Employees; the Communication Workers of America, and
the Service Employees International Union, opposes the legislation
and didn't mince words when asked for its view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cheney-led Halliburton Co. has been an integral part of an
asbestos industry which knowingly poisoned its own workers for
years and is still trying to get off the hook. That industry _
which is counting on special treatment from a Bush-Cheney
administration _ has publicly vowed that it will be bringing its
bailout legislation back to Congress next year,'' said William
McNary, president of USAction.
</P>
<P>
   McNary said Halliburton should have settled its claims with the
workers. ``Instead, Cheney chose to gamble that federal legislation
could be passed to allow his company to escape its responsibility
to the people it harmed,'' McNary said.
</P>
<P>
   A blizzard of suits
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court said something had to be done
to break the logjam of asbestos cases clogging the court system.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist said the situation cries out for
a legislative solution.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsors insist it will end the backup of hundreds of
thousands of victims waiting for their day in court and prevent
personal-injury lawyers from pocketing large chunks of the
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition _ mostly unions, victim groups, consumer
coalitions and personal-injury lawyers _ called the legislation the
``Asbestos Industry Relief Act'' because it will prevent thousands
of terminally ill victims from filing suit or holding the industry
accountable for their asbestos-related disease.
</P>
<P>
   The committee debates often turned into an angry circus with
asbestos-industry lawyers accusing the attorneys for those with
asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma with being ambulance
chasers who oppose the legislation because it will eliminate
millions of dollars in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the battle centered on the medical criteria that
the government would use to screen applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The criteria, developed for the most part by asbestos-industry
consultants, was soundly criticized by nationally recognized
pulmonary and cancer specialists, who called the proposed standards
``antiquated,'' ``exclusionary'' and ``barbaric.''
</P>
<P>
   Tears were shed in the committee hearing room as asbestos
victims from Libby, Mont., some clutching tanks of oxygen, told how
hundreds in their tiny town were killed or sickened from asbestos
that contaminated the vermiculite dug from a mine owned by Grace.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, denounced the
legislation, saying it would relieve corporations of their
responsibilities to fairly compensate workers injured by their
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   `Wait 'til next year'
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait 'til next year,'' was the headline of a full-page ad in a
Capitol Hill newspaper for lawmakers. The ad was bought by the
Coalition for Asbestos Resolution, a Washington-based lobbying
group supporting the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing the old Brooklyn Dodgers' battle cry, the coalition
told lawmakers reading Roll Call last week that the industry-funded
group would be back next year to push for passage of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition is funded by the asbestos and construction
industries, with most of its money coming from the GAF Corp., a
private company owned almost entirely by Sam Heyman of Westport,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   GAF Corp., which is leading the lobbying effort against the
bill, has made about $178,500 through its PAC and its employees in
donations to federal candidates from 1997 to the present, of which
about $66,250 went to co-sponsors of the asbestos legislation.
Although Grace has been the target of hundreds of thousands of
suits, its political action committee donated nothing to the bill's
supporters, according to Federal Elections Commission documents.
</P>
<P>
   Millions were spent by both sides _ the asbestos industry and
the trial lawyers _ in lobbying for and against the bill. The
battle got down to the glitzy television ads saturating the home
states of key members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a high-profile, prolonged legislative face-off
over the past year, not only in the Congress but on the airwaves in
Montana, Minnesota and the metropolitan Washington area,'' said
John Bell, a spokesman for the Association of Trial Lawyers of
America. ``We've calculated that Sam Heyman and the asbestos
industry have invested some $20 million in their campaign _ and
although unsuccessful so far, they've outspent us and our allies by
more than 10-to-1.''
</P>
<P>
   Direct donations to the bill's sponsors represent only a part of
the effort to influence Congress. Far more dollars are given for
lobbying expenses, and in ``soft money'' _ donations to party
political action committees that are often funneled to campaigns.
Halliburton has donated at least $282,050 in ``soft money,'' mostly
to state and federal Republican Party committees.

A SUIT OF HIGH-TECH ARMOR TO FOIL LATTER-DAY HIGHWAYMEN

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ We were speeding along in what the
Mercedes-Benz executive at the wheel had promised would be a
two-part demonstration of a new S-Class sedan _ 0-to-30
acceleration, followed by 30-to-0 braking. He did not tell us about
the third part, involving three guys with .44 Magnums who
surrounded the car as it screeched to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   In less time than it takes to say ``faster than a speeding
bullet,'' they fired six shots at the back-seat window next to me.
</P>
<P>
   As you have probably figured out, I survived, but not because I
can deflect bullets like a superhero. The guns were loaded with
soap pellets that left pinkish splotches on the window. But
Mercedes says that if the bullets had been real, the ultrathick
glass and the lightweight armor in the door would have kept me
safe.
</P>
<P>
   I was riding in a production-model armored car, the first that
Mercedes-Benz has brought to this country. The S500 Guard looks
almost the same as a regular S-Class, but has factory-installed
equipment meant to turn an already solid car into a fortress on
wheels. In addition to the body armor and the glass (which Mercedes
says can withstand gunfire if no three shots are closer together
than about 5 inches), the car comes with run-flat tires.
</P>
<P>
   The S500 Guard starts at $153,950, making it the high-priced
entry among factory-built armored cars. BMW's 740iL and 750iL
Protections are $99,400 and $124,400.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are hoping to capitalize on Americans' fear of
highway violence. Mercedes expects to find 1,000 buyers a year; BMW
projects far fewer sales.
</P>
<P>
   Worried drivers can have their old cars armored by companies
that specialize in making body panels Superman-tough, but Mercedes
and BMW are betting that some buyers would rather have factory
equipment. ``Retrofitting means you disassemble and reassemble the
car,'' said Rob Allen, manager of special vehicles for
Mercedes-Benz and the driver in the demonstration. ``Anytime you
have to take a car apart to armor it, when you put it back
together, it's not going to be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said the S500 Guard had 300 armored parts and weighed 800
pounds extra _ not that anyone is likely to notice. ``The
security's as incognito as possible because you do not want to be
reminded of your own vulnerability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So nothing in the car's ``occupant cell'' indicates that the car
withstood 128 bullets in a test to see whether it met European
security-industry standards for ``street violence where the victim
is chosen randomly.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to the S500 Guard than a bullet-resistant
body. The engine has been beefed up to handle the extra weight;
security experts say that one way to foil bad guys is to make a
speedy getaway. The S500 Guard can go from 0 to 60 in 7.3 seconds
(about a second longer than an ordinary S500).
</P>
<P>
   ``No special protection car is impregnable,'' Allen said. ``The
reason you buy a car like this is to get out of trouble. You don't
want to just stand there and take shots.''

BREAKING THE CODE OF LAB BILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 6)  
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a familiar sequence of events to anyone who has spent much
time in a doctor's office. You have blood taken, you call for the
results, you get on with your life _ and then weeks, months or even
years later, you receive a bill from the laboratory or an
explanation-of-benefits letter from your insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   These missives can be maddening, and not only because they
arrive so long after the fact. There is usually no way for a layman
to discern the test in question or which doctor ordered it; all you
see are a few numerical codes. Unless you own the handbook that
explains what ``82947'' stands for, you're at least one phone call
away from an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   I received one of those letters recently _ 14 pages, printed on
both sides, concerning blood tests from a mere two summers ago.
According to Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, my insurer at the
time of the tests, I still owed the laboratory $186.85. I called
the lab, which deciphered the identity of the doctor and test, and
further informed me that I owed nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Two representatives at Empire Blue Cross, whose recent
television ads have promised improved customer service, gave me the
telephonic version of the blank stare. I eventually established
that I am indeed in the clear.
</P>
<P>
   Why do these cryptic letters arrive so late? How are ordinary
people supposed to make sense of them?
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the answer depends on whom you ask.
Laboratories say the blame rests squarely with doctors, who do not
give them all the information needed to process bills. Doctors have
a relationship with their patients, they say, but labs are just
hired guns, processing tests at the doctor's behest and then
issuing bills to insurers and patients.
</P>
<P>
   Lab representatives say they often do not get complete insurance
information or proper diagnostic codes from doctors. As a result,
they say, lab bills are misdirected or are rejected by the
insurance company. ``Our mantra is that we don't see the patient,''
said Joanne Glisson, vice president for governmental relations at
the American Clinical Lab Association, a trade group. ``We really
are like a middleman.'' In other words, at the mercy of the
doctor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors don't see it that way. Dr. Lawrence Ossias, a
hematologist in Manhattan, said he recently stopped using one lab
because of its billing practices. He had contracted to have
services ``bundled'' _ a package deal of sorts for a half-dozen
blood tests. But managed-care companies insisted on itemized bills.
When the claims managers saw the lab's much higher piecemeal rates,
they were ``laughing and paying $20,'' Ossias said _ even less than
the bundled rate he had negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   So, he said, the lab started itemizing its bills to all
patients, apparently hoping that some would pay retail and make up
for the low HMO payments. ``It has been a real nightmare,'' he
said. ``Patients assume their insurance companies have been billed,
and then six months later a bill shows up and they wonder what it
is.'' He found himself having to negotiate with the lab on
patients' behalf, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Hawkins, the president of ClaimsPro, a claims processing
company in Toledo, Ohio, said she could deal with these headaches
better than the labs and doctors could. Her company takes outgoing
bills and screens them, using special software to make sure that
all the coding and other essential information required by insurers
is where it belongs. Bills go out the door within 24 hours after
she receives them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ClaimsPro collects a fee only when the screened bills are paid,
so it is motivated to be accurate and fast. ``A lot of labs do
their billing in-house and are very slow,'' Hawkins said. Companies
like hers, she added, are gaining business as insurer requirements
become more stringent and as coding grows more complex.
</P>
<P>
   What can patients do?
</P>
<P>
   Start by calling the lab to make sure that it has your correct
insurance information. When you receive a bill, follow up and make
sure it is correct; if I had simply paid my bill without question,
I would have dumped nearly $200 out the window. If you are having
extensive tests, go over billing issues with your doctor's office
in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is a limit to how much aggravation you can head
off. ``It is a very frustrating process,'' said David Nichols, vice
president for marketing at Clinical Diagnostic Services in
Englewood, N.J., where my lab work was done. ``Doctors frustrate
labs, labs frustrate patients, patients frustrate insurance
companies. This is what is wrong with health care in a nutshell.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Mercedes-Benz brochure of the 1980s described the marque's
philosophy thus: A Mercedes should not inspire aggressive driving,
but if you find yourself in a bind _ say, roaring into a tight turn
too fast _ the car will get you through. That, at least, was the
gist. The Mercedes was an automotive Clark Kent, serious and
sedate, but ready to fling off its eyeglasses and soar to the
rescue.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing mild-mannered about the Mercedes-Benz of today.
The company boasts of having the fastest sport utility on the road,
the ML55, alongside V-12 sedans and luxury hot rods tweaked by AMG,
its high-performance-tuning operation. Still, the cutting-edge Merc
of today, the CL500 coupe, seems in many ways an evolution of that
previous thinking, not a break with it.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the car is gorgeous, the only true pillarless hardtop in
showrooms today; its roofline is a graceful curve and the
traditional Mercedes grille is swept back into a long hood. The car
that I tested, in almandin black with light java leather, garnered
admiring glances on interstates and even on the jaded streets of
New York.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, it was powerful. Car and Driver magazine found that
the 302 horses of the 5-liter V-8 pushed the two-ton chariot to 60
miles per hour in a scant 6.2 seconds, and through a quarter-mile
in 14.7 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   For those who would dare yawn at that, the CL600 is now arriving
at dealerships, with a supersophisticated V-12 generating 362
horsepower. In November there will be a CL55, a souped-up AMG
version of the V-8 that makes 355 horsepower. Ergo, the car is
striking and fast, and destined to be faster.
</P>
<P>
   So where's Clark Kent?
</P>
<P>
   His legacy lives in the CL500s emphasis on intelligence over
brawn or beauty. If BMW celebrates driving, and Jaguar promotes
sensuality, Mercedes venerates technology _ and its showcase is the
CL. My pleasure in guiding the car on winding, rude backroads of
the Endless Mountains in Pennsylvania came not from speed or
cornering force, though these I tried, but from the way the
electronics and engineering anticipated and mastered every
maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Turn as sharply as you dare, then stomp brutally on the brakes,
and the big machine remains almost mystically level and composed.
The feat is achieved by sophisticated hydraulic plungers at the
four corners that react in split seconds to keep the car
unflappably level no matter what the laws of physics try to do _
there is no dive, no squat, no roll, no wallow, no pitch, no sweat.
</P>
<P>
   When the paving runs out, a gentle nudge of a button nestled in
the burled walnut raises the starship an inch or two above the
nasty pebbles. As you accelerate back onto the highway, the car
snuggles down again to hug the pavement, ready to negotiate
whatever speed you dare.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes calls this system ``active body control,'' or ABC, and
it comes with ESP (electric stability program) and ASR (automatic
slip control). These are only the most impressive of a host of
electronic innovations that put the CL500 at the sharpest edge of
automotive technology.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking here of gizmos that do little besides twinkle
little red lights, but of stuff that really is useful, like the
ultra-low-profile windshield wipers that go on automatically, and
at the right frequency and speed, when they're needed; like the
ventilated and heated seats that can be adjusted 14 ways and _ get
this _ will give front-seat passengers a pulse massage; like the
doors and trunk lid that pull themselves closed; like the
five-speed automatic transmission that can figure out how sporty
the driver is, or that cedes the shifting to him or her. Not all of
this is unique to the CL500, of course, but it's all there in one
car, along with an automatic climate control with charcoal filter,
auto-dimming mirrors, Xenon headlamps, air bags everywhere and
laminated windows that filter infrared rays.
</P>
<P>
   The driver is not even aware of many touches, like aerodynamics
that channel water from the rear window, or the plastic fenders,
aluminum hood and roof and magnesium inner doors that keep the
weight far below that of previous big Mercedes coupes.
</P>
<P>
   To continue in this vein, I should describe how the 10 speakers
of the Bose audio system soothe the soul and whatnot, but that
would be premature. You do not learn on your first spin, or even on
the second, how to manipulate the ``Comand'' system _ the screen
and knobs that control the stereo, navigation computer, telephone
and probably many other things. Even a dedicated gadget lover will
find the centralized controls frustratingly unintuitive. Besides, I
wonder if the best of such systems _ like those operated by
touching the screen _ is truly safe. The glowing maps, messages and
instructions all require looking away from the road for at least a
few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, only the Comand system can be accused of being
distracting. What is impressive is how unobtusive, intuitive and
forgiving the rest of the electronics are. That, I think, is the
true link to the Mercedes philosophy of the 80s, the notion that
one could put more faith in the car's intelligence than in the
driver's. Some of these smarts are discreetly concealed, in the air
bags, the air filters, the adaptive transmission. In other matters,
the driver can override the automation _ by shifting the gears,
turning on the lights, turning off the wipers, switching off the
traction control. But in every instance, the CL500 demonstrates
what electronics can do _ and what, before long, they may be doing
in far lesser cars.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not pretend the ride is cheap. That terrific back massager
is $1,550 extra, and the multicontour seats add $1,050. The rest is
standard, and with $1,000 in gas-guzzler tax and $595 for shipping,
the CL500 I drove came within $300 of $90,000. (The SL600 is
$117,200 plus add-ons; the CL55 will be around $10,000 below that.)
</P>
<P>
   But then, many electronic features that we take for granted,
from engine management to air bags, were exotic extras not so long
ago. Traction control, antilock brakes, electronically controlled
transmissions have become commonplace in inexpensive cars. So who's
to say that a $20,000 sedan won't be giving massages before long?
</P>
<P>
   More intriguing, where will Mercedes go from here? Next year,
the CL is expected to have a cruise control that keeps track of
what the car you are following is up to, and automatically slows
down or speeds up to keep you at a safe distance behind. &QL;

PHILADELPHIA DIARY: A GIG, A BABE TURNED POL, AND THE RAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI and MATTHEW PURDY  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican audiences this week have been prosperous and
vanilla and the stage always a Gap ad of vivid ethnicity. But
sometimes, the models have thoughts of their own.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, a group of children sat at school desks on the
convention-hall podium behind Laura Bush as she addressed the
delegates. On Thursday, at a ``Tribute to Laura Bush'' luncheon,
young performers from Philadelphia's Rainbow Company were her
backdrop in a packed hotel ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   The children were excited, but some members of the troupe, a
musical theater group, seemed to feel more like props for the
Republicans' message of inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how male presidents can understand about
abortion and pregnancy,'' said Katie Gould, 15, before the company
performed for the Bushes, who oppose abortion. ``Like they say
they're not for welfare and they're not for abortion. They've never
experienced it _ not that I have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a show,'' said Will Brock, 27, who plays keyboards for
the group. ``But they've got to do some things to get some votes
they don't usually get, some black and Hispanic votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Martin, the director of the theater, said he liked the
exposure and money from the event and being part of what he called
history. ``I'm certainly not doing it because I believe in the
Republican ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   Some on stage were more coy. Asked if she supported George W.
Bush, Lauren Brown, who just turned 18, smiled politely and said
``I know who I'm voting for, but it's a secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Brooks left the stage thrilled that Governor Bush had
spoken to her, and she said, ``I tend to favor Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   As the performers ended their program with a rousing ``God Bless
America,'' the Bushes worked their way into the middle of the group
so they were surrounded by the children.
</P>
<P>
   Shrugged Brock, the keyboard player, ``It's a gig, man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tale of Two Dans
</P>
<P>
   Pop political quiz: Which Dan is at the Republican National
Convention, Quayle or Rostenkowski?
</P>
<P>
   Guess again. Rosty, the once-powerful Democratic House
leader-turned inmate-turned corporate consultant, is offering
convention commentary for Fox's Chicago television station.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quayle, the once-youthful vice president and surrogate son
of President Bush-turned national amusement-turned political orphan
when a real Bush son emerged, is home in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Through his office in Phoenix, Quayle, who made a brief and
ill-fated bid for the GOP presidential nomination, said he was
making himself scarce to allow the light to shine on George W.
</P>
<P>
   Let's ask a veteran commentator. ``I hate to say this about him,
because he was vice president,'' Rostenkowski said. ``Dan Quayle
was never taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Rostenkowski once was, but at the convention, he said, people
looked at him quizzically. ``I'm just doing a job here,'' he
growled.
</P>
<P>
   For Republican Women Who Rock
</P>
<P>
   Congresswoman Mary Bono's new women's organization _ in a play
on the name of the women's group more typically affiliated with
another political party _ is called Right Now. It made its national
debut with a party Wednesday night at a nightclub called The Five
Spot.
</P>
<P>
   The party was pretty tame: The club typically has a burlesque
show with some nudity every Wednesday, but they canceled it and
hired a swing band in deference to the Republican women.
</P>
<P>
   Bono said she and a couple of friends were sitting around having
a beer last year when they came up with the idea for Right Now.
``We were just talking about how there were young women in the
Republican party who don't really have a place to go. They needed
someplace hipper than the Republican Women's Federation.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Bono's aides described that venerable group as ``the
blue-hairs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we're rock 'n' roll Republicans,'' Bono said, sipping a
vanilla martini. Then she made a whooping sound, like the exuberant
exhalation of a teen-ager at a rock concert, holding a lighter
aloft:
</P>
<P>
   Whooooo!
</P>
<P>
   Bono said that she decided to call the group Right Now because
feminists like Gloria Steinem and Patricia Ireland, the president
of the National Organization for Women, had defended Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, NOW is extremely ticked off at the abuse of
their name. Patricia Ireland, NOW's president, said, ``I think they
will be as successful in starting a grass-roots organization as
they will in holding on to our name. I have sent a notice to our
general counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Derek Conversion
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years can sure change a girl.
</P>
<P>
   Bo Derek used to be the bodacious babe in the movie ``10,''
bouncing along the beach in a macrame bikini that wouldn't provide
enough material for a potholder. In those days, she was an
apathetic California Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward two decades. Bo Derek is now a Republican
operative in a gray pants suit, a stump-speechifying campaign
junkie, a 43-year-old George W. Bush acolyte. Along with Lee
Greenwood, the Rock and Chaka Kahn, she is providing the GOP's
celebrity firepower.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, Derek spoke about her political awakening
and her excitement about appearing at the convention, where she
introduced a California assemblyman on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started out as a Democrat because I had the impression that
they were nicer people,'' she said. ``But I have spent a lot of
time out of the country, and you can't help but compare governments
and see how things function, and you start to see that what works
here is due to Republican policies.''
</P>
<P>
   But Derek differs from the Bush gospel on at least one major
issue: abortion. ``I am pro-choice,'' she said, then brightly
added, ``But I am really, really completely behind George Bush's
ideas about reforming education.''
</P>
<P>
   After the convention, Derek will start filming a new movie,
playing an alcoholic defense lawyer. She's no longer playing beach
babes.
</P>
<P>
   Would she ever run for office?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, but people have asked me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Soggy Scenes of Summer
</P>
<P>
   Don't take it as a sign from God that it rained every day of the
Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   But the weather in Philadelphia sure did contribute to sodden
energy levels by the final day of the Republican convention on
Thursday. California delegates were popping gingko-biloba capsules
to stay alert. Donors and delegates on their way into yet another
PAC party began to complain of gout. On ``Good Morning America,''
Charles Gibson stood on the floor of the convention hall and
pointed out a flashing sign to Diane Sawyer, who was in New York.
It read: We need fresh laundry, Diane!
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday night's grand finale, Kentucky delegate Joey
Stanton was dragging himself to the final happy hour sponsored by
House Whip Tom DeLay's political action committee, aboard a VIP
train car parked outside the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``My back hurts,'' he complained, ``My toenails hurt. My
bellybutton hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Borden of Texas said that friends had e-mailed him saying
he had looked asleep on C-Span.
</P>
<P>
   ``I e-mailed them back saying, `well, you dopes, I should have
looked asleep because I was asleep,''' he said. ``I am dying for
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it takes a grizzled professional to negotiate the
grueling party schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the former presidential candidate, looked spry and
expertly made-up on his way into the PAC party caboose. ``Having
been on the campaign trail, this is duck soup,'' he said.

GAY GROUP EXPECTED TO ENDORSE BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The harsh message to homosexuals at the 1992 GOP
convention was find another party. Unwelcomed, unwanted, and
enraged over Patrick J. Buchanan's vitriolic speech in Houston, a
gay Republican organization refused to endorse President Bush for
reelection.
</P>
<P>
   Friday the Log Cabin Republicans are expected to meet and
endorse Bush's son, George W. Bush. The group's leaders say the
Texas governor has lived up to his commitments _ no prime-time
gay-bashing from the podium in Philadephia, modify antigay language
in the party platform, and give an openly homosexual congressman a
speaking slot at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   What the group did not expect was that Bush would pick as his
running mate Dick Cheney, a conservative who plans to have his gay
daughter, Mary, at his side during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a while you get a moment of great and dramatic
change,'' said Kevin Ivers, national spokesman for the Log Cabin
Republicans. ``Something definitely has happened here. The gay
community has been more visible. More importantly, we have a
nominee that for the first time is reaching out.''
</P>
<P>
   Endorsing Bush was not a given for the gay GOP group. During the
primary season, Bush refused to meet with gay leaders because, he
said, pitting one group against another ``creates kind of a huge
political, you know, nightmare for people.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he clinched the nomination, Bush shifted gears and invited
12 gay leaders to meet with him in Austin. He asked for their
support and pledged to work with Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson,
the platform chairman, to eliminate anti-gay provisions in the
party's statement of principles. He also said ``sexual
orientation'' would not be a factor in appointing people to his
campaign and administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush followed through on the platform, Ivers said. But the
platform committee, controlled by conservative delegates, objected
to the Bush-Thompson draft, which would have eliminated specific
bans on gay marriage and gays in the military and would have given
gays protection under antidiscrimination laws. Ivers said by
putting the blueprint forward and allowing a gay-rights debate in
the platform committee, he was serious about his desire to include
gays in the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The number of openly gay GOP delegates is 18, up slightly from
previous years. More significant for gay Republicans,
Representative Jim Kolbe of Arizona, a homosexual, was invited to
give a speech on international trade, despite objections from
social conservatives and the threat of a walkout by some Texas
delegates if he spoke. During Kolbe's speech, some Texans removed
their cowboy hats and bowed their heads in a silent protest.
</P>
<P>
   The orders against antigay rhetoric during the four-night
convention was another sign that Bush knows to win and govern he
needs to build a coalition broader than the Republicans'
conservative base, Ivers said.
</P>
<P>
   Log Cabin leaders are also hailing Bush for being the first
candidate to name a running mate with an openly gay offspring. Mary
Cheney, 31, is a lesbian who lives in Denver and left her job last
spring as a liaison to the gay community at Coors Brewing. She is
now studying for an MBA at the University of Colorado but is
expected to take a leave to be an aide to her father this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group for gay
rights, held a news conference to question how Bush can oppose
hate-crime legislation, gay marriage, and adoption by gay couples
when the daughter of his running mate is gay and will have a role
in the GOP campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been watching this sunny, rosy, we-love-everybody
convention, but when you get down to what the party stands for, it
harms gay people,'' said David Smith, a spokesman for the
gay-rights group, which has endorsed Democrat Al Gore. ``Mary
Cheney's presence focuses attention on Bush's antigay policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney, the former defense secretary, and Lynne, his wife,
have been very clear they do not want their daughter to become an
issue in this campaign or have her privacy invaded. ``I'm running
for office, and (my children) are entitled to their privacy,''
Cheney said in a broadcast interview this week.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cheney said in a separate interview that she was ``appalled
at the media interest in one of my daughters.'' Reacting shrilly to
a statement that her daughter was a lesbian, Mrs. Cheney said,
``Mary has never declared such a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Cheney has not spoken publicly, but she has been very
visible at the convention. Sitting next to her sister, Elizabeth,
in the front row of the VIP box, Mary Cheney repeatedly jumped to
her feet and applauded during her father's acceptance speech
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush campaign seems very clear and comfortable about
whatever role Mary Cheney wants to play,'' Ivers said. ``What we
are happy to see is a woman who is openly gay and is very much a
part of her family and loved and embraced.''

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The hottest convention in town is perhaps not the
obvious one made up of 15,000 journalists and an occasional
Republican, but rather a more private one unfolding away from the
television lights, one to which admission is based not on politics
but on blood and marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a family reunion,'' Laura Bush explained last month.
Indeed, one of the conveniences of having a family active in
presidential politics is that it offers a unique opportunity for
quadrennial reunions with lots of balloons and confetti. Throngs of
Bushes have been at all the Republican conventions since 1980,
cheering one of their own at each one except for 1996, when they
took a brief break.
</P>
<P>
   This time as well, scores of members of the extended Bush clan
are on hand, mostly staying at the Wyndham Hotel, along with the
candidate himself. Tight security keeps the paparazzi away, but
Karen P. Hughes, the candidate's chief spokeswoman, said the
hallway near her room is full of little Bushes charging up and
down.
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes are less harassed by paparazzi than other prominent
political families, like the Kennedys, but they are also more
reticent, and George W.'s four siblings have mostly refused to give
interviews about him this year. Still, perhaps sensing the friendly
atmosphere, a few have emerged from the cocoon and one _ George P.
Bush, the son of younger brother Jeb _ has become a hot media
property, perhaps the most sought-after member of the clan among
television producers after George W. himself.
</P>
<P>
   George P., who is 24 and was listed by People Magazine as No. 4
on its list of most eligible bachelors, had a formal coming-out
celebration of sorts when he addressed the convention Thursday in a
mix of English and Spanish. His mother was born in Mexico. and the
Bush campaign has used him to try to drum up support among young
people and Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb and George P. together addressed a fund-raising luncheon on
Wednesday for 3,000 people, offering a ``10-best'' list of reasons
George W. should be elected president. These included ``will cut
federal spending by using left-over `From the desk of President
Bush' note pads'' and ``I left a carry-on bag on Air Force One back
in 1992, and I want it back.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention has seemed wary of giving too large a role to
former President Bush, for fear of reinforcing public doubts about
whether his son is his own man. But Barbara Bush was given the
podium to introduce her son on Monday night when the candidate
spoke briefly by satellite from Gettysburg, Pa., and the potential
first lady, Laura, was given the chance to make a major speech on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While George W. has stayed mostly in his hotel since coming to
Philadelphia on Wednesday, watching the proceedings on television
with family members and old buddies _ several of his old fraternity
pals from Yale are also staying at the Wyndham and hanging out with
him and his family _ his parents have dutifully attended most
convention sessions, logging more hours than many delegates. They
sit in a family VIP area just above the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bush sits in the center, regularly leaping up to hug one
relative or another straggling in to join the reunion. George W.'s
twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, have appeared a few times in the
VIP box but have resolutely stayed away from the mobs with
microphones and notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   George and Laura Bush have tried throughout their years in the
Texas governor's mansion and on the campaign trail to retain their
daughters' privacy. Early on, one of the girls was mortified when a
television crew happened to be in the mansion and caught her father
teasing her about a boy who was telephoning for her; ever since,
the Bushes have generally kept the girls away from the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Bush, one of George W.'s younger brothers, has generally
been the least inclined to talk to reporters in recent years,
perhaps because of a general feeling in the clan that the news
media treated him harshly when he was caught up in a
savings-and-loan scandal in his father's administration. But he
appeared briefly on Larry King Live on Wednesday. His younger
brother Marvin, a management consultant in Texas, also gave a brief
television interview.
</P>
<P>
   George W.'s sister, Dorothy, the youngest in the family, is also
here and _ as a Maryland resident _ cast the Maryland delegation's
votes for her brother.
</P>
<P>
   The family members declined to be interviewed and have generally
been wary of the national press, partly because of a feeling that
reporters mistreated President Bush in 1992 and tend to be mocking
of George W. today. But the Bushes all have plenty of training and
practice in looking like a loving, model family when the cameras
are focused on the VIP box (and probably when they are not, as
well).
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, when President Bush was running for the White House,
his advisers were worried that his Democratic rival, Michael S.
Dukakis, came across as more lovey-dovey with his wife than
President Bush did with his. ``I'm being advised to do that, reach
out, hold Bar's hand,'' President Bush grumbled in a diary entry
quoted in his memoirs, and he included a note that he wrote to his
wife:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweetsie, Please look at how Mike and Kitty do it. Try to be
closer in, more _ well er romantic _ on camera. I am practicing the
loving look, and the creeping hand. Yours for better TV and more
demonstrable affection. Your sweetie-pie coo-coo. Love `ya. G.B.''

AFTER CURBING DONATIONS, COMPANIES FIND NEW WAYS TO COURT KEY
REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ When General Motors became the first corporation
to voluntarily stop writing large checks to political parties in
1997, the automaker's executives sent a powerful message that they
were disgusted by the political culture of cash and influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the principle,'' said GM's vice chairman, Harry J.
Pearce, after announcing the decision in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, GM has stuck to its pledge to forswear soft money,
the unrestricted gifts, after donating $750,000 to political
parties in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But outside the convention hall and around town this week, the
nation's largest automaker demonstrated that it has hardly
abandoned the campaign finance arena, finding different ways to
curry favor with current _ and possibly future _ Republican
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   GM provided 400 Cadillacs, sport utility vehicles and minivans
for use by the organizers of the Republican National Convention,
part of a package of ``in-kind contributions'' that the host
committee here estimated was worth $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday, GM sponsored two lunch receptions at different
downtown locales _ one honored House Speaker Dennis Hastert and the
other saluted Lawrence B. Lindsey, the chief economic adviser to
the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 30 corporations that have eschewed soft money,
GM is not the only company here to play the political influence
game without handing out checks.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner, which stopped making soft money donations last
year, was one of the sponsors of a gaudy packed party on Wednesday
night at the nightclub Shampoo to honor a House entertainment task
force.
</P>
<P>
   GM's receptions were less flashy but attracted more high-powered
political stars.
</P>
<P>
   At the lunch at the Philadelphia Naval Yard, GM designers showed
off the newest prototypes, called concept cars, for Hastert, an
unabashed automobile buff. The speaker was joined by members of the
House Transportation Committee and was given a miniature replica of
a vintage GM truck, a 1950 Chevrolet Bullnose pickup, that he is
restoring at home in Illinois. The menu was seared tuna, red wine
and strawberry souffle.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch, Hastert squeezed into several of the concept cars
on display, including a voice-activated Buick.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are leading the way and creating the transportation system
that is leading the world,'' Hastert told GM executives. ``We
salute you and your industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, across town, GM and GMAC Financial Services held a
brunch honoring Lindsey, the lead economic adviser to Bush who is
also a consultant to GMAC and a board member of its subsidiary,
Escrow Bank U.S.A. of Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The brunch allowed GM to showcase its relationship with Lindsey.
In his introduction, John Finnegan, the chairman of GMAC, hailed
Lindsey as ``one of the best economic minds in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   After speaking to a group of 100 GM executives, lobbyists and a
few House members, Lindsey seemed surprised when he was asked if it
was appropriate for the automaker to sponsor the brunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had a three-year relationship with GM,'' Lindsey, 46,
said. ``It's a natural thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Several GMAC vice presidents drew a distinction between the
corporation's discarded practice of making soft-money donations and
their current practice of holding receptions for consultants and
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the game we like to play,'' a GMAC senior vice
president, Scott Rombach, said of the practice of giving soft
money. ``But this is different.''
</P>
<P>
   Another GMAC vice president, Jim Farmer, said, ``This is just a
kind gesture to Larry.''
</P>
<P>
   With much fanfare last November, Time Warner announced it would
no longer make soft money donations. The company's chairman, Gerald
Levin, said much of the soft money had been used for misleading and
negative advertising that had cheapened political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Late on Wednesday night, Time Warner's raucous party was
attended by about 1,000 lobbyists, House staff members and
journalists. As thousands of free drinks were served and the
singers Jon Secada and Celia Cruz performed, the attendees toasted
Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., and the House Entertainment Industry Task
Force, a loose coalition of House members whose decisions affect
the media and entertainment industries.
</P>
<P>
   The party was also sponsored by News Corp., Seagram/Universal
Studios, the Recording Industry Association of America, the Motion
Picture Association of America, Viacom and Walt Disney Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Adler, a senior vice president at Time Warner, did not
return telephone calls Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Another party sponsor, Viacom, the parent of CBS, gives
virtually no soft money to political parties, but its political
action committee contributes sizable sums to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, several corporations have stopped giving soft
money because their executives have said that they had found better
uses for their resources, such as lobbying, building political
action committees and sponsoring fund-raising events. Some
executives have complained that it was harder to justify the
expense of large contributions to shareholders because the
membership fees of the parties' most elite donor clubs had outpaced
the rate of inflation, jumping this year to $250,000 from $100,000
.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at other corporations that sponsored parties and
receptions this week said they believed the events are most
effective at marketing the corporate brand-names to
convention-goers.
</P>
<P>
   Providing 400 vehicles to the host committee is ``a great
product exposure opportunity for us,'' said William Noack, a GM
spokesman attending the convention. ``We also do it for the
Olympics and events like that.''

SHARES END BROADLY HIGHER TO RECOVER FROM EARLY SKID 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks pulled out of an early skid and rallied to
finish broadly higher on Thursday, with the technology-dominated
Nasdaq composite index posting a hefty 2.8 percent gain after being
down as much as 3.8 percent in the first half hour.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index and Dow Jones industrial
average traced similar but less pronounced patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attributed the sharp reversal to a combination of
bargain-hunting, Motorola's denial of a report that it had cut its
estimate of cellular telephone production, and a surge of
confidence that the government's monthly report on jobs and pay, to
be released on Friday morning, would make the Federal Reserve less
likely to raise short-term interest rates when it meets on Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is still searching for technological investment,'' said
Ned Riley Jr., chief investment officer at State Street Advisors in
Boston. He cautioned, however, that the Federal Reserve will sooner
or later succeed in curbing economic growth and that when it does,
high-technology businesses will be hurt as well as traditional,
more cyclical, companies.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor stocks were under particular selling pressure on
Thursday morning after Kulicke &AMP; Soffa, a top maker of equipment
for assembling chips, warned of deferred orders. Its shares slumped
to 13 9/16 and recovered only to 16 5/8, down 5{. Credence Systems
was among other industry losers, falling 9 49/64, to 39.
</P>
<P>
   But other technology stocks regained all their lost ground and
then some, with Cisco Systems, the most highly valued company after
General Electric, slipping to 58{ before rallying to close at 64
3/8, up 3 7/16. Cisco is to report its quarterly results on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index ended the day with a gain of 101.42
points, at 3,759.88. This shrank its loss so far this year to 7.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500 advanced 13.86 points, or nearly 1 percent, to
1,452.56, paced by Cisco, Oracle, Intel, Sun Microsystems, EMC and

 &HT;    Study finds bastion of bias: Y'all with an accent need not apply
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A heavy regional accent, including a Southern drawl,
works against job candidates, a University of North Texas study
concludes.
</P>
<P>
   A New Jersey participant in the study was ranked by potential
hirers as the least employable of 10 men from various regions of
the United States. Although he had a doctoral degree, he was
perceived as uneducated and hostile.
</P>
<P>
   The second-lowest ranking went to a North Georgia man, who was a
doctoral candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Accent bias is often subtle but has significant impact, the
study found.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters in the study regarded people with Southern drawls,
for instance, as stupid and assigned them to jobs where they had
little contact with the public. ``You mean to tell me if somebody's
a cardiologist and you need surgery, you're going to deny your life
just because he's got an accent?'' reacted Lee Pederson, an Emory
University linguist.
</P>
<P>
   ``After spending my professional career studying dialects in the
North and South, I find it offensive that observers are making
incorrect observations about people's speech,'' Pederson said.
</P>
<P>
   Although other studies have focused on attitudes toward accents,
the Texas study is believed to be the first related to people's
getting jobs.
</P>
<P>
   North Texas researcher Patricia Cukor-Avila said bias against
people with noticeable accents has become ``an acceptable form of
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   The study had 56 executives with hiring authority listen to
recordings of 10 men reading the same 45-second passage. The
speakers were from Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, Louisiana,
Alabama, California, Texas and North Carolina, in addition to
Georgia and New Jersey. All of the speakers were college-educated.
The executives hire people for white-collar jobs in banking,
telecommunications, government, agriculture, higher education and
other fields.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring executives perceived the man from Georgia as friendly
and said he would do well in a job with little public contact.
</P>
<P>
   A Californian and Minnesotan in the group ranked high mostly
because their accents were neutral, researcher Dianne Markley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ties in to the fact that in the U.S., we tend to go for
nondescript accents based on those of national broadcasters and
actors,'' said Cukor- Avila.

YUGOSLAVS HOLD 4 WESTERNERS IN ARMS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ The Yugoslav army said Thursday that it
had arrested two Britons and two Canadians in Montenegro, accusing
them of possessing weapons and explosives, in what appeared to be
another effort to stimulate fears of Western encirclement before
elections next month.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second arrest of four foreigners reported this week
by Yugoslav authorities. Four Dutchmen whose detention was
disclosed on Monday were seized last month on Serbia's border with
Montenegro, reportedly because they were trying to kill President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The army said Thursday that the Britons and Canadians were
employees of the NATO-led forces in Kosovo and were suspected of
training pro-Western secessionists in Montenegro, Serbia's tiny
sister republic, to commit ``terrorist actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges were rejected by British and Canadian forces, who
said the four were simply returning from a weekend vacation in
Montenegro to nearby Kosovo, the Serbian province that NATO-led
forces now control, and were not carrying arms or explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest follows days of Serbian and Yugoslav army statements
about the need to preserve Yugoslavia, which is made up of Serbia
and Montenegro. Belgrade has accused the West of training the
Montenegrin police in preparation for Montenegro's secession, and
the charges today appear to fit that pattern.
</P>
<P>
   President Milo Djukanovic of Montenegro has broken with
Milosevic, talks of an independent Montenegro and is openly
supported by the West. Milosevic controls the Yugoslav army in
Montenegro, while Djukanovic controls the police, which he has
built up with Western help.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats fear that Milosevic is not merely creating a
sense of threat to help his election campaign, but may also be
laying the groundwork for military or police action in Montenegro
to bring down Djukanovic.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   NATO provided Montenegro a security guarantee in its air war
against Serbia last year. But that guarantee is no longer in place.
NATO and Western officials regularly warn Milosevic not to move
against Montenegro. But they do not specify what NATO might do
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has called federal, local and presidential elections
for Sept. 24. Djukanovic has resisted calls by the Clinton
administration to participate in them and, together with the
Serbian opposition, try to defeat Milosevic. Djukanovic argues that
to participate after recent constitutional changes forced through
by Milosevic would only legitimize the elections, which Milosevic
is widely expected to rig.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has also been unable to persuade Vuk Draskovic,
leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement, the single largest
opposition party in Serbia, to participate in the elections. But
Draskovic appears to be willing to have his party run for local
offices and at least support a unified opposition candidate for the
presidency, if one can be agreed on.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic presents himself as the best defender of Serbs against
outside enemies and paints his opposition as traitors in the pay of
the Western countries that bombed Yugoslavia last year and took
over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats regard the arrest of the four men near the
Montenegro-Kosovo border sometime between Monday night and Tuesday
morning as a ploy for domestic purposes. In a statement faxed to
news agencies in Belgrade, the Yugoslav army said, ``There are
indications the foreign citizens arrested trained special units of
the Interior Ministry in the Republic of Montenegro and are
specialists in demolition and performing terrorist actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Britons _ Adrian Pragnell, 41, and John Yore, 31 _ work
in Kosovo training police officers at the police academy, said
their employer, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which is based in Vienna. A spokeswoman for the
organization, Melissa Fleming, said in a telephone interview that
the two men were unarmed, and that they had been taking a ``weekend
excursion'' to Montenegro and were to return to England on Sept. 4,
after a year in Kosovo. Fleming said descriptions of the men as
experts on explosives were ``absolutely absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   The office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe in Kosovo has warned its employees not to travel to
Montenegro, but it is not clear that all employees received the
warning, Fleming said. It is possible that the four arrested men do
not have visas for Yugoslavia, she said, ``but probably that's the
extent of their wrongdoing.'' The organization does not know where
the men are being held, she added.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians _ Shaun Going, 45, and his nephew Liam Hall, 19 _
had also gone to Montenegro from Kosovo for a weekend break,
employees told Agence France-Presse in Pristina. Going owns
Meridian Resources, a construction company with headquarters in
Calgary, Alberta. For a year, he has been running its office in
Pristina, where the company has 20 contracts, mostly with the
NATO-led forces. Going was said to be friendly with the Britons and
was traveling with them.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Yugoslav authorities played a videotape at a news
conference that showed the Dutchmen arrested in August confessing
to the charges of plotting to kidnap or assassinate Milosevic and
the former Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic.

BUSH BROADCASTS A SENSE OF POSSIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ With a rousing speech in a jubilant hall,
Governor George W. Bush stoked his party's hunger to reclaim the
White House but laid bare the principal question of the day: Does
the politics of contentment require a politics without content?
</P>
<P>
   For a week this question lingered in the hot air of
Philadelphia. All recognized its presence. None dared answer it. No
historical precedent offered a guidepost. But in an era of good
feelings _ a period almost without politics _ the Republicans'
newly minted presidential nominee went with his instincts. He
determined that what the American people want most is a good
feeling about their leaders and then he set out to provide it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole convention can be called the politics of
pleasantry,'' said Frank I. Luntz, a Republican pollster.
``Everybody is so gosh-darn nice.''
</P>
<P>
   The niceness was almost everywhere. Specifics, however, were
scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speech, a celebration of American diversity and American
promise, was full of well-rounded rhetoric (he spoke of using
``good times for great goals'') and big promises (he vowed to
extend American prosperity ``to every forgotten corner of this
country.'') It drew on the optimism of Ronald Reagan and the
idealism of John F. Kennedy. It mixed, in its way, the faith in the
American people that was a hallmark of Jimmy Carter with the
unpretentious utilitarianism that marked the short presidency of
Gerald R. Ford.
</P>
<P>
   But in his speech and in his route to the GOP nomination, Bush
showed himself to be nothing less than an American original.
</P>
<P>
   He is a classic late bloomer, but he showed Thursday night that
the late-flowering bloom can be brilliant in its impact. He is the
son of a political family, but he showed that his gifts _ not the
patrician rectitude of his grandfather but a breezy sense of
possibility, not the establishment sense of duty of his father but
a fresh sense of opportunity _ were his own.
</P>
<P>
   The last century was blighted by the dictators' cult of
personality. This century _ inaugurated in the United States by
Bill Clinton _ is more about the pop culture of personality. The
language of the Bush acceptance speech may have been about
overhauling the public schools, strengthening Social Security,
safeguarding Medicare, providing prescription-drug benefits, but
the tone, timbre and delivery were much more about personality than
about the policy nuances of any of those things.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has a remarkable personality. In a week's worth
of festivities, speeches, fund-raisers, caucuses, coffees and
casual street meetings, the Republicans spoke more of who their
nominee is than of what he would do with power. Part of who he is,
of course, is that he is not Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the threads that ran through this week's sessions and that
were prominent in his acceptance speech indicated that there was
more of Bill Clinton to George W. Bush than either man is likely to
acknowledge. Clinton rose to power and kept it by becoming a
burglar in the Republicans' policy mansion. He broke in and stole
their dedication to balancing the budget. He muscled his way in and
made off with their determination to overhaul welfare.
</P>
<P>
   And the Texas governor, in his speech, did to his rivals just
what the onetime governor of Arkansas did. He broke into the
Democrats' home and made off with the silverware of education, the
flatware of Social Security, the jewels of the poverty fight. He
tucked them into his coat pockets, swaggered onto the stage and
brandished them as his own.
</P>
<P>
   At one point he even borrowed their language, saying, as Robert
F. Kennedy might have, that prosperity remains beyond the reach of
too many Americans. ``We are their country, too,'' the governor
said. ``And each of us must share in its promise, or that promise
is diminished for all.''
</P>
<P>
   The lift of the driving dream, so much a part of American
political rhetoric, was there in the form of the simple statement,
``Americans live on the sunrise side of the mountain.'' That is a
part of the Bush personality that was unknown until this speech. It
is the part of the Bush personality _ more than the smile, which
beguiles the listener, or the casual manner, which wins over the
crowd _ that might scare the Democrats the most.
</P>
<P>
   What was missing, however, was a staple of the Republican
political repertoire for three-quarters of a century: What will it
cost? How will it work? Where can you find the support for it?
</P>
<P>
   All week long the Democrats have wondered how they might respond
to the Republicans' convention. They have 10 days to contemplate
their answer. But part of it might be those kind of questions, the
kind the Republicans used to throw so scornfully at them.

SEC TO REVISE PROPOSED RULE RESTRICTING CORPORATE DISCLOSURES
</HEADLINE>
  By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite an outpouring of support from individual investors and
consumer groups, federal securities regulators are still scrambling
to revise a proposed rule against selective disclosure of corporate
information before it comes up for a vote next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is scheduled to vote on
Aug. 10 on the new rule, designed to prevent corporate officials
from sharing important information only with limited groups of big
investors or Wall Street analysts. People close to the commission
said they expected the rule, a pet project of Arthur Levitt, the
chairman of the commission, to be passed over the vocal opposition
of investment banks and brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt has repeatedly said that by ``feeding'' information to
analysts before the rest of the investing public, some corporations
have put ``a stain on our markets.'' Two of the three other
commissioners have expressed concerns about particular aspects of
the proposed rule.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure passage, these people said, the commission is
rewriting the rule to make clear that senior executives will not be
punished for sharing information with reporters and bond-rating
agencies and that lower-level employees will remain as free as they
are now to talk to people outside their companies. The commission
also is making changes to protect executives from civil lawsuits
over public disclosures of corporate information.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is exempting information gathered by reporters to
appease some critics in the media, including Dow Jones &AMP; Co., the
publisher of The Wall Street Journal. Dow Jones objected to the
rule, arguing that it could restrict the ability of reporters to
gather information from company executives.
</P>
<P>
   Peter G. Skinner, executive vice president and general counsel
for Dow Jones, said Thursday that he had heard that the company's
concerns had been addressed, but he declined to comment before
seeing a revised version of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has received thousands of letters and e-mail
messages expressing support for the rule from individual investors,
as well as the Consumer Federation of America, the Council of
Institutional Investors and the Financial Executives Institute. On
Thursday, the AFL-CIO said its investment officers supported the
rule.
</P>
<P>
   One group that has not been appeased is the Securities Industry
Association, the main trade group for Wall Street firms. On
Thursday, the association reiterated its strong opposition to the
proposed rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental problem with this is that, with the best of
intentions, it will end up hurting investors,'' said Stuart
Kaswell, general council for the association. ``They're taking a
swing at Wall Street and they're going to hit investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaswell said that the rule would do more harm than good because
it would sharply curtail communications between company executives
and analysts and, in turn, the investors those analysts advise.
Analysts no longer will be able to meet privately with corporate
executives and try to ``ferret out'' information that may be useful
to investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will have what amount to presidential-style press
conferences where corporate officials will be able to answer as
much or as little as they care to answer,'' Kaswell said. ``The
chance to ask hard-hitting questions in private will go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Kaswell, Joseph McLaughlin, a securities lawyer at Brown &AMP;
Wood in New York, argues that the rule will put a chill on
corporate communications. ``The natural thing to do is to be
extremely careful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But groups representing major corporations, such as the Business
Roundtable, have not stood in the commission's way. ``We talked a
lot about whether there would be a chilling effect,'' said Philip
Livingston, chief executive of Financial Executives Institute. ``We
didn't really think so.''
</P>
<P>
   To protect reporters' ability to gather news, the commission
plans to spell out who cannot receive material information from
corporate officials that is not available to the general public.
That group of recipients will be limited to include securities
analysts, brokers, mutual fund managers and other big investors.
The association opposes that change, Kaswell said, because
brokerage firms regard news reporters as competitors in a race to
gather valuable information about companies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is standard practice at most companies to hold
separate meetings and conference calls for analysts and for
reporters. Privately, some securities regulators say the Wall
Street firms are fighting to maintain the advantage they have in
gathering information from companies whose stocks they rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the fear is that information is being given out
selectively as a way of keeping analysts in check,'' said Harvey
Goldschmid, a law professor at Columbia University who helped draft
the proposed rule when he was the commission's general counsel.
``Fundamentally, for the average person, there will be a sense of
the markets being fairer.''

AFTER TWO MONTHS OF REFINING, BUSH FINDS JUST THE WORDS TO MATCH
HIS STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ If it had been up to his speechwriter, Gov.
George W. Bush would have planned to open his remarks Thursday
night by thanking the delegates here for ``the honor of this
hour.''
</P>
<P>
   But that felt too lofty to the Texas governor, too fancy and
formal. And so, as he scribbled in margins, sounded out sentences
and ushered the most important address of his political career
through 17 drafts, Bush deleted the last three words of that
phrase, ending the sentence with ``honor.'' It was closer to the
way he normally spoke, and closer to the way he felt.
</P>
<P>
   He used the last few weeks before his big moment to nip, tuck,
find an extraneous passage here, a vaguely redundant sentence
there. At about 4,300 words, his full remarks had been well within
the range of prior convention speeches. But Bush, with his
self-professed disdain for pretension and pomposity, made certain
that the address was trimmed to about 3,900 words, believing that
shorter was better, and truer to who he was.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the generally worded proposals and beneath the
emphatically stated priorities, Bush's planned speech Thursday
night was in many ways a glimpse into the way he thinks and feels.
According to the campaign's chief speechwriter, Michael Gerson, and
other aides who worked with Bush on the remarks, he tended to elect
simple statements over ornate locutions, the epigrammatic over the
elongated, words he felt comfortable saying over words that
challenged him, clarity over ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted images, he wanted things shorter, he wanted things
more concrete,'' said Gerson, who has been writing Bush's biggest
speeches for nearly a year and a half. The campaign did not, as is
sometimes the case, recruit outside help for this address. Like
most endeavors in Bush's political world, this process was kept
close to home, among the tried and trusted.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not practice it in front of focus groups or strangers,
advisers said, although he did practice it often over the last two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He read it aloud in front of senior campaign officials, taking
pointers from Karen Hughes, his communications director, and Mark
McKinnon and Stuart Stevens, who make the commercials for the
campaign. He toted a teleprompter into the living room of a private
house in Cincinnati and then into the dining room of the
Pennsylvania governor's mansion in Harrisburg, subjecting friends
in both places to his trial runs.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's speech may well be a hallmark of Bush's maturation as
a candidate, in that the advance text reflects a degree of
diligence and level of preparation not always evident on the
campaign trail over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   He looked at the first draft two months ago, and ordered changes
and more changes until the end. He pestered aides well outside of
office hours with his latest thoughts. As Gerson spoke with a New
York Times reporter over breakfast early last week, his cell phone
rang, and it was the boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirteen is just spelling errors and punctuation,'' Gerson
told Bush, explaining what had been corrected and amended since the
12th draft. ``We'll make sure that we get 14 ready for the
teleprompter.''
</P>
<P>
   After hanging up, Gerson said that Bush, who had called from his
Texas ranch, wanted the reporter to know that ``he's been thinking
so hard, the deer have started talking to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Those animals were apparently urging concision, simplicity,
``making our eloquence more direct,'' as Gerson said. What Bush and
his campaign strategists wanted was something that balanced the
formality of the occasion with the informality of his personal
style, that fit within the limits of his talents as an orator.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush was very much a part of the production.
</P>
<P>
   He pruned an array of phrases near the top. At the end of a
sentence that began ``together, we will,'' Gerson attached a
lengthy litany of goals. Bush distilled them into a single phrase,
``renew America's purpose'' that echoed existing slogans from his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gerson initially offered several paragraphs of examples of the
sacrifices of the World War II generation, which Bush had wanted to
honor. Bush was not content until the tribute had been boiled down
to a few sentences and a central sentiment: That these brave men
had ``stormed beaches, liberated concentration camps and delivered
us from evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerson, trying to make the case that good times are as crucial
as bad, wrote that ``a time of crisis is a test of strength, a time
of prosperity is a test of vision.'' But that was neither active
nor specific enough for Bush, who kept pressing and pressing until
Gerson came up with this: ``Prosperity can be a tool in our hand,
used to build and better our country, or it can be a drug in our
system, dulling our sense of urgency, of empathy, of duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the theme that the baby boom generation had squandered
some of its opportunities and surrendered to irresponsible impulses
was present from the first draft, Bush wanted that notion turned
into a motif, with recurring allusions to a privileged generation's
unrealized obligation to give something back.
</P>
<P>
   Inasmuch as Bush can be said to have intellectual obsessions,
this had always been one, but there was another reason to hammer
home this argument. It represented an implicit indictment of
President Clinton, and an implicit pitch to start anew in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Although Thursday night's speech was much more than a culling
and cobbling together of Bush's stump speeches to date, the
candidate did revert to familiar phrases.
</P>
<P>
   An early draft by Gerson included the sentiment that
``congregations are responsible not only to worship, but to
serve.'' Bush was not accustomed to using that first word, and one
of the first times he read a version of the speech aloud he
spontaneously changed it to ``churches, synagogues and mosques,''
words he had used in dozens of previous remarks. Aides duly
inserted the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to be able to say the words in a comfortable way,''
said Hughes, who provided extensive help with the editing. Hughes,
who has worked with Bush since 1994, knew his voice as well as he
did, and often came to Gerson to single out the same passage the
governor had as something that did not sound like him.
</P>
<P>
   But as involved as the governor was, he did not let the gravity
of the task eclipse the levity to which he is perpetually inclined.
</P>
<P>
   When he walked onto the convention stage on Wednesday to check
out where he would be standing for his big moment, he made a widely
grinning, grandly gesticulating show of pointing to ushers, waving
to supporters and calling out familiar names, even as his
straight-faced entourage busily went about checking the lighting
and sound.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday afternoon, when reporters scrutinized Bush's
latest thoughts about Thursday night, he said he was going to
``power through'' bursts of applause to keep the remarks moving
along, and that he had given a more important speech ``when I asked
my wife to marry me.'' Aides said Bush was determined to take a nap
later in the afternoon, because the scheduled time for the
beginning of his remarks shortly after 10 p.m. was past his usual
bedtime.

 &HT;    Who is the next Ted Williams?
 &HT;    By Joe Capozzi
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ About a year ago, Ted Williams sat down
to breakfast with some guests at his Hernando home. There were a
couple of New Hampshire state troopers who were longtime friends
and a few others, but the Hall of Famer didn't notice the slender
kid with the ballcap pulled close to his bird's-beak nose.
</P>
<P>
   Between bites of eggs and fruit, the baseball talk started
flowing. Someone asked Williams what he thought of the young
shortstop for the Boston Red Sox, Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great hitter. Graceful. Powerful,'' replied Williams, 81,
the last man to hit. 400. ``And if anyone can hit .400 again, it's
Garciaparra.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the table, Garciaparra flipped off his cap and grinned.
The table erupted in laughter. Good thing you complimented the kid,
someone joked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, it's the truth,'' said Williams, who was 23 when he hit
.406 in 1941. ``If anyone can do it, this guy can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into Saturday, Garciaparra, 27, was batting .398 with two
months left in the season. Plenty of hitters over the years have
had high averages in August only to see them fall to more human
levels come September.
</P>
<P>
   But in this era of Cartoon Baseball, many are wondering whether
the same elements that have altered the home-run records will lead
to the first .400 hitter in nearly 60 years _ and whether that
hitter just might be Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought a few years ago that Tony Gwynn was the only guy,''
said George Brett, who in 1980 made the most serious run in 39
years, batting .400 as late as Sept. 19 before finishing at .390.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the numbers are so inflated right now. You had Roger
Maris' (single-season home run) record stand for so long and now
guys are flying past it. Pretty soon somebody is going to get on a
hot streak. I definitely think someone else is going to do it. It's
going to happen, but it's going to be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   ADVANTAGE TO THE HITTERS
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be tough, all right. Hitters travel to different
time zones, see more than just one pitcher per game and face a
crush of media. But there are advantages that didn't exist in the
days of Ty Cobb and Teddy Ballgame: diluted pitching from expansion
and stronger, better-conditioned players _ benefiting from
advancements such as laser eye surgery, nutritional supplements and
year-round strength programs _ hitting with smaller strike zones in
smaller ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of good hitters out there,'' said pitcher
Randy Johnson of the Arizona Diamondbacks, ''but I don't know if
anyone will (hit .400 again). I think it might be more difficult
now because there are so many specialty pitchers coming out of the
bullpen. They get to face up to four different pitchers in a game,
all coming with different stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are signs that the road to .400 may not be an
impossible journey. Darin Erstad, a left-handed hitter for the
Anaheim Angels, is on pace to break the single-season record for
hits (257 in 1920 by George Sisler, who hit .407 that year).
</P>
<P>
   And entering the All-Star break, 11 players _ six in the
National League and five in the American League _ were batting .350
or higher. Only twice in the past 10 seasons have as many as seven
players been hitting that high by the All-Star break, according to
the Elias Sports Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's average stood at .389 at the break, followed by
Colorado's Todd Helton at .384. In 1993, John Olerud was hitting
.395 and Andres Galaragga .391 at the break. A year later, Larry
Walker was at .398.
</P>
<P>
   Still, only two players since 1941 have hit .400 into August _
Olerud in 1993 and Brett in 1980. And for Garciaparra to finish the
season at .400, he would have to at least match his best career
numbers for August (.372 in 1997) and September (.393 in 1999).
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting .400 is probably the closest to impossible feat there
is,'' said Braves third baseman Chipper Jones, the reigning NL MVP.
``Some guys hit .400 for a month. That's a hot month. You stay hot
for six or seven months, that's unheard of. Guys just don't do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   GETTING BREAKS ESSENTIAL
</P>
<P>
   Wade Boggs did it. For a span of 162 games, he hit .404 _ from
May 1985 to May 1986. (Boggs finished 1985 at .368 and 1986 at
.357.) But Boggs, now retired and working in the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays' front office, and Williams are among those who do not
subscribe to the theory that the Power Ball-era elements will spike
batting averages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think home runs and average are conducive to one
another. You can go one for five with a home run and hit 65 home
runs and not hit for average,'' Boggs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for someone to hit .400, you have to enter September
hitting .420. And even then, the only way to hit .400 is to barely
qualify for the title, have the minimum number of at-bats or be
injured part of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how Brett's season went in 1980, when he missed 45 games
because of injuries, including an ankle injury that sidelined him
for six weeks. By Aug. 30, with his average at .406, Williams and
Maris were saying they thought Brett could hit .400.
</P>
<P>
   In that final month of 1980, Brett recalled, the pressure
finally got to him. He was hounded by reporters. The ball no longer
looked like a cantaloupe. Fielders seemed to rob him of hits with
great defensive plays.
</P>
<P>
   He went 4 for his next 27, dropping to .384, then went on to get
10 hits in his next 19 at-bats to finish with the highest average
since Williams in '41.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dealing with the media was tough,'' Brett recalled. ``Whoever
is going to do it, that last month of the season is going to be
hard to deal with. I'm still getting calls on (the 1980 season) 20
years later.''
</P>
<P>
   POWER VS. AVERAGE
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the question of whether players want to hit .400 _
and accept all of the baggage that comes with it. Garciaparra
refuses to talk about numbers and insists he doesn't pay attention
to where his average is.
</P>
<P>
   In the record-breaking home-run season of 1998, there was a
feeling players were more infatuated with power than for average.
``Big home-run hitters are being paid a lot of money,'' Mike
Hargrove, then managing the Cleveland Indians, told a reporter that
year, ``and I think a lot of people are concentrating on homers.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the skeptics agree that few offensive records, power or
average, are safe anymore. ``I never thought I'd see major-league
players hit .370 with 55 home runs and 160 RBI,'' Brett said.
``That just didn't happen when I played, and I've only been out of
the game since 1993.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Boggs, ``I don't think anybody can say 'never' about
anybody, not when you have Sammy Sosa hitting 60 home runs for two
years in a row and never leading the league. That's
mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Many agree that a left-handed hitter would have the best shot at
.400. Because most pitchers are right-handed, a left-handed hitter
more often than not has a better view of the pitch. However, these
same people think the right-handed Garciaparra is a hitter who
might have the intangibles to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's unreal,'' Boston pitcher Pedro Martinez said
Friday after Garciaparra went 3-for-4 in Oakland. ``I've never seen
anybody _ never, ever _ any pitch, any count, you can whip it up
there and he can hit it. I just pray to God he stays healthy. I've
seen something very weird in Nomar's bat and he only seems to hit
the ball with the barrel of the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, whose Braves played the Red Sox this month, was impressed
at the way Garciaparra was able to hit breaking balls going away
from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He keeps everything so simple,'' Jones said. ``He's got very
little movement. His mechanics are perfect. He's got a perfect
swing. He plays in a great ballpark where he can hit 290-foot
doubles all day. But he doesn't just try to do that. He'll take the
ball the other way. He's got some juice to all fields. He's very
quick to figure out what a pitcher's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's why the last man to hit .400 says he thinks
Garciaparra will be the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nomar is going to do it. He's going to hit .400,'' Williams
said in a phone interview Saturday. ``I'm predicting that on the
record and I've been saying that for a while. He has the instinct
and the patience and the discipline, and the proof is in the
average.''

   &UR; GOP CONVENTION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN DIAZ, Editorial Page Editor &QC;  &LR; 
 &UR; c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle &LR;  &QC; 
 &QL; 
GOP TO YOUTH: DO AS WE SAY, NOT AS WE DO
</P>
<P>
   This is the way it is in Politics 2000. Subtlety and specifics _
or risky ideas _ are for losers. So are worries about perceptions
about how much it costs to include a member of Congress in your
foursome for golf.
</P>
<P>
   Message is everything _ get the money and get the images on
television. Republicans here were hoping the nation would hardly
notice that the welcoming theme of inclusion from a parade of
diverse speakers was contradicted by hard-line remnants in the
party platform.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Colin Powell's eloquent opening night call against
``preferences for special interests'' failed to lighten the crush
at all the corporate-sponsored parties for delegates. The best
skyboxes in the house remained reserved for the ``Regents,'' the
title bestowed on the 137 people and companies who have contributed
at least $250,000 this election.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be considered gauche for a
politician to raise money at a convention. Not anymore. Rep. Tom
DeLay, the Texas Republican last seen on the national stage
whipping the troops into line to impeach President Clinton, kept a
low profile while leading the fund-raising frenzy all week. He
spent his time behind rope lines, schmoozing contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, the GOP throng here is so quick to note, will be
doing the same thing in Los Angeles. Get over it; enjoy the party _
``Hey, look, there's Jon Secada!'' As DeLay told a Washington Post
reporter about his legendarily aggressive fund raising, ``That's
what politics is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton and Al Gore showed how ruthless devotion to the
bottom line _ in money and message _ could succeed in 1992 and
1996, and everything about this convention suggests the Republicans
have learned their lessons well.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy may be winning elections, but it is losing the
faith of young people. Poll after poll has found a deep
disillusionment with politics among the people who are at an age
where they can be inspired to enter into the world of politics or
public service.
</P>
<P>
   I did, however, find at least a glimmer of youthful idealism at
this Republican gathering. In return for its $27 million
contribution to the two conventions, the federal government
required the two parties to set up programs to encourage young
people to participate in the political process. The Republican
National Committee brought in 600 people, ages 16 to 25, for a week
of seminars at the University of Pennsylvania and
convention-related duties, such as painting signs or serving as
pages on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   What I found in interviews with a handful of the participants
was the sense of idealism _ that issues, not images matter _ that
seemed so lacking from other convention events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be honest with you: I was a little ticked off with the
way it seemed they were trying to overplay the representation of
minorities in the party,'' said Yuwynn Ho, a 21-year-old UC
Berkeley economics and political science student.
</P>
<P>
   Ho, born in Malaysia, became a U.S.
citizen just three months ago. His parents left Malaysia because
the government allotted few slots for Malaysians of Chinese
descent. ``They knew I had zero chance of getting a good education
over there,'' he said. Ho now opposes racial preferences in any
form _ even for the selection of convention speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Ho's appreciation of American freedom also led him to pass up a
lucrative investment banking internship for an unpaid position at
the White House press office. Yes, the  &LR; Clinton &LR;  White House.
</P>
<P>
   Ho hopes to someday apply his newfound skills in a Bush
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Tobin, a 20-year-old college student from Delaware, said
he understood and accepted the strategic reasons for keeping the
convention programming on the benign-and-blurry side. He quickly
rattled off a number of items on his agenda, most of which involved
tax policy and limiting the role of government. The university
sessions gave him a sufficient dose of substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like we're having our own little convention
here,'' said Tobin, adding that the experience has ``definitely
inspired me to run for office.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the among the young people involved in major-party
politics; unfortunately, a rarity these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``These have been years of prosperity ... but little purpose,''
Dick Cheney said
in accepting the vice presidential nomination Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the Clinton White House. His words also
could be applied to the state of the major political parties.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Breaking down the art of the Philly cheese steak
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By CRAGG HINES
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Before leaving town, it's time to blow the
whistle on Philadelphia cheese steaks. That's the depth charge of a
sandwich that _ the Liberty Bell and Rocky Balboa statue aside _
seems to be the reason most people bother to get off the train
between Washington and New York.
</P>
<P>
   For years, I've gone along with the game, traipsing about town
with crazed locals who want to show me where the really best cheese
steak is made. Regretfully, I've concluded there is no such thing
as a really good cheese steak, at least in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   A Lebanese guy who ran a diner across the street from the
Chronicle's Washington bureau made a better cheese steak than I've
ever had here.
</P>
<P>
   In case you've lived in Waxahachie, Texas, all your life,
perhaps you need the cheese steak short course. It comes on a long
roll (cf submarine, hero, hoagie). And immediately run away
shrieking if a Philadelphian tries to tell you there's a
significant difference in these three essentially indistinguishable
types of gummy white bread.
</P>
<P>
   The eponymous ``steak'' is paper-thin shavings of mystery meat
fried up in great gobs on a grill. The cook slashes at the mass
with a couple of spatulas, trying to whack it into further
unrecognizable shreds. I'm duty-bound to note that I've never seen
a stray dog near Ninth and Passyunk, cheese steak ground zero.
</P>
<P>
   Now here's the really rich part. The ``cheese'' can be ersatz
American or ersatz provolone (which has never been closer to Italy
than Bayonne, N.J.). But it can just as easily be Cheez Whiz or
even less distinguished orangey glop (dished up from the bubbling
can in which it was formulated at the laboratory).
</P>
<P>
   Cheez Whiz is perfectly fine as the base for a frozen spinach
dip at a
 &UR;  &LR; suburban wife-swapping party, but it can't seriously be considered
a prime ingredient in a supposed culinary landmark.
</P>
<P>
   That's the basic cheese steak.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the options. The best course is to plead for a lot of
fried onions, and the greasier the better, as the undressed
sandwich is pretty dry. Slivers of canned ``Italian'' peppers (see
geographical note on provolone above) are almost always on offer,
but they don't help much and can lead to Alka-Seltzer abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps visiting Republicans have been lured by the hype to
sample a cheese steak in its native precincts. But convention-goers
may not be easy pushovers on the junk food front. Recent Democratic
and Republican confabs have been held in cities with far more
distinguished candidates for the sandwich hall of fame.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic delegates in New York (1976, 1980, 1992) could
experience first-hand the pleasures of pastrami and corned beef.
Many a post-session caucus was convened at the Carnegie Deli or
Katz's (Motto: ``Send a salami to your boy in the Army``).
</P>
<P>
   The GOP convention in New Orleans (1988) was a revelation to
those untutored in po' boys (shrimp or oyster versions at Mother's
or the drippy, fully dressed beef entry at Parasol's). Or
muffulettas (the cold cuts and cheese delight topped with olive
salad, preferably from Central Grocery). Houston (1992) opened the
world of real barbecue to many an outlander's tastebuds.
</P>
<P>
   And in just a week or so, Democrats in Los Angeles can join the
fight over the real birthplace of the French-dip. (I'm a firm
backer of Philippe's across from Union Station and intend to sing
its praises more fully if I'm allowed back into this space when our
magical mystery tour reaches the Coast).

TOM CLANCY LEAVES AGENT OF 18 YEARS TO JOIN OVITZ 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In another sign of Michael Ovitz's return to power as a
Hollywood deal-maker, Ovitz has persuaded the best-selling thriller
writer Tom Clancy to defect from his longtime agent Robert Gottlieb
at the William Morris Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb was irate at the news. He discovered Clancy's first
manuscript, ``The Hunt for Red October,'' 18 years ago at a book
fair. Gottlieb went on to negotiate contracts for 47 of his books,
roughly 10 of them still be to published, along with film,
television and other deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clancy was raided,'' Gottlieb said. ``What Mike Ovitz has done
is put his company in an adversarial position with a major agency.
I believe it is open season on him.'' Gottlieb said Ovitz had
similarly alienated Creative Artists Agency, another major agency,
by luring away the actor Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz first rose to prominence in Hollywood as the founder of
Creative Artists Agency but quit for a 14-month career as a studio
executive at the Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz had previously advised Clancy on film and television deals
but will now take over his representation completely, including
negotiating book contracts. Ovitz is handling Clancy's latest
thriller, ``The Bear and the Dragon.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz began managing Clancy's film and movie deals two years
ago, when he returned to Hollywood to open Artists Management
Group, a talent management firm with a sideline producing its own
films and television shows.
</P>
<P>
   An agent represents a client, collecting generally 10 percent of
his earnings, and helps negotiates contracts. Managers do not
negotiate contracts but oversee a client's career, often collecting
15 percent. In recent years the line between the two have become
increasingly blurred.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy had said previously that he was unhappy that just four of
his many thrillers had been made into films. Ovitz's firm recently
began producing a film based on Clancy's novel ``Rainbow Six,''
which had languished at a studio.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ovitz nor Clancy were available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb said that Ovitz's poaching would soon make him a
``pariah.''
</P>
<P>
   No agent would refer a client to Ovitz in his role as a
Hollywood business manager if he began trying to steal their
business as agents as well, Gottlieb said. ``He has made it clear
that he is neither fish nor fowl, neither agent nor manager nor
lawyer.''

INTERNATIONAL MERGER WAVE CATCHES EUROPE'S LAW FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Pushed by globalization and a boom in corporate law
involving mergers and acquisitions, law firms in Europe are
undergoing some mergers and acquisitions of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are also affecting law firms in the United States,
as links are forged across the Atlantic. But they are confronting
the firms with the challenges of bridging differences in culture,
mentality and business practices.
</P>
<P>
   This year, at least six mergers have redefined some of the
landscape for lawyers in Britain and Germany, most recently on
Monday when Herbert Smith of London announced a strategic alliance
with Gleiss Lutz Hootz Hirsch, of Stuttgart, Germany. At the same
time, two mergers have been struck across the Atlantic. In January,
Clifford Chance, a leading London law firm, merged with Rogers &AMP;
Wells in New York and Puender, Volhard, Weber &AMP; Axster in
Frankfurt, Germany, pooling 3,100 lawyers to form the world's
largest firm. In June, Titmuss Sainer Dechert of London announced
that it was merging, after a loose six-year alliance, with Dechert
Price &AMP; Rhoads of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more transactions are coming along that require
capabilities in several jurisdictions,'' said Anthony Cann, senior
partner at Linklaters, a leading London firm. Last month,
Linklaters transformed an alliance with Oppenhoff &AMP; Raedler of
Germany into a full merger.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Continental law firms feared what looked like a
British invasion. Linklaters, for instance, expanded in France in
1998 by hiring the cream of a top Paris law firm, Gide Loyrette
Nouel. Last year, Linklaters reaped the rewards, obtaining
lucrative work in a hostile-takeover battle among three of France's
biggest banks, the acquisition by the Total oil group of Fina of
Belgium, and a shopping spree by the big retailer Carrefour.
</P>
<P>
   Developments at Linklaters also reflect the opening of
Continental firms to British influence. In 1998, several European
firms that had previously allied, including Oppenhoff &AMP; Raedler,
offered Linklaters a place in the alliance in order to gain access
to Britain. Linklaters, Cann said, insisted on a joint integrated
partnership, meaning ``we brand together, we bill together, we work
together.'' Last week, Linklaters announced the merger with
Oppenhoff &AMP; Raedler. ``Germany is clearly a very strategic
jurisdiction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other partners are not sure what sort of relationship to pursue.
Last year, a leading Italian firm, Gianni, Origoni &AMP; Partners,
joined the Linklaters alliance. But Gian Battista Origoni del
Croce, a partner, said his firm was not prepared for a merger.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance has brought benefits, he said, ``certainly in terms
of culture, in terms of methodology, international know-how.'' He
added, ``Certain Anglo-Saxon practices are prevailing, and will
prevail, so there's a lot to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   In Madrid, Spain, Uria &AMP; Menendez, a leading firm, was among the
original alliance partners, yet it dropped out last year, figuring
that it could survive alone. With the Spanish market flourishing,
notably in telecommunications and utilities, and big Spanish banks
and industrial companies on buying sprees in Latin America, Uria &AMP;
Menendez is booming.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation in Europe's legal industry partly reflects
changes in several countries. In 1993, for instance, Britain
dropped rules preventing British lawyers from practicing with
lawyers not admitted in Britain. Three years earlier, Germany
eliminated curbs on lawyers' practicing in more than one city.
</P>
<P>
   But the real push came with the wave of mergers and acquisitions
encouraged by the single European currency, forcing European
governments to sell nationalized industries to meet budgetary
requirements and leading to the burgeoning of capital markets to
finance increased corporate financial activity. American and
British firms were helped by the role of New York and London as
financial capitals and their experience in handling the legal work
behind corporate finance.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the British offensive on the Continent was a reaction
to the success of American law firms, which followed American
investment banks into the lucrative new world of European
privatization, mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, for instance, when Germany sold shares worth $13
billion in its phone monopoly, Deutsche Telekom, the transaction
was handled by two New York law firms, Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &AMP;
Hamilton and Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell. Two years later, when
Daimler-Benz merged with Chrysler, and the Frankfurt stock exchange
began seeking a link with its London counterpart, much of the legal
work went to Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell. In Italy, when an investor group
made a hostile bid for Telecom Italia, which helped set the wave of
mergers and acquisitions in motion, Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell got much of
that work.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, British and American work habits are prevailing.
Ward Bower, a principal at Altman Weil, legal consultants in
Philadelphia, says anecdotal evidence indicates that while typical
partners in an American firm put in about 1,800 billable hours a
year, their British counterparts put in up to one-third fewer
hours, and lawyers on the Continent still fewer. And while British
firms pay partners based on seniority, many American law firms
follow the principle of ``eat what you kill,'' compensating lawyers
for the amount of fresh business they generate.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the boom has created a rush for talent throughout
Europe, driving up lawyers' starting salaries, which have already
been inflated by competition for law school graduates from banks,
financial companies and dot-com startups.
</P>
<P>
   Still, American firms believe increasingly that they cannot stay
away. ``If you are not able to serve clients all over the world,
maybe someone else can,'' said Jason Kravitt, co-chairman of Mayer,
Brown &AMP; Platt in Chicago, one of many U.S. firms seeking to expand
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, like Bower of Altman Weil, believe that further
trans-Atlantic mergers may take a while to come. ``I don't see it
until the next recession,'' he said, when law firms are forced to
muster their assets and economize. ``Right now, they are fat and
happy.''

EDITORIAL: KANSAS, EVOLVING 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Aug. 4:
</P>
<P>
   The earth is billions of years old, and will again be so in
Kansas, despite reckless attempts by the state Board of Education
to deprive its children of modern scientific thinking. Voters put
an end to the madness by expelling conservative board members who
had gutted statewide science standards last year to eliminate
evolution as an explanation of the origin of species and the Big
Bang theory to explain the start of the universe. The balloting was
a triumph for common sense, and a resounding defeat for
creationists whose religious zeal threatened to imperil their
schoolchildren's education.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a 1987 U.S. Supreme Court decision, no state can
compel the teaching of creationism in its public schools. But last
year the Kansas board took the opposite tack _ banishing evolution
from its standards and assessment tests, by a 6-4 vote.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's Kansas Republican primary, three of the six
conservatives responsible for that vote were defeated. The
triumphant moderate Republican nominees and their Democratic
opponents in the general election have pledged to return evolution
and the Big Bang to the standards tests, and will have the votes to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   The primary results send a strong message. Voters in the
nation's heartland will not stand to have their children's
education hijacked by those who would repudiate modern science in
the name of religion. They know full well that in today's world,
their children would be left behind. It is a matter of natural
selection.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It is time for them to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' call for an end to the Clinton/Gore years also
described the scene late Thursday after the balloons and confetti
had rained down and the GOP faithful filing toward the exits.
</P>
<P>
   Their national convention had come to a close and waiting in the
wings were workers ready to move in, mop up and tear down.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1,000 workers spent six weeks getting ready for the $63
million Republican bash here at the First Union Center,
transforming the sports and entertainment complex into an
international media center.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they'll have 10 days to clean up the property before the
next major event, an AC/DC rock concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it's Humpty Dumpty being put back together again,''
said Ike Richman, a spokesman for Comcast-Spectacor Ventures, which
owns and operates the center.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the speechifying and politicking ended here late
Thursday night, union crews began removing chairs and scooping up
balloons and confetti, dismantling risers and clearing out
dividers.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the 4,132 delegates and alternates, the 15,000
reporters and and more than 15,000 staff members, volunteers and
interns, convention organizers gutted VIP boxes, erected huge,
white tents for use as makeshift newsrooms and even laid temporary
railroad tracks to bring in antique rail cars.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the army of reporters in attendance, convention
organizers installed 6,000 miles of fiber-optic cable and more than
800 miles of computer cable.
</P>
<P>
   Although summer thunderstorms blew through the Philadelphia area
repeatedly during the convention, convention participants and the
media had to deal with only minor leakage problems and an overly
aggressive air condition system.
</P>
<P>
   The vintage Union Pacific rail cars were scheduled to leave
later this morning, and railroad officials hope to pull up the
track by the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few days, the massive tents will be gone from the arena
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This'll be like a desert when we're done _ gone,'' said Ed
Reynolds, a member of the Carpenters Union Local 8.
</P>
<P>
   All the plywood that can be salvaged from the site, union
members said, will be donated to Habitat for Humanity, the
home-building charity associated with a president Republicans drove
from office 20 years ago _ Democrat Jimmy Carter.

ARMY PROPOSAL CALLS FOR EXPANDED NATIONAL GUARD ROLE IN COMBAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Army is proposing to give the National Guard a
greatly increased role in combat, which would mean that tens of
thousands of the part-time soldiers would almost certainly be
mobilized and sent to fight if war broke out on the Korean
Peninsula or in the Persian Gulf, senior Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The combat divisions of the Guard, which a generation ago was
the place to go to avoid fighting in Vietnam, have been assigned no
role in the Army's war plans since the fall of the Berlin Wall in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Army's proposals are approved, six out of the eight
divisions _ each with roughly 15,000 soldiers _ would be assigned
specific roles in the Defense Department's newly revised war plans,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The move reflects the Army's increasing dependence on the Guard
as it has reduced the size of the active force, even as it has
taken on new missions from the Balkans to Africa to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War, the National Guard's combat divisions
were held literally in reserve, to be mobilized only if the Soviet
Union started World War III by invading western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last few years, the Army, like the other armed
services, has increasing turned to the National Guard and Reserve
to support military operations around the world. In March, troops
from the 49th Armored Division of the Texas Guard took over the
U.S. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, the first time since the
Korean War that a guard division commanded an overseas operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's proposal, drafted last week, would represent an even
more marked shift in the Guard's role that could have profound
effects on its budget, equipment and training _ and on the
willingness of people to join a service that has traditionally
demanded only a weekend a month and two weeks each summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making a big step toward better use of the National
Guard in the nation's military strategy, particularly in the war
plans area,'' said Maj. Gen. Michael W. Davidson, the assistant to
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for guard affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The war plans _ or ``op plans,'' as they are known _ are highly
classified documents prepared by the nation's regional commanders
in chief and regularly updated. In the event war breaks out, they
detail which forces would be used to fight and where; they also
assign roles in other military operations, like peacekeeping
missions, or in ``backfilling'' for other units sent to war.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal now being considered, the Army would assign
six of the Guard's eight combat divisions specific missions in the
war plans, according to two senior officials familiar the details.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the divisions would be assigned to participate in the
two ``major theater wars'' _ in the Persian Gulf and in Korea _
that are the bedrock of national military planning. The other two
divisions would have missions supporting other operations in the
Southern Command, which has responsibility for Central and South
America, and in the European Command.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials declined to discuss the Guard's specific
missions, saying that details of the proposal are still being
ironed out and must be approved by the Army's civilian and military
leaders before being formally presented to the Joint Chiefs of
Staff and the regional commanders later this month. The Army has
also not yet decided which of the divisions would be assigned to
each mission.
</P>
<P>
   If the Joint Chiefs accept the Army's proposal, then the Army's
chief of staff, Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, is expected to unveil the
proposal at the annual convention of the National Guard Association
of the United States next month.
</P>
<P>
   Individual units, including the Guard's 15 combat brigades, have
for some years been assigned missions in the war plans and, like
the 49th Armored Division, have increasingly participated in Army
operations. But the fact that the war plans have not included the
eight guard divisions has been perhaps the greatest source of
contention between the Army and the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Guard commanders have long complained that without specific
missions, the divisions have received the lowest priority when it
came to dividing up dwindling budgets, leaving Guard divisions with
older equipment and less money for training.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, now the
Republican vice-presidential nominee, and Gen. Colin Powell, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, tried to make deep cuts in
the Guard divisions, arguing that the Army no longer needed so many
reserve combat forces that had no real mission. But those efforts
where blocked in Congress, where the Guard has had strong support.
</P>
<P>
   The Army National Guard was increased to 10 divisions during the
Reagan build-up in the 1980s. But after the Cold War, it was
reduced back to eight while the regular Army was reduced from 18 to
10 today.
</P>
<P>
   The world has changed since then. As the Army has shrunk by 40
percent from its Cold War high of nearly 800,000 troops, its 10
active divisions have become increasingly taxed, officials say, by
the pace of operations like those today in the Persian Gulf, the
Sinai Peninsula, Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, two of the active divisions _ the 10th Mountain and
the 1st Mechanized Infantry _ classified themselves as unready to
fulfill their missions in the war plans because so many of their
troops were committed to the Balkans. Army officials said it was
that predicament that forced them to consider relying on the Guard
to fulfill some of the war-time missions and other objectives.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Secretary of Defense William Cohen has made
better use of the Guard and Reserves a priority, ordering the
services to remove ``all structural barriers'' between active and
reserve forces.

 WASHINGTON: reserve forces.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Guard has made major contributions to the nation's
wars. Guard divisions fought in both World Wars; the 29th Infantry
Division of Virginia was one of two divisions that landed on Omaha
Beach on D-Day. Two guard divisions fought in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, the divisions have not been deployed to
fight, though some units and individuals served as volunteers in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   During the Persian Gulf War in 1991, the Pentagon mobilized more
than 265,000 reservists, including 85,000 guard members, but most
of them served in support roles.
</P>
<P>
   During that war, the Pentagon did activate a combat tank brigade
from the Georgia National Guard, but after putting the unit through
two months of training, commanders deemed it unprepared for combat
and refused to send it to the Gulf _ a decision that causes
bitterness even today.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Pentagon, there remains lingering doubts about the
ability of the Guard divisions to be ready for combat, especially
in a major regional war, but with Shinseki pledging to fully
integrate the National Guard into the Army, officials say they are
determined to overcome them.
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Alexander, a retired major general who is executive
director of the National Guard Association in Washington, said the
Army's willingness to include the divisions in the war plans
signaled a significant change in its attitude toward the guard
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're satisfied there is a relevancy being established for the
Guard _ and relevancy is the key,'' he said. ``Once relevancy is
established, we are obligated to do whatever we can to see that it
is adequately resourced.''
</P>
<P>
   Including the divisions in the war plans will almost certainly
require the Army and the Guard to spend more on equipment and
training, though officials say it is far too early to estimate what
the costs would be. ``If we know they're going to be missioned,
they're going to have to have the equipment they need,'' one Army
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the Army will still have to set priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This nation as a whole is not going to spend the money to
bring every guard division, every reserve unit and every
active-duty division up to the pinnacle of readiness 24 hours a
day, 365 days a year,'' said P.T. Henry, the Army's assistant
secretary for reserve affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Another obstacle will be the amount of time it takes to mobilize
a guard division, compared with an active division, since most of
its soldiers serve only part time and, in many cases, are scattered
in units spread over several states.
</P>
<P>
   The war plans today require the Guard's combat brigades, with
roughly 2,000 soldiers, to be ready to deploy into combat within 90
days of mobilization.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they are now increasing the readiness standards
at the platoon level and working on a plan that would require the
guard divisions to be combat ready within 150 days.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean that the divisions would not likely be the first
ones deployed to a conflict, though one official noted that the
Army had six months after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 to
assemble the force that ultimately drove the Iraqis out.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the Army's proposal would also give the guard
divisions the role of filling in when an active division is pulled
away from an overseas base or from a peacekeeping mission like
those in Bosnia or Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest question will be the effect on recruiting
and retention. While many guard commanders have wanted an increased
role, the increasing possibility of deploying for war could cause
some of those who signed up to rethink their commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Charles L. Cragin, the assistant secretary of defense for
reserve affairs, said that the contract with the nation's citizen
soldiers has evolved as much as the role of the military in
general. He derides the widely-used phrase ``weekend warrior'' for
reservists because, he said, it simply is no longer relevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic premise throughout the Cold War was that unless the
Russians started pouring through the Fulda Gap,'' Cragin said,
referring to the hilly area that was once the border of eastern and
western Germany, ``we were not going to call up the reserves. The
reserve force was reserved. That equation has changed.''

ANALYSIS: IN BID TO RECAST GOP, BUSH MIMICS DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Close your eyes, and Gov. George W. Bush on
Thursday night could have been Bill Clinton without the punch _ or
Al Gore without the precision.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in his planned acceptance speech Thursday night, the
Texas governor and Republican presidential nominee sought to
reorient his party to the center with passages that were strikingly
similar to Clinton's speech at the 1992 Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   The speech Thursday night capped a four-day political production
in which Bush deftly elbowed aside ardent conservatives to convince
America that his party was much like himself _ approachable and
open _ and that he is a candidate who can be trusted to safely lead
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ambitious attempt at reintroducing the Republican
Party, akin to Richard M. Nixon's drive in 1968 to transform the
once solid South for the Democrats into a Republican stronghold or
Ronald Reagan's ``Morning in America'' campaign for middle
Americans in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   By stressing ``idealism and inclusion'' and the ``forgotten,''
Bush sought to give a gracious new twist to the Grand Old Party,
moving beyond the battles over impeachment, abortion and culture
that had given his party such a harsh face. Rather than invoke Newt
Gingrich, Bush spoke of ``a bipartisan approach to governing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Democrats conceded that Bush had mounted an impressive
start in setting out a general election campaign that excises the
demons that have haunted Republicans by offering a nominee who
often sounds very much like his foes.
</P>
<P>
   And already, many Democrats expressed fear that the display in
Philadelphia will force Vice President Al Gore _ whose campaign is
entering a crucial phase with the selection of a running mate and
then his own convention _ to aggressively fire back and depict the
convention as a four-day masquerade that obscured the party's
platform and hard-line voting records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds of jaws are dropping of Democratic members of
Congress around the country who are hearing of a Republican
commitment to their building of schools, hiring of teachers,
commitment to the environment and diversity of government,'' said
Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Will it work? ``It has been skillfully done,'' Torricelli said.
``The Republicans have succeeded in projecting an image that is not
only at total variance with their record but in contradiction of
their own platform.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be exactly what the Bush campaign wants. The
calculation _ or at least the hope _ among Republicans is that they
will box Gore in: The more he tries to portray his opponents as
insincere the more the vice president risks appearing mean-spirited
and political. That is an important reason Gore foundered when he
tried to take on Bush after the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   And that helps explain why a relentlessly upbeat Bush managed to
topple a popular _ and increasingly defensive _ Gov. Ann Richards
in 1994. ``The axis upon which a lot of this turns is Bush's
experience against Ann Richards,'' said Richard N. Bond, a former
chairman of the Republican Party. ``She got shriller and shriller
and shriller _ and less believable. That's the experience in which
Bush has based his strategy for this campaign and this
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   In pursuing that strategy, Bush gave no heed Thursday night to
the vast gulf between himself and Gore on issues ranging from
cutting taxes and banning abortion. Rather than alienate the
suburban swing voters who will decide the election, Bush did not
trouble the public with details of policy.
</P>
<P>
   In this most formal moment for a determinedly informal man, Bush
allowed as to how he possessed the qualities to reach beyond his
own party and unite the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time,'' Bush said in his prepared remarks, ``for
Republicans and Democrats to end the politics of fear and save
Social Security, together.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that his opponent sounds like a Democrat, there are other
complications for Gore as he prepares to name his running mate in
the coming days and then make his own pitch at the Democratic
convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had the luxury of neglecting conservatives this week
because Republicans of all stripes are lock-step behind his
candidacy. But beyond competing with Bush for the swing voters,
Gore at his convention will have to tend to restive Democrats who
are not altogether content with their candidate or his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said Gore faces a tougher balancing act
than Bush. ``He's got a more difficult line to walk,'' Breaux said.
``Our job is to make sure the base is comfortable and secure _ but
be very aggressive in speaking to the moderate middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also has to contend with the shadow of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on the eve of the convention, Bush went out of
his way to say that there was little need to demonize Clinton.
``The opponent is not President Clinton,'' he said. ``The opponent
is Vice President Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton has been a subtext here all week long. It started
when Laura Bush spoke of the need for people ``to respect the
president of the United States of America.'' And Thursday night,
Bush, by underscoring that ``times of plenty'' are ``tests of
American character,'' the governor left no doubt that he and his
campaign regard Clinton as a tantalizing villain _ and will truly,
albeit subtly, try to make him an issue in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   To further complicate matters, Gore also has an interest in
seeing Clinton hover over this campaign. While Bush's loyalists
will try to remind voters of Monica Lewinsky, Gore's will trot out
Robert Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, who helped the
Clinton-Gore administration preside over the most sustained
economic recovery in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   While there was a dash of Clinton in Bush's address Thursday
night _ his attempt to reach out to the middle _ the Texas governor
also capitalized on his opportunity to reach the largest audience
that will likely hear him give a speech in this campaign to try to
charm the public.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they were confident that their thoroughly
unobjectionable, even warm-hearted, message was carried enough on
the news to reach well beyond the delegates in the hall, even
though most of the proceedings were not even carried by the major
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's objective Thursday night was not entirely different from
that of Ronald Reagan, who at his convention in Detroit in 1980
sought to convince Americans that beyond his affability, he was up
to being commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   The calculation of Bush operatives is that if Bush puts to rest
worries about his capacity to be president, and reassures moderates
that he feels their pain, he can gain the edge by trumping Gore in
the likability category.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about George Bush being, in essence, not a bad
person and a well-meaning person,'' said William Daley, Gore's
campaign chairman. ``Therefore he will do what's right and trust
me. There's got to be more to it than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaux put it this way: ``This cannot be a popularity contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans do not see it that way. To them, it is all about
presenting a happy, inclusive candidate and a happy inclusive
party.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they should update Reagan's relentlessly gauzy _ and
wildly successful _ slogan from 1984, ``It's Morning Again in
America.'' Again.

 &HT;    EDS: Pittsburg, Texas is CQ &HT;    Texas GOP delegates cast all their votes, toss all their hats
for Bush
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By CLAY ROBISON
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Already convinced that the sun revolves around
their governor, Texas Republicans rejoiced Thursday evening as they
finally cast their 124 presidential nominating votes for George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Tossing dozens of white cowboy hats into the air on the closing
night of a lovefest officially known as the Republican National
Convention, they didn't care that the carefully scripted moment was
totally devoid of suspense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most exciting thing. I think I'm at an Aggie football
game,'' said David Kent, a retired Texas A&AMP;M tennis coach and
delegate from Bryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've not only energized Texas (for Bush), we've energized
other states as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming, home state of Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, already
had given the Texas governor enough votes for the GOP nomination on
Wednesday. But Texas completed the roll call Thursday night,
building anticipation before Bush delivered his acceptance speech
to the Republican faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' votes were cast by Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, the delegation
chairman and head of Bush's presidential campaign in Texas, and
delegate Martha Sanchez Metzger of Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   Perry praised Bush for his bipartisan record in Texas and,
countering Democratic attacks, said the Texas governor had made his
state a better place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush set out in Texas to make our schools better, our
streets safer, and our economy stronger, and he did. And he will do
the same for America,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Thorburn, a delegate from New Braunfels, said she was
having a ``grand time'' boosting, she hoped, the political future
of her governor.
</P>
<P>
   Praising Bush for his ``integrity,'' she said, ``It's time
someone went in and washed the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other delegates in Philadelphia, Thorburn wore a red,
white and blue vest. But hers was the only one that had ever been
fished out of the Guadalupe River. After her home was destroyed in
a flood in 1998, the vest and other political memorabilia were
recovered days later about 300 yards downstream.
</P>
<P>
   B.R. ``Skipper'' Wallace, a delegate from Lampasas, said that
nominating Bush was the ``greatest honor that we could have.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the greatest political leader we've ever had. When he
tells you something, you can take it to the bank,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie Boerner, a delegate from Pittsburg, in East Texas, said
Bush, despite his limited governmental resume, was well-prepared
for the presidency, partly because of his family ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a front row seat to this all his life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Faith Johnson of DeSoto, an alternate
delegate and one of a handful of blacks in the Texas delegation,
said Bush's greatest strength in the White House would be his
ability to work with all people, ``black, white, purple, green,
what have you.''

RED SOX GET BROGNA FROM PHILLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Red Sox have claimed Rico Brogna off waivers, as
general manager Dan Duquette won his battle of wills with the
Phillies and acquired the veteran first baseman for next to
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Brogna, 30, who was born in Turners Falls in Western
Massachusetts and lives in Watertown, Conn., has not played in his
seven major league seasons with a team that finished over .500 or
closer than 18 1/2 games off the pace. He played with the Tigers
and the Mets before he joined the Phillies in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited to play for the Red Sox and be in a pennant
race,'' Brogna told reporters in a conference call from Denver
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With the offense sputtering, Duquette in recent weeks had
coveted Brogna, a lefthanded hitter who averaged 21 home runs, 33
doubles, and 97 RBIs over his last three full seasons with the
Phillies. After the All-Star break last year, he hit .297 with 13
homers and drove in 58 runs.
</P>
<P>
   But with Brogna headed for free agency in October, Duquette
refused to part with a number of players the Phillies wanted for
him, including infield prospect Donnie Sadler. Sox pitcher Bryce
Florie's name also surfaced in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies fished for top Boston prospects until Monday's
trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted more talent than we were willing to give up,''
Duquette told reporters. ``We took the risk that we would have an
opportunity to claim him by the waiver process.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Phillies settled for the Red Sox picking up the
balance of Brogna's $4.2 million salary, about $1.5 million for the
rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players offered on Monday did not balance with the money
that we had to take back,'' Phillies general manager Ed Wade said.
``We talked to Boston again this morning, but it still wasn't
enough, so we made the deal and recouped his entire salary.''
</P>
<P>
   The question facing Brogna when he reports Friday to Fenway Park
is similar to the quandary that other recent Red Sox arrivals have
confronted: What role will he play?
</P>
<P>
   Joining a team desperately seeking consistency, Brogna will
instantly rank as the only first baseman with lengthy major league
experience and a superb defensive resume. He led National League
first basemen in 1995 with a fielding percentage of .995.
</P>
<P>
   Putting Brogna at first base full time would bump Brian Daubach,
who as a first baseman has hit .284 with seven home runs and 30
RBIs. As a designated hitter, Daubach is hitting .234 with six
homers and 19 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman was also playing often at first base before he
went on the disabled list this week with a deep knee bruise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where I fit in exactly,'' Brogna said. ``Maybe I
can be the lefthanded bat in the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said he would leave it to manager Jimy Williams to fill
out the lineup card.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daubach has done a nice job,'' he said. But the general
manager also noted that Brogna is the only established first
baseman on the team and only player to have received votes for a
Gold Glove at the position.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox must also clear a spot Friday on the 25-player roster.
Among the options would be demoting the Frontier League legend
Morgan Burkhart, who was called up to fill Offerman's slot.
</P>
<P>
   Brogna began the season as Philadelphia's starting first
baseman, after his second straight 100-plus-RBI season and third
consecutive year with 20 or more home runs. But when he returned in
June from a two-month absence after his left forearm was fractured
when he was hit by a pitch in Montreal, Brogna had lost his job to
young phenom Pat Burrell.
</P>
<P>
   The misfortune came a decade after former Tigers manager Sparky
Anderson said of Brogna, who was then 19, ``He's the finest young
player I've seen since Johnny Bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Injuries have attributed to Brogna's struggle, and his physical
condition was likely a key factor Thursday among the teams that let
him pass on the waiver wire. Under major league rules, every team
with a record inferior to Boston's had a shot at him before the Red
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   After he ended the 1999 season with a 49-game errorless streak,
Brogna last October had arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder.
In January, he had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. Then
came the fractured forearm. He also has coped with spinal
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   In 38 games this year with the Phillies, Brogna hit .248 and
drove in 13 runs. But he hit only one home run in 129 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said Brogna, who coaches the Watertown High freshmen
basketball team in the offseason, told him he is eager to make his
Fenway debut. ``This is a homecoming for him,'' Duquette said.

CHANGES IN FORD EXPLORER AIM AT PROTECTING OTHER MOTORISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (11 p.m. ET EMBARGO) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ The Ford Motor Co. said Thursday that its next
generation of Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles, scheduled to go
on sale in January, would be extensively changed from current
models so as to reduce the danger to other motorists during
collisions and decrease the risk of deadly rollovers.
</P>
<P>
   The sturdy frame that runs the length of the Explorer, the
nation's best-selling sport utility vehicle, will be as low at the
front of the vehicle as that of Ford Taurus sedans, considerably
reducing the risk that the sport utility vehicles will override
cars' bumpers and door sills in crashes, Ford officials said. The
front foot or so of the frame will absorb more energy in a
high-speed crash, reducing the risk of injury in both vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is an impact, the vehicles can share the energy of
the event, instead of the Explorer imparting it to the passenger
vehicle,'' said Stephanie Sweeney, Ford's crash safety supervisor
for Explorers.
</P>
<P>
   Dale E. Claudepierre, Ford's director of midsize sport utility
vehicles, said the Explorer's design reflected a shift in the
company's approach to safety. ``More so than in the past, we are
concerned about the impact our vehicles have on other vehicles,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said Ford had also improved the safety of Explorer
occupants by adding ceiling-mounted side air bags that protect them
during rollovers, which are responsible for three-fifths of all
deaths in sport utilities. The manufacturer also widened the
distance between the front wheels and between the rear wheels by
two and a half inches and lowered the entire vehicle slightly to
make it more stable and less likely to tip over when it strikes
curbs, guard rails and lower-riding vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Ford made a point of saying that the changes would not
compromise the vehicle's off-road performance. Thanks to suspension
changes, Ford will increase ground clearance by an inch, to 9.2
inches, one of the highest clearances for any sport utility.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also improved the Explorer's brakes, to stop the vehicle in
135 feet when fully loaded and traveling 60 miles an hour _ similar
to a car's stopping distance. The current Explorer needs 164 feet
to stop. Sport utilities will not be required to meet brake
standards for cars until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Independent safety experts said Ford appeared to have made
important progress toward improving the safety of motorists who
share the road with Explorers, although they cautioned that they
would like to study the new vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has not lowered the hood of its Explorer, choosing instead
to mount lower in the vehicle the long, stiff ``frame rails'' that
form the vehicle's skeleton. High hoods increase the risk of head
and neck injuries when they strike cars in the side, experts said,
although the low frame rails on the Explorer make it less likely
that the new model will override cars' door sills and project its
hood into cars' passenger compartments during crashes. With a new,
optional third row of seats, the Explorer will also be 200 pounds
heavier, which could also slightly increase damage to other
vehicles in crashes.
</P>
<P>
   But Gerald Donaldson, senior research director at Advocates for
Highway and Auto Safety, a nonprofit group in Washington, said he
was impressed that Ford was addressing rollovers and risks to other
motorists even in the absence of government regulation in either
area. ``I am amazed to see it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Explorer has been the nation's best-selling sport
utility by a wide margin every year since 1991, although its share
of the sport utility market has steadily eroded, to 13.8 percent in
the first seven months of this year, as manufacturers have
introduced many more models. The Mercury Mountaineer, also
redesigned for the new model year, shares a common underbody and
other mechanical underpinnings with the Explorer but has different
sheet metal, grille, headlights, taillights and interior. It had
just 1.4 percent of the market in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Under Alex Trotman, Ford's chairman and chief executive until
his retirement at the end of 1998, the company contended that sport
utility vehicles inevitably posed risks to other motorists and that
nothing could be done about this. In an interview in 1997, Trotman
said a collision between a sport utility vehicle and a car was like
smashing two rocks together; the larger rock would be less likely
to suffer damage.
</P>
<P>
   But most of Ford's top management turned over when Trotman
retired, and the company's perspective has changed. Claudepierre
said that by changing the frame rails the company had found a
surprisingly simple and inexpensive solution to the problem of
sport utility damage to other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Frame rails look like two railroad rails, only they curve up and
down somewhat from the front to the back of the vehicle. They are
connected by a series of cross bars, and form the vehicle's
foundation, providing anchor points for the engine, transmission
and suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The foot-long segments of the frame rails in front of the front
cross bar are known as the frame horns. On most models, including
current Explorers, the frame horns curve up slightly to just behind
the bumper or the grille, a design that makes them prone to
overriding cars' bumpers and door sills and spearing passenger
compartments and their occupants.
</P>
<P>
   Claudepierre said Ford had found it could simply turn over the
front segments and have them curve down instead. While this
involved some engineering changes in the front end of the vehicle,
he said, it is fairly easy to manufacture, because factory robots
make roughly the same welds as before but with the front segments
inverted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave up nothing by flipping them upside down,'' he said.
``That really puts it at the height of a Taurus.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford installed energy-absorbing, horizontal steel bars last year
below the bumpers of its immense Ford Excursion, which has very
high frame rails. But Sweeney said that on the new Explorer, ``We
don't need the Excursion blocker beam because we lowered the frame
by over two and a half inches _ we didn't just lower the bumper, we
lowered the frame.''
</P>
<P>
   General Motors disclosed last March that it was taking a smaller
step in the same direction, using suspension changes to lower the
frame rails on its new Chevrolet Blazers, GMC Envoys and Oldsmobile
Bravadas by up to two inches as they are introduced this autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also made the front ends of the new Explorer's frame rails
less stiff, by drilling holes in them so that the rails will
crumple slightly during high-speed crashes, absorbing some of the
force of an impact. Such changes are possible partly because the
new Explorer will no longer share a common frame with the Ranger
pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the frame horns, the rest of the Explorer' frame
rails are slightly lower than before, partly because of suspension
changes that will also make the ride less bouncy and more carlike.
Ford took the unusual step of mounting the rear suspension through
holes in the frame rails.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the new Explorer accommodates the optional third
row of seats that is mounted low enough to allow ample headroom
even for adults up to 6 feet 6 inches tall. The extra seats could
lure families out of larger, far less fuel-efficient sport
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has also introduced two more fuel-efficient engines, so
that even with the additional weight of the optional row of seats
the vehicle will get an extra mile per gallon on the highway.

BOFA FIRES KATHLEEN BROWN, PLANS TO SHUT S.F. BANKING UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM ZUCKERMAN  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Bank of America has fired Kathleen Brown, one of
California's most visible leaders and a member of one of the
state's most prominent political families, from a high-ranking
executive post at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   BofA announced the departure of the former state treasurer and
1994 Democratic gubernatorial candidate in a statement Thursday,
explaining that Brown had ``decided to leave to pursue other
personal and career interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown lost her job as part of a wide-ranging purge of senior
executive ranks at the bank, one well-placed source said. Last
week, BofA said it would slash up to 10,000 jobs during the next
year, more than 6 percent of its workforce, to cut costs. The
cutbacks are focused on top- and middle-level managers.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who was based in Los Angeles, had been president of
BofA's private banking operations in the West, which provides
banking and money management services to wealthy clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had an incredible run, for which I am most grateful,''
Brown said in an interview. ``Times have changed, and its time for
me to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown declined to comment on the circumstances of her departure.
``I'm not going to go there,''` she responded when asked if the
bank blundered in giving a high-profile female executive her
walking papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bank went through a reorganization, of which I took part''
in designing, Brown continued. ``We didn't need three presidents of
private banking. This is a better structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's departure comes two years after North Carolina's
NationsBank bought San Francisco's BofA and took its name.
Observers said the matter will fuel perceptions that the bank is a
carpetbagger in California.
</P>
<P>
   Brown ``is a highly respected female executive. She represents
the essence of the California team,'' said John Wilson, an
executive recruiter with Korn/Ferry International.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing her out is ``incredibly insensitive. It sends a very bad
message,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, BofA also said it is shutting its Northern California
retail banking unit based in San Francisco and moving its functions
into a single statewide organization headquartered in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, San Francisco will no longer be a consumer banking
administrative center for BofA. That represents one of the biggest
losses for the city inside the bank since NationsBank bought
BofAtwo years ago, creating the nation's largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of BOFA04 (91833 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  To replace Brown as Western private banking chief, the bank named
Connie Beck, a NationsBank executive in Texas who was brought to
San Francisco last year to run the Northern California retail bank.
Beck will stay in San Francisco and continue as the bank's liaison
with local government and charitable groups.
</P>
<P>
   The bank did hand the old BofA an important prize, naming Liam
McGee, a Los Angeles veteran of the former California bank, to run
the newly formed statewide operation.
</P>
<P>
   Brown joined the old BofA in 1995 as a California private
banking manager, shortly after losing the governor's race to Pete
Wilson. When many other senior female executives from the old BofA
quit the bank following its 1998 takeover, Brown stayed and
publicly defended the new bank's record on hiring and promoting
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has alway been an incredible ambassador for the bank,''
said San Francisco Treasurer Susan Leal.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was rewarded early in 1999 with the job as Western private
banking chief.
</P>
<P>
   On the headquarters issue, BofA officials said despite the
bank's move to close its Northern California retail banking unit,
it still considers the Bay Area a vital market.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, McGee, the new statewide banking chief, said he
plans to appoint several key deputies based here: ``San Francisco
does quite well. There will not be a Southern California
concentration of leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   McGee cited his own appointment as evidence that the bank is
willing to give power to executives from the old BofA. ``Most
people wouldn't have thought it possible that I could get this
job,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Executive recruiters said the 45-year-old McGee may have won the
confidence of the bank's leaders because he is an effective manager
who has changed loyalties several times in his career. McGee worked
for Wells Fargo for more than a decade before jumping to Los
Angeles' Security Pacific, which in turn was bought by the old BofA
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows how to make money,'' said Los Angeles search
specialist Bob Rollo. ``His entire career has been based on getting
results.''
</P>
<P>
   BofA is competing for the city of San Francisco's business with
Wells Fargo and Union Bank of California. Leal wouldn't comment
specifically on how the latest moves BofA's standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say, though, one of the things we will be looking at is
organizational stability,'' Leal said.

SPRINT OFFERS VOICE DIALING ON CELL PHONES 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Could the phone keypad soon go the way of the
rotary dial?
</P>
<P>
   Some wireless companies seem to think so.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS introduced a service Thursday to allow a subscriber
to make a call by pronouncing each digit in the phone number.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, customers can also set up an address book at their
desktop computers so they can simply call out the name of the
person they want to call.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, several carriers, including Sprint, already offer
specialized handsets that understand spoken commands. But customers
have to train the phones, made by manufacturers like Qualcomm and
Samsung, to understand that particular person's cadence. Customers
with a cheaper phone were out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Sprint executives say its service will work with
any telephone and doesn't need to be trained.
</P>
<P>
   They say the speech-recognition software is more sophisticated
because it runs on powerful computers linked to the Sprint network,
instead of on tiny chips wedged inside a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   The price for the ``voice command'' will range from nothing to
$10 per month, depending upon which pricing plan a customer has.
</P>
<P>
   Other wireless carriers plan to follow suit. Nextel plans to
offer a similar service within six months. And AT&AMP;T Wireless is
testing the technology at its Menlo Park, Calif., research center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be the way everyone dials their phone,'' said
Ronald Croen, chief executive of Nuance Communications in Menlo
Park, which developed the speech recognition software used in the
Sprint service.
</P>
<P>
   Nuance, which traditionally sold its software to companies for
automated answering machine systems, is now duking it out with
rival Speechworks of Boston in the cell phone market.
</P>
<P>
   However, AT&AMP;T spokesman Ken Woo said the current
state-of-the-art technology might still be too primitive to work
reliably, especially while driving down the freeway or on a noisy
street in downtown San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the demonstrations I've seen have been with someone in
a quiet room, wearing a headset and a mike very close to their
mouth,'' Woo said. ``Of course, it works great, but that's not
exactly a real world test.''
</P>
<P>
   Woo hadn't tried the Sprint system. But other voice-recognition
systems routinely make errors even under ideal conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, voice-activated phone dialing could just be
the beginning of a vast array of services activated by spoken
commands, from directions to movie listings.
</P>
<P>
   These services are already offered by a couple of dozen existing
``voice portals,'' including TellMe Networks in Mountain View and
BeVocal in Santa Clara, both launched in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   However, to access voice portals, customers usually must dial a
toll-free number and wait for the call to connect. By contrast,
cell phone companies might let customers simply flick on their
phone and say a key word such as ``Weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Group analyst Adam Zawel said independent voice portals
could still survive by offering better features. But if it's even
close, Zawel figures customers will just stick with the default
service offered by the wireless telephone carrier instead of
dialing up a voice portal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's true,'' said Croen of Nuance, which also sells
its software to voice portals like TellMe.
</P>
<P>
   But BeVocal co-founder Amol Joshi said he expects most wireless
companies will team with an existing voice portal instead of
replicating the service themselves. He said BeVocal is in talks
with several of the top six largest wireless carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They clearly have the brand and the infrastructure, but they
lack the applications (or software),'' Joshi said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint spokesman Bob Kelley confirmed the company plans to work
with outside partners. ``I don't think we are building our own
portal,'' he said. Kelley said the company probably wouldn't expand
into the area until next year.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T appears to be moving in this direction, having invested $60
million in TellMe three months ago. But Joshi said AT&AMP;T could still
pick a different partner for its voice portal, since the investment
didn't come from its wireless unit.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless companies could make potential money in several ways,
such as selling advertising, receiving money from portals, charging
customers for the time they spend using the service or even taking
a cut of any purchases people make while shopping on their phone.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless company executives also say voice portals will be a
boon for customers, since it can be awkward to drive while fumbling
around a cell phone keypad.

 GROUP'S HEARING EXPLORES INTERNET SAFETY
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARRIE KIRBY &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; C. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Installing software that blocks out
objectionable Web sites may not be the best way to protect children
who use the Internet, a disparate group of experts told a
congressional commission Thursday in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   In the third of a series of hearings to consider different
strategies for protecting kids online, dot-com executives,
librarians, children's advocates and even pornographers gathered at
San Jose State University to testify before the Commission on
Online Child Protection.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the commission has heard from makers of filtering
software such as Net Nanny and from people who want to separate
pornography from the rest of the Internet by giving such sites
their own domain name endings _ perhaps .xxx instead of .com.
</P>
<P>
   This time, witnesses suggested other technological solutions _
such as using special portals just for kids, like Yahoo's
Yahooligans. They also put forward nontechnical answers such as
setting and enforcing rules that children must follow when using
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of parents conducted by FamilyPC magazine suggests that
filtering software is not considered relevant by many parents.
Fewer than half of parents use filtering software or a filtered
Internet service provider, according to the survey, presented to
the commission yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   And while the software focuses on blocking out ``bad'' Web
sites, parents told the magazine their top concern is Internet
privacy, not pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Filtering software has been controversial because some people
believe it violates Web-page-makers' freedom of speech. But many of
yesterday's witnesses focused on the software's effect on children
who use it.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on filtering software such as Net Nanny or Cyber Patrol
to keep kids safe online can be shortsighted, said Nancy Willard,
director of a University of Oregon group called Responsible
Netizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping kids fenced in does not teach them to take care of
themselves in the real world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents must gradually teach their children to deal with online
dangers and unpleasantness, which ranges from pornography and child
predators to false information and swindles, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is incumbent upon us to give them the education to avoid
becoming a generation of victims,'' said Judith Krug, director of
the American Libraries Association's Office for Intellectual
Freedom, which opposes using filtering in public libraries.
</P>
<P>
   But some commissioners questioned whether just talking to
children about online dangers is enough. Former Sen. Gary Hart
confidante Donna Rice Hughes, who runs the Protectkids.com, said
education should be used alongside other precautions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My preferred solution has always been a comprehensive solution
_ shared responsibility between the public, the technology
community and law enforcement,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of COPA04 (90084 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Danni Ashe, chief executive officer of a pornography site called
Danni's Hard Drive, said children's safety advocates and porn
merchants have some of the same problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Responsible'' adult sites do their best to keep kids out by
charging a fee payable only by credit card, Ashe said.
</P>
<P>
   But when porn sites' images are copied by viewers and posted for
free elsewhere on the Internet, kids can see them without a credit
card. ``We need stronger copyright laws and more cooperation from
ISPs and law enforcement agencies'' to prevent theft, Ashe said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress created the commission as part of the Child Online
Protection Act, a 1998 law that banned Web sites from making
``harmful'' material available to children.
</P>
<P>
   The law was quickly blocked in court after being challenged by
the American Civil Liberties Union as a violation of the First
Amendment and has never been enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Although the future of the Act or other legislation on the
subject is uncertain, the commission is going ahead with its
mandate to study the different methods of protecting kids from
online porn.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow, the commission will hear how emerging technologies
such as broadband Internet access may affect children's exposure to
harmful material.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission may not recommend new legislation'' in its
report to Congress, due November 30, said George Vradenburg III,
America Online's representative on the commission. ``But hopefully
it will set an agenda for the whole Internet community.''
</P>
<P>
   Other commission members include executives from Yahoo and
Disney's Go.com, as well as representatives from the Federal Trade
Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice.

BUSH BELITTLES DEMOCRATS AS HE ACCEPTS NOMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Basking in the adoration of Republicans who
believe he is destined to recapture the White House, Texas Governor
George W. Bush triumphantly accepted his party's nomination
Thursday night, declaring that the Democratic administration that
ousted his father from the White House eight years ago has had ``no
great purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by contrast, vowed to ``seize this moment of American
promise'' and ``extend the promise of prosperity to every forgotten
corner of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the speech's many promises, occasional platitudes and even
a bit a even bit of Robert Frost poetry, the governor did not shy
away from the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``For eight years, the Clinton-Gore administration has coasted
through prosperity,'' Bush said in remarks prepared for delivery.
The governor laid out a litany of lapses, accusing the
administration of having ``squandered'' world leadership, overseen
a ``steady erosion of American power'' and leaving millions of
children ``trapped in schools where violence is common and learning
is rare.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration had its chance,'' Bush said, in what was
intended as the evening's signature statement. ``They have not led.
We will.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the most important political speech of Bush's life, aimed
beyond the beribboned convention hall to a nationwide television
audience of millions, including many undecided voters who may have
heard little beyond some 30-second ``sound bites'' from the
governor until his acceptance oration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 54, who until six years ago had never held elected office,
began writing the remarks months ago, and continued to revise them
as late as Thursday. But the themes echoed his campaign stump
speeches: Using prosperity for a greater purpose, restoring honor
to Washington, broadening the Republican platform to include voters
across the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now the party of ideas and innovation...The party of
idealism and inclusion...The party of a simple and powerful hope,''
Bush said. ``My fellow citizens, we can begin again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush then sought to directly answer Gore's charge that Bush's
plans for large tax cuts and the partial privatization of Social
Security as ``risky schemes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the sum of his message,'' Bush said. ``If my opponent
had been there at the moon launch, it would have been a `risky
rocket scheme.' If he'd been there when Edison was testing the
light bulb, it would have been a `risky anti-candle scheme.' ''
Then, alluding to Gore's assertion that he helped invent the
Internet, Bush said mockingly, ``If he'd been there when the
Internet was invented...well, I understand he was actually there
for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly six months after Bush sewed up the nomination, and after
days of choreographed convention speeches, the evening injected
some drama into the presidential campaign by underscoring how much
is at stake between now and election day.
</P>
<P>
   A subplot was seen in every banner: this was also singular
moment for the Bush family.
</P>
<P>
   In a box seat sat the nominee's father, former President Bush,
himself the son of a US senator. Ousted from office by the
Clinton-Gore victory in 1992, former President Bush has largely
refrained from dwelling on his defeat but this week he dutifully
made the rounds of television interviews to promote his son.
</P>
<P>
   On the convention floor stood another Bush son, Jeb, the
governor of Florida and the man whom some family friends initially
believed was most likely to seek the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   And on the stage was the graduate of Sam Houston Elementary
School in Midland, Texas _ as well as the elite institutions of
Andover, Yale and Harvard _ who presented himself as the outsider,
a man who ``may lack the polish of Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush portrayed his lack of Washington experience as a virtue.
``I don't have enemies to fight,'' Bush said. ``And I have no stake
in the bitter arguments of the last few years. I want to change the
tone of Washington to one of civility and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, said brother Jeb Bush, the Texas governor
``looks like a president to me now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago I wouldn't have told you this,'' Jeb Bush said in
an interview on Good Morning America. ``In all honesty, I thought
he had the capacity to be a president, but today when I see him,
it's different. ... He's got the right stuff, and I'm incredibly
proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate's other brother, Marvin, gave a similar
assessment. Saying he would not have imagined this of his older
brother two decades ago, Marvin Bush said the Texas governor had
``channeled his energy into positive things, and as a result of
that, he's been a great achiever ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People have suggested that being the son of George Bush is an
easy thing. It's not. So he is a survivor,'' Marvin Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, candidates look for a post-convention bounce after the
acceptance speech, but Bush headed into the evening enjoying a
sizable jump in the polls from his choice of Dick Cheney as vice
president and the party's seamless convention. In a poll taken
before Bush spoke, the Texas governor led Al Gore by 48 percent to
34 percent, according to the ``Battleground'' survey sponsored by
the Internet company, Voter.com. The survery has a reported margin
of error of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping for even more bounce in the polls, Bush treaded carefully
as he approached the political battles of the fall. Twelve years
ago, his father erased a 17-point deficit in the against Michael
Dukakis with an acceptance speech promise of a ``kinder, gentler
America,'' a theme the Texas governor echoed in tone in his speech.
But there were major differences: The elder Bush told voters that
the best follow-up to eight years of Reaganism were a continuation
of Republicanism. Bush's son, known universally as ``W,''
implicitly acknowledged the prosperity during eight years of
Clintonism, but said a different party should occupy the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bush made no surprising policy declaration as his
father did with the 1988 vow of ``Read My Lips, No New Taxes.'' The
promise helped elect the elder Bush but the breaking of that vow
played a major role in his defeat by the Clinton-Gore team in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   A week of carefully planned festivities, filled with mostly
sunny speeches and rousing musical appearances, built toward Bush's
moment. The Bush campaign oversaw every aspect of the convention,
ordering up themes of diversity and unity while playing down
dissent. Many issues that divide Republicans went unmentioned:
Colin Powell didn't mention his support of abortion rights, nor did
Senator John McCain's press his case for overhaul of the campaign
finance system.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did bring up the issue of abortion, which has long divided
his party, but gingerly. Instead of vowing to work for passage of a
constitutional amendment to ban abortions, as called for in the
newly adopted GOP platform, Bush laid out a milder-sounding marker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know good people disagree on this issue, but surely we can
agree on ways to value life by promoting adoption and parental
notification, and when Congress sends me a bill against
partial-birth abortion, I will sign it into law,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush devoted a portion of the speech to concrete policies,
emphasizing the five ideas he routinely features on the campaign
trail: Social Security, education reform, tax-cutting, building the
military and expanding Medicare to include prescription drugs. He
honed in on a specific program, saying: ``Now is the time to make
Head Start an early learning program, teach all of our children to
read, and renew the promise of America's public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea was not new; Bush has long said he hopes to move the
Head Start program into the Department of Education. But Head Start
has been in the news ever since Bush's announced his running mate
pick of Dick Cheney, who voted against funding for Head Start while
a member of the US House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not follow the example set by Cheney on Wednesday
night, when when the former defense secretary elicited thunderous
applause with by borrowing an attack first used by Gore in 1992
against Bush's father. ``It's time for them to go!'' Cheney said of
Clinton-Gore, just as Gore had said of Bush-Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Bush instead appeared as a gentler warrior, preaching harmony,
civility and respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will seize this moment of American promise. We will use
these good times for great goals,'' Bush said. ``We will confront
the hard issues _ threats to our national security, threats to our
health and retirement security _ before the challenges of our time
become crises for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on the wave of publicity generated by his formal
nomination, Bush plans to embark Friday on a three-day train trip
through swing states, starting in Pittsburgh and ending on Sunday
night in Missouri after a detour through Michigan. He is then
expected to spend several days at home in Austin, before heading to
the West Coast next week to campaign with McCain, his former rival
who during the convention emerged as an outspoken supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting Robert Frost, and indirectly raising the issue of
President Clinton's conduct in the Oval Office, Bush said that the
highest hope of the Founding Fathers was ``to occupy the land with
character.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And that, 13 generations later, is still our goal,'' Bush
said, ``to occupy the land with character.''

BUSH LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN WITH APPEAL TO SWING VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   (EDS: New material throughout based on speech text)
 &HT;    By STEWART M. POWELL   
 c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
PHILADELPHIA _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush accepted the Republican
nomination for president Thursday night by vowing to extend the
``promise of prosperity to every forgotten corner'' of America as
he sought the support of independent voters and crossover Democrats
in his quest to become the first son to follow a father to the
White House since 1824. &QC; 
Bush, an affable, pragmatic Republican, told cheering,
placard-waving delegates and guests packed into the 22,000-seat
convention center that the nation ``can begin again'' led by a
party of ``idealism and inclusion.'' The 54-year-old son of former
President George Bush vowed to ``seize this moment of American
promise'' and ``use these good times for great goals.''
<P>
   Bush, accusing the Clinton-Gore administration of having
``coasted through prosperity'' and ``squandered'' opportunities,
ignited partisan loyalists with the repeated refrain: ``This
administration had its moment. They had their chance. They have not
led. We will.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's acceptance speech was the dramatic climax of the GOP's
four-day convention that was characterized by soft-pedaling of such
divisive social issues as abortion and gay rights. The roster of
convention speakers included a large number of minority-group
members, a selection that contrasted sharply with the
overwhelmingly white ethnic composition of the delegates. It was
all part of Bush's efforts to redefine his party as mainstream with
no radical tinges.
</P>
<P>
   With his parents proudly watching from the audience, Bush
broadly sketched plans to overhaul public schools, strengthen
Social Security and add prescription drug benefits to Medicare _
themes that are more often invoked by Democratic candidates than
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He vowed to ``confront the hard issues'' such as threats from
abroad and problems besetting Americans' health and retirement
systems at home before ``the challenges of our time become crises
for our children.'' Bush added: ``Prosperity can be a tool in our
hands _ used to build and better our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush declared: ``Grant me a mandate and I will use it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a hallmark address that he worked on for weeks, Bush
emphasized that his brand of ``compassionate conservatism'' would
reach out to disadvantaged Americans who feel left behind amid the
longest economic boom in American history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are their country too,'' Bush told delegates, adding: ``We
will extend the promise of prosperity to every forgotten corner of
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a graduate of Yale and Harvard Business School who ran oil
companies, the Texas Rangers baseball team and advised his father
during the Bush presidency, cast himself as a rough-hewn,
plain-spoken political outsider ready to take on the entrenched and
unpopular powerbrokers in the nation's capital. Bush said his life
in the big sky country of Midland, Texas, had left him with ``more
than an accent'' _ it had given him ``an outlook'' of can-do
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Bush contended that while he ``may lack the polish of
Washington'' he wasn't burdened by ``a lot of things that come with
Washington experience'' such as ``enemies to fight'' or a ``stake
in the bitter arguments of the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush lamented the lost ``promise'' of President Clinton, a
fellow Baby Boomer blessed with ```so many talents, so much charm,
such great skill'' _ all harnessed for ``no great purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush criticized Vice President Al Gore more directly, deriding
his rival's repeated criticism of GOP policy proposals as ``risky
schemes.'' Bush said Gore is ``always seeing the tunnel at the end
of the light'' and he played off the Great Depression phrase of
President Franklin D. Roosevelt to sum up Gore's approach as ``the
only thing he has to offer is fear itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush implicitly contrasted himself with Gore's alleged reliance
on polls, saying that he ``did not need to take your pulse before I
know my own mind,'' adding: ``I do not reinvent myself at every
turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, linking Gore closely with Clinton, said that after the
Clinton-Gore administration's failures ``they come asking for
another chance, another shot.'' Bush countered: ``This is not a
time for third chances. It is a time for new beginnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush underscored his bipartisan appeal to swing voters by paying
homage to Republican and Democratic presidents alike, including
Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Ronald
Reagan. He spoke sadly of Clinton, rather than critically.
</P>
<P>
   Bush warned his allies that what lies ahead before election day
on Nov. 7 will be ``a tough race, down to the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke amid fresh evidence that the GOP was winning support
for its nominee by devoting the convention to showcasing diversity
and avoiding messy ideological squabbles. The latest bipartisan
Voter.com-Battleground public opinion survey, conducted by
Democratic pollster Celinda Lake and GOP pollster Ed Goeas, showed
that the four-day GOP convention had given the Bush-Cheney ticket a
sizable 14-percentage point edge over a Gore-led ticket, with Bush
leading Gore, 48 percent to 34 percent. &QC; 
The survey also showed Bush seizing an 18 percentage point edge
over Gore among independents and a 6 percentage point edge among
women _ both constituencies won by the Clinton-Gore ticket in the
last two presidential elections to enable the elected Democrats to
hold the White House for two successive terms for the first time
since 1936. &QC; 
Gore hopes to begin a comeback with his scheduled announcement on
Tuesday of his Democratic running mate. In 11 of the 12
presidential elections since 1952, the candidate who led in the
polls on Labor Day won the election. Only Ronald Reagan came from
behind in 1980 to beat President Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cheney planned to storm out of the GOP gathering on
Friday for a three-day campaign trip by train through Midwest swing
states including Ohio and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans closed out their sixth convention in Philadelphia
since 1856 with a new GOP anthem, entitled ``We the People,'' a
blend of rock , blues and country written and released by country
singer Billy Ray Cyrus. The convention came to an end with 150,000
red, white and blue balloons showering down upon the delegates.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bush, grandson of the late Sen. Prescott Bush, R-Conn., has been
governor of the nation's third most populous state for
five-and-a-half years _ making the Republican standard bearer the
least experienced politician to lead the party since former World
War II allied commander Dwight D. Eisenhower sought the presidency
in 1952. &QC; 
Bush's running mate has been away from the political fray since
1989, serving as the Bush administration's defense secretary and
later as chief executive of Halliburton Corp., a worldwide energy
services firm based in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seeks to become the first presidential son to capture the
presidency since John Quincy Adams followed his father, John Adams,
to the White House 24 years after his father's term ended. Bush
hopes to win back the White House from which his father was ousted
by then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton and then-Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn.,
in 1992. Bush gave the next generation of the Bush clan a boost by
awarding his 24-year-old nephew, George P. Bush, son of Florida
Gov. Jeb Bush, the chance to address the GOP convention in both
English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The election is the first contest since World War II in which
neither candidate served in a fateful conflict that shaped the
modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Bush lightly brushed off any suggestion that
his address would be the most important of his life, quipping:
``The most important speech was when I asked my wife to marry me _
and that went okay.''
</P>
<P>
   Before exercising on a stationary bicycle and reviewing his
speech, Bush stopped by Philadelphia's Hahnemann University
Hospital to visit former President Gerald Ford, who was admitted on
Wednesday following two minor strokes. Bush spent 20 minutes with
the 87-year-old former president, who told Bush, ``I'll be
campaigning for you in a couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said Ford was expected to make a full recovery. &QC; 
Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway fired a salvo at Bush even before
the GOP candidate had mounted the podium to deliver his address. &QC; 
``Given the high praise his father received in 1992, George junior
has a lot to live up to tonight,'' said Hattaway. ``Tonight,
America will see if there is any substance behind the smirk.''

VERIZON TO CREDIT BAY STATE CUSTOMERS WITH $42 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Regulators Thursday ordered Verizon Communications to
give its Massachusetts customers nearly $42 million in credits and
rate cuts even though the service problems that prompted the
reductions were corrected more than four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say the controversial decision prompted heated
discussions among the five commissioners of the state Department of
Telecommunications and Energy. Four of the commissioners ultimately
voted in favor of the ruling, while the commission chairman, James
Connelly, refused to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling means Verizon will have to issue a one-time credit
sometime this year of about $5 per line and make a similar-size
reduction in its rate structure next year. But the philosophical
underpinnings of the decision were more controversial than the
actual dollar amounts.
</P>
<P>
   The price-cap formula state regulators use to set Verizon's
rates in Massachusetts is a complex equation involving
productivity, inflation, and service quality. In 1995 and 1996, the
first two years of the price-cap system, Verizon, formerly Bell
Atlantic, failed to meet service quality standards and saw its
rates reduced as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon has met the service standards every year since, but
because of the way the rate-setting formula is calculated the
earlier service problems continue to have a carryover effect.
According to Thursday's decision, the carryover effect is $20.87
million this year and next year.
</P>
<P>
   In its November rate filing, Verizon did not seek to recover
some $55 million in rate reductions in 1997, 1998, and 1999 that
were also tied to the service problems from previous years. But it
did withhold $20.87 million in rate reductions that would have been
required this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Telecommunications and Energy Thursday agreed
with Verizon's analysis but said it wasn't going to start tampering
with the formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree with Verizon that the current operation of the
price-cap formula leads to the result described,'' said the ruling.
Despite that, however, the agency said it was not about to change
the rules in the middle of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make a change to these pricing rules would be inconsistent
with what we've done in the past,'' said Michael Isenberg, director
of the DTE's telecommunications division.
</P>
<P>
   The current rate-setting system is scheduled to expire at the
end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very disappointed the DTE did not approve our request to
eliminate ongoing penalities for service levels in 1994 and 1995
that we've long since improved,'' said Verizon spokesman John
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   George Dean, chief of Attorney General Thomas Reilly's regulated
industries division, applauded the ruling, saying the formula used
to set Verizon's rates is working as it was intended. ``They're
just trying to erase their past problems,'' Dean said.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, the attorney general's office was
unsuccessful. In its November rate filing, Verizon said it was
going to accomplish part of this year's rate reductions by
eliminating the $1.46-a-month touch-tone charge for business lines.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's office argued it was unfair to eliminate the business
charge entirely while continuing to charge residential customers 46
cents a month for touch-tone service. ``It's unfair to give it away
to one group and not another,'' Dean said.
</P>
<P>
   But the DTE allowed Verizon to proceed with its rate
adjustments, noting business and residential rates often differ in
many respects.
</P>
<P>
   A DTE spokesman Thursday declined comment on why chairman
Connelly refused to sign the ruling. Sources said Connelly
supported Verizon's position but decided not to write a dissent or
even sign the order given the majority against him. Before being
appointed chairman, Connelly was the consumer representative on the
commission.

SOME GUIDES TO A REDEFINED RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 6) 
 By FRED BROCK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Books aimed at the growing, and increasingly affluent, senior
market are steadily filling bookstore shelves around the country.
Here is a sampling of some recent additions, which touch on
subjects from retirement to the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   RETIREMENT MATTERS _ Retiring means more than just quitting
work. It is one of life's major transitions that can carry
heavy-duty emotional and psychological issues, involving nothing
less than a redefinition of the self. ``Breaking the Watch: The
Meaning of Retirement in America,'' by Joel S. Savishinsky (Cornell
University Press, $26), and ``Taking Retirement: A Beginner's
Diary,'' by Carl H. Klaus (Beacon Press, $16), both grapple with
the meaning and ramifications of this transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breaking the Watch,'' which will be available in October,
takes a broader look at retirement by examining the lives of 26
people _ 13 men and 13 women from various backgrounds and
professions _ in an upstate New York town. ``Taking Retirement'' is
the diary of one man's efforts to come to terms with his first year
of full retirement. But despite this difference in focus, both
books go right to the main issues, practical and otherwise, that we
all are facing or will face one day.
</P>
<P>
   Savishinsky, a professor of social sciences at Ithaca College,
does an admirable job of interviewing his 26 retirees on a wide
range of topics. Partly, he succeeds because he lets his subjects
have their say. The book is divided into six major chapters and a
final, smaller one, ``Conclusions: Lesson and Cautions.''
</P>
<P>
   One nit: The author does not use the real names of the town,
which he calls ``Shelby,'' or the people he interviews. He writes
that this is to protect their privacy. Well, maybe, but there are
plenty of nonfiction books about considerably more controversial
subjects that don't need that cover.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's the voices of the retirees that power the book:
</P>
<P>
   _``Retirement is like a progressive illness _ and a spiritual
experience. There's a loss of efficacy, but the moral side grows.''
</P>
<P>
   _``In retirement, it's not the watches that get broken, it's the
promises. No one who talked to me about a job ever came through. I
came to feel you can't rely on anyone, and I'd never felt that way
before.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I call it `drift time.' It's not being in a fixed frame of
work or routine. You bicycle instead of drive through life, letting
each day unfold, taking you wherever it does.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``My children are so uptight. Where did I go wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Taking Retirement,'' Klaus, 68, a former college professor
and the founder of the nonfiction writing program at the University
of Iowa, uses his diary to take us inside his struggle to come to
terms with a new life after 42 years of teaching. His musings
chronicle the highs and lows as he copes with worries about money
and health and with fears that he has been cast adrift, without the
moorings of work. In the end, it is partly the work he continues to
do _ his writing _ that lets him find balance in his new life.
</P>
<P>
   BITS AND BYTES _ For seniors who are anxious about jumping into
the world of computers and the Internet, two books can be a big
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer Friendly,'' by Raymond Steinbacher, is a guide for
those who are really beginners. Clearly written and easy to follow,
it begins with the assumption that the reader knows nothing about
computers. The book is available only from the publisher, Green
Tree Press in Erie, Pa., (800-834-3888). The price is $15.95,
including shipping.
</P>
<P>
   `` Modem's Internet Guide for Seniors,'' by Richard Sherman
(Sybex, $19.99), is an excellent map for navigating the Internet.
Its lists of Web sites are especially valuable. However, the book's
constant efforts at cuteness can get a little tiring.
</P>
<P>
   SOCIAL SECURITY _ If you're confused by the political discourse
over the future of Social Security, two books from the University
of Chicago Press may help sort out the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security: The Phony Crisis,'' by Dean Baker and Mark
Weisbrot ($22), argues that because of overly conservative economic
projections, Social Security is not in danger and doesn't need to
be ``saved'' by putting some of its funds into individual stock
market accounts, as George W. Bush, the Republican presidential
candidate, and others advocate. This is a very readable book by two
economists that is actually influencing the political debate..
</P>
<P>
   ``Making Sense of Social Security Reform,'' by Daniel Shaviro
($25), is due out next month and does a good job of explaining the
nuts and bolts of Social Security. In the end, Shaviro, a law
professor, comes down in favor of what he calls ``progressive
privatization,'' in which some money would be transferred at
retirement from the individual accounts of people who have done
well with them to those who have not. I wouldn't want to bet on
that idea getting past conservative Republicans in Congress.

ON THE CONTRARY: WHO CARES, AS LONG AS IT'S NATURAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 6) 
 By DANIEL AKST    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there's a sure-fire way to sell something these days, it's to
claim the thing is natural _ even if it's a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   ``Natural American Spirit Products,'' the excruciatingly cool
Web site says solemnly, ``were created based on our belief in the
traditional Native American usage of tobacco _ in moderation, in
its natural state. Our brand name was chosen as a symbol of respect
for this tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Above those words is a row of mannered photographs showing
hipsters smoking what are presumably Natural American Spirit
cigarettes. It's a seductive lineup; you can just see yourself
puffing away, joining this gallery of quirky individualists.
</P>
<P>
   The Natural used to be Roy Hobbs, Bernard Malamud's mythic
baseball player, but now it's an obsession that many of us seem to
share about a life we have somehow lost. In the grip of something
like lapsarian fever, people buy natural cigarettes presumably to
be sure that when the cancer comes, it wasn't caused by any
horrible chemical additives. They shop at health food stores and
pay outrageous prices for herbal remedies to be consumed in
blissful indifference to the absence of scientific support or
approval by the Food and Drug Administration. A new book, ``The
Soul of the New Consumer'' by David Lewis and Darren Bridger, says
the key to success in business is to give people authenticity, and,
of course, suggests a few sophisticated techniques for
accomplishing this.
</P>
<P>
   Natural? Authentic? Some fairyland of trees and grass that we
can traverse in our sport utility vehicles? For women, a truly
natural life probably means having a dozen babies and spending all
the time in between breast-feeding. For men, I imagine, it's
spearing mammoths and dying at 30 of gangrene in a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that people have never before lived so far from
anything like ``the natural'' _ or worked harder to widen the
distance. And a good thing, too. The sooner we stop pretending, the
sooner businesses will stop fooling us with natural folderol. I
myself lead as unnatural life as possible, and I'm proud of it. If
you are reading these words, you shouldn't need reminding that
primitive hunter-gatherer societies had a terrible time getting
home delivery of The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   At some level, of course, people know that they are pretending.
They drive cars to natural childbirth classes. They buy natural
European spring water bottled in plastic and shipped thousands of
miles. They object in Internet discussion groups to genetically
engineered products. Is it any wonder that businesses respond by
marketing pretend ``natural'' products?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, to wake up one day in a world that knows the state of nature
is no more hospitable than the state of North Korea. Then we'll all
demand hard proof that herbal remedies are safe and effective,
instead of simply assuming that being herbal makes them OK We'll
recognize that some of the nastiest toxins we ingest are made by
Mother Nature without capitalism's help. And we'll be open to more
``unnatural'' technologies that actually increase safety, like food
irradiation.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, if you're selling something, natural goes with
traditional, as long as the second term is used the right way.
Clever marketers like Restoration Hardware, for instance, know that
people hanker for ``simpler times'' and stock the shelves
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Among the group that David Brooks has christened Bobos (for
bourgeois bohemians), the natural fetish extends even to children's
toys. One mother I know believed for a while that children
shouldn't play with stuff made of plastic, only wood. What
difference does it make? Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'm hoping for more products like Gatorade. My
favorite flavors are Riptide Rush, Alpine Snow and, in a truly
marvelous aqua hue, Glacier Freeze. Not only do they taste great,
but there is no pretense whatsoever of any naturalness about them.
</P>
<P>
   Mine remains an unfashionable opinion. I bought a tasty
electric-blue sports drink once from a California sales clerk who
scorned its artificiality.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what's natural?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the earth,'' she replied disdainfully.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently she has never visited the Natural American Spirit Web
site, which (at the government's behest) offers the perfect
rejoinder: ``No additives in our tobacco does NOT mean a safer
cigarette.''

   PHILADELPHIA _ From the opening night speech Monday by Colin
Powell to a key role Thursday for Houston's Kirbyjon Caldwell, the
Republican Party strained mightily to put its best and most diverse
face forward this week.
</P>
<P>
   There was the retired army general chiding his party for its
anti-affirmative action position; the chief national security
adviser, Condoleezza Rice, speaking glowingly about the Republican
presidential nominee, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   There was Caldwell, the pastor of Windsor Village United
Methodist Church, earnestly introducing Bush as a man who will lift
all economic boats as Democrats have not. There were black singers,
black dancers, black music, black children, black preachers, a
veritable army of black speakers.
</P>
<P>
   By no means least, there was the ubiquitous black U.S. Rep. J.C.
Watts, R-Okla., speaking from the podium, mingling at fund-raisers,
being honored at a gala and, just hours before Bush accepted the
nomination, holding a press conference to defend the parade of
color.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are seeing does not necessarily reflect our past.
What you are seeing does not necessarily reflect our present,''
said Watts, surrounded by several dozen African-American
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it does do is reflect our future.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by as many African-Americans as were seen together
throughout the convention, Watts called the convention the start of
a massive Republican Party effort to expand its minority base.
``This is only the beginning,'' said Watts, announcing a new
outreach Web site called Talk2Us2000.com.
</P>
<P>
   Critics were unimpressed. Even as the GOP was preparing to
anoint Bush, the Rev. Al Sharpton was hammering the conferees for
false advertising. Calling the proceedings ``a cosmetic
production,'' Sharpton accurately pointed out that only 4 percent
of the GOP delegates here are black.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like all 4 percent of them were given keynote
addresses,'' said Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, however much Republican Party leaders succeeded in
banishing their most right-wing and racially divisive elements from
center stage here, the reality is that the 2000 convention still
looked very much like the 1996 and 1992 conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blacks still are largely Democratic and that is not going to
change anytime soon, no matter what the Republican Party does,''
said David Bositis, senior analyst at the Joint Center for
Political and Economic Studies, a Washington, D.C., think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what has made them such an important voter bloc.
Democrats have had to rely significantly on the black population
for success and that is not going to change, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans under the Bush banner are not necessarily aiming for
a significantly larger slice of the black electorate, said Bositis.
``They're after the moderate voters, the independents, the whites
who are turned off by the party's intolerant and insensitive
image.''
</P>
<P>
   If they also pick up at least some additional black votes, said
Bositis, so much the better. Blacks were 10 percent of the 1998
electorate, the bulk concentrated in 22 states where they
potentially can swing elections.
</P>
<P>
   There also has been some genuine GOP progress. Black delegates
this year numbered 85, not much considering a total of 2,066, but a
63 percent increase over the 52 black delegates four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Watts, deputy permanent co-chair of the convention, Thursday
promised to personally try and triple the number of black delegates
to the 2004 convention. A Bush presidency is a key first step, said
Watts. Houston's Caldwell, who has faced considerable heat from
some of his black congregants for appearing here, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``My speaking at the convention tonight has been a lightning rod
for information and sharing,'' said Caldwell optimistically.
``Never in the history of the Republican convention and maybe never
in the history of the Democratic convention have so many
Houstonians paid such close attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nothing else, it's going to help us take a more serious and
balanced look at the issues instead of just walking into the booth
and pulling a big lever. Let's look at what the candidates are
saying
</P>
<P>
   ``Vote for the program and the plan as opposed to the party and
the politics.'' &QL;

IF THE MAITRE D' CAN'T GET YOU A TABLE, TRY YOUR PC 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 6) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Do you find yourself in Manhattan for a long weekend
when suddenly, on Friday afternoon, you are overcome by a desire
for a world-class meal. Why not call Lespinasse, that temple of
Francophile fantasies, where a bowl of soup (albeit with truffles)
can set you back $35.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Because in most cases, the next available table at one
of the city's few four-star restaurants may not become available
until days, or even weeks, from now.
</P>
<P>
   But about 1 p.m. just a few Fridays back, if you had bypassed
the reservation desk and logged on to a Web site called
OpenTable.com, you would have found after five or so clicks of the
mouse that the impossible is sometimes possible: A table for two,
available at 7:15 p.m., most likely because of a late cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   No busy signal. No voice saying, ``I'm terribly sorry.'' Just a
credit card number, an e-mail confirmation and the table would have
been yours.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of easy online transaction that has already
transformed the way that millions of people book airline flights,
hotel rooms, rental cars and concert and movie tickets _ even
doctor's appointments. But until recently, online reservations were
seldom used in the restaurant business, mostly because of its
fragmented nature and the traditional leanings of many chefs and
owners.
</P>
<P>
   About six months ago, however, an invasion of young Web
entrepreneurs began in earnest in the industry, restaurateurs say.
And two companies, OpenTable and Foodline.com, have emerged as
early leaders in a field that continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kalinowski, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, estimates
that 1,200 independent restaurants _ still a tiny fraction of the
industry _ have signed up with online-reservation companies. Just a
year ago, there were virtually none, with the exception of a few
restaurants that had developed their own online reservations
systems, including Tavern on the Green and the Russian Tea Room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rush is really on, and I think this is an industry where
you're going to see a shakeout pretty soon,'' said Andy England, a
vice president for marketing at OpenTable, which is based in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Opentable and Foodline, which control about three-quarters of
the online reservations market, and about 20 smaller competitors
have thrown up makeshift offices in dozens of cities. They have
hired squadrons of sales agents, who have been knocking on
restaurant doors and staging flashy computerized sales pitches, to
convince restaurateurs that like it or not, they will inevitably
have to branch out from their handwritten reservation books and
reliance on the memories of maitre d's.
</P>
<P>
   While there are big differences in the companies' hardware and
software, as well as their appearance on the Web, their argument is
essentially the same: Online reservations are both easier and more
accurate. A customer can check on the availability of tables at any
time, the companies say, and can worry less about a reservation
being lost. (Some people carry along printouts of e-mail
confirmations to the restaurant.) And if a Web surfer's restaurant
of choice is full, he or she can easily scan a list of others, read
reviews or scan prices and menus. ESeated.com, a Boston company
that concentrates on corporate reservations, is even working to
bundle restaurants into business travel packages.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant owners, however, may see benefits beyond an immediate
increase in sales. They can more easily determine not only who
their regulars are, but also their semi-regulars and their
dedicated summer vacation visitors. They can figure out which
repeat customers like window tables, which ones are allergic to
shellfish, or which ones break the bank on wine. They can also
identify the chronic no-shows who leave restaurateurs holding
precious tables empty. (Absentees take note: Foodline says it may
charge $20 for not keeping a reservation, depending on the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The information collected in online reservations systems is
intended to help owners track customers the same way they now keep
tabs on orders using computers and touch screens, which have
appeared in most big restaurants over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   But Web reservation sites have not had an easy time convincing
restaurateurs that all these things are worth the money. Most
online reservations companies sell the hardware _ touch screens,
computers and other equipment _ and then charge monthly for
connections to the site, for technical support and for backing up
all the information on the restaurants' computers.
</P>
<P>
   Foodline charges a $500 installation fee for the hardware, which
includes a touch screen that is usually placed near the front of
the restaurant, plus $200 a month for the service. OpenTable's
monthly service charge is $100, while its installation fee also
starts at $500 but can go higher if more equipment is needed. Both
services charge $1 a head for each online reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Sirio Maccioni, the owner of Le Cirque 2000, another of New
York's four-star restaurants, has given much the same response to
every one of the pitches he has heard: ``He says, `If there is a
database better than me, you're welcome to put it in,''' said
Maccioni's son, Marco, co-owner of Osteria del Circo in New York
and a director at Le Cirque. In other words, the elder Maccioni,
who has run Le Cirque 2000 and its legendary predecessor, Le
Cirque, since 1974, will never need a computer to keep track of his
best customers and their predilections.
</P>
<P>
   But that may not be the case for restaurants that are not
family-operated. High staff turnover can mean that valued patrons
are sometimes overlooked by chefs and owners whose time is being
increasingly stretched by the commitments of writing cookbooks,
appearing on cooking shows and opening new branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Restaurants will tell us, `Our maitre d' is great and he
remembers everybody,'' said England of OpenTable. ``And we say:
`Well, what happens if he falls in love and moves to Barcelona?
Your database is in his head.'''
</P>
<P>
   Drew Nieporent, who owns and manages several top New York
restaurants, including Nobu and Montrachet, recalled that he once
missed greeting Steve Forbes, the former presidential aspirant,
because a reservationist's handwriting made the name look like
Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to know everything about everybody who comes
through the door,'' Nieporent said. ``But I do want to be able to
manage the information I do have a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he said, many of the 2,000 seats in all of his
restaurants, including those in San Francisco and London, will be
available for reservations through Foodline.com, on whose board
Nieporent serves.
</P>
<P>
   It is still much too early to tell which of the companies, none
of which have gone public, will emerge as the Ticketmaster of the
field. All are scrambling to get an edge not only in quantity of
restaurants, but also in quality, on the theory that many
restaurants and chains will gravitate toward companies that have
signed up the best.
</P>
<P>
   While Nieporent has allied with Foodline, Danny Meyer, co-owner
of the Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern, Tabla and 11 Madison
Park in New York, work with OpenTable. Charlie Trotter, whose
namesake restaurant in Chicago has been consistently rated as one
of the best in America, announced recently that he would take
reservations through eSeated.com. And the Four Seasons in New York
now works with iSeatz.com, based in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the flurry of activity, the restaurant industry has far
to go before it catches up with airlines and hotels in the use of
online reservations. The Industry Standard recently estimated that
fewer than 1 percent of all restaurant reservations are now made
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, what we're trying to do is change the way a whole
industry operates,'' said Paul Lightfoot, the president and chief
executive of Foodline. ``It's going to take a little time.''

SRI LINKA CONSIDERS NEW CONSTITUTION TO BENEFIT TAMIL MINORITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENNAI, India _ After years of procrastination, Sri Lanka's
governing coalition proposed Thursday in Parliament that a new
constitution be adopted to give greater political autonomy to the
minority Tamil population in an attempt to help end the
17-year-long war waged by separatist rebels for a Tamil homeland.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure faces a highly uncertain fate. Despite months of
talks aimed at building bipartisan support for the new
constitution, the main opposition organization, the United National
Party, decided recently to vote against it.
</P>
<P>
   In a demonstration that was typical of Sri Lanka's rancorous
highly partisan politics _ especially with national elections
scheduled for the fall _opposition members of Parliament booed
President Chandrika Kumaratunga on Thursday as she introduced the
document and then tore the pages of the proposed constitution to
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Kumaratunga is quite unlikely to win passage of the measure in
the House without some defections from the United National Party,
as well as support from small Tamil parties. The government needs a
two-thirds vote to pass the constitution, but has only a narrow
majority in the House. If adopted by Parliament, the measure would
then face a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This endeavor, in the final count, would be the only
alternative to violence and murder in resolving the Tamil question
and for peace in our land,'' the presidential secretariat said in a
statement. It has been the lack of a clear-cut two-thirds majority
that had discouraged Kumaratunga from introducing the constitution.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The six-year term of this Parliament ends on Aug. 24, and she
has apparently decided to gamble that she can cobble together
enough votes or go to the voters seeking a bigger parliamentary
majority that would help have the constitution passed later.
</P>
<P>
   The years of delay in introducing the constitution have deeply
disappointed Tamil voters, who joined with voters from the majority
Sinhalese population to support Kumaratunga in large numbers in
1994, when she was elected president on a peace platform.
</P>
<P>
   Early in her term, Justice Minister G.L. Peiris and a Tamil
constitutional scholar, Neelan Tiruchelvam, went to work to draft a
constitution to gave Tamils more power. But for years it languished
as the governing People's Alliance and the United National, both
dominated by the mostly-Buddhist Sinhalese majority, bickered.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Tiruchelvam, the leading moderate Tamil
parliamentarian, was assassinated by a suicide bomber widely
believed to have been a member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, the separatist group that has been fighting for 17 years for
a separate state in the north and east, where Tamils, mostly
Hindus, are in the majority. More than 60,000 people have died in
the war.
</P>
<P>
   The idealistic hopes that many moderate Sri Lankans had for the
constitutional proposal have been worn down in the years of
waiting. The measure was greeted Thursday with demonstrations that
show the deep ethnic divisions between the Tamils and the
Sinhalese.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand people demonstrated against the proposed
constitution Thursday in Colombo, among them influential members of
the Buddhist clergy and hard-line Sinhala groups who say the
measure gives the Tamils too much power and could lead to a
division of the country. The banned Tiger rebels were, of course,
not in evidence, although heavy security was evident on the
streets. They have already declared their opposition to the new
constitution on the ground that nothing short of an independent
nation will satisfy them.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Kumaratunga said, the draft constitution will be
sent to the Tigers. ``Stop the war and come for talks,'' she said
in her speech, addressing the rebels.

ARMY PROPOSAL CALLS FOR EXPANDED NATIONAL GUARD ROLE IN COMBAT

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Army is proposing to give the National Guard a
greatly increased role in combat, which would mean that tens of
thousands of the part-time soldiers would almost certainly be
mobilized and sent to fight if war broke out on the Korean
Peninsula or in the Persian Gulf, senior Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The combat divisions of the Guard, which a generation ago was
the place to go to avoid fighting in Vietnam, have been assigned no
role in the Army's war plans since the fall of the Berlin Wall in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Army's proposals are approved, six out of the eight
divisions _ each with roughly 15,000 soldiers _ would be assigned
specific roles in the Defense Department's newly revised war plans,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The move reflects the Army's increasing dependence on the Guard
as it has reduced the size of the active force, even as it has
taken on new missions from the Balkans to Africa to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War, the National Guard's combat divisions
were held literally in reserve, to be mobilized only if the Soviet
Union started World War III by invading western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last few years, the Army, like the other armed
services, has increasing turned to the National Guard and Reserve
to support military operations around the world. In March, troops
from the 49th Armored Division of the Texas Guard took over the
U.S. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, the first time since the
Korean War that a guard division commanded an overseas operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's proposal, drafted last week, would represent an even
more marked shift in the Guard's role that could have profound
effects on its budget, equipment and training _ and on the
willingness of people to join a service that has traditionally
demanded only a weekend a month and two weeks each summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making a big step toward better use of the National
Guard in the nation's military strategy, particularly in the war
plans area,'' said Maj. Gen. Michael W. Davidson, the assistant to
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for guard affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The war plans _ or ``op plans,'' as they are known _ are highly
classified documents prepared by the nation's regional commanders
in chief and regularly updated. In the event war breaks out, they
detail which forces would be used to fight and where; they also
assign roles in other military operations, like peacekeeping
missions, or in ``backfilling'' for other units sent to war.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal now being considered, the Army would assign
six of the Guard's eight combat divisions specific missions in the
war plans, according to two senior officials familiar the details.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the divisions would be assigned to participate in the
two ``major theater wars'' _ in the Persian Gulf and in Korea _
that are the bedrock of national military planning. The other two
divisions would have missions supporting other operations in the
Southern Command, which has responsibility for Central and South
America, and in the European Command.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials declined to discuss the Guard's specific
missions, saying that details of the proposal are still being
ironed out and must be approved by the Army's civilian and military
leaders before being formally presented to the Joint Chiefs of
Staff and the regional commanders later this month. The Army has
also not yet decided which of the divisions would be assigned to
each mission.
</P>
<P>
   If the Joint Chiefs accept the Army's proposal, then the Army's
chief of staff, Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, is expected to unveil the
proposal at the annual convention of the National Guard Association
of the United States next month.
</P>
<P>
   Individual units, including the Guard's 15 combat brigades, have
for some years been assigned missions in the war plans and, like
the 49th Armored Division, have increasingly participated in Army
operations. But the fact that the war plans have not included the
eight guard divisions has been perhaps the greatest source of
contention between the Army and the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Guard commanders have long complained that without specific
missions, the divisions have received the lowest priority when it
came to dividing up dwindling budgets, leaving Guard divisions with
older equipment and less money for training.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, now the
Republican vice-presidential nominee, and Gen. Colin Powell, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, tried to make deep cuts in
the Guard divisions, arguing that the Army no longer needed so many
reserve combat forces that had no real mission. But those efforts
where blocked in Congress, where the Guard has had strong support.
</P>
<P>
   The Army National Guard was increased to 10 divisions during the
Reagan build-up in the 1980s. But after the Cold War, it was
reduced back to eight while the regular Army was reduced from 18 to
10 today.
</P>
<P>
   The world has changed since then. As the Army has shrunk by 40
percent from its Cold War high of nearly 800,000 troops, its 10
active divisions have become increasingly taxed, officials say, by
the pace of operations like those today in the Persian Gulf, the
Sinai Peninsula, Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, two of the active divisions _ the 10th Mountain and
the 1st Mechanized Infantry _ classified themselves as unready to
fulfill their missions in the war plans because so many of their
troops were committed to the Balkans. Army officials said it was
that predicament that forced them to consider relying on the Guard
to fulfill some of the war-time missions and other objectives.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Secretary of Defense William Cohen has made
better use of the Guard and Reserves a priority, ordering the
services to remove ``all structural barriers'' between active and
reserve forces.

 WASHINGTON: reserve forces.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Guard has made major contributions to the nation's
wars. Guard divisions fought in both World Wars; the 29th Infantry
Division of Virginia was one of two divisions that landed on Omaha
Beach on D-Day. Two guard divisions fought in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, the divisions have not been deployed to
fight, though some units and individuals served as volunteers in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   During the Persian Gulf War in 1991, the Pentagon mobilized more
than 265,000 reservists, including 85,000 guard members, but most
of them served in support roles.
</P>
<P>
   During that war, the Pentagon did activate a combat tank brigade
from the Georgia National Guard, but after putting the unit through
two months of training, commanders deemed it unprepared for combat
and refused to send it to the Gulf _ a decision that causes
bitterness even today.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Pentagon, there remains lingering doubts about the
ability of the Guard divisions to be ready for combat, especially
in a major regional war, but with Shinseki pledging to fully
integrate the National Guard into the Army, officials say they are
determined to overcome them.
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Alexander, a retired major general who is executive
director of the National Guard Association in Washington, said the
Army's willingness to include the divisions in the war plans
signaled a significant change in its attitude toward the guard
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're satisfied there is a relevancy being established for the
Guard _ and relevancy is the key,'' he said. ``Once relevancy is
established, we are obligated to do whatever we can to see that it
is adequately resourced.''
</P>
<P>
   Including the divisions in the war plans will almost certainly
require the Army and the Guard to spend more on equipment and
training, though officials say it is far too early to estimate what
the costs would be. ``If we know they're going to be missioned,
they're going to have to have the equipment they need,'' one Army
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the Army will still have to set priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This nation as a whole is not going to spend the money to
bring every guard division, every reserve unit and every
active-duty division up to the pinnacle of readiness 24 hours a
day, 365 days a year,'' said P.T. Henry, the Army's assistant
secretary for reserve affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Another obstacle will be the amount of time it takes to mobilize
a guard division, compared with an active division, since most of
its soldiers serve only part time and, in many cases, are scattered
in units spread over several states.
</P>
<P>
   The war plans today require the Guard's combat brigades, with
roughly 2,000 soldiers, to be ready to deploy into combat within 90
days of mobilization.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they are now increasing the readiness standards
at the platoon level and working on a plan that would require the
guard divisions to be combat ready within 150 days.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean that the divisions would not likely be the first
ones deployed to a conflict, though one official noted that the
Army had six months after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 to
assemble the force that ultimately drove the Iraqis out.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the Army's proposal would also give the guard
divisions the role of filling in when an active division is pulled
away from an overseas base or from a peacekeeping mission like
those in Bosnia or Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest question will be the effect on recruiting
and retention. While many guard commanders have wanted an increased
role, the increasing possibility of deploying for war could cause
some of those who signed up to rethink their commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Charles L. Cragin, the assistant secretary of defense for
reserve affairs, said that the contract with the nation's citizen
soldiers has evolved as much as the role of the military in
general. He derides the widely-used phrase ``weekend warrior'' for
reservists because, he said, it simply is no longer relevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic premise throughout the Cold War was that unless the
Russians started pouring through the Fulda Gap,'' Cragin said,
referring to the hilly area that was once the border of eastern and
western Germany, ``we were not going to call up the reserves. The
reserve force was reserved. That equation has changed.''

LOOKING FOR A RARE DOUBLE

<P>
   After winning the Pennzoil Indiana Sprint Week, Jay Drake has
put himself in position to pull off a rare feat in United States
Auto Club competition.
</P>
<P>
   Drake, the former Val Verde, Calif., resident and Buena
(Ventura, Calif.) High graduate who makes his home in Indianapolis,
has a chance to win the USAC Sprint and Midget car championships.
He is second in both series.
</P>
<P>
   If he can earn both titles, he would be the first to do it since
Tony Stewart _ who also won the Silver Bullet Series title _ in
1995. The only other USAC driver to win the Sprint and Midget
titles in the same year was Rich Vogler in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were five (Sprint) races I didn't even go to,'' the
30-year-old Drake said. ``To be second in points is pretty
impressive. I wasn't expecting to run for either points titles.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake is coming off a week in which he won four of seven races
over 11 days in the Indiana Sprint Week. He also earned nearly
$25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty tough deal,'' Drake said. ``There were 50 cars
in each race and we won four of them. We actually should have won
five.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last three races of Indiana Sprint Week, Drake won twice.
His first win came July 28 in the Tony Hulman Classic at Terre
Haute Action Track, where he led all but two laps of the 30-lap
feature.
</P>
<P>
   In the next race the following day, Drake took the lead on lap
seven at Lincoln Park Speedway in Putnamville and won the 30-lap
feature.
</P>
<P>
   Drake won the pole but finished sixth in the final race of
Sprint Week on Sunday at Tri-State Speedway in Haubstadt.
</P>
<P>
   Cory Kruseman of Ventura won the final race of Indiana Sprint
Week.
</P>
<P>
   Drake finished with a 76-point lead over his nearest competitor,
Tony Elliott, who is leading the Sprint Car season standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just ran the dirt races at the start of the season,'' Drake
said. ``I didn't run any of the pavement. Now I've been able to run
(Elliott) down lately. I just wish I'd have run those other
races.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake trails Elliott by 88 points in the Sprint Car standings.
The Midget Car standings are a little tighter, with Drake trailing
Kasey Kahne by 73 points.
</P>
<P>
   The USAC Sprint Car Series makes its next stops at Hartford,
Mich., on Aug. 11 and at Salem, Ind., on Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rookies rule on NASCAR Busch Series: A week after NASCAR
Busch Series rookie Ron Hornaday Jr. won his first race of the
season, fellow first-year driver Kevin Harvick followed with a
first-place finish Saturday night in the CarQuest 250 at Gateway
International Raceway in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   `'It's a feeling you don't get to feel very often,'' the
Bakersfield resident said of winning his first Busch Series race.
Just the memories of that night I will never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   It's fitting that Harvick, a former NASCAR Winston West champ
and Truck Series driver, should follow Hornaday to victory lane. It
seems as though Harvick has been following in Hornaday's tire
tracks for the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday is also a Winston West champ and the king of the
Craftsman Trucks, with a series-best 25 wins and two championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you eager after he gets his first win,'' Harvick said
after Hornaday's win. ``I really enjoy racing against Ron. It makes
it nice to have someone else out there who's going through the same
thing as you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Harvick had to follow Hornaday to victory lane,
Harvick is leading the way in the Busch rookie and season
standings. He has an 11-point lead in the rookie race and is fourth
in the season standings. Hornaday is fifth in points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone expected us to win,'' said Harvick, who drives the AC
Delco Chevrolet owned by Richard Childress. ``This is a huge
pressure off my back.''
</P>
<P>
   The next race on the Busch Series schedule is the Kroger 200 at
Indianapolis Raceway Park today. &QL;

FORD LISTED IN FAIR CONDITION

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Former President Ford exercised and visited with
family members at a hospital here Thursday as doctors monitored his
recovery from a stroke suffered while attending the Republican
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The 87-year-old Republican was upgraded from ``serious'' to
``fair'' condition but remained in the intensive care unit at
Hahnemann University Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Among Ford's visitors were Republican presidential nominee Gov.
George W. Bush, who said the former president was ``doing great.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to tell people that he can't wait to get out and
campaign with me in a couple of weeks,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also reported that Ford was in ``good spirits,'' with
his health noticeably improved.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was hospitalized Wednesday morning after experiencing
unsteady balance and difficulty speaking. Doctors diagnosed a brain
stem stroke and admitted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased to report the president's doing much
better,'' said Robert Schwartzman, the hospital's chief of
neurology. ``He's walking, his balance is better, his left hand has
returned to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors learned in conversations with former first lady Betty
Ford that her husband exhibited symptoms this week that suggest he
suffered an earlier stroke. However, doctors have clinical evidence
of only one stroke.
</P>
<P>
   A family spokesperson said doctors encouraged Ford to receive a
CAT scan when he sought treatment for facial pain Tuesday night
after he and other former GOP presidents were honored at the
Republican convention. Ford decided at the time not to undergo
further evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   The former president has been placed on blood-thinning
medication but will not require rehabilitation at home. Doctors
anticipate ``100 percent'' recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Ford chatted with his wife and family members Thursday. He could
be released as early as this weekend. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All that stood between me and victory was 90 feet of
immaculate green grass. At the far end, a cluster of black balls
huddled around my target: the jack, a white ball the size and shape
of a cue ball. To win, I had to curve my ball through the globes
and nudge the jack. Misjudge it by more than an inch and I'd lose.
I might as well have been trying to sink a putt from the rough with
a broomstick.
</P>
<P>
   But then I never thought lawn bowling was going to be easy, as I
was finding out on a warm Sunday in Central Park. This sport of
kings and commoners _ an ancient relative of boccie played by Henry
VIII and William Shakespeare _ was not only enjoyable but also
quite challenging.
</P>
<P>
   My first memories of lawn bowling stem from two pre-teen years I
spent in England, where the sport is almost as popular as golf is
in America. Ever since then I've harbored a grainy home-movie image
of the game in the recesses of my brain. I recall stately older men
and women dressed in all-white outfits and wide-brimmed hats. I
remember much murmuring, appraising and bending. And I remember
thinking they were using a perfectly good soccer pitch for what
appeared to be slow-motion bowling.
</P>
<P>
   Though lawn bowling has but a minuscule following in the United
States _ there are only 160 greens in the country, according to the
American Lawn Bowls Association _ the sport has been popular in
England since the 12th century and still draws celebrities (Diana,
Princess of Wales, was a frequent bowler) and big crowds across the
United Kingdom and in Australia and New Zealand. Initially popular
in the colonies, lawn bowling didn't fare well in the United States
after the Revolution, perhaps because it was seen as a relic of
British rule.
</P>
<P>
   Here in New York the first green was built in 1664 on the parade
grounds of Fort Amsterdam, and the green at what is now Battery
Park was erected 60 years later. It was not until 1926 that bowling
came to Central Park, when the New York Lawn Bowling Club was
formed and the greens were built near the West 69th Street entrance
to the park. Recently, the club has received competition from the
Metropolitan Bowling Club, headed by a former New York Lawn Bowling
Club president, Richard Keoseian, a lively man who once tried to
arrange a celebrity lawn bowling tournament overseen by Robin
Leach, host of ``Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd never played the game while living in England, but I was
always a bit curious. So when I heard that people lawn-bowled right
here in Manhattan, in Central Park no less, I decided to have a go.
If nothing else, the game had to be more fun than cricket, for me a
soporific British sport that had tormented me as a youth. I called,
and arranged for a lesson the next Sunday with Tony Reynal,
president of the New York Lawn Bowling Club. (The Metropolitan Club
had yet to start its season.)
</P>
<P>
   I arrived at the greens, north of the Sheep Meadow in Central
Park, just after noon. Situated on a slight rise, the matching
120-foot-by-120-foot swathes of grass (one is used by a croquet
club) are enclosed by a five-foot-tall green fence and covered with
the type of pristine, short-cut grass one would find on a putting
green in Augusta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, the greens were an oasis of inactivity amid the
Frisbee fiends, sunbathers and soccer players who cluttered the
park. As I approached, I saw a solitary figure rolling balls down
the grass, placing each within a foot of the jack. It was Reynal,
looking ready for breakfast at Wimbledon in white shorts, a
white-collared shirt, white socks, and white tennis shoes. The only
sign that I was dealing with a born-and-bred New Yorker was the
Yankees cap atop his head.
</P>
<P>
   I introduced myself and he ushered me inside the fence. ``First
off, the balls are not called bowling balls,'' he said. ``They're
called bowls.'' This, it seemed, was not only a very common
misconception, but also an important point. I came to understand
that one risked calling them balls at one's own peril.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he said, ``despite appearances, this isn't much like
boccie.'' He was referring to the Italian game in which players
throw wooden balls toward a small metal one. ``We roll, not toss,
and our bowls aren't round.'' As he spoke, a white-haired woman to
our right dutifully made her way around the edge of the green,
trimming the frayed edges of the grass.
</P>
<P>
   Leading me around the green, Reynal spoke about the dimensions
of the green. It is divided into lanes, or ``rinks,'' and eight
games can take place simultaneously. Players toss the jack at least
60 feet down the rink, marked off only by posts at the end of the
green, and then take turns bowling from a small plastic mat that is
placed at the opposite end of the rink.
</P>
<P>
   Our tour complete, Reynal brought out the bowls, hard plastic
spheres each weighing three to four pounds each. They were the size
of softballs. The purpose of the game, he said as he hefted a bowl,
is simple: Put as many of your bowls as possible as close as
possible to the jack. Matches are broken up into ``ends,'' which
are similar to innings in baseball. In each end, players roll all
four of their bowls. (In singles and pairs, bowlers get four bowls;
in triples, they use three bowls, and in 4-on-4 games, each bowler
uses two bowls.)
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of each end, players (or teams) get one point
for every bowl they have placed closer to the jack than their
opponents' nearest bowl. Games are typically played to a set number
of ends, usually 12, 14 or 16, and may take a couple of hours.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded easy enough to me:Just toss that sphere down near the
jack. But the catch, Reynal said with a slight grin and a raised
eyebrow, was how the bowls rolled. They are all unevenly weighted,
heavier on one side, so that, depending on how you align them, they
will sweep in an arc that curves either to the right or the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``See how the emblem on this side is larger than the one on the
other side,'' Reynal said, pointing to the design on one side of a
bowl. ``That means that this side is heavier, so keep that emblem
on the side you want the bowl to curve.''
</P>
<P>
   I held the bowl with my thumb pointing up, as he directed, and
kept the larger emblem to the right. Sure enough, after about 50
feet, the bowl began veering right. I smiled; it was like a magic
trick. Unfortunately, the bowl did not end up anywhere near the
jack. That would have to be the next trick.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   I rolled again. Not much closer. Reynal reminded me to keep my
arm straight and step into the bowls. After about 10 practice
rolls, I began to get the hang of it and even put four in a row
around the jack. Not too hard, I thought, especially when there
aren't any other bowls in the way.
</P>
<P>
   That, he told me, is the real challenge. Your opponent _ or
opponents if you are playing in a threesome or foursome _ will
often block your path with their bowls or send them into the jack.
(This is the closest the sport comes to matching the thunder of its
offspring, 10-pin bowling.) And considering that depending on how
many people play, there can be up to 18 bowls on the green at one
time, it can become nearly impossible to find a path to the jack.
</P>
<P>
   Reynal left me practicing. I focused on the jack and worked on
estimating my ``draw,'' the amount of curve on my rolls. ``Hey, 10
bucks says you can't hit it.'' I turned around to see three thick
men carrying a cooler toward the Sheep Meadow. They had stopped to
watch. I felt as if I were in a zoo. I nodded at them, as if to
say, ``Oh yeah, watch this,'' and then promptly rolled the bowl
four feet to the right. The men laughed and walked on. I had a way
to go.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, the other club members arrived, 11 in all on
this day. (Reynal said there were ``about 60'' in the club.) Like
the 60-year-old Reynal, a retired computer programmer, most members
were dressed in white and eligible for the senior citizen movie
discount, or at least closing in on it. In the group there were a
teacher, an actor, an investment banker and a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   I watched as Reynal split up teams and the games started. As
they rolled, partners stood at opposite ends of the rink, directing
one another's bowls using an elaborate system of hand signals,
similar to a third-base coach's signs to a hitter, indicating to
their teammates the score, where the jack was and where the
opponents' bowls were.
</P>
<P>
   Talking is discouraged in the game, hence the tradition of hand
signals, The conversation, what there was of it, was limited.
``Right down the middle, Frankie!'' exhorted one bowler. ``You got
it, Frankie, you got it!'' Frankie did not have it; his bowl
drifted to the right. Oh, well.
</P>
<P>
   After witnessing most of one game, I was ready to go up against
Frankie, or at least try my hand in competition. Fortunately for
me, David Fainkich, a 31-year-old Brooklyn lawyer who has been
bowling for three years, had arrived late. He lent me a spare set
of four bowls and we began a game of singles. We played with four
bowls each, trading off rolls, and decided to play to 12 ends.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, I managed to take an early lead on Fainkich, going
up 4-1 by finishing closer to the jack in four of the first five
ends. But he answered right back with a three-point end, clustering
three of his bowls closer to the jack than any of mine. On the
fourth end, Fainkich pulled out a pocket tape measure to determine
whose ball was closer. On the fifth end, he moved the mat forward _
the winner of each end gets to place the mat and roll the jack in
the next end _ effectively shortening the distance by 15 feet and
throwing me off.
</P>
<P>
   ``A common strategy, but you'd be surprised how often it
works,'' he said, proving his point by making one. The score
wavered back and forth _ 8-7, 9-8, 11-9 _ until we came to the
final end. Fainkich was up 12-9 on me; I needed a few monster
rolls. Fortunately for me, his first three bowls were off the mark.
If I could get to the jack on my fourth bowl, I could take the
game. It was all-or-nothing time. I bent down and sent my final
bowl spilling onto the carpet of grass. It sailed down the right
side and began slowly curving back to the left. I hopped on one
leg, exerting all kinds of body English from 60 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just as I was preparing to stifle a shout of ``Boo-yah!''
(there's absolutely no gloating allowed in lawn bowling), I heard a
sickening clank. I'd hit one of his bowls; the gantlet _ and my
opponent _ had won. Fainkich smiled and shook my hand. ``Good game,
especially for a beginner,'' he said. ``You should come back some
time.'' I just might, I told him, I just might.

CANADA BOARDS SHIP TO RESCUE WEAPONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Ending a naval wrangle that highlighted the
logistical weakness of the Canadian military, Canadian troops swung
down from a helicopter on Thursday to board an American merchant
ship that for almost three weeks had held three Canadian soldiers
and 10 percent of Canada's armored might hostage on the high seas
over nonpayment of a shipping bill.
</P>
<P>
   Without any sea-lift capacity of its own, Canada moves its
personnel and materiel either by private freighter or by arranging
rides to wars and peacekeeping assignments aboard the ships of
other NATO countries. On Thursday afternoon, with the money owed by
a Montreal shipping company still unpaid, Canada's defense
minister, Art Eggleton, ordered soldiers from a Canadian naval
vessel, the Athabaskan, to board the merchant ship, the Katie,
which had been anchored in international waters off the southeast
coast of Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
   The boarding of the ship, which flies the flag of St. Vincent
and the Grenadines, took place without injuries, although Reuters
reported that the Ukrainian captain, Vitaly Khlebnikov, ``engaged
the ship in violent maneuvers'' as a Canadian Sea King helicopter
lowered the soldiers by cable. After the boarding, the freighter,
escorted by a Canadian frigate and destroyer, resumed course to its
original destination, Becancour, a port downriver on the St.
Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boarding this vessel became necessary after all other
reasonable solutions were exhausted,'' Eggleton said at a news
conference after the incident. Referring to the billing standoff,
which was almost a month old, he added: ``There was no end in sight
to this dispute. No responsible government can allow interference
with its military personnel or equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   For Canadians, the spectacle of $150 million worth of tanks and
munitions held hostage over a $100,000 bill was either a joke or a
sad commentary on how Ottawa has starved successive military
budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the ``amusing'' side, The Globe and Mail in Toronto
editorialized Thursday about the ``comic opera,'' saying, ``The
Ukrainian crew of a Soviet-era ship flying the flag of that great
naval power, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, holds hostage Canadian
military equipment because of a financial dispute that does not
even involve the Canadian government.''
</P>
<P>
   But The National Post, Canada's conservative national newspaper,
saw the standoff as a national humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to decide which is the most pitiful part of this
story,'' the newspaper said Thursday, before the boarding. ``Is it
that Canada's navy, which in 1946 was the third largest in the
world, today doesn't even have the ability to transport our army to
battle?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it that a key element of our national security was
delegated to a foreign company?'' continued the newspaper, which
routinely criticizes the Liberal government for squeezing military
budgets. ``Is it that fully 10 percent of Canada's armored force
can fit on a single ship?''
</P>
<P>
   Returning from a Canadian peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, the
cargo included 580 tanks, armored personnel carriers and
reconnaissance vehicles as well as 390 sea containers loaded with
500 tons of weapons, ammunition and electronic warfare gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exposure to salt and humidity are decidedly bad for tanks,
vehicles and high-tech equipment, no matter how well wrapped they
may be,'' The Globe and Mail said Thursday. ``National Defense must
get the equipment back as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Under international maritime law, a boarding may occur if
permission is granted by the captain, by the owner or by the
country of registry. St. Vincent and the Grenadines told Canada
that it did not object to the boarding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still regard it as a commercial dispute,'' Mary Ellen
Gilroy, public affairs officer for the United States Embassy in
Ottawa, said Thursday evening. ``We hope the commercial dispute
will be resolved satisfactorily.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Margan, president of the company that owns the freighter,
Third Ocean Marine Navigation of Annapolis, Md., has said that
halting the Katie in international waters was the only leverage he
had over the delinquent company, Andromeda Navigation of Montreal.
Andromeda stopped payment to Margan's company on July 5 because of
counterclaims against it. A month of negotiations failed to resolve
the billing dispute.

SPORTS COLUMN: AT SYDNEY, THE FIRST TOSS GOES TO THE WOMEN

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Little did Dawn Ellerbe know, when they handed her a
strange metal contraption featuring a ball and a chain, that they
were giving her a chance to be an Olympian.
</P>
<P>
   Hold it this way, they said. Spin. Extend. Let it fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got dizzy,'' Ellerbe recalled Thursday in Manhattan, on her
way to Sydney. ``I fell down.''
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't fall down anymore. Ellerbe is the American champion
who is very much a medal contender at the first Olympic women's
hammer throw, next month in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken a while for women to gain the official Olympic
license to fling the ancient device made popular by the Celtic hero
Cuchulain, who heaved a chariot wheel by its axle, some 4,000 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, the hammer was tossed mainly by hairy-legged,
anvil-headed Gaelic, Scottish, Teutonic, Nordic and Anglo-Saxon
behemoths in the ancient mists of northern Europe. In the modern
Olympics, the event has been dominated by your basic Hungarians and
Russians, but now it is also the province of female athletes like
Dawn Ellerbe.
</P>
<P>
   In the Olympic movement, women are performing in more and more
events, some of them previously judged too strenuous or esoteric.
There was the first marathon in Los Angeles in 1984, soccer and
softball in Atlanta in 1996, and now the pole vault and hammer
throw in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time,'' Ellerbe said. ``It's not that women weren't
there. The first Olympics I remember was with Florence Griffith
Joyner, but I wasn't that involved. I'd rather play with my Barbie
dolls.''
</P>
<P>
   She was 14 years old when FloJo ran her victory lap in the Seoul
Games in 1988, muscles and eyelashes and fingernails in motion.
Ellerbe was already 6 feet 2 inches tall, with a body type that
made her suspect she was not going to be the next FloJo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was a large woman,'' said Ellerbe, now 240 pounds of
grace and poise. ``But in the eighth grade, it wasn't fun.''
</P>
<P>
   She played basketball for a while but was more attuned to the
individualism of the shot-put and the discus, how the
responsibility was all on her own large shoulders. At Central Islip
High on Long Island, she gained a scholarship to the University of
South Carolina, where she was introduced to two foreign concepts,
the first being training.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first week, we went three hours every day with the weights
and running,'' she said. ``I almost passed out. It was a totally
different program.''
</P>
<P>
   The second oddity was the 8-pound-13-ounce hammer, with its
steel handle, its clanking chain, and that circular weight, refined
from the chariot wheels and axles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I tried it, I couldn't go 100 feet,'' Ellerbe
recalled Thursday, ``but I found out I liked it. Some people are
linear people and some people are rotational. I'm more rotational.
I liked it better than the shot-put and discus.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon the hammer was her specialty, usually practiced and
performed out on the fringe somewhere, so nobody will get skulled.
</P>
<P>
   ``They introduce you, but usually it's only after the main
events are over,'' Ellerbe said. ``You don't get to run a victory
lap. Nobody throws teddy bears and flowers at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Blossoming under coach Larry Judge, Ellerbe qualified for the
1996 nationals, where there was a rumor that the hammer might be
included in the next Summer Games. This year she won the national
trials in Sacramento, where the hammer was held right inside the
main arena. ``People cheering for each of us, every throw,''
Ellerbe said.
</P>
<P>
   She is one of the 25 athletes who will represent the New York
Athletic Club, but most of the year she is a long way from her
parents, John and Constance, and her brother, Alan. Ellerbe is
currently an assistant coach and trains at the University of
Wyoming in Laramie, a college town of 26,000 persons, including the
students _ ``one person for every square mile,'' she said with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never realized there was so much undeveloped land in
America,'' Ellerbe added. ``I come from Long Island, and South
Carolina is not desolate, but Laramie is different, a great place
for me right now, not many distractions. It's like the good old
America you see on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellerbe has earned a degree in advertising and a master's degree
in media and communication, all of which comes through when she
talks. Thursday she seemed to relish the photo shoot, rearranging
her large supple frame as well as her expressive features. She has
come a long way, baby, from the eighth grader who wondered why she
had to be the one who was 6 feet 2 inches tall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept it,'' she said with a hearty laugh. ``I say, `If you
don't like it, don't look.'''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 27 and 29, Ellerbe will escape the anonymous exterior
fields. In a main event of the world arena, the ancient gadget from
the northern bogs will be launched by women from all over the
world, and the eye of the camera will like what it sees.  &QL;

INDONESIA'S FORMER PRESIDENT SUHARTO CHARGED WITH CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs third graf to correct reference to Suharto.) 
By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Sick, bewildered and besieged at his home
by angry protesters, former President Suharto was formally charged
Thursday with corruption during his 32 years of unchecked power in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The charge involves only a small portion of the widespread
corruption that characterized his rule, but it sends a significant
signal of Indonesia's attempts to overhaul its economy and
political system and lay the basis for the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   President Abdurrahman Wahid has said repeatedly that he would
pardon Suharto, but only after the legal process is complete. He
has also suggested that the former president could strike a deal by
returning his wealth to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Unless his lawyers can use his illness and mental incapacity
following a stroke to delay things, Suharto, 79, could be put on
trial this month, said Attorney General Marzuki Darusman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The official charge legally, of course, will be done in the
courtroom,'' Darusman said. ``But as of today he has been
officially charged by the attorney general's office.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the attorney general was trying to hurry
things in advance of a state-of-the nation address by Wahid next
week. Progress in the case may be one of the few concrete
accomplishments Wahid will be able to present as his country
struggles to find its footing following Suharto's forced
resignation in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The charge _ like a series of interrogations that led up to it _
was presented at Suharto's home in central Jakarta, where he has
been confined to house arrest since May.
</P>
<P>
   Unappeased, a small group of mostly young protesters rallied in
the streets outside his home, as they have many times before,
raising a familiar battle cry: ``Hang Suharto!''
</P>
<P>
   Both prosecutors and defense lawyers have said the former
president is frail and has shown difficulty comprehending and
answering questions. They offered conflicting accounts Thursday on
whether he had been alert enough to sign a formal acknowledgment of
the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person who cannot explain his thoughts should not be put on
trial,'' said Muhamad Assegaf, one of Suharto's lawyers. But the
attorney general's office said its case also included the testimony
of more than 100 witnesses, including three of his six children.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Thursday's proceedings involved the presentation of
the case to the city prosecutor's office by Darusman's office.
Lawyers on both sides said Suharto's status had shifted from ``the
suspect'' to ``the accused.''
</P>
<P>
   The case focuses on the misuse of at least $150 million funneled
through tax-free charitable foundations controlled by Suharto. That
falls far short of the billions of dollars he is widely reported to
have stolen, along with his family and circle of favored friends.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Darusman said he was seeking to carve a narrow and provable case
out of a complex web of financial manipulation during Suharto's
tenure, much of it legalized at the time by presidential decrees.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last month, he said investigators had not been
able to find any money hidden overseas and were concentrating on
the former president's assets in Indonesia. Two buildings connected
to the charitable foundations have been seized by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Though Thursday's action symbolized the government's good
intentions, there has been little progress so far in reforming the
laws and institutions that Suharto manipulated for his own gain.
</P>
<P>
   The major monopolies of the Suharto years have mostly been
broken, said James Castle, who heads The Castle Group, a leading
consulting and investment advising company. And there is less
large-scale corruption because there are fewer lucrative
investments in Indonesia's slumping economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, corruption is down, but the opportunities for it are
down,'' Castle said. ``And we are still waiting for the legal
reforms that would assure that when things pick up it does not
reappear like before. Unfortunately, we haven't had a really good
chance to test things yet.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For some Indonesians, Thursday's action was far from
satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Hasibuan, a human rights lawyer who leads a private group
called Corruption Watch, said he was disappointed by the narrow
focus of the case. ``The charges should include not only the
foundations but also the collusion and nepotism which has benefited
the children and the cronies and has robbed the state of billions
of dollars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a political scientist who
was an adviser to former President Habibie _ who held power for 17
months before Wahid's election _ said she did not believe that most
Indonesians really wanted Suharto to go to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Although people do want the case to go forward, she said, ``few
of the political elite want to see Suharto behind bars.''
</P>
<P>
   But they apparently do not want to see him on their banknotes,
either.
</P>
<P>
   As of Aug. 21, the 50,000 rupiah bill that bears his image (once
worth $20 and now worth less than $6) will no longer be legal
tender. In its place, a new banknote carries a portrait of the
composer of the national anthem, Wage Rudolf Soepratman.

TECHNIQUE USES ROCKS TO STUDY EARTH'S EARLY ATMOSPHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH CHANG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have developed a new technique to analyze the
chemical composition of ancient rocks for hints about what the air
was like billions of years ago. The information could help them
decipher the evolution of Earth's earliest life forms.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of California at San Diego
reported in Friday's issue of the journal Science that 2.1 billion
to 2.5 billion years ago, the mix of gases in the atmosphere
shifted radically, probably signaling the rise of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Most scientists agree that the Earth's atmosphere contained very
little oxygen when the planet formed 4.5 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But iron deposits on the ocean floor _ which can exist only when
oxygen in the water causes the metal to precipitate out _ indicate
that the air was oxygen-rich 2.3 billion years later.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, what happened to create the change? And did it
occur suddenly or over hundreds of millions of years?
</P>
<P>
   ``What you didn't know was how much was there and how did it
change over time,'' said Mark H. Thiemens, dean of physical
sciences at the university and professor of chemistry and the
paper's senior author. ``You didn't really see the change with
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The new clue lies in the relative amounts of different types, or
isotopes, of sulfur in the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   The prevalence of the different isotopes varies according to
whether sulfur molecules have been broken apart by ultraviolet
radiation from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, varies according to the amount of oxygen _ in the
form of ozone _ that is in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The ratio of sulfur isotopes ``is an oxygen barometer, if you
will,'' Thiemens said.
</P>
<P>
   Rocks about 2.1 billion years old contained sulfur ratios
similar to those of rocks today, indicating considerable amounts of
oxygen in the air. Rocks about 2.5 billion years old indicate
little oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   The change may have occurred much more quickly, and researchers
plan to refine their oxygen timetable by analyzing more rock
samples.
</P>
<P>
   They also plan to measure levels of oxygen isotopes in the
rocks, which could offer additional clues to the atmosphere's
composition.
</P>
<P>
   With a detailed history of oxygen, biologists could then see if
the life on Earth during this period, all one-cell organisms,
evolved in tandem with the changing atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you've got a record that is quantitative,'' Thiemens said.
``One can compare that with the empirical observations and
fossils.''
</P>
<P>
   James F. Kasting, a professor of geosciences at Pennsylvania
State University, said that the findings by the San Diego
researchers were ``consistent with the story that many of us
already believe'' _ that levels of oxygen in the atmosphere jumped
suddenly about 2.2 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Kasting said, the paper is still ``very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very creative application of chemistry and physics.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego researchers had earlier performed the same
analysis on several Martian meteorites, reported in March in the
journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual ratios of sulfur isotopes have been offered as one
argument for signs of ancient life within the Martian meteorite
ALH84001.
</P>
<P>
   Thiemens said the lack of an ozone layer on Mars was a more
likely explanation. ``That's why we see it in the Martian rocks,
too,'' he said, ``because the UV is going down to the surface.''

COMMENTARY: UNDER THE BIG TENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to rewrite 1st and 5th grafs.)  
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ What can you say about a Republican Convention
that spends as much time talking about AIDS as abortion, and frets
more about urban blight than gun control? That it's a changed
party? A conflicted party? A sneakier party?
</P>
<P>
   ``The platform is solid,'' shrugged Gary Bauer, the former
pro-life presidential candidate. You will remember him as the guy
who fell off the stage during a pancake-flipping contest before the
New Hampshire primary. He added, ``Anybody who's pro-life on
Election Day will vote for us, and anybody who's pro-choice will
vote for the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong message. Under George W. Bush the Republican Party is one
big, huge, enormous, humongous tent. Bush is asking for the vote of
every single American who supports restoring dignity to the
presidency and not leaving a single child behind. Those yearning
for an undignified chief executive and a pile of children stranded
without transportation are just going to have to go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Coming to grips with the Bush candidacy is tricky, since there
is so much that goes unsaid in this campaign. Until Dick Cheney
gave his red-meat speech on Wednesday night, the Republican
Convention had gone for three days without ever mentioning Bill
Clinton's name. We were in Harry Potter land, and the president was
Lord Voldemort, the villain so villainous he can be referred to
only as ``You-Know-Who.'' (Cheney was a hit with the delegates, who
had been languishing on topics like ``Prosperity With a Purpose:
Keeping America Prosperous.'' However, many people who saw him on
TV felt the new vice-presidential candidate had all the warmth and
charm of an armadillo.)
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Convention was full of delegates who had become
party activists so they could combat abortions and gun control, yet
Bush managed to drag them through this entire convention without
one televised peep about the right to bear arms, or even about
prayer in school. Every black Republican who's ever been elected to
a county road commission was given a speaking role, but Alan Keyes,
the black presidential candidate who's the darling of the
anti-abortion movement, was nowhere in sight. Until Bush devoted a
sentence to the unborn Thursday night, the only person I heard
bring up abortion was a Senate candidate from Nebraska who said
that if a Republican president could just get one more pro-life
justice in there, his state would be able to get its abortion
restrictions past the Supreme Court. It was distinctly off message,
but also distinctly off prime time.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, this isn't much different from what Bill Clinton did
in 1992, when he pulled his party to the center while placating its
left by muffling Robert Casey, the pro-life governor of
Pennsylvania. But at least the Democrats didn't keep their
positions secret. You'd have had to be living in a cave not to know
what Clinton intended to do about abortions and gun control. Bush
is less forthcoming. Watching the convention, all you might be able
to deduce is that whatever he plans, it's going to be accomplished
to the music of Motown.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's easy enough to read his intentions. His surrogates
forcefully stripped the platform of all signs of immigrant-bashing,
and made an unsuccessful attempt to moderate the plank opposing
gays in the military. The convention's rainbow coalition of
speakers did at least send a message that Bush is going to have
blacks in his cabinet and regards immigrants as a group worthy of a
well-placed pander. One of the very, very few middle-aged white men
who got on stage was the Republican Party's only openly gay
congressman.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no effort to change the party's sweeping
declaration of war against all forms of abortion, and no hint Bush
ever intended to do battle with his core constituency on that
issue. ``He does not want to fight,'' said Tommy Thompson, the
long-suffering chairman of the platform committee, who kept
demanding credit for having allowed pro-choice Republicans to speak
at the hearings. ``The Republican Party is a pro-life party, but
it's never been so open,'' he said repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to abortion, George W. Bush's move to the center
consists solely of his willingness to accept the votes of people
who disagree with him. The tent is huge, but the ringmaster is only
listening to the folks who entered from the right.

ARMS SHOW COST OVER HALF A MILLION  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The cost to the Pentagon for sending an array of
weapons and other military equipment for an exclusive viewing by
members of Congress and their guests as they were gathering for the
Republican National Convention is in at more than half a million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   A decision by Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen to approve
the display of military might _ despite a Pentagon policy
forbidding military involvement in partisan politics _ prompted
criticism from Democrats and even some within the military, who
complained that the effort would drain resources better spent on
other things.
</P>
<P>
   The display _ including such weaponry as a Marine V-22
tilt-rotor aircraft, an Army unmanned aerial vehicle and a tank
from the Pennsylvania National Guard _ spent three days at the
Philadelphia Naval Yard, where some 100 congressmen have been
staying during the convention in what is being called Congressional
Village. The display came down on Monday, but even on Thursday some
Navy personnel were still breaking down the show.
</P>
<P>
   The Army spent the most: $280,000, which included the
transportation and lodging costs for the soldiers who accompanied
the equipment, which also include an Apache attack helicopter and a
Theater Area Air Defense System.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force, which also sent an unmanned aerial vehicle and a
virtual armory of missiles, estimated its costs at $100,000, while
the Marine Corps said it spent only $35,000. The Navy, which sent
the least equipment, reported an unusually precise estimate of
$246,796.
</P>
<P>
   Was it worth the costs? Because the shipyard was closed to the
public, the services reported relatively few people saw the display
_ as few as 25 delegates, according to Air Force estimates. As luck
would have it, though, there was a convention of firefighters at
the shipyard last weekend, and they made up most of the visitors.

 &HT;    GEORGE P. JOINS RANKS OF BUSHES ON A NATIONAL STAGE
 &HT;    By BRIAN E. CROWLEY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ George P. Bush brought tears to eyes of his
father and grandfather as he gave his first nationally televised
campaign speech to the Republican National Convention on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old nephew of Texas Gov. George W. Bush spoke
directly and earnestly in English and Spanish about his mixed
heritage, telling the cheering crowd that if his uncle is elected
president he will look out for ``those of us whose faces look
different.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and his Mexican-born mother,
Columba, took to the stage as if he had been born there. He waved
to the crowd pointing to people he recognized, throwing a kiss and
pausing just the long enough for the excitement to build before he
spoke.
</P>
<P>
   So strikingly handsome that he is being called the Ricky Martin
of the Republican Party, Bush showed the crowd the political skills
he has inherited as the first member of the fourth generation of
Bushes to be involved in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Calling his uncle someone who ``has been determined to do what
is right,'' he said the two of them ``not only share the same name.
We share the same dream. The dream for a leader who will bring
people together to solve problems, not create them; who will get
the people's work done for the good of the people, not for
political careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``And a leader who really cares about those he was elected to
serve, including those of us whose faces look different. You see,
I'm American, but like many I come from a diverse background, and
I'm really proud of it. I respect leaders who respect my
heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who taught ninth-graders for a year after graduating from
college, said that he and his uncle also share a passion for
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will give teachers and schools and parents the support they
need to help all children in our country get the best education
they possibly can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During his speech, both his father and grandfather, former
President Bush, had tears in their eyes. His grandfather and
grandmother, Barbara Bush, appeared not only thrilled but awed by
Bush's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new day. Now is the time to end the cynicism and the
fussing and fighting in Washington,'' Bush said as the cheers from
the crowd grew louder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time to make sure the American dream touches every
willing heart no matter the color of your skin or the accent of
your speech. You can do that by electing my uncle. Now is the time
to restore a sense of honor and decency to the White House. We can
do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then with a final flurry of Spanish repeating what he said in
English, Bush raised his fist in the air. The crowd jumped to its
feet as he strolled off the stage.
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, Barbara Bush walked over to Columba Bush and
gave her a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Bush begins law school at the University of Texas in a few weeks
but promises to be back on the campaign trail whenever his uncle
needs him.

LOPES DOESN'T DWELL ON DODGERS PAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ There are many who are outraged that Davey Lopes
is not pictured on the Dodger Stadium outfield fence that serves as
a shrine to the club's glorious past.
</P>
<P>
   Davey Lopes is not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Garvey is up there; Ron Cey, too. Bill Russell was there
last year. With Lopes, those three combined to form the longest
infield run in major-league history and helped the Los Angeles
Dodgers to four pennants between 1974 and '81.
</P>
<P>
   To Lopes, that '70s Show left town long ago. He is proud of his
past but prouder of the future. When Lopes steps onto the field
tonight at Chavez Ravine, it will not be as a nostalgia act. It
will be as manager of the Milwaukee Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about players who would make great managers, he
was always at the top of the list,'' said Tom Lasorda, Lopes'
former manager. ``He was a great leader and a great student of the
game. I am so happy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before a 15-year career that included 557 stolen bases
ended in 1987, Lopes began preparing to run a team. His fire as a
player ignited those Dodgers championship seasons. But in a sport
that has been slow to integrate minorities into management
positions, Lopes looked as if he might never get his chance. (He is
of African, Irish and Portuguese descent and grew up in Rhode
Island.)
</P>
<P>
   For five years, he was the first-base coach in San Diego. Before
that, he coached in Texas and Baltimore. The Dodgers called twice
with jobs in their farm system, but Lopes had bigger plans.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's in and even though the Brewers are near the bottom of
the National League Central, Lopes, 54, says it was worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity,'' Lopes said. ``It's a very
challenging experience. It's very rewarding at times and very
frustrating at times. But it's the closest thing to an adrenaline
rush that I've had since I retired.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopes has mellowed some from the player who once went into the
stands after fans at Candlestick Park. But he bristles when he
hears that managing the lowly, small-market Brewers is some sort of
consolation prize for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people question, `Well, look at the job you have.' Look
at the job I have? I have one of 30 jobs. I've been chosen as one
person who has the ability to manage a major-league ball club. I
don't slight any job opportunity and people who do, what do you
expect?
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty, you're not going to get the Yankee job. You're
not going to get the Boston Red Sox job. You're not going to get
the Atlanta Braves-type job. That's OK. All you want as a minority
is an opportunity. That's all you ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it hasn't been easy.
</P>
<P>
   __ With a $36.5-million payroll (23rd overall), the Brewers were
not expected to improve much from 1999's 74-87 record under Phil
Garner.
</P>
<P>
   __ It hasn't helped that outfielder Jeromy Burnitz, one of the
league's top run producers the past few years, has been batting
around .220 all season and has struggled especially against
left-handed pitching.
</P>
<P>
   __ Opening-day starter Steve Woodard was 1-7 with a 5.96 ERA
when he was sent to Cleveland in a six-player deal at last Monday's
trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   __ In that trade, the Brewers received slugger Richie Sexson but
gave up closer Bob Wickman and starter Jason Bere.
</P>
<P>
   __ Shortstop Mark Loretta has missed more than two months after
breaking a bone in his left foot. Loretta, batting .305 when
injured, is expected back in mid-August. The Brewers are 23-31
since he left.
</P>
<P>
   But there also have been plenty of poor defensive plays, missed
cutoff men and runners stranded in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is up to us to perform,'' Burnitz said this season. ``His
career speaks for itself and he brings a great deal of respect with
the players. He has a great passion for the game and I think that
wears off on the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopes has had the job only four months, but he says there is no
added pressure being a minority, who often don't receive second
chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it may be an issue now only as to `where' we're going
to manage as opposed to `if' we can manage,'' he said. ``I don't
think they doubt the ability of minorities to manage any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Still plenty wait, including Jerry Royster, former Dodgers
infielder and now a member of Lopes' staff. After several years as
a top minority candidate, Royster made a lateral move last year
from Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it is now after what Dusty (Baker) has done with the
Giants and Cito Gaston (in Toronto) and Felipe Alou (in Montreal),
it's not as difficult now for me,'' Royster said. ``I don't think
it's as difficult for Davey. We understood prior to these hirings
that we were capable. It's just better now that these guys have
come through.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor, who took last year off after a successful run in
Colorado, had his choice of jobs during the winter before selecting
the Chicago Cubs. He had an offer from the Angels, where he was
American League MVP in 1979. And before deciding on Lopes, the
Brewers talked to Baylor, who had coached in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a double standard?'' Baylor said. ``What I've noticed
that happened in the '90s was guys would get fired and there would
be no interview process whatsoever. Or, they'd showcase some people
as a directive from the upper echelon, so that's the frustrating
part for guys like (Chris) Chambliss and Willie Randolph. Now Hal
McRae is bitter about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, there are two minority managers, Baylor and the
White Sox's Jerry Manuel. Baylor isn't sure that would happen in
Los Angeles or New York although the Dodgers have thought wistfully
about Baker twice in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about middle America,'' Baylor said of Chicago.
``Would you ever see it with the Dodgers? Probably not. Dusty might
have a chance because he played there and there's a lot of things
that could happen. I had a chance to go to Anaheim. That was
different because they didn't have a general manager. If they hire
the manager first and then the general manager, there's going to be
friction.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopes knows all those stories. There also were reports that his
brash on-field demeanor did not play well in the interview process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people feel that (being outspoken) may have kept me back.
Once we get in this position, we have to speak up about things we
feel that are unjust. Baseball's a great game. It's a great life. I
have a passion for this game. But there are some things that could
make it better. I think it's my responsibility as well as any other
minority who's in this position to choose and promote people who we
feel are capable of doing what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopes refuses to wonder whether he had taken one of the minor-
league jobs with the Dodgers, he would have risen in the
organization after Lasorda retired in 1996 and the club was sold
two years later by the O'Malley family.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, Lopes' former double-play partner, replaced Lasorda and
was fired midway through the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew even if I had taken that job, I would not have been
next in line to succeed Tommy. I know that. You just have a gut
feeling about things. It's nothing derogatory about the team. It's
just my gut feeling that that was not the right place for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers claim their outfield mural is based not on players,
but on great moments in team history. Another stipulation was no
players could be affiliated with other clubs. This seemed
particularly trivial two years ago when Fernando Valenzuela was
excluded because he was pitching in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Lopes will not be saluted in pregame ceremonies but will be part
of a media gathering before tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hold any animosity toward anybody,'' he said. ``That's
a misunderstanding that a lot of people have. People question, `Why
isn't your picture up on the wall there when they have all three
infielders and mine just happened to be left off?' I don't know. I
don't really care, to be honest with you. It would've been an
honor, but just because they don't, I don't feel slighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. O'Malley and that regime decided to do something like
that, then I'd have some bad feelings. My allegiance was to the
O'Malley regime. I don't know anybody over there. I haven't been a
Dodger since 1981. People think I was there last week. It's a new
regime, new era, new tradition. Let them do what they have to do.''

THE SPEECHWRITER: SERIOUS MAN OF SERIOUS WORDS CREATES FINE PHRASES
FOR BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ In many ways, the man who put many of the words
into Gov. George W. Bush's mouth Thursday night could not be more
unlike his boss. Michael Gerson, the campaign's chief speechwriter,
is short, bookish, given to conversing in finely rendered sentences
and self-effacing to a fault.
</P>
<P>
   Gerson's seriousness makes him a ripe target for Bush's kidding.
One of the governor's advisers said that Bush, in reviewing drafts
of Gerson's speeches over time, would try to guess what Gerson's
favorite line was, instantly point it out and say that it had to
go. Only after Gerson's face had lost all color would the governor
let him know that it was all a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, so quick with nicknames, calls Gerson, 36, the scribe, and
it befits Gerson's demeanor. He is a philosophical man who studied
theology in college, calls himself a born-again Christian and is
conversant in the work of a wide array of political philosophers
and poets.
</P>
<P>
   Although fundamentally conservative, Gerson was an early convert
to the school of thinking now often called compassionate
conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Gerson got his start in politics writing speeches and developing
policy for former Sen. Dan Coates of Indiana, then helped to write
speeches for Bob Dole in the 1996 presidential race. In the Bush
campaign, he plays an unusual dual role, sitting in not just on the
communications staff's meetings but also on the policy staff's as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a speechwriter can do his job unless he's
involved in that,'' Gerson said.

c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Aug. 4:
</P>
<P>
   It will be 96 days before Republicans know if Gov. George W.
Bush was right to bypass standard GOP ideological fare and center
this convention on the twin themes of inclusion and personal
testimony. The shape of the convention, like Bush's highly
autobiographical acceptance speech, reflected his determination to
incite a public appetite for change and emphasize the personalities
of the candidates over issues and experience.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ridiculed Vice President Al Gore as the risk-averse partner
in an administration that ``has coasted through prosperity.''
Ending his embargo on direct attacks, he said, ``They had their
chance. They have not led. We will.'' The underlying invitation was
for voters to take a leap of faith on the promise that Bush will
develop into a more effective, resolute and likable leader and role
model than Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   This presentation of an admittedly late-blooming candidate as a
work in progress carries certain risks. Not since Jimmy Carter in
1976 has there been a presidential candidate to whom the act of
introducing himself to the American people _ of making himself
known, trusted and familiar as well as simply famous _ was more
important. The speech marked the toughest test for the new nominee
before the debates this fall, when he and his aides expect a
swarming attack from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of Bush's situation right now is that, despite his
familiar name and the seasoned characters surrounding him as policy
advisers, he is actually not very well known even to many who
support him and voted for him in the primaries. His six-year stint
as governor of Texas is one of the briefest times in public life of
any recent presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But serving in Austin probably has less meaning to the voters
than the associations they bring to him because of his family
background and his distance from the Washington world epitomized by
Gore and President Clinton. In speaking of being a ``different''
kind of Republican, Bush hopes to communicate that he will stand
for a broad change in the political culture in the direction of
``civility and respect'' and actually deliver on the ``kinder and
gentler'' Republican policies promised some years ago by his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Running a campaign for change is complicated by the fact that
Americans are satisfied with the economy, and the polls show them
broadly supporting the Democrats' approach on budget issues, as
well as abortion, guns, health care and Social Security. The
oratorical doorway for Bush has been to speak from, and about, his
heart, and Thursday night he charged that the Democrats had used
prosperity ``to no great purpose.'' Tactically, he attempted a
Clinton-like trick of putting a rhetorical lasso around the other
party's issues _ in this case, Social Security, Medicare and Head
Start.
</P>
<P>
   But the glue that holds all this together is the promise of
personality suited to the office, yet free of historical baggage.
In service of that theme, Bush invoked the values of Midland and
boasted that he would come to Washington without inherited enemies
and with ``no stake in the bitter arguments of the last few
years.'' He asserted that his would be an administration guided by
convictions and character rather than polls and focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   A world of difference lies between Bush and Ronald Reagan, the
last Republican Convention nominee to stir the kind of hope among
Republicans that could be heard Thursday night. But like Reagan,
Bush promised that if given a chance he would rise above
expectations, and like Reagan, he is attempting to create a market
for change in the summer convention and then cash in this fall.
Also like Reagan, he promised a regime of homespun values in place
of the policy sophistication or taste for legislative maneuvering
of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, this down-home emphasis is sharply at odds with the
privileged educational and financial background of Bush and many of
the delegates here _ a condition that has led some to say this
ought to be known as the illusion convention instead of the
inclusion convention. But Democrats should make no mistake about
the themes laid down here or the stump performance of George W.
Bush and even that of his running mate, Dick Cheney. They represent
a considerable danger for Gore and his party this fall.

GORE RELEASES SHORT LIST OF RUNNING MATES 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Even as Republicans feted their freshly nominated
candidate Thursday, the Gore campaign sought to steal some of the
media spotlight by releasing a short list of running mates being
considered by the Democratic contender.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore hopes to blunt some of the momentum the
Republicans will get out of their convention, which ended Thursday,
by announcing his vice presidential choice next week in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation over the likely pick heated up as campaign officials
privately confirmed that Gore had narrowed his list down to six
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   They were identified as Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., Sen. Evan Bayh,
D-Ind., New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, and House Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   However, the more realistic list is probably closer to four
since two of the candidates, Shaheen and Gephardt, have said they
don't want the job.
</P>
<P>
   As is the tradition, Gore has remained largely out of sight
during the Republican convention, vacationing with his family in
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Democratic convention a little over a week away, he
has been busily narrowing down his running mate options.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's down to six, with one wild card that I haven't eliminated
yet,'' Gore said, while walking on the beach at Figure Eight
Island, N.C. His aides were not aware of the ``seventh wild card''
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ends his vacation today and will hit the campaign trail in
Chicago and New York before flying to Tennessee on Sunday to make
the final decision on a running mate. He is scheduled to introduce
his choice Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Gephardt, none of Gore's prospects come
from battleground states. Gephardt could also help Gore mend ties
with organized labor, which is angry at the vice president for his
support of free trade pacts. But Gephardt has said he wants to
focus his energy on helping Democrats take back the House, which
would propel him to the powerful position of speaker.
</P>
<P>
   While his name is on the short list, Gephardt's spokeswoman
Laura Nichols said ``nothing's changed'' in regard to her boss'
position on the vice presidential spot.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen, a former teacher who played a key role in Gore's New
Hampshire primary win, also told the Associated Press, ``I'm not
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the other possible contenders were non-commital.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Gerstein, a spokesman for Lieberman, said the Connecticut
senator was ``sticking by his vow of silence. We are not commenting
at all about the selection process.''
</P>
<P>
   A centrist Democrat, Lieberman would be the first Jewish person
on a major presidential ticket. As one of the most outspoken
critics of President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky,
political observers believe he could help inoculate Gore from voter
fatigue with scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, a decorated Vietnam War veteran who eventually protested
the conflict, could help Gore, who also served in Vietnam, to
provide a contrast with Bush and Cheney, neither of whom served in
combat.
</P>
<P>
   A Kerry spokesman would not comment on the process and said the
Massachusetts senator was out West with his family because of the
death of his father.
</P>
<P>
   Both Edwards and Bayh each would bring a fresh new moderate face
to the ticket. However, since both men were elected to the Senate
in 1998 they may be considered too green.
</P>
<P>
   As the list became public, Republicans assessed the pluses and
minuses of facing the various running mates in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Former Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour said
he wouldn't mind going up against Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so liberal and he's from Massachusetts. He'd suit me
fine,'' said Barbour, who is now a lobbyist in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Barbour suggested Lieberman would provide a tougher target
and make it harder for Bush to make inroads with traditionally
Democratic Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going after Lieberman. He's an honorable man, a good
man, more liberal than he lets on sometimes,'' Barbour said. ``It's
a plus for the Democrats.'' &QL;

WOMAN'S ARREST LED TO BROTHER AS SUSPECT IN '99 MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For 14 months after Amy Watkins died with a knife in
her back on a tree-shaded sidewalk in Brooklyn, David Jamison
managed to escape the notice of dozens of detectives hunting for
her killer.
</P>
<P>
   He cut off his dreadlocks. He apparently spoke little about the
crime. He spent nine months in Pennsylvania until returning to
Prospect Heights, the neighborhood in Brooklyn where, police say,
he killed Watkins in a botched robbery in 1999, leaving behind the
$8 in her pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Jamison's undoing began in May, with the arrest of a 37-year-old
woman _ identified by investigators as his sister _ in two bodega
robberies in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn, law
enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   While the woman, Geneva Jamison, said nothing to the authorities
about her younger brother, the officials said her arrest set in
motion a series of events that led detectives to arrest Jamison on
Wednesday, accusing him of plunging a large carving knife into
Watkins' back on March 8, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   After Geneva Jamison's arrest, the officials said, someone who
knows her and her brother made a remark about the killing of
Watkins within earshot of a police informer.
</P>
<P>
   The informer eventually persuaded the person to whom the remark
was made to go to police with the information. That information,
coupled with a call to the police Crime Stoppers line, prompted the
detectives to focus on Jamison.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Jamison, 27, who the police said admitted to his
role in the killing, was arraigned in Criminal Court in Brooklyn on
a charge of first-degree murder, for which he could face the death
penalty. He was also charged with first-degree robbery and weapons
possession. Judge Joseph McKay ordered him held until a bail
hearing on Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   With Jamison standing before the judge in an oversize white
T-shirt and baggy black pants, Michael Vecchione, the first deputy
assistant in the office of the Brooklyn district attorney, said the
killing was a ``crime of opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Amy Watkins was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time,''
said Vecchione, adding that Jamison and his co-defendant, Felix
Rodriguez, 20, set upon her ``to satisfy their need for a small
amount of money, stabbing her with a knife that went virtually all
the way through her body.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, 26, had come from Kansas to attend the Hunter College
Graduate School of Social Work. In court on Thursday, Vecchione
called her ``an angel among us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, whose sister is Jamison's girlfriend and the mother
of his 3-year-old daughter, was also held pending an Aug. 10
hearing. He was arraigned before Judge John Carter in a separate
courtroom on charges of second-degree murder, first- and
second-degree robbery and weapons possession.
</P>
<P>
   Jamison's lawyer, Jonathan D. Sims, acknowledged that his client
had had brushes with the law, but said they resulted in a single
misdemeanor drug conviction, for which Jamison completed his
probation.
</P>
<P>
   Sims said he planned to ``vigorously challenge the
authenticity'' of Jamison's confession, especially ``how the
confession was elicited by the police,'' but he would not elaborate
Since his probation on the drug charge, Sims said, his client ``had
been on the right track.'' Outside the courtroom after the
arraignment, Vecchione said, ``He certainly didn't take the right
track that night.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jamison and Rodriguez and a third suspect, Pierre Antoine, 26,
met at least five years ago when two of Rodriguez's sisters were
dating the other two men, some of their friends and family members
said. Jamison lives with Tanya Rodriguez, together with their
child.
</P>
<P>
   The men's friendship blossomed as Jamison _ who friends said was
known as Sinister or Sin _ and Antoine played basketball in the
Dean Street Park, not far from where Watkins was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Antoine, who, according to Jamison's statement to police, fled
after the robbery with the purse Watkins was carrying, was released
on Thursday to officials of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service, who said they would begin proceedings to deport him,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Antoine, who was held on an old petty larceny warrant from
Schenectady, N.Y., and was questioned in the killing for about 24
hours, was born in Haiti, family members said. He grew up in
Brooklyn, graduating from high school there and winning a
basketball scholarship to Schenectady County Community College, but
he dropped out after a conviction on drug charges, family members
said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives said they believed that Antoine served as a lookout
in the attack, but the only evidence they have against him is from
the other men, and under New York State law, that is not enough to
win a conviction, authorities said. After he completed a six-month
shock-incarceration sentence for his drug conviction, immigration
authorities could have moved to deport Antoine, but state parole
officials and his family said they did not.

BUSH PLEDGES TO `USE THESE GOOD TIMES FOR GREAT GOALS'

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Introducing himself to a nation that barely knows
him, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas pledged Thursday night to
``confront the hard issues _ threats to our national security,
threats to our health and retirement security'' that he said the
Clinton administration had ducked.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a jubilant final session of the Republican National
Convention, he argued that ``times of plenty'' were times to solve
major problems, not to sit back and relax. With that, he sought to
cut the ground from beneath his Democratic rival, Vice President Al
Gore, whose strongest electoral argument is his association with
the prosperity of the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   With his parents and many other members of his large family in
the VIP seats, Bush offered this curt verdict on Bill Clinton's and
Al Gore's time in the White House: ``So much promise, to no great
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush accused the vice president of indulging in ``the politics
of the roadblock, the philosophy of the stop sign.'' He turned
Franklin D. Roosevelt's famous first inaugural address around and
aimed it at Gore, charging that ``the only thing he has to offer is
fear itself.''
</P>
<P>
   He mocked Gore by saying, ``I do not need to take your pulse
before I know my own mind. I do not reinvent myself at every turn.
I am not running in borrowed clothes.'' Yet he himself has been
successively moderate, conservative and moderate again, as the
nominating campaign progressed.
</P>
<P>
   In a further though more indirect thrust at the president he
hopes to succeed, the Republican nominee quoted the poet Robert
Frost, remembered by older Americans for his appearance at John F.
Kennedy's inaugural four decades ago, on the need to ``occupy the
land with character.'' Few if any of the thousands who filled the
First Union Center in south Philadelphia, and few of those watching
on television, could have missed the allusion to Clinton's sexual
involvement with an intern, which led to his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration had its chance,'' Bush asserted. ``They
have not led. We will.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he had vowed, much of Bush's text was upbeat. ``Tonight
we vow to our nation: We will seize this moment of American
promise,'' he said. ``We will use these good times for great
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for a few jibes Thursday night and Wednesday night's more
hard-edged speech by Dick Cheney, his running mate, Bush and his
party have tried all week to avoid the kind of sniping, to say
nothing of the internal bickering, that they know the U.S. public
hates.
</P>
<P>
   They succeeded, but not without cost; lacking debate or drama,
the convention experienced considerable trouble in luring
television viewers. Many preferred Regis Philbin or ``Friends'' to
the GOP's voter-friendly show.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier sessions had had something of the tone of a sales
meeting, long on team spirit and short on specifics. But Thursday
night the governor spelled out, far more completely than other
speakers here, his agenda for action.
</P>
<P>
   Bush proposed major reforms in the public schools, in the Social
Security system and in the federal tax code. He promised to abolish
the inheritance tax and guaranteed that on his watch no one would
have to pay more than a third of their income to the government _
considerably less than the 39 percent plus some now pay.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to modernize Medicare, and to add prescription
benefits ``for every senior who needs them,'' stressing the last
item more than he had before. He vowed to rebuild the nation's
military strength. He said the moment had come ``to make Head Start
an early learning program, teach all of our children to read and
renew the promise of America's public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   In a striking passage, he told the strongly conservative
Republican gathering, hostile to most new government initiatives,
that he intended ``to extend the promise of prosperity to every
corner of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that far too many in the United States felt left out
and left behind, and he described that as a challenge ``to the very
heart of America.'' Speaking in much the same vein as retired Gen.
Colin Powell on the convention's opening night, and implicitly
reminding his audience of his own doctrine of ``compassionate
conservatism,'' he declared, ``We are their country, too, and each
of us must share in its promise or that promise is diminished for
us all.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``When these problems aren't confronted, it builds
a wall within our nation. On one side are wealth and technology,
education and ambition. On the other side of the wall are poverty
and prison, addiction and despair. And, my fellow Americans, we
must tear down that wall.''
</P>
<P>
   The point was underlined in a lengthy video that depicted Bush
as a longtime friend of Hispanics and African-Americans in his home
state.
</P>
<P>
   At 54 years of age, Bush has already succeeded where many have
failed. He is only the second son of a former president ever
nominated for president by a major party; the other was John Quincy
Adams in 1824. Since then Robert Todd Lincoln fell short twice and
Robert Taft did so three times.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's speech was a crucial moment for Bush, more so
than for most nominees. It was the speech of a lifetime for a
politician whose time in elective office has been confined to a
bare six years as governor of Texas. Not since Dwight D.
Eisenhower, war hero and political neophyte, has a presidential
nominee offered so sketchy a political resume.
</P>
<P>
   Bush dealt candidly with that problem, as well as Gore's
extensive experience on Capitol Hill and in the White House, and
sought to turn his inexperience into an asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may lack the polish of Washington,'' he said. ``Then again,
I don't have a lot of things that come with Washington experience.
I don't have enemies to fight, and I have no stake in the bitter
arguments of the last few years. I want to change the tone of
Washington to one of civility and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a strong signal that he intends to run as an outsider _ a
U.S. political tactic dating back to Andrew Jackson, but one
surprising in a man whose father was president and whose
grandfather was a senator.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's was shorter and leaner than many past acceptance
speeches. It had a touch of humor or two _ he took the blame for
his mother's white hair _ and a few emotional appeals, like a
tribute to his father and other members of the World War II
generation.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates, Republican loyalists all, loved what they heard,
and they stood and cheered for much of the evening, enveloped in
the now-obligatory falling balloons. Most were in no mood to make
dispassionate judgments of Bush as a rhetoritician or, indeed, as a
party standard-bearer. Nights like this are for brassy bands and
funny hats, whistles and silly signs.
</P>
<P>
   As for the impact of the speech on independents and other swing
voters, on whom the outcome in November will probably depend, that
remains to be seen _ not only whether they give him the customary
``bump'' in the polls but whether it lasts once Gore gets his four
days in the convention sun in Los Angeles later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush, who would never claim to be in the same league as
an orator with Clinton or with Ronald Reagan, gave a credible
account of himself and made a start at the process of convincing
the country that his legs are long enough to reach the stirrups of
leadership at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Andrew H. Card Jr., the convention's major-domo, said before
Thursday night's session began that it, like the last three days,
would ``be about the future, not about the past.''
</P>
<P>
   One manifestation of that was the marginalization or the
outright absence of many of the important figures in the Republican
party's recent past, including former Vice President Dan Quayle,
former House speaker Newt Gingrich, Jack Kemp, Lamar Alexander,
Steve Forbes and, of course, Pat Buchanan, who is now contending
for the Reform Party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   There was no place for any of them on Thursday night's four-hour
program, which included a number of not-quite-hip singers, a former
Miss America, four videos, a number of little-known politicians and
non-politicians, Bo Derek, several friends of the nominee and his
24-year-old nephew, George P. Bush, who gave part of his speech in
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   George P. Bush described his uncle as a man who would ensure
that all Americans of all origins ``can share in the promise and
the prosperity of el sueno Americano _ the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to George W. Bush, the only prominent politicians to
speak were Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee and Gov. Tom Ridge of
Pennsylvania, both of whom Bush briefly considered as possible vice
presidential nominees. But a non-politician was called upon to lend
weight to one of the Bush's campaign's main arguments on behalf of
their man: that he has shown a talent for working both sides of the
aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Bullock, the widow of Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock of Texas, talked
of her husband's cooperation with Bush in Austin. Bullock, a
Democrat, got along so well with Bush that he endorsed him for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush described the year 2000 as ``a remarkable moment
in the history of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Prosperity can be a tool in our hands, used to build
and better our country. Or it can be a drug in our system, dulling
our sense of urgency, of empathy, of duty. Our opportunities are
too great, our lives too short, to waste this moment.'' Praising
Reagan and his father for having helped to end the Cold War, he
accused ``the Clinton/Gore administration,'' as he called it, of
having squandered the momentum generated by the fall of the Berlin
Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen a steady erosion of American power and an
unsteady exercise of American influence,'' he said. But at the very
end of his speech, he had reassuring words for the Republican
faithful and for others listening to him: ``The night is passing,
and we are ready for the day to come.''

TIGHTLY SCRIPTED CONVENTION MAY BRING RESULTS GOP LOOKING FOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHARLES POPE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The 37th Republican National Convention ended
Thursday, right on time, right on message and most significantly,
just slightly to the right of center.
</P>
<P>
   A convention that was designed to showcase moderation and
diversity and keep the party's famous factions from spinning
embarrassingly out of control succeeded on all counts, delegates
and party officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to have a unifying convention that would bring
together and energize everybody. That's what we did,'' said
Washington Rep. Jennifer Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   The questions left to be answered are these: Will a successful
convention largely ignored by the networks and public help elect
the party's nominee, George W. Bush? Will the hipper, louder,
faster, flashier 2000 convention become a model for the future?
</P>
<P>
   Full answers will not emerge until November and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   But early indications are encouraging for Republicans. Tracking
polls conducted during the convention showed that Bush was picking
up support among the groups the convention was designed to
influence _ women and independents. According to a bipartisan poll
released Thursday, Bush is 18 points ahead of Al Gore among
independents and 6 points ahead among women. The two candidates
were virtually tied among both groups at the start of the week in
the Voter.com-Battleground poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message of the convention does seem to be coming across,''
said Republican pollster Ed Goeas, who conducted the survey with
Democratic pollster Celinda Lake.
</P>
<P>
   On the convention floor, no poll was needed. As delegates filed
out of the First Union Center for the last time, they left unified,
enthralled and breathless _ much like the crowd after a Las Vegas
supershow. In many ways, the four-day convention more closely
resembled an extravagantly produced show than a political
instrument, relying on a quick tempo, non-politicians to make
political statements and a tight script to keep the focus squarely
on Bush.
</P>
<P>
   This convention, said Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the
American Enterprise Institute and an authority on U.S. politics,
contrasts this with previous GOP conventions because ``it has been
organized, unified, enthusiastic and the nominee has been fully in
charge. ... Things have definitely gone according to plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Ornstein is less certain about whether future GOP conventions
will follow from a similar mold. The reason has less to do with
philosophy than with the power and mechanics within the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a confluence of circumstances that don't occur
often,'' Ornstein said. ``Republicans have been out of the White
House for eight years, they believe they can win and that has
brought everybody together.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Ornstein said, the Bush campaign has been
fantastically well organized and informed, resolving problems
before they take root.
</P>
<P>
   The clearest example came Tuesday when Rep. Jim Kolbe, the only
openly gay Republican congressman, spoke. Conservative delegates
from Texas threatened to revolt but the Bush campaign intervened.
Instead of a loud and potentially disruptive protest, the delegates
silently bowed their heads in prayer while Kolbe delivered his
three-minute speech.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that, the convention never strayed from a script so
detailed it included ``talking points'' for delegates to follow
when interviewed by one of the 15,000 reporters on site.
</P>
<P>
   It conformed with Bush's goal to expand the party by reaching
out to minorities, women and independent voters, groups that
historically have been shunned by more conservative elements that
had controlled the party.
</P>
<P>
   And if anyone had any doubts about the seriousness of that goal,
it was on display every night on the podium. Few politicians had
speaking roles. Instead, there was a long line of African
Americans, including an R&AMP;B singer in tight black leather pants,
and a Baptist minister. It included the first ever convention
speech delivered entirely in Spanish, as well as a Muslim cleric
and celebrities from professional wrestler The Rock to actors Rick
Schroder and Richard ``Shaft'' Roundtree.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in his acceptance speech Thursday night, made clear that
the Philadelphia convention would be the launch pad for a new
direction. ``We are now the party of ideas and innovation. ... The
party of idealism and inclusion. ... The party of a simple and
powerful hope,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Steve Forbes, who was a large thorn Bush's side during the
primaries, accusing him of abandoning the party's conservative
values, voiced the party line of unity, diversity and progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very real,'' Forbes said of the bond that was
forged during the convention. ``I think one of the reasons all the
activists are excited is that they feel that, for example, on taxes
that by the time the term is done more is going to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention followed the script so precisely that when asked
to find a flaw, Haley Barbour, former chairman of the Republican
National Committee, could offer only this: ``They did finish two
minutes late last night.''

WEST NILE FOUND IN DEAD BIRDS IN FIVE MORE UPSTATE NEW YORK
COUNTIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.J.)  By EUN LEE KOH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dead birds testing positive for the West Nile virus
were found in five more counties in upstate New York, indicating a
statewide presence of the mosquito-borne virus, the State Health
Department announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Traces of West Nile were found in dead birds found in Albany,
Dutchess, Putnam, Warren and Washington Counties, some of which are
far from New York City and the suburban counties hit hardest by the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   According to the health department, the birds were too young or
weak to have flown that far from the city, indicating that they
probably contracted West Nile from local mosquitoes carrying the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``That news shouldn't result in unnecessary alarm,'' said
Antonia Novello, the state health commissioner, adding that New
Yorkers should take precautions to protect themselves from mosquito
bites.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said the threat of the virus was not great
enough upstate to begin a pesticide spraying program similar to the
one in the metropolitan region, but the health department has
produced a public service announcement, for radio stations
statewide, urging New Yorkers to get rid of stagnant water around
their homes where mosquitoes can breed.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, 119 birds and 38 samples of mosquitoes had been
found infected with the West Nile virus, a slight increase from
Wednesday, but officials said they have not confirmed the presence
of the virus in any humans. Last year, the disease killed seven
people and seriously sickened 55 others. The elderly, young
children and people with weakened immune systems are most at risk
for a serious reaction to the virus.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, a dead crow infected with the virus was found in
the town of Columbia, the first known case in eastern Connecticut.
There were no immediate plans to spray the town, according to state
officials, but the state's chief entomologist predicted that the
virus would spread through the state and across New England.
</P>
<P>
   The findings come as New York City braces itself for another
round of pesticide spraying Friday night in northern Manhattan and
parts of the Bronx and Queens. Central Park was scheduled to be
sprayed again in the early morning hours Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the virus continues to be concentrated in the New
York City area, especially on Staten Island. So far, the city has
ruled out 160 possible human cases of the virus, and is awaiting
the results of tests on 40 other people, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, state officials have referred six suspected cases
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The
people who were ill showed symptoms of the disease and they lived
in counties where dead birds infected with the virus have been
found. The test results are expected sometime next week. About 50
people from New Jersey have been tested for the virus so far, but
none have tested positive.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms of the virus, which can cause encephalitis, an
inflammation of the brain, include high fever, muscle weakness,
disorientation and signs of infection in spinal fluid.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Candidate Bush saves tough words for Democrats for acceptance
speech
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NEWS ANALYSIS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By R.G. RATCLIFFE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ After a year of delivering only soft criticisms
and allusions to scandal, Republican presidential nominee George W.
Bush went on a hard offensive Thursday against the Democratic
administration, portraying it as a failure.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to millions of Americans directly for the first time in
his speech accepting the GOP nomination, Bush left no doubt that
his campaign had shifted gears from the primaries to the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   Where Bush had once seemed unwilling to engage his Democratic
opponent, Vice President Al Gore, too directly or too often, the
Texas governor drew clear lines in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush's vision of the future was one of renewal, his rhetoric
was that of a man determined to win _ to win for himself and his
country and in some ways avenge the loss his father, former
President Bush, suffered to President Clinton in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was the last president of a great generation, a
generation of Americans who stormed beaches, liberated
concentration camps and delivered us from evil,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Without directly mentioning the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal,
Bush said Clinton has failed his generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our current president embodied the potential of a generation.
So many talents. So much charm. Such great skills. But in the end,
to what end?''
</P>
<P>
   The speech made a case for why America should not elect Gore as
Clinton's successor as much as it made a case for why Bush should
be elected.
</P>
<P>
   Bush acknowledged the prosperity the nation has seen under
Clinton and Gore, but he portrayed them has having squandered an
opportunity. Prosperity, Bush argued, gave the administration a
chance to strengthen the military, improve schools and shore up
Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had their moment. They have not led. We will,'' Bush
said. ``This is not a time for third chances. This is a time for
new beginnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Though only mentioning Gore by name three times, Bush was
belittling of the vice president's campaign against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of the proposals I've talked about tonight, he has
called a `risky scheme' over and over again,'' Bush said. ``It is
the sum of his message _ the politics of roadblock, the philosophy
of the stop sign.''
</P>
<P>
   While releasing his volley, Bush also tried to frame this fall's
political debate in a way that makes his own attacks defensive
while Gore's are acts of aggression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their war room is up and running, but we are ready. Their
attacks will be relentless, but they will be answered,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign, even before the text of Bush's speech was
delivered to reporters Thursday night, unleashed a ``prebuttal''
against it. The prebuttal criticized Bush's policies on Social
Security, tax cuts, education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final dance at the masquerade ball will be the Texas
two-step,'' said Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took no defensive positions in his speech, however. And he
even dared to bring up the issue that often most clearly divides
Democrats from Republicans, abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will lead our nation toward a culture that values life _ the
life of the elderly and the sick, the life of the young and the
life of of the unborn,'' said Bush, who opposes abortion except in
cases of rape, incest or to save the mother's life.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speech recognized that the swing constituency in this
year's election _ women and independents _ has been alienated in
recent years by both Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sought to reassure these voters that if they choose him
over Gore he will be a different kind of Republican, a man who
would lead honorably with an agenda that is tough but not
hardhearted.
</P>
<P>
   And though he is the son of a president, Bush sought to portray
himself as the outsider in this race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a lot of things that come with Washington
experience. I don't have enemies to fight,'' Bush said. ``And I
have no stake in the bitter arguments of the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas political science professor Bruce Buchanan
said Bush, by putting distance between himself and the Washington
establishment of both parties, is reaching out to disillusioned
voters.
</P>
<P>
   And for those voters, Buchanan said, Bush also was able to build
an agenda of ``leadership issues'' that showed his campaign is
about more than just winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It addresses their concerns by combining goals with high
uplift,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   The basic themes of Bush's speech were those that he has been
laying out over the past year of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush promised to improve schools, strengthen Social Security and
give prescription drug benefits to those on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues are meant to appeal to those Americans who have
been turned off by the attempts of congressional Republicans to
dismantle or cut social programs. Bush cut himself free of the
congressional budget-cutters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big government is not the answer, but the alternative to
bureaucracy is not indifference,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   These themes also slash at the heart of the traditional
Democratic agenda, forcing Gore to play defense on his home turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's issue trespassing,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   The speech gave Bush an opportunity to convince Americans that
he is a man of substance and quell fears that he lacks the gravitas
to hold the nation's highest office.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in the speech did he try harder to establish himself as
a leader of substance than on the issue of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security has been called the third rail of American
politics _ the one you're not supposed to touch because it shocks
you,'' Bush said. ``But if you don't touch it, you can't fix it,
and I intend to fix it.''

 &HT;    BUSH ACCEPTS GOP NOMINATION, PROMISES TO RESTORE ``CIVILITY AND
RESPECT'' TO WASHINGTON
 &HT;    By JENA HEATH
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush accepted his party's
presidential nomination Thursday night, offering himself as an
inclusive leader who will broaden the Republican Party, restore
``civility and respect'' to Washington and bring back an ethos of a
simpler time.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech repeatedly interrupted by cheering delegates
concluding their four-day convention, Bush urged Republicans and
Democrats in the nation's capital to stop feuding and ``end the
politics of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   At its heart, the speech was a denunciation of President Clinton
and Vice President Al Gore as babyboomers who ``coasted through
prosperity'' and squandered their eight years in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our current president embodied the potential of a
generation,'' Bush said. ``So many talents. So much charm. Such
great skill. But, in the end, to what end?
</P>
<P>
   ``So much promise,'' he added, ``to no great purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling his father, former President George Bush, ``the last
president of a great generation,'' Bush called upon his own
generation to ``extend the promise of prosperity to every forgotten
corner of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They had their moment. They have not led. We will,'' he
declared, to thunderous applause and cheers. ``Our generation has a
chance to reclaim some essential values _ to show we have grown up
before we grow old.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech emphasized the themes Bush has relentlessly pursued
on the campaign trail: greater accountability for public schools,
strengthening Social Security, building up the military and cutting
taxes. Bush also wove in a recent theme, offering the elderly
Medicare coverage for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore campaign spokesman Douglas Hattaway ridiculed Bush's
speech even before it had been delivered, describing it in a
statement as ``the Texas two-step'' being played at ``the GOP's
masquerade ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway said ``George Bush attacked Al Gore tonight to draw
attention away from his agenda of cutting Social Security benefits,
lavishing most of the tax cuts on a few, raising Medicare premiums
for seniors, failing to ensure access to health insurance to every
child and failing to expand pre-school or college opportunity for
the next generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's prime-time speech appeared aimed beyond the boisterous
GOP faithful inside Philadelphia's First Union Center. It consisted
of a full basket of themes and promises intended to attract swing
voters, disaffected Democrats, minorities and young citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Bush mocked Gore, painting him as an obstructionist and a
pessimist who practices ``the politics of the roadblock, the
philosophy of the stop sign.'' And he ridiculed the vice president
for repeatedly characterizing Bush's proposals as ``risky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If my opponent had been there at the moon launch, it would
have been a, 'risky rocket scheme,''' Bush said. ``If he'd been
there when Edison was testing the light bulb, it would have been a,
'risky anti-candle scheme.' ...He now leads the party of Franklin
Delano Roosevelt. But the only thing he has to offer is fear
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush dismissed Gore, the son of a U.S. Senator and a lifelong
Washington insider, while recounting his own story of growing up in
Midland, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``That background may lack the polish of Washington,'' he said.
``Then again, I don't have a lot of things that come with
Washington experience. I don't have enemies to fight. And I have no
stake in the bitter arguments of the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to change the tone of Washington to one of civility and
respect,'' he said, prompting cheers from delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called on Republicans and Democrats to work together to
save Social Security, reshape the Head Start program for poor
children and, ``renew the promise of America's public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's wife, Laura, wearing a white suit, entered the convention
hall at 8:30 p.m. (EDT) and took her seat in the family's box. The
couple's twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, 18, were also in the
box, along with President Bush and his wife, Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Bush told reporters he felt upbeat about the
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I want to say,'' Bush said. ``I know the tone I
want to set.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected to feel emotional the moment he took to the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a moment of high drama and a lot of energy in the
hall,'' he said. ``It is a very close setting, so I'll be right on
top of the Texas delegation and the California delegation, where I
have a lot of friends. And the Ohio delegation will be to my
left... I'll be able to see my family easily. So it is going to be
a moment I'm really looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush talked with reporters after visiting President Ford, who is
recovering at Hahnemann University Hospital from two mild strokes.
The visit lasted about 20 minutes. Ford's wife, Betty, his
daughter, Susan and two sons, Jack and Steve, were also there.

BUSH PLEDGES TO LEAD NATIONAL RENEWAL 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Gov. George W. Bush, a president's son, pledged
in a surprisingly stinging speech Thursday night to be the father
of a national renewal ``in times of plenty.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had promised to keep his rhetoric positive. But in the
course of accepting the Republican presidential nomination, he
denounced President Clinton as immature and ineffective, Vice
President Al Gore as a fear-monger.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had their moment. They have not led. We will,'' the Texan
said.
</P>
<P>
   With the mission of convincing America he has depth to match his
charm, and facing his largest television audience ever, Bush closed
out his party's national convention by casting himself as a
Washington outsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a lot of things that come with Washington
experience,'' he said. ``I don't have enemies to fight. And I have
no stake in the bitter arguments of the last few years. I want to
change the tone of Washington to one of civility and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush emerged last year as the favorite for the nomination after
Republican leaders and voters looked to anoint a contender with few
obvious ties to the battle-scarred GOP majority in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But, sounding as if he had joined those battles, Bush said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Our generation has a chance to reclaim some essential values,
to show we have grown up before we grow old. But when the moment
for leadership came, this administration did not teach our
children, it disillusioned them.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not directly mention the impeachment trial that sprang
from Clinton's adultery, or the ethical questions surrounding
Gore's 1996 campaign fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   Convention delegates, finishing a four-day meeting that
soft-pedaled their conservative views while elevating Bush's pitch
to moderates and minorities, showered him with adoring applause and
bellows.
</P>
<P>
   Bush offered to take the nation beyond the economic prosperity
that blossomed in the Clinton years. ``We will seize this moment of
American promise,'' Bush said. ``We will use these good times for
great goals. We will confront the hard issues.''
</P>
<P>
   His eyebrows tight with intensity, Bush hit on issues normally
carried by the Democrats. He promised to tackle problems with
public education, the Head Start pre-school program, Social
Security and Medicare. He denounced bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   He also raised traditionally Republican concerns, saying the
nation needs tax cuts, a rebuilding of the military and respect for
``the life of the unborn'' _ a reaffirmation of his opposition to
abortion. He emphasized his proposal to let families use government
money to send their children to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, he said, ``embodied the potential of a generation. So
many talents. So much charm. Such great skill. But in the end, to
what end? So much promise, to no great purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to Gore's criticisms of Bush's economic proposals as
risky schemes, Bush said the vice president only creates obstacles
to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he'd been there when Edison was testing the light bulb, it
would have been a `risky anti-candle' scheme,' '' Bush quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic operatives criticized Bush's prime time address.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Gov. Bush does not want to talk about his record in
Texas, or his running mate's record in Congress, he offered up only
the tired, old Republican formula of personal attacks, vague
phrases and rehashed platitudes,'' Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway
said. ``Gov. Bush failed to tell the whole story about how his
plans favor the few over America's working families.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the pivotal convention moment was extraordinary for
Bush and the Republican Party, which usually awards the
presidential nomination to tested political veterans.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time since the nomination of Dwight Eisenhower
in 1952 that the curtain-closing GOP acceptance speech was
delivered by a man who had never sought or served in the presidency
or vice presidency before. The nominees in the interim were Richard
Nixon, Barry Goldwater, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George Bush and
Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas governor's speech was also a link with the past.
After a day that included a visit to Ford in the hospital, Bush
delivered his speech to a convention audience that included his
parents, former President Bush and Barbara Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The governor called his father ``the most decent man I have ever
known'' and ``the last president of a great generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dad, I am proud to be your son,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 54, is seeking to become the first presidential offspring
to fill his father's shoes since John Quincy Adams in 1824.
</P>
<P>
   With running mate Dick Cheney, who served as Pentagon chief
under the governor's father, Bush now sets out on a campaign to
defeat Gore, who teamed with Clinton in 1992 to end the Bush
presidential administration. The Bush campaign gets to declare the
convention a success to the extent that voter surveys show Bush's
lead over Gore has increased.
</P>
<P>
   The governor was scheduled to attend a prayer breakfast today,
then fly to Pittsburgh, Pa., to start a campaign train-and-plane
trip through Midwestern states where the Nov. 7 election is
expected to be the closest.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is scheduled to announce his selection of a vice
presidential nominee Tuesday, six days before the start of the
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Challenging the Democrats' franchise on representing the
down-trodden, Bush used his speech to urge his party to attend to
Americans who feel left out. ``We are their country, too,'' he
said. ``And each of us must share in its promise, or that promise
is diminished for us all.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We will extend the promise of prosperity to every
forgotten corner of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Answering criticism that he lacks the experience for the White
House, Bush said he had made difficult decisions under pressure as
governor and in private business. After running an oil company, he
was managing partner of the Texas Rangers baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Warm-up speakers included Jan Bullock, widow of the late Texas
Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock's friendship and bi-partisan work with Bush was
considered a key to Bush's successes as governor. Bullock endorsed
Bush for re-election in 1998, encouraged him to run for president
and died in 1999 a few months after Bush declared his national
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, I am honored to join in his nomination,'' Bullock's
widow said. ``I consider it to be a part of Bob Bullock's
unfinished business.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush returned the compliment in his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he is with me in spirit in saying to those who would
malign our state for political gain: Don't mess with Texas,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was introduced to the convention by the Rev. Kirbyjon
Caldwell of Windsor Village United Methodist Church in Houston, the
city Bush listed as his home address for 15 years of his childhood
and early adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   The influential African-American clergyman, who calls himself a
politically independent admirer of Bush's performance, created a
controversy in Houston by agreeing to play a convention role. Some
blacks said Caldwell was being exploited by a party hostile to
their interests; others defended his right of expression. ``I am
here tonight because I place policy above and beyond politics,''
Caldwell told conventioneers.
</P>
<P>
   The events Thursday night were the the culmination of Bush's
remarkable rise to the crest of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bush followed his father's path to the nomination without his
father's portfolio of service in Congress and the diplomatic corps.
Republican Ronald Reagan and Democrat Bill Clinton captured
presidential nominations after serving longer in governorships than
Bush has.
</P>
<P>
   But, on a steady updraft designed by his Austin-based political
consultant, Karl Rove, Bush led the early preference polls among
Republican voter by virtue of his family name, fund-raising
potential, overwhelming gubernatorial re-election in 1998 and
distance from the controversial GOP leadership in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to raise a record-high $90 million for his campaign,
starting with donations from Texas executives and those who had
supported his father.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush's campaign ran into stiff resistance from
reform-minded Sen. John McCain, Bush prevailed in the primaries
thanks to his dominating warchest and outreach to conservatives,
who are the GOP bedrock. His hard work aside, Bush's run through
the primaries was as breezy as his speaking style on the campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day convention, choreographed and packaged for TV video
in the style of its forerunners, was plotted by the Bush campaign
to emphasize his message instead of the party platform, his stances
rather than the legislative warfare of the party's congressional
leaders, and women and minorities rather than conservative white
men, who were a majority of the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of sentiment, the Texas delegation was called on
last to cast its votes for Bush's nomination. The party tallied the
total vote and officially awarded the berth to Bush Thursday night,
although other states gave more than the amount needed the night
before.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Introducing himself to a nation that barely knows
him, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas pledged Thursday night to
``confront the hard issues _ threats to our national security,
threats to our health and retirement security'' that he said the
Clinton administration had ducked.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a jubilant final session of the Republican National
Convention, he argued that ``times of plenty'' were times to solve
major problems, not to sit back and relax. With that, he sought to
cut the ground from beneath his Democratic rival, Vice President Al
Gore, whose strongest electoral argument is his association with
the prosperity of the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   With his parents and many other members of his large family in
the VIP seats, Bush offered this curt verdict on Bill Clinton's and
Al Gore's time in the White House: ``So much promise, to no great
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush accused the vice president of indulging in ``the politics
of the roadblock, the philosophy of the stop sign.'' He turned
Franklin D. Roosevelt's famous first inaugural address around and
aimed it at Gore, charging that ``the only thing he has to offer is
fear itself.''
</P>
<P>
   He mocked Gore by saying, ``I do not need to take your pulse
before I know my own mind. I do not reinvent myself at every turn.
I am not running in borrowed clothes.'' Yet he himself has been
successively moderate, conservative and moderate again, as the
nominating campaign progressed.
</P>
<P>
   In a further though more indirect thrust at the president he
hopes to succeed, the Republican nominee quoted the poet Robert
Frost, remembered by older Americans for his appearance at John F.
Kennedy's inaugural four decades ago, on the need to ``occupy the
land with character.'' Few if any of the thousands who filled the
First Union Center in south Philadelphia, and few of those watching
on television, could have missed the allusion to Clinton's sexual
involvement with an intern, which led to his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration had its chance,'' Bush asserted. ``They
have not led. We will.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he had vowed, much of Bush's text was upbeat. ``Tonight
we vow to our nation: We will seize this moment of American
promise,'' he said. ``We will use these good times for great
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for a few jibes Thursday night and Wednesday night's more
hard-edged speech by Dick Cheney, his running mate, Bush and his
party have tried all week to avoid the kind of sniping, to say
nothing of the internal bickering, that they know the U.S. public
hates.
</P>
<P>
   They succeeded, but not without cost; lacking debate or drama,
the convention experienced considerable trouble in luring
television viewers. Many preferred Regis Philbin or ``Friends'' to
the GOP's voter-friendly show.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier sessions had had something of the tone of a sales
meeting, long on team spirit and short on specifics. But Thursday
night the governor spelled out, far more completely than other
speakers here, his agenda for action.
</P>
<P>
   Bush proposed major reforms in the public schools, in the Social
Security system and in the federal tax code. He promised to abolish
the inheritance tax and guaranteed that on his watch no one would
have to pay more than a third of their income to the government _
considerably less than the 39 percent plus some now pay.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to modernize Medicare, and to add prescription
benefits ``for every senior who needs them,'' stressing the last
item more than he had before. He vowed to rebuild the nation's
military strength. He said the moment had come ``to make Head Start
an early learning program, teach all of our children to read and
renew the promise of America's public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   In a striking passage, he told the strongly conservative
Republican gathering, hostile to most new government initiatives,
that he intended ``to extend the promise of prosperity to every
corner of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that far too many in the United States felt left out
and left behind, and he described that as a challenge ``to the very
heart of America.'' Speaking in much the same vein as retired Gen.
Colin Powell on the convention's opening night, and implicitly
reminding his audience of his own doctrine of ``compassionate
conservatism,'' he declared, ``We are their country, too, and each
of us must share in its promise or that promise is diminished for
us all.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``When these problems aren't confronted, it builds
a wall within our nation. On one side are wealth and technology,
education and ambition. On the other side of the wall are poverty
and prison, addiction and despair. And, my fellow Americans, we
must tear down that wall.''
</P>
<P>
   The point was underlined in a lengthy video that depicted Bush
as a longtime friend of Hispanics and African-Americans in his home
state.
</P>
<P>
   At 54 years of age, Bush has already succeeded where many have
failed. He is only the second son of a former president ever
nominated for president by a major party; the other was John Quincy
Adams in 1824. Since then Robert Todd Lincoln fell short twice and
Robert Taft did so three times.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's speech was a crucial moment for Bush, more so
than for most nominees. It was the speech of a lifetime for a
politician whose time in elective office has been confined to a
bare six years as governor of Texas. Not since Dwight D.
Eisenhower, war hero and political neophyte, has a presidential
nominee offered so sketchy a political resume.
</P>
<P>
   Bush dealt candidly with that problem, as well as Gore's
extensive experience on Capitol Hill and in the White House, and
sought to turn his inexperience into an asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may lack the polish of Washington,'' he said. ``Then again,
I don't have a lot of things that come with Washington experience.
I don't have enemies to fight, and I have no stake in the bitter
arguments of the last few years. I want to change the tone of
Washington to one of civility and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a strong signal that he intends to run as an outsider _ a
U.S. political tactic dating back to Andrew Jackson, but one
surprising in a man whose father was president and whose
grandfather was a senator.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's was shorter and leaner than many past acceptance
speeches. It had a touch of humor or two _ he took the blame for
his mother's white hair _ and a few emotional appeals, like a
tribute to his father and other members of the World War II
generation.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates, Republican loyalists all, loved what they heard,
and they stood and cheered for much of the evening, enveloped in
the now-obligatory falling balloons. Most were in no mood to make
dispassionate judgments of Bush as a rhetoritician or, indeed, as a
party standard-bearer. Nights like this are for brassy bands and
funny hats, whistles and silly signs.
</P>
<P>
   As for the impact of the speech on independents and other swing
voters, on whom the outcome in November will probably depend, that
remains to be seen _ not only whether they give him the customary
``bump'' in the polls but whether it lasts once Gore gets his four
days in the convention sun in Los Angeles later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush, who would never claim to be in the same league as
an orator with Clinton or with Ronald Reagan, gave a credible
account of himself and made a start at the process of convincing
the country that his legs are long enough to reach the stirrups of
leadership at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Andrew H. Card Jr., the convention's major-domo, said before
Thursday night's session began that it, like the last three days,
would ``be about the future, not about the past.''
</P>
<P>
   One manifestation of that was the marginalization or the
outright absence of many of the important figures in the Republican
party's recent past, including former Vice President Dan Quayle,
former House speaker Newt Gingrich, Jack Kemp, Lamar Alexander,
Steve Forbes and, of course, Pat Buchanan, who is now contending
for the Reform Party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   There was no place for any of them on Thursday night's four-hour
program, which included a number of not-quite-hip singers, a former
Miss America, four videos, a number of little-known politicians and
non-politicians, Bo Derek, several friends of the nominee and his
24-year-old nephew, George P. Bush, who gave part of his speech in
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   George P. Bush described his uncle as a man who would ensure
that all Americans of all origins ``can share in the promise and
the prosperity of el sueno Americano _ the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to George W. Bush, the only prominent politicians to
speak were Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee and Gov. Tom Ridge of
Pennsylvania, both of whom Bush briefly considered as possible vice
presidential nominees. But a non-politician was called upon to lend
weight to one of the Bush's campaign's main arguments on behalf of
their man: that he has shown a talent for working both sides of the
aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Bullock, the widow of Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock of Texas, talked
of her husband's cooperation with Bush in Austin. Bullock, a
Democrat, got along so well with Bush that he endorsed him for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush described the year 2000 as ``a remarkable moment
in the history of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Prosperity can be a tool in our hands, used to build
and better our country. Or it can be a drug in our system, dulling
our sense of urgency, of empathy, of duty. Our opportunities are
too great, our lives too short, to waste this moment.'' Praising
Reagan and his father for having helped to end the Cold War, he
accused ``the Clinton/Gore administration,'' as he called it, of
having squandered the momentum generated by the fall of the Berlin
Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen a steady erosion of American power and an
unsteady exercise of American influence,'' he said. But at the very
end of his speech, he had reassuring words for the Republican
faithful and for others listening to him: ``The night is passing,
and we are ready for the day to come.''

 &HT;    Ex-UT pitcher Williams getting ready for 2nd Olympics
 &HT;    By Curtis Johnson Jr.
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ At home watching gymnast Mary Lou
Retton compete in the 1984 Summer Olympics, Christa Williams told
herself the Games were a place she wanted to be one day.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, she was there. Now she's back, and the excitement and
honor of representing the United States at the Sydney Games next
month has not waned.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first found out that I made the team in '96, I was
ecstatic,'' said Williams, a former pitcher for the University of
Texas. ``I felt every emotion possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Those emotions are still present for Williams, one of six
pitchers on the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their ``Central Park to Sydney Tour,'' the team made
a stop in College Station on Wednesday night to play the Texas
All-Stars, a team of former and current college players. The tour
will include at least 31 cities leading to its completion on Sept.
3 in Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   Getting ready for the Olympics is no easy task. The travel,
although good for promoting the sport and the Olympics, is taxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of pressure,'' Williams said. ``I know that no
matter how good or bad I do, my family will still love me, but you
don't want to come in and fail either.''
</P>
<P>
   Failure. Williams? Not likely.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1996 Games, Williams was 2-0 with a 9-0 shutout of the
Netherlands and a 4-2 win over Canada. She posted a 0.00 ERA with
15 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   The current U.S. team is 43-0 through Wednesday, including 11-0
and 10-0 routs in College Station.
</P>
<P>
   Williams leads the team in victories at 9-0 and has one save.
She has pitched a team-high 58 2/3 innings, allowing 14 hits with
110 strikeouts, just five walks and a 0.00 earned run average.
Opponents have a .075 batting average against Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Life is good now, but her first time around as an Olympian was a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then I was young and didn't care a lot about anything,''
said Williams. ``I didn't care who I was pitching against. I was
trying to be someone I wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a graduate of Pasadena Dobie High School, pitched a
perfect game with 14 strikeouts and drove in the game-winning run
to lead the 33-0 Lady Longhorns to the Class 5A state softball
championship in 1996. Her energy and desire began to slump some in
college and the weight of expectations was heavy.
</P>
<P>
   Williams played one season at UCLA and earned All-America honors
before the school was placed on probation for NCAA rules
violations. That's where softball almost lost Williams and Williams
almost lost softball. She vowed never to play again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to pay the penalty for someone else's mistakes
or lies (at UCLA),'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then a friend, Univesity of Texas softball player Nikki
Cockrell, suggested that Williams join her at Texas. Williams made
the move, and it was a good one.
</P>
<P>
   Williams earned All-America honors the next two seasons at
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father (Ed Williams) is responsible for all of my
success,'' Williams said. ``He literally made me the player I am
today.''

 &HT;    ARMEY MAKES ANTI-GAY JOKE WITH HOMOSEXUAL LAWMAKER AS THE PUNCH
LINE
 &HT;    Eds: Note language in 6th graf. Updates 9th graf with
spokeswoman's description.
 &HT;    By MARK SHERMAN
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, made
an anti-gay joke to a group of journalists at a party here that
used Rep. Barney Frank's homosexuality as the punch line.
</P>
<P>
   The remark was the second time Armey has referred to Frank's
sexuality to journalists, and it occurred in the context of a
Republican convention that was tightly scripted to highlight the
GOP's inclusiveness. The convention, which ended Thursday, featured
an openly gay speaker, Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Armey spokeswoman Michelle Davis said the comment was taken out
of context. But, after talking to her boss, she confirmed that
Armey had made a joke to five political cartoonists and humorist
Dave Barry when they met at a crowded late-night party on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mike Luckovich, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Atlanta
Journal-Constitution cartoonist, the following exchange occurred:
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you really Dick Armey?'' Barry asked.
</P>
<P>
   Armey replied, ``Yes, I am Dick Armey. And if there is a dick
army, Barney Frank would want to join up.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry reported in his own column today (Friday) that Armey told
a dirty joke linked to his name, but omitted any reference to
Frank, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the Armey spokeswoman, was at the party but said she did
not hear the exchange. She got Armey's account before returning a
telephone call for this story.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said several people were joking about Armey's name, and
Armey, anticipating that someone in the group would use the joke
about Frank, decided to utter it first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad joke and he was just trying to get it over with,''
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Armey called Frank ``Barney Fag'' in an interview with
broadcast journalists. Armey immediately apologized, saying, ``I
don't use the word in personal conversation. I would not use such
an expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank was traveling Thursday and could not be reached for
comment, said Maria Giesta, an aide in his Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he told Armey that he understood the remark had not
been intended. But Frank said the episode disturbed him. ``But I
could not accept that it was wholly accidental. . . . I just had to
believe that it was somewhere in the back of his mind,'' Frank
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin-themed party Wednesday was a hot ticket among
politicians and journalists covering the convention. It was hosted
by Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla.

BUSH AIDE CRITICIZES CLINTON-GORE FOREIGN POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Clinton-Gore administration has run a
``messy'' foreign policy in which the United States finds itself
immersed in crises ``without knowing what it is trying to
accomplish,'' George W. Bush's chief foreign policy adviser said
Thursday night in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has been much more interested in the news of the
day, and not interested in the long-run ramifications of what we
do,'' Condoleezza Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, believed in line to be the first woman to serve as White
House national security adviser should Bush win the presidency,
cited free trade as about the only issue on which Bush has fully
agreed with the Clinton administration. The Texas governor
supported the White House on ratification of the North American
Free Trade Agreement. He did so again in the recent Capitol Hill
battle over making permanent China's normal trade status and
clearing the way for its membership in the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   With that said, however, Rice excoriated President Clinton for
focusing so intently on nurturing U.S. ties with China that he has
neglected a half-century's worth of trade and foreign policy links
to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the United States goes to Beijing for nine
days, but does not stop in Tokyo. ... That is something the
governor found appalling,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, 45, is perhaps the highest profile African American woman
in the Republican Party. The Stanford University provost worked for
the National Scecurity Council from 1989 to 1991 under
then-President Bush, father of the Republican nominee. She
specialized in Soviet policy at a time when the Soviet Union was
collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   Rice is especially critical of U.S. policy toward Russia, where
Vice President Al Gore has been a major player. She said Clinton
and Gore stood behind Boris Yeltsin's policies for far too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important not to personalize relations with Russian
leaders. The problem with this administration and Yeltsin was to
adopt his agenda when it was not in our interests,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the United States ``turned a blind eye'' toward
Russia's brutal war of suppression in Chechnya during the
mid-1990s, as well as to the oligarchs ``who were stealing the
country blind.''
</P>
<P>
   As he worked to control the Soviet nuclear arsenal, Gore forged
close ties to Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, who was
unceremoniously fired by Yeltsin shortly after the premier was
greeted by Gore on a U.S. visit.
</P>
<P>
   Rice described Russia's President Vladimir Putin as ``a pretty
wily and effective leader,'' and noted ``a lot of movement by KGB
veterans'' into the new administration headed by the former secret
police leader.
</P>
<P>
   Rice declined to criticize Clinton over the recent breakdown of
U.S.-sponsored Middle East peace negotiations between Israeli
Premier Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. She, in
fact, praised the president for seeking to work out an agreement
over territories held by Israel since the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least they were in the same room talking,'' Rice noted,
adding that ``American presidents have had to put the pieces in
place'' on Middle East peace agreements. In order for any deal to
ever work, however, both sides must ``be convinced it will enhance
their security, a very difficult business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his father, who ran in 1988 on the slogan ``a president
we won't have to train,'' Bush has thin foreign policy credentials,
although as Texas governor he has dealt with issues involving
Mexico and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Bush evoked chuckles on the campaign trail with his references
to the people of Greece as ``Grecians'' and residents of Kosovo as
``Kosovians'' (Kosovars is the proper word). He flunked an
impromptu identification quiz of foreign leaders posed by a Boston
TV reporter, and was victimized by a Canadian comedy show's send-up
story that Prime Minister Jean Chretien had endorsed his bid for
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Rice insisted, however, that the best decision-making qualities
of Bush the father are shared by Bush the son.
</P>
<P>
   Does George W. Bush have the ability not only to seek out
quality advisers but to demand more policy choices when he is not
satisfied with what they propose?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Rice replied. ``I have already seen that in
sessions I have held with him. Larry Lindsay (a major Bush domestic
adviser) can tell you the same thing. If George Bush is not
satisfied with the options presented, he will demand more.''
</P>
<P>
   During the elder Bush's administration, Rice noted, the
president not only asked whether a decision was the right thing to
do, but would turn to foreign policy aides with the question: ``Why
might you be wrong?'' It is a question, she added, that Clinton
might have asked Secretary of State Madeleine Albright when she
underestimated the staying power of Serbian dictator Slobodan
Milosevic.

MAVS HOPE 7-FOOT-1 CHINESE PLAYER WILL SOMEDAY BLOSSOM INTO NBA
STAR
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Welcome to Texas, Mr. Wang. Welcome to the land of big
cars and big steaks, and, for good measure, big elbows.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Zhi Zhi, a Mavericks' second-round draft pick in 1999 and
current Chinese national team star, admits to being a fan of
Lincolns and the beef staple of a Texan's diet. What he might not
have been expecting on his trip overseas was an early taste of
NBA-style roughhousing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason was jacking him up pretty good,'' Mavs assistant coach
Donnie Nelson said, referring to former Texas Tech and Dallas
Kimball standout Jason Sasser.
</P>
<P>
   Sasser and Greg Dreiling, both former Mavericks players, led a
pickup team that scrimmaged against the Chinese team Wednesday
night at the Baylor/Tom Landry Center. On Wang's] first trip across
the lane, Sasser hit the 7-footer with a strategically placed
elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason threw everything and the kitchen sink at him and
\RWang\S did well,'' Nelson said. ``There was some physical play in
the paint. \RWang\S handled it, he was resilient \Rand\S didn't
back down. And there isn't any guy any tougher by NBA standards
than Jason Sasser.''
</P>
<P>
   Passing the Sasser test is only one hurdle in Wang's journey to
the NBA. The 7-foot-1 Wang Zhi Zhi (pronounced Wong Zhu-Zhu) still
has many more obstacles to clear before joining the Mavs for the
2001-02 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to see him play in a NBA jersey,'' said Xia
Song, a representative of the Chinese Basketball Association and
interpreter, adding that it would help promote Chinese basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Wang, 23, said yesterday he hopes to don a Mavs jersey in ``one
year,'' but there is ``not a commitment yet, there's a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are optimistic and hopeful that's the case,'' Nelson said
of the one-year timetable. ``Obviously there are a lot of different
factors that play in a situation like this. I think a lot of it
depends on how they do in the Olympics, and there are some
political ramifications as well. We're working on those.''
</P>
<P>
   As a gesture of goodwill, owner Mark Cuban invited the Chinese
national team to Dallas. Coach/general manager Don Nelson leaves
for China in a little more than a week for more discussions with
Chinese leaders on Wang's future.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being a member of the national team, Wang is a
soldier in the Chinese army, which carries a lifetime commitment.
And though Chinese military service isn't mandatory, Wang joined
the army at a young age to better his quality of life. He plays for
the army's Bayi Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army team is better subsidized than the other teams,'' the
interpreter Xia said. ``His family encouraged him to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang said he makes a good living by Chinese standards playing
for the army, equating his yearly salary to about $40,000. The
interpreter said that the Chinese army and government would have to
grant Wang permission to play in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs, Donnie Nelson said, are ``pulling out all the stops.''
Nelson has been to China twice, and he and Cuban are planning trips
there next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forging relationships and developing trust ... I think that's
going to yield us the best result,'' Donnie Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   The junior Nelson isn't a beginner in negotiating with foreign
governments. In addition to helping coach Lithuania's Olympic team,
Nelson helped sign the first player from the former Soviet Union
\RSarunas Marciulionis\S to an NBA contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously when you're dealing with a different governmental
structure, there are different challenges. However, there's been a
revolution of change that's happened over the last 10 years,''
Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson first met Wang in 1996 while coaching Lithuania. They
were reunited at the 1998 Goodwill Games, when the Chinese team
stayed on the dorm floor above the Lithuanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not your typical Chinese guy,'' Nelson said. ``He's very
aggressive. He's outspoken. He's really kind of an American-type
kid. He's working on his English and there's big-time improvement
there. Culturally the adjustment is going to be easier than your
typical Chinese national person.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang, who lists Tim Duncan and David Robinson as his favorite
players, knows his biggest adjustment will be banging against the
likes of San Antonio's Twin Towers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to be ready for the physical game,'' he said through
the interpreter. ``And mentally I need to be ready, be tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson likens Wang's skills to another international member of
the Mavs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's \RDirk\S Nowitzki-like,'' Nelson said, comparing Wang to
the Mavericks' 7-foot forward from Germany. ``He's 7-1 \Rand\S he's
very skilled. He's got some `junk' to his game _ he can pass, he's
creative.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson added that Wang figures to be a project once he reaches
the NBA, possibly needing two years before he begins to make an
impact.
</P>
<P>
   Wang is ready to start the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas is a beautiful city,'' Wang said without the help of
the interpreter. ``I hope I can play here someday.''

(Eds: The complete text of Bush's speech will be available at the
New York Times on the Web: www.nytimes.com) By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Close your eyes, and Gov. George W. Bush on
Thursday night could have been Bill Clinton without the punch _ or
Al Gore without the precision.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in his acceptance speech Thursday night, the Texas
governor and Republican presidential nominee sought to reorient his
party to the center with passages that were strikingly similar to
Clinton's speech at the 1992 Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   The speech Thursday night capped a four-day political production
in which Bush deftly elbowed aside ardent conservatives to convince
America that his party was much like himself _ approachable and
open _ and that he is a candidate who can be trusted to safely lead
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ambitious attempt at reintroducing the Republican
Party, akin to Richard M. Nixon's drive in 1968 to transform the
once solid South for the Democrats into a Republican stronghold or
Ronald Reagan's ``Morning in America'' campaign for middle
Americans in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   By stressing ``idealism and inclusion'' and the ``forgotten,''
Bush sought to give a gracious new twist to the Grand Old Party,
moving beyond the battles over impeachment, abortion and culture
that had given his party such a harsh face. Rather than invoke Newt
Gingrich, Bush spoke of ``a bipartisan approach to governing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Democrats conceded that Bush had mounted an impressive
start in setting out a general election campaign that excises the
demons that have haunted Republicans by offering a nominee who
often sounds very much like his foes.
</P>
<P>
   And already, many Democrats expressed fear that the display in
Philadelphia will force Vice President Al Gore _ whose campaign is
entering a crucial phase with the selection of a running mate and
then his own convention _ to aggressively fire back and depict the
convention as a four-day masquerade that obscured the party's
platform and hard-line voting records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds of jaws are dropping of Democratic members of
Congress around the country who are hearing of a Republican
commitment to their building of schools, hiring of teachers,
commitment to the environment and diversity of government,'' said
Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Will it work? ``It has been skillfully done,'' Torricelli said.
``The Republicans have succeeded in projecting an image that is not
only at total variance with their record but in contradiction of
their own platform.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be exactly what the Bush campaign wants. The
calculation _ or at least the hope _ among Republicans is that they
will box Gore in: The more he tries to portray his opponents as
insincere the more the vice president risks appearing mean-spirited
and political. That is an important reason Gore foundered when he
tried to take on Bush after the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   And that helps explain why a relentlessly upbeat Bush managed to
topple a popular _ and increasingly defensive _ Gov. Ann Richards
in 1994. ``The axis upon which a lot of this turns is Bush's
experience against Ann Richards,'' said Richard N. Bond, a former
chairman of the Republican Party. ``She got shriller and shriller
and shriller _ and less believable. That's the experience in which
Bush has based his strategy for this campaign and this
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   In pursuing that strategy, Bush gave no heed Thursday night to
the vast gulf between himself and Gore on issues ranging from
cutting taxes and banning abortion. Rather than alienate the
suburban swing voters who will decide the election, Bush did not
trouble the public with details of policy.
</P>
<P>
   In this most formal moment for a determinedly informal man, Bush
allowed as to how he possessed the qualities to reach beyond his
own party and unite the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time,'' Bush said in his prepared remarks, ``for
Republicans and Democrats to end the politics of fear and save
Social Security, together.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides sounding like Clinton, Bush went so far as to laud the
president even as he was skewering him. ``Our current president
embodied the potential of a generation,'' he said. ``So many
talents. So much charm. Such great skill. But in the end, to what
end?''
</P>
<P>
   As did Clinton in his acceptance speech eight years ago, Bush
sounded themes of compassion and inclusion as he sought to appeal
well beyond the Democrats in the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, for example, Bush said that when he was growing
up in Midland, Texas, ``our sense of community was just as strong
as that sense of promise.'' It was an echo of Clinton, who said in
1992, ``We can restore our sense of unity and community.''
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday night, Bush said, ``Each of us is responsible to
love and guide our children, and help a neighbor in need.'' It was
an echo of Clinton, who implored his audience eight years ago,
``take responsibility for your children.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that his opponent sounds like a Democrat, there are other
complications for Gore as he prepares to name his running mate in
the coming days and then make his own pitch at the Democratic
convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had the luxury of neglecting conservatives this week
because Republicans of all stripes are lock-step behind his
candidacy. But beyond competing with Bush for the swing voters,
Gore at his convention will have to tend to restive Democrats who
are not altogether content with their candidate or his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said Gore faces a tougher balancing act
than Bush. ``He's got a more difficult line to walk,'' Breaux said.
``Our job is to make sure the base is comfortable and secure _ but
be very aggressive in speaking to the moderate middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also has to contend with the shadow of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on the eve of the convention, Bush went out of
his way to say that there was little need to demonize Clinton.
``The opponent is not President Clinton,'' he said. ``The opponent
is Vice President Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton has been a subtext here all week long. It started
when Laura Bush spoke of the need for people ``to respect the
president of the United States of America.'' And Thursday night,
Bush, by underscoring that ``times of plenty'' are ``tests of
American character,'' the governor left no doubt that he and his
campaign regard Clinton as a tantalizing villain _ and will truly,
albeit subtly, try to make him an issue in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   To further complicate matters, Gore also has an interest in
seeing Clinton hover over this campaign. While Bush's loyalists
will try to remind voters of Monica Lewinsky, Gore's will trot out
Robert Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, who helped the
Clinton-Gore administration preside over the most sustained
economic recovery in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   While there was a dash of Clinton in Bush's address Thursday
night _ his attempt to reach out to the middle _ the Texas governor
also capitalized on his opportunity to reach the largest audience
that will likely hear him give a speech in this campaign to try to
charm the public.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they were confident that their thoroughly
unobjectionable, even warm-hearted, message was carried enough on
the news to reach well beyond the delegates in the hall, even
though most of the proceedings were not even carried by the major
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's objective Thursday night was not entirely different from
that of Ronald Reagan, who at his convention in Detroit in 1980
sought to convince Americans that beyond his affability, he was up
to being commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   The calculation of Bush operatives is that if Bush puts to rest
worries about his capacity to be president, and reassures moderates
that he feels their pain, he can gain the edge by trumping Gore in
the likability category.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about George Bush being, in essence, not a bad
person and a well-meaning person,'' said William Daley, Gore's
campaign chairman. ``Therefore he will do what's right and trust
me. There's got to be more to it than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaux put it this way: ``This cannot be a popularity contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans do not see it that way. To them, it is all about
presenting a happy, inclusive candidate and a happy inclusive
party.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they should update Reagan's relentlessly gauzy _ and
wildly successful _ slogan from 1984, ``It's Morning Again in
America.'' Again.

 &HT;    BUSH DOESN'T SOAR, BUT DELIVERS HIS MESSAGE
 &HT;    830&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By KEN HERMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The message, competently delivered by a candidate
not destined for the oratory hall of fame, was simple and direct:
Meet the new boss. Different than the old boss.
</P>
<P>
   Riding high in the polls and taking a last shot at making a
first impression with voters, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas accepted
the Republican presidential nomination Thursday night with a speech
that was part core issues and part character.
</P>
<P>
   In a jubilant First Union Center, Bush gave the most important
speech of his life to as friendly and enthusiastic a crowd as he
will see between now and Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had them at ``Mr. Chairman,'' the speech's opening line,
which he had to say four times to get going. He was interrupted by
cheers 100 times during a 55-minute speech that led to a
convention-ending celebration.
</P>
<P>
   True to his style, Bush, who is engaging and animated
one-on-one, stood relatively motionless during most of the speech,
resting his clasped hands between the bottom two rings of the
three-ring binder that held the crucial address.
</P>
<P>
   He used the home-field advantage to its fullest by including
couldn't-miss jabs against President Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore, his November foe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our current president embodied the potential of a generation.
So many talents. So much charm. Such great skill. But, in the end,
to what end? So much promise, to no great purpose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkled throughout the speech were code-word efforts to get
this point across: Although Bush is a multimillionaire now trying
to turn the presidency into something of a family business, he
wants Americans to think of him as the nice man next door with the
charming wife and the engaging twin daughters.
</P>
<P>
   He chided Gore as a man who sees issues through the prism of
Washington, ``always seeing the tunnel at the end of the light.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I come from a different place, and it has made me a
different leader,'' said Bush. ``In Midland, Texas, where I grew
up, the town motto was `the sky is the limit' and we believed it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That background may lack the polish of Washington. Then again,
I don't have a lot of things that come with Washington,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush hit hard on his baseline issues, but he _ in terms more
subtle than vice presidential nominee Dick Cheney's full-frontal
assault Wednesday night - also talked about character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have enemies to fight,'' he said, ``and I have no
stake in the bitter arguments of the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who often chides his own generation as too heavy on ``if
it feels good, do it,'' said fellow baby boomer Clinton has failed
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our generation has a chance to reclaim some essential values.
To show we have grown up before we grow old., But when the moment
for leadership came, this administration did not teach our
children, it disillusioned them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, polls show the Bush message, embodied in his speech and
performed here for four nights this week, is working. Nightly
polling by Voter.com-Battleground shows Bush now has a comfortable
18-point lead over Gore among independents, a key group. Bush also
has a six-point lead among women, a group Gore must have to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message of the convention does seem to be coming across,
said Republican pollster Ed Goeas, who conducted the survey with
Democratic pollster Celinda Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will get his shot at a convention bounce later this month
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   On the convention floor here, Bush's speech got high grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think America is falling in love with him,'' said
21-year-old delegate Bill Raskind of Duluth, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Delegate Tracey Edge of North Myrtle Beach, S.C. said the speech
delineated the differences between the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is taking the issues that are on the mind of the American
people, and that is education and taxes,'' said Edge, a state
lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, experts disagreed on the grade earned by Bush. Two
political scientists who have followed the campaign said Bush has
improved, but they disagreed on how much.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely more comfortable and seems quite believable.
These's no evidence of hesitancy,'' said University of Texas
professor Bruce Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said Bush touched on many of the same themes as he did
during his campaign, but repackaged them effectively to present to
a national television audience.
</P>
<P>
   University of Iowa professor Arthur Miller was less impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take this speech tonight and compare it with the speech
he gave at the Iowa straw poll a year ago, it's better but it's not
tremendously better,'' Miller said. ``It doesn't seem to come
across with any enthusiasm or fire.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the address as ``very safe speech,'' offering no
</P>
<P>
   new campaign themes or bold political initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, it added up to a solid showing for Bush, for whom
big-hall speaking has been a weakness. His State of the State
speeches have done a journeyman job of laying out his priorities,
but never attracted more than routine, appropriate applause.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Bush - who possesses a quick mind and
sometimes quicker tongue - tends to cruise on autopilot during
speeches. One-on-one and small-group mingles have been his campaign
trail bread-and-butter.
</P>
<P>
   An early foray into big-league speaking went poorly three years
ago when he was merely a big-state governor and rising star of the
GOP. Bush, who turned down most out-of-state speaking appearances
until he became a full-fledged presidential candidate, went to
Indianapolis to speak at the Republicans' Midwest Leadership
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP audience of 1,500 people gave him passing grades on
content - he criticized the Clinton administration's handling of a
welfare issue - but far lower grades on delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he had a good message. But I thought the
presentation as a little weak,'' Ed Mueller of Laporte, Ind., said
that day, summing up what became conventional wisdom of Bush the
public speaker.
</P>
<P>
   A woman in the audience that day said she also wasn't overly
impressed with the performance, but something caught her eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he may just be the next nominee,'' said Glenna Stephen
of Redkey, Ind. ``He seems different than the rest, so I want to
hear what he has to say.''

BUSH AIDE CRITICIZES CLINTON-GORE FOREIGN POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Clinton-Gore administration has run a
``messy'' foreign policy in which the United States finds itself
immersed in crises ``without knowing what it is trying to
accomplish,'' George W. Bush's chief foreign policy adviser said
Thursday night in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has been much more interested in the news of the
day, and not interested in the long-run ramifications of what we
do,'' Condoleezza Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, believed in line to be the first woman to serve as White
House national security adviser should Bush win the presidency,
cited free trade as about the only issue on which Bush has fully
agreed with the Clinton administration. The Texas governor
supported the White House on ratification of the North American
Free Trade Agreement. He did so again in the recent Capitol Hill
battle over making permanent China's normal trade status and
clearing the way for its membership in the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   With that said, however, Rice excoriated President Clinton for
focusing so intently on nurturing U.S. ties with China that he has
neglected a half-century's worth of trade and foreign policy links
to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the United States goes to Beijing for nine
days, but does not stop in Tokyo. ... That is something the
governor found appalling,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, 45, is perhaps the highest profile African American woman
in the Republican Party. The Stanford University provost worked for
the National Scecurity Council from 1989 to 1991 under
then-President Bush, father of the Republican nominee. She
specialized in Soviet policy at a time when the Soviet Union was
collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   Rice is especially critical of U.S. policy toward Russia, where
Vice President Al Gore has been a major player. She said Clinton
and Gore stood behind Boris Yeltsin's policies for far too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important not to personalize relations with Russian
leaders. The problem with this administration and Yeltsin was to
adopt his agenda when it was not in our interests,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the United States ``turned a blind eye'' toward
Russia's brutal war of suppression in Chechnya during the
mid-1990s, as well as to the oligarchs ``who were stealing the
country blind.''
</P>
<P>
   As he worked to control the Soviet nuclear arsenal, Gore forged
close ties to Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, who was
unceremoniously fired by Yeltsin shortly after the premier was
greeted by Gore on a U.S. visit.
</P>
<P>
   Rice described Russia's President Vladimir Putin as ``a pretty
wily and effective leader,'' and noted ``a lot of movement by KGB
veterans'' into the new administration headed by the former secret
police leader.
</P>
<P>
   Rice declined to criticize Clinton over the recent breakdown of
U.S.-sponsored Middle East peace negotiations between Israeli
Premier Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. She, in
fact, praised the president for seeking to work out an agreement
over territories held by Israel since the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least they were in the same room talking,'' Rice noted,
adding that ``American presidents have had to put the pieces in
place'' on Middle East peace agreements. In order for any deal to
ever work, however, both sides must ``be convinced it will enhance
their security, a very difficult business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his father, who ran in 1988 on the slogan ``a president
we won't have to train,'' Bush has thin foreign policy credentials,
although as Texas governor he has dealt with issues involving
Mexico and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Bush evoked chuckles on the campaign trail with his references
to the people of Greece as ``Grecians'' and residents of Kosovo as
``Kosovians'' (Kosovars is the proper word). He flunked an
impromptu identification quiz of foreign leaders posed by a Boston
TV reporter, and was victimized by a Canadian comedy show's send-up
story that Prime Minister Jean Chretien had endorsed his bid for
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Rice insisted, however, that the best decision-making qualities
of Bush the father are shared by Bush the son.
</P>
<P>
   Does George W. Bush have the ability not only to seek out
quality advisers but to demand more policy choices when he is not
satisfied with what they propose?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Rice replied. ``I have already seen that in
sessions I have held with him. Larry Lindsay (a major Bush domestic
adviser) can tell you the same thing. If George Bush is not
satisfied with the options presented, he will demand more.''
</P>
<P>
   During the elder Bush's administration, Rice noted, the
president not only asked whether a decision was the right thing to
do, but would turn to foreign policy aides with the question: ``Why
might you be wrong?'' It is a question, she added, that Clinton
might have asked Secretary of State Madeleine Albright when she
underestimated the staying power of Serbian dictator Slobodan
Milosevic.

`GENERATION W' ACTIVISTS HOPE TO DRAW YOUNGER CROWD TO GOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELA GALLOWAY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ They call themselves ``Generation W.''
</P>
<P>
   They're a loosely organized group of young, Seattle-area
professionals who throw parties, hang with bigshot Republicans and
raise a bit of money with one goal in mind: bringing fresh blood to
the Grand Old Party.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, the George W. Bush backers have kicked off
their campaign to remake the image of their party by adopting
Generation W, a hipper nickname for the Bush campaign's ``Young
Professionals for W'' group.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Young Professionals' sounds so lame,'' said Reagan Dunn, the
29-year-old son of U.S. Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Bellevue, and one of
two Generation W organizers. He, like many in the group, is here as
a Bush delegate to the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   While their numbers are small, the new generation of GOP
activists, many drawn into party politics by the charisma of the
candidate, tend to be more moderate, less dogmatic and more open to
cultural diversity than their elders in the party.
</P>
<P>
   Stacked with the kind of upwardly mobile 20- and 30-year-olds
who make the ``People on the Move'' newspaper columns, Generation W
is a loose collection of future power brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting together a very good list,'' said Dunn, a lawyer
from Bellevue with carefully groomed wavy hair and the confidence
and lingo of a political veteran.
</P>
<P>
   At the group's core are a half-dozen active volunteers _ four
lawyers, a construction executive and a fundraiser for Rep. Dunn.
Four were in Philadelphia this week, three as delegates. They spent
the week talking politics and partying at a succession of Irish
pubs, rock-and-roll restaurants and even a Blues Traveler concert.
</P>
<P>
   Generation W has no office or website, and they've only held a
couple of events.
</P>
<P>
   But they have big ideas and those events have drawn GOP stars.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the group played host in Seattle to George P. Bush,
the party's 24-year-old poster child in its effort to pull in a
younger crowd. About 80 fresh-faced conservatives went to admire
the Generation W hearthrob at Mama Lou's _ a restaurant on
Seattle's 5th Avenue that is popular with the just-out-of-college
set.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the year, about 150 of the young leaders met with
Laura Bush, wife of the presidential nominee, at the trendy W Hotel
_ a swanky spot that sounded just right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We planned that,'' Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn and a couple of friends started organizing the group in
November, fired up by a presidential campaign that seemed to
reflect their own energetic approach to politics, as well as life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our candidates are just more exciting,'' Dunn said. ``We've
got a young candidate (for president) this time.''
</P>
<P>
   For two decades, the GOP had nominated candidates who came of
age in the Great Depression. George W. Bush, at 54, is to
Generation W what Bill Clinton was to young, moderate Democrats in
1992 _ a candidate more like them than any they have ever known.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing number of young Republicans in this state
who are fiscally conservative and more middle of the road
socially,'' Dunn said. ``I see more and more of those folks getting
involved. That, for me, is exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see our party go that way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the party will move in that direction is anyone's guess.
But those in Generation W offer the kind of polished and positive
image Bush wants for the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative to bring in new blood is long overdue, said the
group's co-organizer, Arthur K. Langlie, whose grandfather was
mayor of Seattle and a three-term governor in the 1940s and 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Lombardi, a clean-cut and dimpled 34-year-old
already-prominent labor lawyer from Issaquah, said recently that
the party needs to improve the way it delivers its message. Younger
Republicans, he said, love the core values of the party and don't
want to change them, but feel the message has become lost because
of negativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The GOP) has done a poor job packaging it,'' he said. ``It's
just kind of how you emphasize it, how you talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The group wants to continue that effort after the November
election, win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be another set of elections in two years,''
Lombardi said.

POLITICAL SURFING: SCENES OF BUSH, PREPARING FOR HIS SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Subs to replace first 7 grafs with updated material.)  
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the nominees had spoken and the themes of the Republican
National Convention had coalesced on its final day _ we're not your
grandma's Republican Party, let's wash the Clinton-Gore stain out
of the White House, the sky's the limit _ the cable television
pundits and Internet commentators seemed visibly relieved that they
finally had a firm idea of the agenda they will be bickering about
for the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they were just relieved that it was time for them to
go.
</P>
<P>
   As the time approached Thursday night for the acceptance speech
of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and the twisting rivers of people
on the convention floor began to slow and then build up (``It's
kind of scary for the elderly people here in the Kansas
delegation,'' one Fox floor reporter said.), the television cameras
began to spend more time watching the stage and scanning the crowd.
It was time for the big dog to sing.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush, that's my final answer,'' read one placard in
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, several television channels were cleaning
out their stash of leftover features about the wonders of
Philadelphia (Jane Clayson of CBS' ``Early Show'' went rowing on
the Schuylkill River with octogenarians, for instance). There were
some lingering arguments about how well the vice-presidential
nominee Dick Cheney's throw-the-bums-out line would play with
moderates or whether the convention had been specific enough on
policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, the Democrats are going to say something about us,'' the
Bush strategist Karl Rove told CNN. ``If we'd delivered a four-day
economics lecture from the lectern, the Democrats would have said
we're not fun.''
</P>
<P>
   As was widely reported throughout the day Thursday, people have
not been watching the convention in droves, a subject of much
concern to the people who have paid a fortune to cover the event.
While the major networks had chipped their prime-time coverage down
to an hour or less, shifting the bulk of the work to cable, the
cable all-news channels were attracting viewership numbers that
looked more like the circulation for a medium-sized newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   This is mass media? Perhaps the crowds have moved to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not. One of the most interesting Web projects at the
convention was the partnership between Speakout.com and MSNBC,
which allowed viewers to rate the convention's major speakers, in
real time, while listening to the speech. Afterward, compiled
results were to be posted on the Internet, broken down by gender
and political preference. On Tuesday night, when Sen. John McCain
of Arizona was the featured attraction, only 426 people bothered to
take part, about the size of many high-school graduating classes.
It will never be know how many might have taken part on Wednesday
night, when Cheney delivered his blast at the Democrats, because
the whole thing went kaflooey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to substantial network failure, we were unable to conduct
the scheduled Instant Viewer Response on Wednesday,'' said a notice
on the Web page.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cause of the failure is currently under investigation,''
it added, ominously, before concluding with a more upbeat,
``However, full service has been restored and new results will be
posted immediately following George W. Bush's speech on Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations that resulted in mass arrest on Tuesday in
downtown Philadelphia also seemed to have vaporized by Thursday, at
least as far as television images were concerned. Perhaps it proved
difficult to rally people to the barricades with the slogan: The
whole world's not watching.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, from the Democratic campaign: Every channel had
Thursday's shot of Al Gore walking along a beach in North Carolina,
shaking hands, waving to folks, but saying nothing. On Wednesday,
he was barefoot and his wife, Tipper, was with him. She had shoes
on. On Thursday, he had shoes on, too, but then it did seem a
little windier.
</P>
<P>
   Both CNN and Fox presented Generation X panels to talk about how
young people were reacting to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith Bagby, author of ``We've Got Issues,'' said the whole
thing seemed like a big pep rally. ``I would give the Republicans
an A in terms of the pep rally,'' she said. ``In terms of talking
about the issues affecting young people, they did a very cursory
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Alison Fields of Rock the Vote said she was disappointed that
McCain had not pushed his campaign finance reform message in his
speech on Tuesday. ``He wussed out big time,'' she decided.
</P>
<P>
   The National Journal decided to find out what the convention's
official theme _ ``Renewing America's Purpose. Together.'' _ might
possibly mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say it four times quick,'' the article by Burt Solomon on The
Journal's Web site said. ``Mean anything yet?''
</P>
<P>
   Their reporter went onto the convention floor to ask people what
the slogan meant to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back to basics,'' decided Dan Crowley, a Maryland alternate
delegate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work together,'' said Pat Harvey, a volunteer from nearby
Bucks County, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to get spiritual on you,'' warned Cindy Costa, a
national committeewoman from South Carolina. ``America has a
destiny, purposed by God Almighty, and we have gotten away from its
precepts, starting in the '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayson capped her week in Philadelphia with a montage of images
from her first-ever national political convention. Yes, a
cheesesteak was involved. Did she have any lessons to bring back to
co-host Bryant Gumbel in New York? ``Even though this was a highly
staged event,'' she said, ``the people behind it were still very
passionate about their politics.''

POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: CLINTON STUMPS ON LAZIO TURF
</HEADLINE>
  By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
  NORTHPORT, N.Y. _ The Clinton 2000 campaign dubbed it the Long
Island tour, with the candidate pitching what she was calling the
``Long Island livability plan.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   For three days, staid and sensible in cream and navy blue suits,
Hillary Rodham Clinton trolled for support in the heart of her
rival's home turf, stopping off to meet with local officials, offer
succor to elderly residents, dine with fishermen on the far East
End. Not only that, she spent that time taking shots at the very
issues that her opponent for the U.S. Senate, Rick A. Lazio, the
Republican Congressman from Long Island, has taken credit for:
lower taxes one day, abortion rights another, the environment the
next.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday it was the environment's turn. With the Long Island
Sound as her backdrop, the sun occasionally poking out of the
clouds in the morning, Clinton rattled off a laundry list of
earth-friendly concerns, from the quality of drinking water in the
state to suburban sprawl to the plight of the lobsters that have
been dying off mysteriously in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A livable Long Island must be an environmentally sound Long
Island,'' she said. ``It bothers me that lobsters have died off.
What does that mean not only to the lobsters but to children and
the rest of us. What also bothers me is that Long Island has the
highest rates of breast cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it went on Thursday, with Clinton touching on everything
from the construction of a water filtration plant in the Bronx,
which she opposes, to requiring municipalities to report water
quality standards online, which she supports.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pointed to her own advocacy for financing breast cancer
research. She lauded the vice president, Al Gore, for ``his
foresight on the environment.'' And she attacked Lazio on his
environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   She declined to offer detailed criticism of his environmental
positions, saying she would save that for later. But she once again
linked Lazio to the reign of Newt Gingrich, the former House
speaker, saying that as a deputy whip, Lazio had voted in favor of
measures that would have weakened enforcement of federal
environmental laws.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finding Where to Go  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Long Island tour has not been a combination of
well-choreographed visits with well-wishers and spontaneous
sojourns along the way.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clinton solicited local reporters for ideas on
where to go on the East End. (They suggested a park or two, spots
to find fishermen, diverse crowds. Clinton's advance team said they
would consult their Hagstrom's guide to Long Island.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So Where's Chelsea?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was the first time during Clinton's Long Island jaunt
that she was not joined by her daughter, Chelsea, 20, who is taking
the fall semester off from college to help her mother campaign and
spend the last few months of her father's tenure at the White
House. Chelsea Clinton has turned out to be almost as much of a
crowd-pleaser as her mother this week.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing the first lady on Tuesday and Wednesday from park to
senior center to luncheons with advocates and politicians, Clinton,
predictably, was no shrinking violet. She had a fixed wide grin.
She thanked her mother's well-wishers, addressed the men as
``Sir,'' attributing it to her Southern upbringing, signed
autographs and posed readily for pictures, asking simply, ``Where
would you like me to stand?''
</P>
<P>
   The only exception was the news media. Chelsea, fiercely
protected from the press during the last seven and a half years of
her father's presidency, said nothing to reporters. She has
appeared at her mother's side only occasionally during Clinton's
Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clinton said her daughter had returned to
Washington to see some friends. ``I am a strong advocate for young
people leading their own lives and not being taken advantage of by
people in the public arena,'' she said. ``I'll be looking forward
to having her back.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether Chelsea Clinton would rejoin her mother
as she heads to Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard for the weekend.
There will be a fund-raiser on Friday in Nantucket and another will
be held on Sunday in Martha's Vineyard.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Lobster Issue  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During her Long Island trip, Clinton has addressed some of
Lazio's main issues. Towing the Republican Party line, he has long
spoken of the need for tax breaks. He has described himself as
being in favor of abortion rights, but as an opponent of using
public money to pay for abortions for poor women. He has also
described himself as an environmentalist, and won endorsements from
the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters in his
Congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clinton also painted herself as the friend of Long
Island lobstermen _ ``our lobsterman,'' as she put it _ by noting
that her opponent voted with the Republicans against an emergency
appropriations bill that would have included money for the lobster
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody should have been a strong advocate for getting that
money immediately to our lobstermen and getting the money needed to
look into causes of the dying off of the lobsters, it should have
been someone who represents Long Island,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio campaign aides swiftly put out an afternoon news release
attacking the Clinton administration for ``arbitrarily small
quotas'' on the number of fluke that New York fishermen are allowed
to catch for sale. As for the lobstermen, they said Lazio had
fought to include $8 million for lobstermen in the emergency
spending bill but voted against it because it spun off into a
bigger, far more expensive measure.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio dismissed the very notion of the ``livability plan'' put
forth by Clinton. ``If she ever lived on Long Island,'' he told
reporters, ``she would have some basis to talk about a livability
plan.''

PUERTO RICAN PARADE MAY BAN SOME RAP 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUAN FORERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two months after the violent aftermath of the
National Puerto Rican Day Parade, parade directors are considering
a ban on some floats carrying rap performers whose music, they say,
glorifies violence and attracts unruly throngs that tarnish the
march's image, a leading board member said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Federico Perez, a board member since the 1960s and a former city
councilman from the Bronx, said he and his colleagues were not
accusing rappers of having incited the rampage that erupted on the
southern fringe of Central Park after the parade.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview, Perez said board members were concerned
that many rap lyrics blaring from floats in recent years had been
obscene and did not blend in with the traditional Latin image
parade organizers wanted to project.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can prevent music that is conducive to these acts that
are outside the norm, well, we'll have to do that,'' said Perez,
who serves as spokesman for the 18-member board, a private
organization that oversees the event.
</P>
<P>
   The events that happened early in the evening of June 11 after
the parade ended on Fifth Avenue have caused consternation among
the board members, Perez said. In frenzied attacks that attracted
nationwide attention, hordes of young men, many of whom had
attended the parade, groped about 60 women in the southeast corner
of the park near 59th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The police have charged 30 men in the attacks and are searching
for 17 others.
</P>
<P>
   Perez and other board members said they had not discussed which
rap stars might be banned. But he said the board would, in all
likelihood, enact far-reaching changes in September when it gathers
to plan next year's festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop industry insiders, rap fans and Assemblyman Ruben Diaz
of the Bronx, whose district includes the Bronx River Houses where
rap was born, said they thought Perez's contentions were misguided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love rap music, and I didn't grow up hassling women,'' said
Diaz, a regular parade participant whose parents were born in
Puerto Rico. ``Somebody who says rap music or hip-hop is not a part
of Puerto Rican culture would be sadly mistaken.''
</P>
<P>
   Rap's energy and street-wise message, supporters said, resonates
deeply among Puerto Rican youth, just as it does among young
African-Americans. And Puerto Rican performers like Fat Joe,
Noriega and the late Big Pun have become mainstream stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as saying hip-hop artists are not part of the Puerto
Rican tradition, they're crazy,'' said Vee Bravo, an editor of
Stress, a Queens-based rap magazine that has had a parade float
carrying rap artists since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's censorship if they go ahead and do this,'' said
Bravo, who is of Chilean descent. Fat Joe, whose given name is
Joseph Cartagena, said he and other rappers have long believed that
parade organizers fail to embrace them.
</P>
<P>
   The National Puerto Rican Day Parade, a New York institution
since 1958, is embraced by hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans
who enjoy the annual chance to express pride in their cultural
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   But the parade, for many, is also about advertising and
promotion, attracting politicians like Hillary Rodham Clinton and
Rep. Rick Lazio, corporations selling everything from Internet
sites to coffee to corn oil, and musicians looking to connect with
Puerto Rican youth. So for years, the parade has attracted rappers
and hip-hop D.J.'s, Latin and African-American, who pay for their
own floats or are sponsored by radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the parade's board members said they foresaw a ban on
rappers. Carlos Velasquez, who oversees marketing for the board,
said old rules might be dusted off to prohibit obscenities in
lyrics and the practice of throwing merchandise from rap floats,
which promotes rowdy behavior.

CONSTANCE STUART LARRABEE, 85, PHOTOGRAPHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Constance Stuart Larrabee, a photographer who recorded the
vanishing tribes of southern Africa, the World War II battlefields
of Europe and her life on Maryland's tranquil Eastern Shore, died
on July 27 at her home in Chestertown, Md. She was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Constance Stuart earlier in her career, Larrabee in
1997 donated her African images to the Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of African Art, her World War II pictures to the
Corcoran Gallery and her views of the Eastern Shore to the
Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum.
</P>
<P>
   All three institutions simultaneously exhibited those
collections in 1998. A traveling display, titled ``South Africa,
1936-1949 _ Photographs by Constance Stuart Larrabee,'' is being
readied for a national tour by the Museum of African Art.
</P>
<P>
   Yale University staged a 120-picture retrospective in 1995,
presenting the remarkable panoply of her work. It opened with
family portraits of Ndebele people in tribal garb, particularly of
mothers with infants, and other tribal groups at work, rest and
play.
</P>
<P>
   She photographed South African soldiers fighting their way up
the Italian boot, as well as the liberation of Paris, with Gen.
Charles de Gaulle, in profile, addressing a crowd. Finally, the
show ended on a genteel note in Maryland, where she bred Norwich
and Norfolk terriers on a farm and depicted the rivers and creeks,
wildlife and people of her surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Two of her South African photographs were included in Edward
Steichen's famous international exhibition and collection of the
mid-1950s, ``The Family of Man.'' New York's Museum of Modern Art
billed it as ``the greatest photographic exhibition of all time,''
and she shared the credits with the likes of Margaret Bourke-White,
Frank Capra and Henri Cartier-Bresson.
</P>
<P>
   Born in England, Larrabee grew up in Pretoria, South Africa, and
studied photography in London and Munich. In 1936 she started a
portrait studio in Pretoria to capture the white South African
elite along with visitors like Noel Coward and members of the
British royal family.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from her commercial work, she began to chronicle the
vanishing ethnic cultures of Bushmen, Transkei peoples and others
in the region. Her exhibitions drew national attention and led to
her appointment as a war photographer.
</P>
<P>
   She accompanied the South African 6th Armored Division and the
U.S. 6th Army as they swept through Europe. At one point she came
under German artillery fire aboard a French tank.
</P>
<P>
   She arrived in the United States in 1949, married Col. Sterling
Loop Larrabee and settled in Chestertown, where she established a
long association with Washington College. She supported its arts
programs and helped establish the Constance Stuart Larrabee Arts
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband died in 1975. No immediate family members survive.

WILLIAM STEINBERG, 87, UNION OFFICIAL 
</HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
   William R. Steinberg, a retired union leader who represented
ships' radio officers and helped organize a low-cost housing
program for retired union members, died Aug. 1 in Miami Beach,
where he lived. He was 87 and formerly had a home in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, he was a radio officer in the U.S. Merchant
Marine in World War II and became an official of the American Radio
Association in New York in 1944. He was elected president four
years later.
</P>
<P>
   He also served on the general executive board of the Congress of
Industrial Organizations. Its president, Philip Murray of the
steelworkers' union, assigned him to join its general counsel,
Arthur J. Goldberg, in the negotiations that led to the CIO's
merger with the American Federation of Labor in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kennedy administration, Steinberg worked with federal
housing officials and other larger unions to create a program
called Four Freedoms to provide inexpensive homes for the elderly.
As its founding president, he oversaw the construction of
union-sponsored housing in Detroit, Miami Beach, Philadelphia,
Paterson, N.J., and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The American Radio Association became Local 2057 of the
International Longshoremen's Association in 1982. Now only about
150 strong, its members operate communications and electronics gear
aboard major U.S. shipping lines.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg retired as head of the union in 1984 but remained
active in it until his death. After retiring, he was chief
negotiator in contract talks, which Local 2057 conducts
independently of the parent longshoremen's union.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg is survived by his wife of 42 years, Lucienne; a
daughter, Michele Ammirata of Miami Beach; a son, Edwin A. of
Manhattan; five grandchildren; and two great-grandsons.

 &HT;    BUSH DOESN'T SOAR, BUT DELIVERS HIS MESSAGE
 &HT;    830&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By KEN HERMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The message, competently delivered by a candidate
not destined for the oratory hall of fame, was simple and direct:
Meet the new boss. Different than the old boss.
</P>
<P>
   Riding high in the polls and taking a last shot at making a
first impression with voters, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas accepted
the Republican presidential nomination Thursday night with a speech
that was part core issues and part character.
</P>
<P>
   In a jubilant First Union Center, Bush gave the most important
speech of his life to as friendly and enthusiastic a crowd as he
will see between now and Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had them at ``Mr. Chairman,'' the speech's opening line,
which he had to say four times to get going. He was interrupted by
cheers 100 times during a 55-minute speech that led to a
convention-ending celebration.
</P>
<P>
   True to his style, Bush, who is engaging and animated
one-on-one, stood relatively motionless during most of the speech,
resting his clasped hands between the bottom two rings of the
three-ring binder that held the crucial address.
</P>
<P>
   He used the home-field advantage to its fullest by including
couldn't-miss jabs against President Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore, his November foe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our current president embodied the potential of a generation.
So many talents. So much charm. Such great skill. But, in the end,
to what end? So much promise, to no great purpose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkled throughout the speech were code-word efforts to get
this point across: Although Bush is a multimillionaire now trying
to turn the presidency into something of a family business, he
wants Americans to think of him as the nice man next door with the
charming wife and the engaging twin daughters.
</P>
<P>
   He chided Gore as a man who sees issues through the prism of
Washington, ``always seeing the tunnel at the end of the light.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I come from a different place, and it has made me a
different leader,'' said Bush. ``In Midland, Texas, where I grew
up, the town motto was `the sky is the limit' and we believed it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That background may lack the polish of Washington. Then again,
I don't have a lot of things that come with Washington,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush hit hard on his baseline issues, but he _ in terms more
subtle than vice presidential nominee Dick Cheney's full-frontal
assault Wednesday night - also talked about character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have enemies to fight,'' he said, ``and I have no
stake in the bitter arguments of the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who often chides his own generation as too heavy on ``if
it feels good, do it,'' said fellow baby boomer Clinton has failed
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our generation has a chance to reclaim some essential values.
To show we have grown up before we grow old., But when the moment
for leadership came, this administration did not teach our
children, it disillusioned them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, polls show the Bush message, embodied in his speech and
performed here for four nights this week, is working. Nightly
polling by Voter.com-Battleground shows Bush now has a comfortable
18-point lead over Gore among independents, a key group. Bush also
has a six-point lead among women, a group Gore must have to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message of the convention does seem to be coming across,
said Republican pollster Ed Goeas, who conducted the survey with
Democratic pollster Celinda Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will get his shot at a convention bounce later this month
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   On the convention floor here, Bush's speech got high grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think America is falling in love with him,'' said
21-year-old delegate Bill Raskind of Duluth, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Delegate Tracey Edge of North Myrtle Beach, S.C. said the speech
delineated the differences between the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is taking the issues that are on the mind of the American
people, and that is education and taxes,'' said Edge, a state
lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, experts disagreed on the grade earned by Bush. Two
political scientists who have followed the campaign said Bush has
improved, but they disagreed on how much.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely more comfortable and seems quite believable.
These's no evidence of hesitancy,'' said University of Texas
professor Bruce Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said Bush touched on many of the same themes as he did
during his campaign, but repackaged them effectively to present to
a national television audience.
</P>
<P>
   University of Iowa professor Arthur Miller was less impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take this speech tonight and compare it with the speech
he gave at the Iowa straw poll a year ago, it's better but it's not
tremendously better,'' Miller said. ``It doesn't seem to come
across with any enthusiasm or fire.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the address as ``very safe speech,'' offering no
</P>
<P>
   new campaign themes or bold political initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, it added up to a solid showing for Bush, for whom
big-hall speaking has been a weakness. His State of the State
speeches have done a journeyman job of laying out his priorities,
but never attracted more than routine, appropriate applause.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Bush - who possesses a quick mind and
sometimes quicker tongue - tends to cruise on autopilot during
speeches. One-on-one and small-group mingles have been his campaign
trail bread-and-butter.
</P>
<P>
   An early foray into big-league speaking went poorly three years
ago when he was merely a big-state governor and rising star of the
GOP. Bush, who turned down most out-of-state speaking appearances
until he became a full-fledged presidential candidate, went to
Indianapolis to speak at the Republicans' Midwest Leadership
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP audience of 1,500 people gave him passing grades on
content - he criticized the Clinton administration's handling of a
welfare issue - but far lower grades on delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he had a good message. But I thought the
presentation as a little weak,'' Ed Mueller of Laporte, Ind., said
that day, summing up what became conventional wisdom of Bush the
public speaker.
</P>
<P>
   A woman in the audience that day said she also wasn't overly
impressed with the performance, but something caught her eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he may just be the next nominee,'' said Glenna Stephen
of Redkey, Ind. ``He seems different than the rest, so I want to
hear what he has to say.''

CANADA BROADENS ITS CASE AGAINST SUSPECTED HACKER  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Prosecutors on Thursday broadened their case against
a suspected teen-age hacker, adding dozens of charges that accuse
the boy of paralyzing several of the most popular World Wide Web
sites in the United States beginning on Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police has evidence that the boy, who
turned 16 on July 17, is responsible for attacks on the Web sites
of Yahoo, Amazon, AtLaw, eBay and Dell, said Staff Sgt. Jean-Pierre
Roy.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the prosecutor in the case, Louis Miville-Deschenes,
charged the boy with three counts of criminal mischief related to
attacks on the CNN Web site. On Thursday, he added 64 criminal
charges related to attacks on the other five sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have direct evidence that places him behind the
computer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, who under Canadian law cannot be identified but who
prosecutors say uses the online name Mafiaboy, made his first
appearance in youth court Thursday as his lawyer entered a plea of
not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Miville-Deschenes said that he was ``prosecuting this case as a
deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy added that police were now working on at least 20 other
computer-related cases. Although more arrests are expected, he said
that there was no evidence of accomplices in the Mafiaboy case.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier reports had linked the Mafiaboy name to a cybergang
called TNT, some of whose members are accused of stealing credit
card information belonging to Internet shoppers. But Roy said no
personal information about users of the victim sites was
compromised. ``It was strictly denial of service,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Miville-Deschenes acknowledged, however, that sealed court files
contains information that could prove harmful to some of the
corporations that it names.
</P>
<P>
   A distributed denial of service attack like the ones Mafiaboy is
said to have committed involves bombarding a Web site's computers
with thousands of useless messages a minute. The huge volume makes
it impossible to serve legitimate users. The attacker does not do
this directly. Rather, he uses telephone lines to gain access to
large computers linked to the Internet and then programs these
computers to send the deluge of useless data, multiplying the
congestion and masking the source of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Mafiaboy is suspected of using at least 54 computers to stage
his attacks. Most belonged to universities, including the
University of California at Santa Barbara. Roy said the suspect
also used at least two computers in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   If the event of a conviction, the maximum penalty the suspect
could face as a juvenile under Canadian law is two years in custody
and a fine of $1,000. In addition, the criminal record could be
wiped clean five years after the sentence was served.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could have been more than 100 charges,'' Roy said. ``We
decided to set a limit. We don't see why we should add more
charges. There is no reason to go further to identify more
attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the prosecutor and the suspect's lawyer agreed that the
trial could last three to four months. ``This will be the longest
youth court trial ever,'' Miville-Deschenes said. He added that the
police collected 50 days of digital and telephone wiretap evidence
and that each day of wiretapping consumes 40 hours of testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Police questioned the boy about the attacks two months before
arresting him in April, before the investigation was complete.
</P>
<P>
   The hacking trial is scheduled for Sept. 28. The suspect is free
on bail but is prohibited from using a computer except at school,
and then only for academic purposes with supervision. He may not
connect to the Internet or go to any establishment that rents or
sells computers. He is subject to a curfew of midnight to 7 a.m.
unless accompanied by a specified adult, except when he works a
late shift at a local restaurant.

   The government has been sued in the European Court of Human
Rights in a dispute over how to preserve a 13th-century Jewish
burial ground on the Prague site where an insurance company is
building its headquarters. The suit was brought by the Committee
for the Preservation of Jewish Cemeteries despite a March agreement
between the government and local Jews on encasing the cemetery in
concrete, and building above and below it.

 &HT;    BUSH ACCEPTS GOP NOMINATION, PROMISES TO RESTORE ``CIVILITY AND
RESPECT'' TO WASHINGTON
 &HT;    Eds: Adds color in opening grafs.
 &HT;    By JENA HEATH
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush accepted his party's
presidential nomination Thursday night, offering himself as an
inclusive leader who will broaden the Republican Party, restore
``civility and respect'' to Washington and bring back an ethos of a
simpler time.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech repeatedly interrupted by cheering delegates, Bush
urged Republicans and Democrats in the nation's capital to stop
feuding and ``end the politics of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's prime-time address ended the Republicans' four-day
convention that appeared to succeed in uniting a sometimes
fractious party. As the session concluded, an estimated 150,000
red, white and blue balloons and nearly a half ton of confetti fell
as the 2,066 delegates danced and clapped to a Latino rock beat.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was joined on stage by his wife Laura , running mate Dick
Cheney and his wife Lynn, and a broad spectrum of party notables
that included Arizona Sen. John McCain, the nominee's chief _ and
sometimes bitter _ primary election foe.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart, Bush's speech was a denunciation of President
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore as babyboomers who ``coasted
through prosperity'' and squandered their eight years in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our current president embodied the potential of a
generation,'' Bush said. ``So many talents. So much charm. Such
great skill. But, in the end, to what end?
</P>
<P>
   ``So much promise,'' he added, ``to no great purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling his father, former President George Bush, ``the last
president of a great generation,'' Bush called upon his own
generation to ``extend the promise of prosperity to every forgotten
corner of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They had their moment. They have not led. We will,'' he
declared, to thunderous applause and cheers. ``Our generation has a
chance to reclaim some essential values _ to show we have grown up
before we grow old.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech emphasized the themes Bush has relentlessly pursued
on the campaign trail: greater accountability for public schools,
strengthening Social Security, building up the military and cutting
taxes. Bush also wove in a recent theme, offering the elderly
Medicare coverage for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore campaign spokesman Douglas Hattaway ridiculed Bush's
speech even before it had been delivered, describing it in a
statement as ``the Texas two-step'' being played at ``the GOP's
masquerade ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway said ``George Bush attacked Al Gore tonight to draw
attention away from his agenda of cutting Social Security benefits,
lavishing most of the tax cuts on a few, raising Medicare premiums
for seniors, failing to ensure access to health insurance to every
child and failing to expand pre-school or college opportunity for
the next generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's prime-time speech appeared aimed beyond the boisterous
GOP faithful inside Philadelphia's First Union Center. It consisted
of a full basket of themes and promises intended to attract swing
voters, disaffected Democrats, minorities and young citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Bush mocked Gore, painting him as an obstructionist and a
pessimist who practices ``the politics of the roadblock, the
philosophy of the stop sign.'' And he ridiculed the vice president
for repeatedly characterizing Bush's proposals as ``risky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If my opponent had been there at the moon launch, it would
have been a, 'risky rocket scheme,''' Bush said. ``If he'd been
there when Edison was testing the light bulb, it would have been a,
'risky anti-candle scheme.' ...He now leads the party of Franklin
Delano Roosevelt. But the only thing he has to offer is fear
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush dismissed Gore, the son of a U.S. Senator and a lifelong
Washington insider, while recounting his own story of growing up in
Midland, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``That background may lack the polish of Washington,'' he said.
``Then again, I don't have a lot of things that come with
Washington experience. I don't have enemies to fight. And I have no
stake in the bitter arguments of the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to change the tone of Washington to one of civility and
respect,'' he said, prompting cheers from delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called on Republicans and Democrats to work together to
save Social Security, reshape the Head Start program for poor
children and, ``renew the promise of America's public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's wife, Laura, wearing a white suit, entered the convention
hall at 8:30 p.m. (EDT) and took her seat in the family's box. The
couple's twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, 18, were also in the
box, along with President Bush and his wife, Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Bush told reporters he felt upbeat about the
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I want to say,'' Bush said. ``I know the tone I
want to set.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected to feel emotional the moment he took to the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a moment of high drama and a lot of energy in the
hall,'' he said. ``It is a very close setting, so I'll be right on
top of the Texas delegation and the California delegation, where I
have a lot of friends. And the Ohio delegation will be to my
left... I'll be able to see my family easily. So it is going to be
a moment I'm really looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush talked with reporters after visiting President Ford, who is
recovering at Hahnemann University Hospital from two mild strokes.
The visit lasted about 20 minutes. Ford's wife, Betty, his
daughter, Susan and two sons, Jack and Steve, were also there.

STATE DEPARTMENT SEEKS $300 MILLION TO IMPROVE SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three months after Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright declared herself ``humiliated'' by lax security at her
department, manifested in one case by the loss of a laptop computer
with classified information, officials there are seeking $300
million to upgrade its headquarters and hire 900 new employees,
most of them security agents.
</P>
<P>
   Those officials, in charge of the department's security, say the
money is needed to protect intelligence and diplomatic secrets in a
culture that has long resisted strict controls. They intend to ask
for three annual $100 million increments, the first of them next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Their plans include overhauling the electronic turnstiles at the
main entrances, using ``biometric'' devices that scan human
features like the eyeball to control access to the most secret
areas and raising the number of diplomatic security agents to
1,500, a 50 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   The financing request, being drawn up by David G. Carpenter, the
department's top security official, is a response to recent highly
publicized breaches at headquarters. One was the disappearance in
February of the laptop computer containing highly classified files.
The FBI is still looking into the loss of the laptop and has issued
no finding as to whether it was misplaced or stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Two months before the laptop's disappearance, investigators
discovered an electronic eavesdropping device in a conference room,
prompting the Clinton administration to expel a Russian diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' Carpenter said in an interview, ``we've been
on fire with a couple of incidents. We see ourselves as a target''
of foreign adversaries, ``and we see it as prudent to go beyond
what our fellow agencies are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the security lapses stirred an outcry on Capitol Hill,
administration and congressional officials predict that the new
financing request will meet opposition from a number of Republican
lawmakers. Some Republicans tend to resist any increased financing
for the State Department, while others maintain that the solution
to this particular problem may have more to do with altering
attitudes about security than with replacing hardware.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican critic of the department, Rep. Benjamin Gilman of
New York, chairman of the House International Relations Committee,
said he would ``carefully examine'' the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I am not willing to just throw money at the problem,''
Gilman said. ``It will also take a change in the culture of
indifference to security at our State Department and an end to the
naive belief that there are no real enemies of our nation in the
post-Cold War era.''
</P>
<P>
   Recommendations being made by Carpenter stem from his review of
department security practices, an effort that was assisted by
experts from the Pentagon, the FBI and the Secret Service, and
included the long-term loan of an adviser from the Central
Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   After the laptop incident, Albright stripped her intelligence
bureau of its right to police itself and said she would promote
Carpenter, a former Secret Service agent, to a newly created post
of under secretary for security. (Not yet elevated, he remains an
assistant secretary.) Since then, officials said, about 7,000
department employees have been freshly briefed on security
procedures, uniformed guards have been assigned to patrol the halls
in search of unescorted visitors, and employees have completed
surveys to outline their need to handle classified information.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some diplomats have privately groused at the measures. Unlike
many of their colleagues at the intelligence agencies, those
involved in diplomatic work are necessarily in regular contact with
the outside world. The State Department's headquarters welcomes
roughly 1,000 visitors a day.
</P>
<P>
   Within that stream of visitors, about one in seven represents a
foreign government, officials say. Moreover, 97 foreign journalists
have direct access to the building. Timothy D. Bereznay, an FBI
section chief, told lawmakers in May that some journalists were
``hostile intelligence officers.'' But Bereznay did not elaborate
on that assertion, and Albright made light of it.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the department recently tightened its escort
policy to prevent visitors from roaming the building freely, and to
restrict journalists to areas of the first two floors unless they
have escorts as well.
</P>
<P>
   Further, officials have already allocated $5 million toward
overhauling the building's turnstile entrances. The new system will
require department employees to punch in a personal identification
number, or PIN, in addition to swiping their identity cards past an
electronic eye. Under the current system, a stolen card could be
used to gain entry, since no PIN is required.
</P>
<P>
   Department experts have also been exploring the possibility of
closing down streets adjacent to the building. In addition to
providing a buffer against armed attack, a closed street would give
security agents the space to search vehicles before they enter the
building's underground parking garage for employees. Currently,
only delivery vehicles are inspected.
</P>
<P>
   But, security officials said, the District of Columbia has e
vigorously opposed shutting down streets in an area where traffic
is already commonly snarled by motorcades, bridge traffic and
construction.

SPLIT OVER NEW YORK BANGLADESHI EVENT BELIEVED TO PROMPT THREATS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SHAILA K. DEWAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For almost all of New York's handful of
Bengali-language newspapers, Tuesday was a harrowing day involving
the city police, the postal police, FBI agents, hazardous materials
experts and, for some, showers in tents set up outside their
evacuated offices. Thursday, they were left wondering what the fuss
had been about.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement came after five Bangladeshi-American newspapers,
one in Manhattan and the rest in Queens, and one cultural
organization, also in Queens, received envelopes containing
threatening letters and a mysterious brown or white powder,
prompting an investigation by the city's joint task force on
terrorism, which includes police officers and federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   As best Abu Taher, the executive editor of Weekly Bangla
Patrika, could remember, the letter he received began ``Fobana
Alert: Take the sweet taste of nerve gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Fobana, which stands for Federation of Bangladeshi Associations
of North America, is the name of an annual Bangladeshi convention
to be held in New York on Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Kowshik Ahmed, the editor of The Weekly Bangalee , said an
employee had opened a similar letter and placed it in another
envelope. Shortly afterward, he arrived in the office and got a
call from the police. They asked him if he had received a
suspicious letter, and when he said yes, they told him to drop it
on the floor and leave the building.
</P>
<P>
   No one who came into contact with the powder was injured or
became ill, said James Margolin, a spokesman for the FBI. He said
the powder was being analyzed at a lab. But, he said, sending the
letters could have been a criminal act no matter what the powder
contained, and no matter what the intention of the sender.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of the federal mail to transmit a threat is illegal
whether the threat is terrorist or not,'' Margolin said.
</P>
<P>
   Taher said he had no idea what could have prompted the threats.
But he and others who received the letters suspected that they had
less to do with the machinations of international terrorists, and
more to do with a controversy within the Bangladeshi-American
community over Fobana 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The annual convention, which includes seminars and cultural
events by artists from Bangladesh, has long been troubled by splits
and factions.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there will be three Fobanas.
</P>
<P>
   The squabbling over who has the rights to the official Fobana
began last year, when two Fobanas were held in Atlanta. One
convention designated a Bangladeshi organization in Toronto to be
the host of this year's Fobana, which it plans to do. Then, the
other convention designated a New York organization to handle this
year's convention. Two organizations are claiming that honor. One
will hold Fobana 2000 at the Pier 92 convention center on Sept. 1,
2, and 3. The other will hold Fobana 2000 at Madison Square Garden
the same weekend. The organizers of both conventions said they
believed the letters were connected to the dueling conventions.
Both condemned the threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very sad thing such a nasty thing can happen,'' said
Shelley A. Mubdi, the organizer of the Pier 92 convention. ``It
shocks us. I have a hunch why it is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Mubdi went on to explain that the Atlanta convention had
designated his organization, the Bangla Desh League of America, to
be the host of this year's Fobana. But because he was not present,
another New Yorker, Saidur Rab, the owner of The Weekly Thikana,
had accepted on his behalf. Then, according to Mubdi, Rab
incorporated his own organization, the Bangladesh League of
America, New York, and proceeded to organize his own convention.
</P>
<P>
   Rab said he had been involved in his organization for 17 years.
But according to state records, his organization was not
incorporated until after the Atlanta convention, while Mubdi's was
incorporated in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   He added that most of the newspapers that received the letters,
except Taher's, were sponsors of his convention.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Alam, a staff reporter at The Weekly Bangladesh in
Jamaica, Queens, which did not receive a letter, said the fight
over the biggest convention in a small community _ there are an
estimated 200,000 Bangladeshi-Americans in New York _ was one of
egos, not politics or ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some ego problem in people,'' he said. ``That's
terrible.''

EDITORIAL: ETHICAL MUSEUM EXHIBITIONS  
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Aug. 4: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In its new ``Guidelines on Exhibiting Borrowed Objects,'' the
Association of American Museums is intent both on creating a sense
of ethical coherence in museum practices and reasserting the
uniqueness of museums themselves. The guidelines, announced earlier
this week, were written largely in response to questions about
financing, undue influence and possible conflicts of interest in
staging the ``Sensation'' exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum of Art
last year. The art in that show was owned by Charles Saatchi, who
also contributed $160,000 anonymously to the Brooklyn Museum and
stood to gain if the show increased the value of the artwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sensation'' may have served as the immediate incentive for
these guidelines, but in fact they address a set of basic conflicts
that affect all museums. Museums are supposed to serve as cultural
cathedrals, repositories of our most significant artifacts. Yet art
makes its way to museums in ways that are often labyrinthine,
closely caught up in the politics of power and money, the push and
pull of international art markets, individual collectors and
powerful patrons. The public has had no way of knowing whether an
exhibition of borrowed objects represented the best artistic
judgment of the professional curators, or was staged at the behest
of hidden donors.
</P>
<P>
   That is the value of these new guidelines. They codify the
relations between lenders, exhibitors and financial supporters in a
way that makes them transparent and as free as possible of
conflicts of interest. When the lender of the artwork is a funder
of the exhibition, the museum is to say so. Although the guidelines
are voluntary for now, ultimately the accreditation of museums is
expected to depend on adherence to these standards. The guidelines
give museums new ethical leverage in their effort to resist undue
pressure from lenders or corporate underwriters. They help define
and protect the boundaries of these essential institutions. &QL;

HELENE RITZERFELD, 86, EXECUTIVE IN TOP GERMAN PUBLISHING HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Helene Ritzerfeld, an internationally known executive of a major
German publishing house, Suhrkamp Verlag, died on July 22 at her
office desk in Frankfurt. She was 86 and lived in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said a colleague, Dr. Petra
Christina Hardt.
</P>
<P>
   At her death, Ritzerfeld, as she was known, was the longtime
head of the Suhrkamp department handling what are called, in U.S.
publishing, subsidiary rights. She was best known for her work in
foreign rights _ that is, the selling to non-German publishers of
the rights to publish books that had been published by Suhrkamp.
</P>
<P>
   Drenka Willen, a senior editor at Harcourt Brace, said
Ritzerfeld was influential in her field because ``for one thing,
Suhrkamp publishes high-quality books, so she sold the rights to
books of great consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a hard bargainer,'' she said. ``She was tough but
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Waters, the Harvard University Press' executive editor
for the humanities, said of Frau Ritzerfeld's passing, ``This is
the end of an era, as anyone who ever attended the Frankfurt Book
Fair will be more than happy to testify.'' The fair is an
international publishing event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great Walter Benjamin project we have going at the Harvard
University Press _ some 3,000 pages _ was made possible by her,''
he said. ``She helped me through so many complicated matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin (1892-1940) was a versatile German man of letters known
for his literary criticism and his surrealist nonfiction prose.
Since the late 1980s, the Harvard University Press has been
publishing English translations of Benjamin's works.
</P>
<P>
   Helene Ritzerfeld was born in Cologne, Germany, and graduated
from a secondary school there, the Kaiserin-Augusta-Schule, where
she specialized in Latin and mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, she lived in Norway and Berlin. After the
war, she worked for a time in the spa city of Wiesbaden, Germany,
for the United States occupation government. Her survivors include
a number of nieces, nephews, great-nieces and great-nephews.
</P>
<P>
   Willen said Frau Ritzerfeld was on excellent terms with all of
Suhrkamp's major writers, including Max Frisch, the Swiss novelist,
and Uwe Johnson, the German author and editor.
</P>
<P>
   She worked for Suhrkamp for half a century. The publishing
house's head, Dr. Siegfried Unseld,
</P>
<P>
   wrote after her death, ``Her commitment to spreading German
literature in other languages is legendary.'' She was also at home
in other literary cultures and translated works by George Bernard
Shaw, T.S. Eliot and Soren Kierkegaard.
</P>
<P>
   A noted German author from a later generation, Martin Walser,
recalled, in a remembrance that he wrote for the Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung: ``Outside Germany one heard that she was a
harsh negotiating partner. That was just her commitment on behalf
of her authors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To enter her room was to come to an ally,'' he added, ``and
what does an author need other than allies?''

BESSEMER TRUST TO ADD KEY BUSINESSES OF RIVAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ga., Calif.)  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the oldest firms in the business of managing
money for wealthy families, the Bessemer Trust Co., will announce
Friday that it is buying the private-client and
institutional-equity groups of a rival, Brundage, Story &AMP; Rose,
executives of the firms said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the firms, which are privately held, would disclose
the terms of the deal. But executives of the firms said the deal
would add $4.5 billion in assets under management and about 800
clients to Bessemer, which has $33 billion under management and
1,300 clients.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette said Thursday that it was buying
the other of Brundage, Story's three units, its institutional
fixed-income division with $3.3 billion in assets under management.
The terms of that deal were also not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   With the transactions, the Brundage name will disappear from
Wall Street 68 years after the firm was founded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This transaction is significant in that it allows Bessemer to
gain size and scale,'' said Henry McVey, a Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality,'' he said, ``is that many of the large commercial
and investment banks are now pushing into this market, and the
independent players need to bulk up.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. said it would buy the U.S.
Trust Co., and just last month Alliance Capital Management, which
is controlled by the French financial services holding company AXA
Group, bought Sanford C. Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Moszkowski, a financial analyst at Salomon Smith Barney
said, ``This is another manifestation of the need to be at a
certain minimum scale to maximize your economics in an environment
where more technology investment is needed every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis S. Branin, the chief executive of Brundage, Story,
acknowledged that size was an issue. ``We felt that longer term, it
was probably going to be more and more difficult for medium-size
firms like ours to compete across a broad range of services,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides investing its clients' money in blue-chip stocks like
General Electric, Intel and Home Depot, Bessemer also offers
investments in leveraged buyouts, venture capital and real estate
limited partnership funds. It also provides estate- and
tax-planning services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wealthy individuals want the services Bessemer has,'' said
Branin, who will join the larger firm along with seven partners.
Apart from managing the affairs of his former clients, Branin said,
his position, and those of his old partners, in Bessemer have not
been determined.
</P>
<P>
   For Bessemer, the transaction was ``an opportunity for us to add
some very talented private-client services and investment
professionals,'' said Donald J. Herrema, the chief executive of the
larger firm.
</P>
<P>
   Business has been booming at Bessemer, and it needed more
employees quickly. Its assets under management have more than
tripled over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Bessemer was founded in 1907 as the family office of Henry
Phipps, a partner of Andrew Carnegie in the Carnegie Steel Co. Its
purpose was to invest the $50 million Phipps received in the sale
of the steel business to J.P. Morgan. In 1974, the family decided
to take on outside clients.
</P>
<P>
   Bessemer added Miami to its New York and Palm Beach offices in
1981 and now does business in eight cities. It opened an Atlanta
office last year and expects to open one in Silicon Valley in the
next few months.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum investment with Bessemer is $5 million. The average
client's portfolio is worth $22 million, executives said, and there
are several dozen with investments of more than $100 million.
Brundage, Story's minimum was $1 million and the average portfolio
was worth $5 million to $10 million.

CHRYSLER PT CRUISER, FORD FOCUS ZX3 RATE POORLY IN CRASH TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 6.)  
 By CHERYL JENSEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two of the nation's most popular new vehicles, the Chrysler PT
Cruiser and Ford Focus ZX3, have fared badly in government crash
tests.
</P>
<P>
   The PT Cruiser received what amounts to a poor rating _ two
stars of a possible five _ for its ability to protect the head of a
driver wearing a safety belt in a front collision, according to
results released recently by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration. The two-door Focus ZX3 got just one star _ the
lowest possible rating _ for protecting a rear passenger in a side
crash.
</P>
<P>
   The safety agency conducts crash tests on new or popular models.
In the front test, vehicles are run at 35 mph into a solid barrier,
replicating a head-on crash between vehicles of the same size and
weight. In the side test, a movable, crushable barrier _ designed
to crumple like a car _ is rammed into the test vehicle at 38.5
mph.
</P>
<P>
   For the front tests, a five-star rating indicates a 10 percent
or less chance of serious injury. The two-star rating for the PT
Cruiser's driver indicates a 36 to 45 percent chance of serious
injury.
</P>
<P>
   The rating for the front passenger was four stars, meaning that
there was only an 11 to 20 percent chance of serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   In side-impact testing, a five-star rating means the vehicle has
a 5 percent or less chance of a life-threatening chest injury. The
Focus coupe's one-star rating represents a 26 percent or greater
chance of serious injury to a rear-seat passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Focus coupe and PT Cruiser scored better at protecting
other occupants.
</P>
<P>
   The PT Cruiser get four stars for protecting the front passenger
in a front crash, four stars for the driver in a side crash and
five stars for a passenger behind the driver. The Focus ZX3 got
five stars for both driver and passenger in a front crash and four
stars for the front passenger in a side impact.
</P>
<P>
   The Focus sedan did better over all, with four stars for driver
and front passenger in a front impact; four stars for the rear
passenger in a side crash, and three stars for a front occupant in
a side crash. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised by the one star,'' said Sara Tatchio, a Ford
safety spokeswoman. ``We did closely look at the test itself, and
we are not challenging it in any way. But it is not at all what our
internal testing showed, so our work is ongoing to figure out what
the differential is.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nor is DaimlerChrysler satisfied with the PT Cruiser's score.
``We are clearly a little disappointed with our two-star rating,''
said Daniel Knott, director of vehicle development for small cars,
who managed the development of the PT Cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important to note that if NHTSA gave decimal
points, we would be a 2.9 star,'' he said. If the head injury score
had been 50 points lower, he said, ``it would have been a three
star'' _ the rating suggested by the company's own testing.
</P>
<P>
   By measuring the forces on crash dummies, the agency comes up
with scores indicating the severity of injuries. A head-injury
score of 1,000 indicates the likelihood of serious trauma, like a
skull fracture; the PT Cruiser's score was 1,080 for the driver and
467 for the front passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hurd, a spokesman for the safety agency, said that despite
deployment of the Chrysler's air bag, the driver dummy's head
appeared to hit the steering wheel hard enough to bend it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Knott of DaimlerChrysler said that head-injury scores could vary
by as much 100 points, and thus the PT Cruiser could have received
three stars. But Hurd said his agency tries to remove any
variability from testing. If there is any variation in results, he
suggested, it could stem from how a car is manufactured.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)  &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Crash tests use a standard test protocol and are ``very
reproducible,'' said Julie Rochman of the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety, which conducts its own tests but has not yet
crashed either the Focus or PT Cruiser. ``If you do the same test
you should see the same result,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   R. David Pittle, senior vice president and technical director of
Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, said the PT
Cruiser's score was a blow to a vehicle that has taken America by
storm. ``I think consumers would be rightfully concerned about the
safety of the driver position that only got a `2' in this frontal
crash test,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For DaimlerChrysler, the poor showing was a second embarrassment
from the testing. The company got unwanted publicity when the
agency had to pay huge premiums to obtain two of the hot-selling PT
Cruisers.
</P>
<P>
   The agency quietly buys from dealers. Although list prices range
from $16,000 to $20,000, the agency had to pay $27,500 and $31,055,
highlighting what consumers were calling price gouging by dealers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very popular vehicle,'' Hurd said. ``My wife says
it's cute. My 16-year-old daughter says it's cute. Buyers are
paying premiums, and we paid a premium.''

COWBOYS ADJUSTING TO TOKYO TIME, SMALL BEDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The hotel is huge. The beds are small.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Cowboys players and coaches are enjoying
their stay at the very futuristic Tokyo Dome Hotel, a
two-month-old, 43-story high-rise located downtown and within a
9-iron shot of the Tokyo Dome, aka the Big Egg.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the Cowboys and Atlanta Falcons will meet in Japan's
American Bowl game, 9 p.m., CDT, tomorrow, inside a bustling,
baseball-oriented restaurant and amusement district appropriately
named Tokyo Dome City.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys strongside linebacker Darren Hambrick, a first-time
visitor to Japan, couldn't sleep and was in the hotel lobby by 6:30
a.m., Tokyo time, Friday. After all, his body clock told him it was
4:30 p.m. Thursday in North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rooms are really nice ... but the bed is hard,'' said
Hambrick, who found that if you're NFL player-size, you need to
find the proper technique to sleep in these Japanese twin-size beds
that are only two inches off the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to hop down in it real quick, then roll into it with
your knee,'' Hambrick said.
</P>
<P>
   This is a ``business trip,'' said Cowboys first-year head coach
Dave Campo, who wants his team to learn how to get its focus on the
road, where the Cowboys have lost eight consecutive
regular-season/postseason road games and seven consecutive
preseason road games.
</P>
<P>
   Campo acknowledges that it's a long way to go _ 6,420 miles _ to
teach his players a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they've got to be able to handle the distractions,'' he
said. ``This isn't exactly a replica \Rof a typical NFL road
trip\S, but it'll give us something to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have played more game abroad than any team in the
league, including the first American Bowl game (1986 vs. Chicago in
London). The Cowboys, however, are 0-6-1, including 0-1 in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Campo had them practice in shoulder pads and helmets Thursday
night (Friday afternoon, Tokyo time) inside the Big Egg, a
21/2-hour workout in front of the Japanese media. The Falcons stay
at the same hotel and work out before of the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   These two teams are quite different in media coverage. The
Cowboys are represented by both major newspapers from Fort Worth
and Dallas, plus TV reporters from all four major networks. The
Falcons are being followed by one sportswriter and one TV reporter
from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Players and coaches are fed American food at their respective
team training tables, which means that (aside from those small,
low, hard beds) there is little to complain about until the 12-hour
flight back home.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,007-room Toyko Dome Hotel is posh, to say the least. It
has the enormous feel of an air and space museum, sort of George
Jetson meets Baron Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   Just outside the glass elevators that overlook the amusement
section of Tokyo Dome City is a parachute ride that climbs 30
stories, then quickly plunges toward the ground, making the
elevator ride seem slow ... and safe.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel's mostly septic-white decor is set against a
background of fancy restaurants, botanical gardens and attentive
hotel workers who are eager to bridge the obvious language barrier
to try to answer questions and provide information to guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the benefit of being with the Dallas Cowboys,''
defensive end Ebenezer Ekuban said. ``Our popularity is known
around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Daily Yomiuri'', the local English-written newspaper,
carried a story in its Friday editions about this game primarily
from the Cowboys' perspective, including a picture of Emmitt Smith
being greeted at Narita Airport.
</P>
<P>
   This is the rainy season in Tokyo. The weather, not unlike
Wichita Falls, is hot and humid. By 6 a.m., the commuters began to
fill the highways around Tokyo Dome City on their way to work, and
the smog slowly began to burn off in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Hambrick found when he tried to hail a taxi in
front of the hotel at 6:30 a.m., but he couldn't get the driver to
stop.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrick laughed and walked back inside.
</P>
<P>
   He was just happy to be out of bed.

POSSIBILITY OF TEAR GAS ALARMS DNC NEIGHBORS &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Calling them ``damn, damn lies,'' a visibly angry
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan rejected claims that he has
ignored poorer areas of the city in planning the Democratic
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan's voice rose and trembled Thursday when he was told that
residents of the South Park and Pico-Union area complained they
would be treated better if they lived in Bel-Air or Brentwood,
where the mayor lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' Riordan said during a City Hall news
conference. ``I spend more time in economically disadvantaged areas
than I do in Brentwood or Bel-Air. Some of my strongest supporters
live there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the ones who recognize what we've done. We've made
the streets safer. They can walk the streets safely, they can go to
parks safely and I'm proud of what I've done in that area and other
economically disadvantaged areas. For them to suggest we care more
for people in Brentwood or Bel-Air is a damn, damn lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan was reacting to claims made earlier Thursday by the
Figueroa Corridor Coalition for Economic Justice, which held a news
conference to voice concerns of people who live across from Staples
Center, where the convention will be held Aug. 14-17.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Saavedra of the Pico-Union/Westlake Cluster Network said
she was offended by Riordan's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the outreach they were doing was to businesses and not to
residents,'' Saavedra said. ``It was us who learned about it and
forced the city to meet with block captains and get the word out.
It has been us who have put out leaflets and fliers to let people
know what is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, I would expect his reaction because the
sensitivity to residents is not there,'' Saavedra said.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Romero, a 32-year resident of the area, agreed. ``I feel
like we have been left in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan, however, said specially formed teams of city officials
have been meeting with block captains about the plans for the
convention, and those efforts will be stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra McNeill, an organizer of the group, said residents are
especially concerned about police questioning them about their
immigration status and use of tear gas or other chemicals to
control crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said residents are being supplied with identification to
get them past police lines, and no one will be asked about their
immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not ask anyone about if they are in the country
legally,'' Riordan said. ``What we want to do is use this
convention to showcase the city, not divide it.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said he was suspicious of groups such as the Figueora
Corridor Coalition and its agenda. ``It sounds like they are
professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   On other convention matters, Riordan said he plans to talk with
Philadelphia officials who hosted the Republican National
Convention in search of tips for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw volunteers on Rollerblades and they were all smiling and
helpful,'' Riordan said. ``I want us to tell our volunteers to
smile and welcome people to the city.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he was also impressed with the restraint shown by
Philadelphia police in the face of sometimes-raucous
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Riordan said he encourages downtown businesses to
remain open if they can arrange work schedules to avoid traffic.
``If they can't go to staggered hours, they should just send
everyone on vacation,'' he said.

PHILADELPHIA DIARY: A GIG, A BABE TURNED POL, AND THE RAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (CHANGES ``vanilla'' to ``mostly white'' in lede; SUBS 12th graf to
add detail; CORRECTS ``their'' to ``its'' in 24th graf)  
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI and MATTHEW PURDY  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican audiences this week have been prosperous and
mostly white and the stage always a Gap ad of vivid ethnicity. But
sometimes, the models have thoughts of their own.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, a group of children sat at school desks on the
convention-hall podium behind Laura Bush as she addressed the
delegates. On Thursday, at a ``Tribute to Laura Bush'' luncheon,
young performers from Philadelphia's Rainbow Company were her
backdrop in a packed hotel ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   The children were excited, but some members of the troupe, a
musical theater group, seemed to feel more like props for the
Republicans' message of inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how male presidents can understand about
abortion and pregnancy,'' said Katie Gould, 15, before the company
performed for the Bushes, who oppose abortion. ``Like they say
they're not for welfare and they're not for abortion. They've never
experienced it _ not that I have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a show,'' said Will Brock, 27, who plays keyboards for
the group. ``But they've got to do some things to get some votes
they don't usually get, some black and Hispanic votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Martin, the director of the theater, said he liked the
exposure and money from the event and being part of what he called
history. ``I'm certainly not doing it because I believe in the
Republican ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   Some on stage were more coy. Asked if she supported George W.
Bush, Lauren Brown, who just turned 18, smiled politely and said
``I know who I'm voting for, but it's a secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Brooks left the stage thrilled that Governor Bush had
spoken to her, and she said, ``I tend to favor Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   As the performers ended their program with a rousing ``God Bless
America,'' the Bushes worked their way into the middle of the group
so they were surrounded by the children.
</P>
<P>
   Shrugged Brock, the keyboard player, ``It's a gig, man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tale of Two Dans
</P>
<P>
   Pop political quiz: Which Dan is at the Republican National
Convention, Quayle or Rostenkowski?
</P>
<P>
   Guess again. Rosty, the once-powerful Democratic House
leader-turned convict in House Post Office check scandal-turned
corporate consultant, is offering convention commentary for Fox's
Chicago television station. .
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quayle, the once-youthful vice president and surrogate son
of President Bush-turned national amusement-turned political orphan
when a real Bush son emerged, is home in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Through his office in Phoenix, Quayle, who made a brief and
ill-fated bid for the GOP presidential nomination, said he was
making himself scarce to allow the light to shine on George W.
</P>
<P>
   Let's ask a veteran commentator. ``I hate to say this about him,
because he was vice president,'' Rostenkowski said. ``Dan Quayle
was never taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Rostenkowski once was, but at the convention, he said, people
looked at him quizzically. ``I'm just doing a job here,'' he
growled.
</P>
<P>
   For Republican Women Who Rock
</P>
<P>
   Congresswoman Mary Bono's new women's organization _ in a play
on the name of the women's group more typically affiliated with
another political party _ is called Right Now. It made its national
debut with a party Wednesday night at a nightclub called The Five
Spot.
</P>
<P>
   The party was pretty tame: The club typically has a burlesque
show with some nudity every Wednesday, but they canceled it and
hired a swing band in deference to the Republican women.
</P>
<P>
   Bono said she and a couple of friends were sitting around having
a beer last year when they came up with the idea for Right Now.
``We were just talking about how there were young women in the
Republican party who don't really have a place to go. They needed
someplace hipper than the Republican Women's Federation.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Bono's aides described that venerable group as ``the
blue-hairs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we're rock 'n' roll Republicans,'' Bono said, sipping a
vanilla martini. Then she made a whooping sound, like the exuberant
exhalation of a teen-ager at a rock concert, holding a lighter
aloft:
</P>
<P>
   Whooooo!
</P>
<P>
   Bono said that she decided to call the group Right Now because
feminists like Gloria Steinem and Patricia Ireland, the president
of the National Organization for Women, had defended Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, NOW is extremely ticked off at the abuse of their
name. Patricia Ireland, NOW's president, said, ``I think they will
be as successful in starting a grass-roots organization as they
will in holding on to our name. I have sent a notice to our general
counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Derek Conversion
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years can sure change a girl.
</P>
<P>
   Bo Derek used to be the bodacious babe in the movie ``10,''
bouncing along the beach in a macrame bikini that wouldn't provide
enough material for a potholder. In those days, she was an
apathetic California Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward two decades. Bo Derek is now a Republican
operative in a gray pants suit, a stump-speechifying campaign
junkie, a 43-year-old George W. Bush acolyte. Along with Lee
Greenwood, the Rock and Chaka Kahn, she is providing the GOP's
celebrity firepower.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, Derek spoke about her political awakening
and her excitement about appearing at the convention, where she
introduced a California assemblyman on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started out as a Democrat because I had the impression that
they were nicer people,'' she said. ``But I have spent a lot of
time out of the country, and you can't help but compare governments
and see how things function, and you start to see that what works
here is due to Republican policies.''
</P>
<P>
   But Derek differs from the Bush gospel on at least one major
issue: abortion. ``I am pro-choice,'' she said, then brightly
added, ``But I am really, really completely behind George Bush's
ideas about reforming education.''
</P>
<P>
   After the convention, Derek will start filming a new movie,
playing an alcoholic defense lawyer. She's no longer playing beach
babes.
</P>
<P>
   Would she ever run for office?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, but people have asked me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Soggy Scenes of Summer
</P>
<P>
   Don't take it as a sign from God that it rained every day of the
Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   But the weather in Philadelphia sure did contribute to sodden
energy levels by the final day of the Republican convention on
Thursday. California delegates were popping gingko-biloba capsules
to stay alert. Donors and delegates on their way into yet another
PAC party began to complain of gout. On ``Good Morning America,''
Charles Gibson stood on the floor of the convention hall and
pointed out a flashing sign to Diane Sawyer, who was in New York.
It read: We need fresh laundry, Diane!
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday night's grand finale, Kentucky delegate Joey
Stanton was dragging himself to the final happy hour sponsored by
House Whip Tom DeLay's political action committee, aboard a VIP
train car parked outside the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``My back hurts,'' he complained, ``My toenails hurt. My
bellybutton hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Borden of Texas said that friends had e-mailed him saying
he had looked asleep on C-Span.
</P>
<P>
   ``I e-mailed them back saying, `well, you dopes, I should have
looked asleep because I was asleep,''' he said. ``I am dying for
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it takes a grizzled professional to negotiate the
grueling party schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the former presidential candidate, looked spry and
expertly made-up on his way into the PAC party caboose. ``Having
been on the campaign trail, this is duck soup,'' he said.

TWO TOP EXECUTIVES OUT AS SAFECO SAYS IT'S TIME FOR CHANGE

 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ One of the pillars of Seattle's financial house
shuddered yesterday, as Safeco Corp. announced the upcoming
departure of its chairman, Roger Eigsti, and the immediate exit of
its top property and casualty official, Randy Stoddard.
</P>
<P>
   During the past two years, Seattle-based Safeco has struggled
with sagging earnings, a stock price that has lost more than half
of its value, difficult market conditions and the digestion of a
major acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   So corporate leaders Thursday said it was time for a change,
issuing a blunt statement saying Eigsti, the company's chief
executive officer, will retire at the end of the year, while
Stoddard, president of Safeco Property &AMP; Casualty companies, will
resign immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that a different style of leadership and executive
involvement is required to restore Safeco to its historic levels of
profitability,'' William Reed Jr., the lead independent director
for Safeco's Board of Directors, said in the statement. ``The
directors had been disappointed with Safeco's financial performance
for several quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   The move comes only 10 days after Safeco reported its
second-quarter earnings plunged 77 percent, due in part to unusual
losses related to storms. The decline was the latest in a series of
disappointing financial performances from the 77-year-old financial
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Only three months ago, Safeco said its first-quarter operating
earnings dropped 76 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Safeco president and chief operating officer Boh Dickey will
take over for Stoddard and also vie for the chief executive officer
slot. The company plans to look inside and outside its ranks for
its next leader.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say it may be time for a change. While Safeco is
recovering from its problems, the injection of new leadership could
bolster the effort, according to one analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the turnaround in the company is really in place. . .
. The speed of the recovery is still open to both change and
question,'' said Daniel Nelson, who tracks Safeco for the
Seattle-based investment firm Ragen MacKenzie Group Inc. ``(The
board) needed to send a message that it was minding the store
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street appeared to receive the message, sending Safeco
shares up $3.13, or 14.25 percent, to close at $25.06 in trading
Thursday. The surge stood in stark contrast to the recent
performance of Safeco's stock. The company's stock price has
plummeted from $55 on March 20, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Eigsti and Stoddard caps two Safeco careers
that spanned three decades. Eigsti joined the company in 1972 and
Stoddard came aboard a year later. Eigsti took over as chief
executive officer in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Safeco officials declined to discuss any severance package being
offered to either executive, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials praised Eigsti's performance, but they added
it could be time for a fresh management style.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not been a hands-on, interfering type of manager. Some
greater degree of involvement would help the company take advantage
of the strategic moves that Mr. Eigsti is responsible (for),''
Safeco's Reed said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the company wants to improve certain key
operations, including ensuring they charge proper rates and prices
and cut expense ratios, according to Safeco officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of getting back to the basic things that we do well,''
Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Safeco has also struggled to digest the largest acquisition in
its history, the $2.8 billion purchase of American States Financial
Corp. in 1997. While Reed said the purchase created some
distractions, one analyst said the insurer could have handled the
process better.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't assimilate American States anywhere near as well
as they could have,'' said Ragen MacKenzie's Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, board members will search for a new chief
executive officer. Dickey has emerged as a strong candidate,
although officials promised to conduct a broad search.
</P>
<P>
   ``New blood could reinvigorate the company,'' wrote Paul Latta,
an analyst with McAdams Wright Ragen Inc., in a report. He added
that Dickey offers a style that differs from Eigsti.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey said in an interview with Bloomberg News that Safeco will
increase insurance rates and cut expenses as part of a plan to
increase corporate earnings. Safeco also hopes to record a
healthier financial performance in the third quarter, Dickey said.

GARRETT EXPECTS MUCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I sidled up to the USC athletic director Mike Garrett Thursday
at the Pac-10 football media gathering Thursday and wisecracked,
``Are you going to fire Paul Hackett if he goes 6-6 again?'' as
Hackett was at the podium giving his state-of-the-Trojans address.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Garrett shook his head, frowned and coolly ignored the
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a tremendously talented team and I think we're
going to have a good year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And what if the Trojans have another flameout under Hackett,
whose two-year log at USC stands at a mediocre 14-11?
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be very disappointing if we don't have a good year,''
warned Garrett. . . .
</P>
<P>
   To listen to the optimism spewed by the 10 coaches at the annual
shindig held at the Gateway Sheraton near LAX, you'd think every
Pac-10 school actually has a legitimate chance to spend Jan. 1 at
the Rose Bowl, which is simply not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it'll all be roses this season, but I can't
envi &QL; 
- sion us going through what we did last year,'' said UCLA coach
Bob Toledo, whose Bruins wound up 4-7. ``I don't think we should be
evaluated by what happened last year. It was just so freaky because
of the suspensions and injuries. The season seemed to fall apart
after we played the opener against Ohio State with 11 of our
players on suspension.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the Bruins, according to Toledo, will be
beefier and stronger this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players put on a total of 600 pounds since last season and
set 90 personal new records in the weight training room,'' related
Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Toledo still might not have a worthy successor to Cade
McNown at quarterback, since two guys who weren't faintly up for
the part last fall, sophomores Ryan McCann and Cory Paus, are once
again competing for the starting position. . .
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hackett, on senior running back Petros Papadakis: ``We
missed his leadership badly when he got hurt (foot injury) a year
ago. He's really focused, and I expect him to have a great season.
He's a madman.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like his fabled father, Big John Papadakis, the former USC
star linebacker and San Pedro restaurateur who now packs 300 pounds
on his 6- foot-1 frame. . .
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising Dodger development this season just might be
the sudden batting surge of shortstop Alex Cora. We all knew Cora
could field, but few thought he could hit in the stout manner he
has in recent weeks. . .
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line with Shawn Green is that he's been a
disappointment with the Dodgers. Sure, he's driven in 73 runs, but
guys earning $14 million a year should be batting above .277 and
should have more than 18 home runs in this HR-crazed season. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Dodger general manager, Kevin Malone, is like Fred Claire in
one respect. As savagely as you knock him, he'll still greet you
with a smile and a handshake. Just like Tom Lasorda does. . .
</P>
<P>
   Never has so much been said about someone as inconsequential to
a football telecast as Dennis Miller. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I'd gladly work for Donald Sterling if he were willing to give
me $8 million across four years, which he was willing to do with
Cincinnati's Bob Huggins. Huggins was a fool to turn down such an
offer, especially considering the array of promising young talent
on the Clippers' roster. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Did you know Donald Sterling's alter ego, Andy Roeser, resides
in Belmont Shore?. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Will someone please explain to me why Carlos Perez still is in
the major leagues?
</P>
<P>
   Sat down the other day with Pine Ave. pioneer John Morris, and
we wistfully reflected on how the Long Beach politicians squandered
an opportunity of a lifetime in the early 1990s to build a football
stadium here that would have lured an NFL franchise. At least these
great visionaries did build a multi million dollar aquarium to lure
a bunch of exotic fish to our community. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The bright new Bonus Baby on our sports staff, Sir Clint
Olivier, isn't related to the late Sir Lawrence Olivier, although
he pronounces his surname the same way. . .

   Phil Trani's apprentice chef, Jason Kapono, has packed eight
pounds of new muscle on his 6-foot-7 frame this summer working
under the guidance of the Westwood fitness guru to the stars, Todd
Person. The UCLA sophomore now weighs 203.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Trani has had a lot of celebrities at his North
Long Beach bisto over the years, but none caused heads to turn as
dramatically as did the recent presence of Elizabeth Hurley, the
English sex godess and former boyfriend of Hugh Grant. . .

   My pal Dave Marshall, the nationally respected security chief of
the Queen Mary and former major league outfielder with the San
Francisco Giants and New York Mets, recently enjoyed a reunion with
his 1961 Lakewood High classmates. Long-time Met scout Harry Minor
tells me Marshall could have played in the NFL as a running back
had he pursued football. . .
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Lakewood High, one of its English teachers,
Kind-Hearted Kandi Boscon, former Cypress High bowling champion, is
picking up some loose change these sweltering days reciting poetry
and mixing beverages back at the Fish Tale. . .

   Butterfields is billing its massive memorabilia auction on Aug.
12 at Dodger Stadium as the as the Sale of the Century in which the
$20 admission fare will go toward Tony La Russa's Animal Rescue
Foundation (ARF).
</P>
<P>
   I'm definitely going to be there, since the 18th home run from
Mark McGwire's record- setting 70-HR season in 1998 will be
auctioned, along with the lineup cards La Russa used with the St.
Louis Cardinals on the evenings McGwire drilled his 500th and 501st
home runs.

<P>
   How can I continue enduring this cruel world without those
mementos in my overflowing trophy case?. . . .

   Kahn &AMP; Lamb, not to be confused with Martin &AMP; Lewis or even
Zeidler &AMP; Zeidler, continue their historic swath through the radio
airways, having just signed a three-year contract to do the Arena
Bowl, not to be confused with the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   You might remember that Larry Kahn and Mike Lamb once did the
USC football play- by-play on radio and have handled similar duties
this season for the Los Angeles Avengers of the Arena Football
League.
</P>
<P>
   The versatile Kahn, who recently quit his post-game talk show
bit for the Angels, will spend this fall doing UNLV football, while
Lamb, a Cypress resident, will do an eight-hour college football
show with Chris Rose for Fox Net Radio.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their radio gigs, Kahn &AMP; Lamb also are available
for appearances at birthday parties, bar mitzvahs, high school
class reunions, Sierra Club banquets, NRA rallies, Moose Lodge
roasts and Shriner conventions.
