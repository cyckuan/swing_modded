<HEADLINE> Four Tons of Marijuana Seized in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian police seized a
total of 4,146 kilograms of marijuana Friday at the port of
Sihanoukville, Rasmei Kampuchea Daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was the largest haul of marijuana seized by Cambodian police
this year and the case was under investigation, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the marijuana, loaded in a container with
17 tons of soybean, was slated to be shipped to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Illegal cultivation and trafficking of marijuana have been
rampant in Cambodia's central provinces in recent years, including
Kandal province.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia is seen by traffickers as an ideal spot for cannabis
production and a transshipment point for other narcotics. The
Royal Government of Cambodia is taking some drastic measures to
crack down on illegal cultivation, production and trafficking of
the drugs.

<HEADLINE> Big Water Project Inaugurated Near Ethiopia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- An emergency Dire dam
project, which cost 31 million U.S. dollars, was officially
inaugurated by head of Addis Ababa administration Ali Adbo on
Saturday, according to the Ethiopian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Dire Dam, located some 37 km north of Addis Ababa, is the
first largest drinking water dam built for the capital city of 2.3
million residents.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inaugural ceremony, the general manager of
Addis Ababa water and sewerage authority, Tadesse Kebede said the
city has been getting 30,000 cubic meters of water daily since the
project began operation three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
He said the city now meets 76 percent of the water demand as
against 60 percent previously.
</P>
<P>
The project started in 1996 and completed last December. About
12.5 million cubic meters of water has already been reserved in
the dam. When the level of the water reached to the dam's full
capacity, the city will get 12,000 cubic meters of additional
water daily.
</P>
<P>
This is one of two emergency water projects built for the city.
The Akaki emergency ground water project, built at a cost of 25
million U.S. dollars, will be completed at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Tadesse said when the Akaki project is completed the city could
be able to meet 95 percent of its water demand.

<HEADLINE> NATO Reaches Compromise on New Strategy, U.N. Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) reached a compromise on a new strategy for the
21st century at its summit meeting Saturday, stressing the
preeminent responsibility of the United Nations for world peace.
</P>
<P>
The NATO draft agreement contained "satisfactory formulas for a
solution" for France, which advocates the role of the U.N.
Security Council in authorizing the use of force, French
presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said the compromise reaffirms "the authority of
the U.N. Security Council and its primordial responsibility" for
upholding international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The debate over NATO's new strategic concept, its key strategy
document, has dogged the alliance for the last six months.
</P>
<P>
Another compromise formula stipulates that NATO will operate in
the "Euro-Atlantic area," making clear the 19-nation Western
alliance does not see itself as a "world policeman."
</P>
<P>
The document on enlargement of NATO names all the Central and
East European countries aspiring to follow Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary in joining the alliance and offers them
individual Membership Action Plans to prepare.

WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- U. S. President Bill Clinton
is seeking gun-control legislation following Tuesday's tragic school
shooting which killed 15 people.
</P>
<P>
The president, in his weekly radio address Saturday,
requests the Congress to approve 12 million dollars for
emergency teams to help communities respond when tragedy occurs.
</P>
<P>
He also requests gun-control regislation focusing on keeping
guns out of the hands of juveniles.
</P>
<P>
"The government must take responsibility," Clinton said,"We
must do more to prevent violence in our schools."
</P>
<P>
He said his Safe Schools Bill would crack down on gun shows
and illegal gun trafficking, prohibit "violent juveniles" from
being able to buy guns and close "the loophole that lets juveniles
own assault rifles".

<HEADLINE> NATO to Adopt New Strategic Concept in Second-day Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- NATO leaders on Saturday
resumed their summit meeting in Washington, which was originally
called to chart a course for the 19-nation bloc for the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
In the second-day session, the 19 leaders will adopt a new
strategic framework that lays out NATO's broader job of
intervening beyond its borders to protect what they called their
strategic interest around the world.
</P>
<P>
"It is our task this morning to make the alliance fit for the
21st century," said NATO Secretary General Javier Solana in
opening the second plenary session of the summit.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO would embrace a comprehensive plan to "advance
security and freedom for another 50 years, by enhancing our
capacity to address conflicts beyond our borders."
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the new framework would recognize, in
addition to NATO's core mission of mutual defense, new
challenges such as regional conflicts, weapons of mass
destruction, nuclear proliferation and transnational threats as
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Also on the agenda in the second-day session are a program
setting out required steps for aspiring members, a sort of road
map to joining NATO; the enhanced Partnership for Peace program,
wherein non-member countries get involved in NATO activities
which may or may not lead to membership; increased dialogue with
Mediterranean countries; and creation of a new center to deal
with weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The major difference over the new strategic concept, which will
replace the one last revised in 1991, concerns the alliance's
relations with the United Nations. France and a number of other
European countries want to set out specifically the conditions
under which NATO can take military action outside its traditional
Euro-Atlantic area.
</P>
<P>
The United States, however, prefers to leave the details about
the NATO relations with the United Nations in a vague term.
</P>
<P>
"There is a wide difference between President (Bill) Clinton
and me on the need to ask the United Nations (before taking
action)," French President Jacques Chirac said after meeting
with the U.S. president on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the 19 NATO nations are expected to acknowledge
the nine countries now seeking membership in the alliance. Each
candidate will be asked to provide NATO with an action plan, and
in return will receive feedback, advice and help in defense
planning.

<HEADLINE> School Shootings Shows Something Wrong in America: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-nine percent of
American people said the tragic school shooting shows something
seriously wrong in the country today, according to a poll jointly
taken by CNN, USA Today and Gallup Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Another poll, taken by CBS, said 80 percent expect more
shootings like the attacks at a Colorado high school to occur
elsewhere in the country over the next year or so.
</P>
<P>
As many as 15 people, including the two teenage killers, were
killed Tuesday in Colorado in the worst school shooting in
American history.
</P>
<P>
75 percent of people think teens who kill teens should face
the possibility of the death penalty, a Fox News poll said.
</P>
<P>
51 percent think the parents of teens who killed other teens
should face legal responsibility, according to the Fox News poll.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a republican presidential candidate said the
entertainment industry is partly to blame for filling the young
gunmen in the Colorado school massacre with violence.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. special envoy for the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Moustapha Niasse Saturday said
he had come to Harare to continue the mission of consultations at
different levels with all concerned parties in the DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released after a meeting with Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe, Niasse said during the course of this
month he had already met Secretary-General of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim in Addis Ababa, Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba has been mandated by the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) to lead the peace negotiations in the DRC war.
</P>
<P>
Niasse had also met with DRC President Laurent Kabila, Kenyan
President Daniel arap Moi and Burundi President Major Pierre
Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
Details of his deliberations were not revealed to the media but
 sources say the two touched on the recent libyan brokered
cease-fire agreement signed by Presidents Kabila, Yoweri Museveni
of Uganda, Idriss Deby of Chad and Muamar Gadaffi of Libya.
</P>
<P>
Niasse said his delegation would continue to emphasize the
willingness of the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, that of the
U.N. Security Council and the international community to the SADC
peace initiative led by President Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
"We will also strive to create new opportunities for the
attainment of peace, harmony, security and regional cooperation in
the spirit of resolution 1234 adopted by the Security Council in
New York on April 9," Niasse said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Security Council resolution 1234, among other things,
demands that all forces who are not in consistency with the
principles and purposes of the U.N. Charter pull out of the DRC
with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy arrived in Harare Friday and is expected to
leave Sunday.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Bangladesh Gets No Aid Commitments This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Much to its disappointment,
Bangladesh did not get any definitive commitments to the country's
request for 2.04 billion U.S. dollars in aid at the Bangladesh
Development Forum this year.
</P>
<P>
Shunning a direct answer whether donors had made any
commitments of aid at the two-day forum held in Paris on Monday
and Tuesday, Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria told reporters on
Saturday the "donors found the country's projection (of 2.04
billion dollars' aid) is realistic."
</P>
<P>
According to Kibria, the donors' aid flow would be more in the
next fiscal year (beginning July 1, 1999) than the amount sought
at the Paris meet, previously known as the Bangladesh Aid Group
Meeting, if utilization could be increased and on-going financial
reforms accelerated.
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous years, the donors refrained from making aid
commitments, as it had done in the past, which may indicate a
change in their policies towards aid to Bangladesh, observers here
said.
</P>
<P>
As a development forum, it focused on "development outcomes
rather than aid inputs," and the partners were moving away from
the previous format toward a genuine development forum in which
they were able to discuss ways of increasing the development
effectiveness of their investments ... in Bangladesh," a World
Bank press release said.
</P>
<P>
Other factors that may have prevented Bangladesh from getting
the anticipated aid pledge included an unstable political
situation, the slow pace of reforms, and the deteriorating law and
order situation in the country, the observers said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the country's donors raised their concern
over the political conflict in Bangladesh, and asked for a
resolution between the government and the opposition, but to no
avail.
</P>
<P>
"We've advised them (the donors) not to talk politics any
more... not to be worried about the political situation. We
assured them it will not affect foreign-aided development
projects," Commerce and Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed
reportedly said early this month.
</P>
<P>
And even Kibria admitted that the donors were "not fully happy"
over the pace of reforms in Bangladesh and they suggested
accelerating the reforms, particularly in the banking and
financial sectors.
</P>
<P>
The partners said the development effectiveness of aid in
Bangladesh was dependent on good governance and urged the country
to speed up the process of decentralization, reduce corruption,
and improve further the law and order situation.
</P>
<P>
They were also concerned about the "lack of appreciable
results" in increasing the rate of cash recovery from the stock of
non-performing loans, raising the rate of resolution of pending
cases in the money loan courts, and reducing the intermediation
costs in banking, "indicating that the pillars of governance and
discipline had not yet been adequately rebuilt."
</P>
<P>
Observers said that lack of definitive aid pledges from donors
was a heavy blow to the already weak economy of Bangladesh, which
has about 50 percent of its annual development program fund from
external sources.
</P>
<P>
Without the aid commitments, the government would have a hard
time in drafting its budget for the coming fiscal year, they
added.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Seeks Foreign Assistance in Oil Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's Oil Minister
Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah reiterated Saturday that his country
needs technical assistance from international oil companies in
developing its oil potentials.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the National Assembly (Parliament) about the "Kuwait
oil project", Sheikh Saud stressed the project was aimed at
obtaining operational services from foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
He added that obtaining foreign technical expertise could
prolong the projected age of the oil fields and traps.
</P>
<P>
"Current trend of the petroleum industry focuses on principle
of cooperation with the international oil companies as a
method of work in exploration, production and phases of
manufacturing," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Saud said Kuwait has not signed any agreement or made
promises to any foreign companies in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, a Gulf state with a crude reserve of nearly 100
billion barrels, began to ponder the idea of seeking foreign
expertise in developing its oil fields in 1993.
</P>
<P>
State decision-makers have ever since been trying to map
out an appropriate form of getting foreign technical assistance
without affecting the state's ownership of its oil fields.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's constitution stipulates that foreign companies have no
right to own or utilize its natural wealth.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Kuwait has contacted several world oil majors,
including the U.S. Chevron Corp., on its oil development project.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf emirate was planning to invite foreign companies to
participate in the upstream operations in developing the oil
fields in the country's northern and western areas.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saud said last February that inviting foreign
participation in the upstream operations, which involve
exploration, development and production, would drastically boost
Kuwait's ability to face future challenges, increase Kuwait's oil
output and safeguard its interests.
</P>
<P>
By seeking foreign assistance, he added, Kuwait can witness the
introduction of high technology it does not possess, secure markets
to absorb Kuwaiti oil as well as win foreign capital.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Closes Border with Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Macedonia closed its border with
Greece Friday to prevent any further NATO troops from entering the
country from Greece, an Albanian newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper "Gazeta Shaiptare" said that Macedonia, in which
12,000 NATO peacekeepers are deployed, does not want its territory
to be used to launch a ground offensive against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that NATO plans to send 2,000 German troops and
2,000 British troops via the Greek port of Selanik to reinforce
the peacekeepers in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia has long been resisting NATO's efforts in persuading
it to allow NATO forces to launch ground attacks on Serb soldiers
in Kosovo, which has been under extensive NATO air strikes since
March 24.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Macedonian Foreign Minister Aleksandar Dimitrov
made an exchange of letters with NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana to regulate the mandate, stay and activities of the NATO
forces in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
A Macedonian news agency MIA report, which was monitored here,
said that both sides agreed the safety of all NATO member
countries is immediately connected with that of NATO partner
countries.
</P>
<P>
It was once again reaffirmed by the exchange of letters that
the territorial integrity, political independence and the security
of Macedonia will be respected and guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a Macedonian Information Ministry source as
saying that it was made clear again the NATO forces stationed in
Macedonia are not offensive.
</P>
<P>
On the sideline of the NATO Summit in Washington to mark the
50th birthday of the Western military organization, Dimitrov
Thursday attended a meeting organized by U.S. Secretary of State
Madeline Albright.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by officials from Yugoslavia's
neighboring countries, including Albania, Bulgaria, Romania,
Hungary, Bosnia, Croatia and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
A number of initiatives for "transforming the Balkans and the
Southeastern Europe into a region of peace, security, economic
progress and democracy" were discussed at the meeting, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration presented its plans for "further
actions" in the Balkan region and additional humanitarian,
economic and financial aid to the countries affected by the Kosovo
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Notifies U.N. of U.S., British Violation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has notified the U.N. of
violations of its airspace by the U.S. and British warplanes which
dropped fuel containers on some areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
In two letters addressed to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
and U.N. Security Council, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf said that the aggressions by the U.S. and Britain had
led to the killing of a number of civilians, the Iraqi News Agency
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases dropped
fuel containers in the southern Iraqi province of Qadissiya, which
inflicted heavy damages, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The recurrent military attacks on Iraq were aimed at achieving
their political goals of undermining Iraq's sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since U.S. and Britain launched airstrikes on Iraq in
mid-December, their warplanes have been regularly attacking Iraqi
military sites and civilian facilities in the two no-fly zones in
the north and south of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"This aggressive act against Iraq and its people constitutes a
clear-cut breaching of the international law, and should not be
ignored or set aside by the Security Council and the U.N.,
especially when those who committed this hostile act are Security
Council permanent members," said Sahhaf.
</P>
<P>
In the letters, Sahhaf said that Iraq retained its full right
to adopt necessary measures to defend its sovereignty,
territorial integrity and security and to demand compensation for
the damages and casualties caused by the aggressions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq would strongly resist the so-called no-fly zones imposed
unilaterally by the U.S. and Britain after the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in the
wake of the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppression."

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Crown Prince and
Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz met in the Saudi
summer capital of Jeddah Saturday with General Manager of the
French Total oil company Theri Demaris on prospects of
investment in the kingdom's energy sector.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed draft plans presented by Total in
response to an invitation made earlier by the Saudi crown
prince on world oil majors to invest in the Gulf country,
the Saudi Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Oil experts said that Riyadh was conducting in-depth studies
on plans proposed by international oil companies to choose the
most appropriate schemes.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen chief executives of foreign oil companies,
mostly American, have visited Saudi Arabia since Abdullah made
the call during his seven-nation global tour last September.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world largest oil producer, had been
reluctant to allow foreign participation in its oil and gas
exploration and production because of its current surplus output
capacity over 2 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources in the region said recent visits by
foreign oilmen and their meetings with Saudi senior officials
might have marked a shift in Riyahd's previous policy on
foreign investment in its energy sector.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
met with visiting Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov Saturday on
Mideast peace process and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
No details of the meeting were given by the Syrian state news
agency SANA, but local observers say that the proposed visit by
Assad to Russia should be one of the topics between the two.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival from Cairo earlier in the day, Ivanov said Russia
holds that the Middle East peace process should be resumed on all
tracks and peace in the region will not be attained without Syria.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said that it is imperative to resume the Syrian-Israeli
negotiations from the point where it was stalled since 1996.
</P>
<P>
And those talks should be based on relevant U.N. Security
Council resolutions and in accordance with the Madrid Conference
formula as well as the principle of land for peace and the return
of the occupied Golan Heights to Syria, said the Russian minister.
</P>
<P>
Russia, as a Middle East peace process co-sponsor, attaches
great importance to the Syrian stances on international and Arab
affairs, he said, adding that such issues would top the agenda of
his talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and his Syrian
counterpart Farouq al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
The talks will touch on ways of boosting bilateral ties as the
two countries are to celebrate the 55th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Sharaa, who received Ivanov at the airport, expressed
satisfaction with the Russian stance.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, on a Mideast tour, has already visited Israel, the
Palestinian territories and Egypt.

for an international conference under the auspices of the United

During the meeting, Corach also voiced his country's readiness
to enhance cooperation with Egypt in the field of security.

LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A suspected nail bomb exploded in
Brick Lane, east London, on Saturday evening, injuring at least
five people.
</P>
<P>
BBC quoted eyewitnesses as saying that a purple Ford Sierra car
exploded in the street just before 1800 local time (1900 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The explosion happened exactly a week after a nail bomb injured
39 people in Brixton, south London. Four racist groups have
claimed responsibility for the Brixton blast.
</P>
<P>
Emergency services were called to the scene -- which is at the
heart of a large Bangladeshi community -- and report severe damage
and at least five casualties.
</P>
<P>
Police investigators believe a man may have been delivering an
explosive device to the local community police station when it
exploded.

<P>
The car is believed to have exploded outside the Sweet and
Spicy restaurant near Brick Lane police station.
</P>
<P>
Anti-terrorist Branch officers were at the scene carrying out a

DAMASCUS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A Libyan airliner, the first
after the U.N. suspension of air embargo earlier this month,
landed at Damascus International Airport Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On board of the Libyan Plane was Mohammed Abou Gharis,
Director General of the Libyan Civil Aviation Authority, a number
of Libyan transport officials together with a galaxy of artists
and some Libyan folklore troupes which gave a series of popular
local performances at the welcoming ceremony held to the occasion.

Libya had been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its refusal
to hand over two suspects in the bombing of a Pan-American
airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The two Libyan suspects were handed over to the U.N. on April 5
to be tried in the Netherlands before a Scottish court. In return,
the U.N. sanctions against Libya was automatically suspended and
will be lifted within 90 days after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi

<HEADLINE> Israel Slammed for Closing Palestinian Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Saturday lashed out at
Israel for its decision to shut down three Palestinian offices in
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters that the Israeli
government's decision to close three Palestinian offices in the
Orient House is a new act aimed at defying the Middle East peace
process and disdaining international laws.
</P>
<P>
Moussa underlined that East Jerusalem is part of the occupied
territories and the holy city's final status has not yet been
determined.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the traditionally Arab East Jerusalem in the
1967 Mideast war and has ever since taken measures to judaize the
city, which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future
independent state. The two sides have agreed to negotiate the
issue in the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet decided on Thursday to shut down the
Palestinian offices in the Orient House, which has been used a
liaison office by the Palestinians since the Madrid Middle East
peace conference in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attributed the
decision to Palestinian Minister for Jerusalem Affairs Faisal
Husseini's meeting on Wednesday with Arab and foreign diplomats
accredited to the Palestinian National Authority.

ADDIS ABABA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A newly-completed sugar
plant, the third biggest in Ethiopia, was inaugurated by Ethiopian
President Negasso Gidada Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Finchaa Sugar Factory has an annual capacity to produce
85,000 tons of sugar. Located at the Finchaa valley, some 350 km
west of the country's capital Addis Ababa, it will also produce
eight million liters of ethanol, a natural by-product of sugar
every year.
</P>
<P>
Negasso said at the ceremony that the new plant will
significantly contribute to the country's self-sufficiency in
sugar supply, the Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It took some 22 years for the detailed feasibility study and
construction work for the factory, which costs about 228 million
U.S. dollars, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The sugar factory began trial production last year. It has some
4,000 workers now on the payroll.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Rejects NATO Presence in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia would not allow
any presence of armed foreign troops on territory to enforce a
possible peace agreement in Kosovo, Belgrade's Foreign Minister
Zivadin Jovanovic said in an interview with the Washington Post
published on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Such a peacekeeping force would contradict Yugoslavia's
"sovereignty and territorial integrity," and any ground invasion
of Yugoslavia would widen the conflict "beyond the borders of
Yugoslavia" and pose "dangers to the whole continent," Jovanovic
said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also warned a NATO ground invasion of
Kosovo -- a possibility that is increasingly under consideration
-- would widen the present war "beyond the borders of Yugoslavia"
and pose dangers to the whole continent."
</P>
<P>
Vietnam "would be nothing" compared with the kind of war the
United States would risk in Yugoslavia, he said. "We are ready to
defend our country and we shall succeed," he added.
</P>
<P>
A NATO ground campaign "would be yet another miscalculation by
those who have already been proved wrong so far," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic spoke with the Washington Post in his office at the
Foreign Ministry shortly before NATO issued a statement on
Kosovo at its Washington summit.
</P>
<P>
He said Belgrade was prepared to accept the return of ethnic
Albanian refugees to Kosovo under the supervision of an
international force, but such a force could not be armed and
could not include representatives of the United States and other
countries "involved in aggression against Yugoslavia."

</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The Lebanese government is considering selling off
two-thirds of Lebanon's national flag carrier the Middle East
Airlines (MEA) to the private sector, the Arabic daily Al-Hayat
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Minister of Public Works and Transportation Najib
Mikati told the paper that the government might sell off
two-thirds of the financially-troubled airline to foreign
partners, while holding the remaining one third to monitor the
parters.
</P>
<P>
The move is intended to rescue MEA from a burden of debts
amounting to 234 million U.S. dollars accrued in the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister refused to give a price tag for the deal,
maintaining that it could go up if MEA retrieves its financial
losses and undergoes further rehabilitation, attracting better
offers.
</P>
<P>
DOHA -- The Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD)
has agreed to provide Yemen with a loan of 58 million U.S. dollars.

back in 20 years with a grace period of four years.
</P>
<P>
The money is to be used financing a project on drainage water
recycling and disposal in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa.

The Doha-based AFESD is an Arab League financial agency
established in 1974 to extend long-term loans and technological
assistance to Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Yemen has received about 780 million U.S. dollars of loans from
the Fund so far.

</P>
<P>
The Arabic daily Al Haiyat Saturday quoted a recently-released
U.N. report as saying that the UNDP has spent 284 million dollars

KHARTOUM, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government has
agreed to renew an interim cease-fire in southern Sudan to
facilitate humanitarian aid to reach the needy in the south.

<HEADLINE> Iran Asks Iraq to Clarify Fate of Iranian POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official on
Sunday called on Iraq to clarify the fate of 2,806 Iranian
Prisoners of War (POWs) held in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Abdollah Najafi, the head of the Iranian special commission in
charge of POWs, said the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) has confirmed the documents were provided by Iran on the
remaining POWs in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has offered a list on the Iranian POWs in Iraq and
promised to help secure their release, Najafi was quoted by the
Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the Iraqi side will follow up the case
and the Iranian POWs still being held in Iraq will be granted
freedom soon.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has also claimed that about 2,000 Iraqi POWs are still
being held in Iran, Najafi said. But he neither confirmed nor
rejected the Iraqi claim.
</P>
<P>
He said 3,587 Iraqi POWs have refused to return to Iraq and
chosen to remain in Iran as refugees.
</P>
<P>
Iran released 6,246 Iraqi POWs unilaterally last year in
coordination with the ICRC while Iraq freed 372 Iranian POWs, the
Iranian official said.
</P>
<P>
Iran precisely examined a list of 9,162 Iraqi nationals
provided by Iraq, but many of the names were repetitive, exchanged
before, refugees or unknown to Iran, Najafi said.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran determined the fate of 18,995 Iraqi POWs
last year.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq reached an agreement last June to settle the
issue of POWS, which has been preventing the two neighbors from
resuming normal relations since the end of their eight-year war in
1988.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Consults With Ghana on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Sunday held talks with Ghanaian officials led by Vice-President
John Atta Mills on the Mid-East peace process with particular
focus on the intended declaration of statehood by Palestine, the
Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Ghanaian capital Accra Saturday night as part
of his African tour to seek advice on whether to go ahead with the
declaration or to delay the process till the Israeli elections
slated for May 17.
</P>
<P>
The 1993 Oslo Accord provides for the declaration of Palestine
as an independent state from May 4 this year.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by his Minister of International Cooperation,
Nabeel Shaath and his political advisor, Nabeel Abourdene, Arafat
had been to Conakry, Guinea, and Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader told reporters on arrival that the
Palestinian authority has the right to declare independence.
</P>
<P>
However, consultations are necessary "with brothers and
friends" whose support Palestine has enjoyed over the years on the
subject, said Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Sampling views during his tour, he said, "some of them are
advising us to delay a little bit and make the declaration after
the Israeli elections."
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, a final decision will come from the Palestine
Central Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"I will discuss my findings from the consultations with the
Central Council before a final decision is taken," he said.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth visit to Ghana by Arafat.
</P>
<P>
In a pre-departure briefing, Shaath described the Accra talks
as extremely fruitful, saying that the outcome will be a major
input for consideration by the Palestine General Assembly when it
reconvenes Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ghana's role in the peace process is vital and
hopes the west African country would spearhead the international
campaign for a successful peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official commented on recent actions taken by
the Israeli government against Palestine's facilities, saying that
they could have very serious and negative repercussions on the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel recently closed the Palestinian office in east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is scheduled to visit Nigeria and Ethiopia before
returning home.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings is currently on an official
tour to the United States.

"China is a very big country while Israel is small, but they
share much in common, including old civilization," Weizman said,
adding that technical cooperation between the two countries will

<HEADLINE> China's Investment in Ethnic Groups Grows Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China's investment in minority
ethnic-group areas has been increasing rapidly over the past years,
according to Li Rongrong, vice minister of the State Development
and Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Reporting to the 7th meeting of the Nationalities Committee of
the 9th National People's Congress (NPC) today, Li said that among
the 2,656 infrastructure investment projects in China last year, 1,
750, or 66 percent, were in the central and western regions where
most of the country's ethnic-minority population lives, and 530 of
these projects, or 20 percent, were in other concentrated ethnic
areas.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he said, China's average growth rate for investment
in state-owned units was 19.5 percent, while the figure was 75.4
percent in the Tibet Autonomous Region, 25.9 percent in the
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and 22.2 percent in the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
He added that during the 1980-1998 period, the average GDP
growth rate for China's five ethnic autonomous regions, and among
the three provinces of Guizhou, Yunnan and Qinghai where ethnic
minorities live in compact communities, was 0.5 percentage points
higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
The rapidly increased investment in infrastructure construction
in China's ethnic concentrated areas will greatly improve
transportation, flood control, electricity supply, and
environmental protection there, he said.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was presided over by Wang Chaowen, head of the
Nationalities Committee of the 9th NPC. Tomur Dawamat, vice
chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, was also present at
today's meeting.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Vows to Cut Industrial Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- This largest commercial and
industrial center of China plans to reduce the proportion of its
money-losing state-owned and state-controlled enterprises from 35
percent to 15 percent by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
This plan means that some 400 money-losing state-owned
enterprises, and enterprises in which the state holds a
controlling interest, will be brought out of the red, according to
a municipal industry official.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai currently has more than 1,700 state-owned firms and 1,
000 state-controlled firms, and 35 percent of these enterprises
are now operating in the red, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's industrial economic efficiency improved last year
with a 10.8 percent increase in total industrial production and
profits reaching 20 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the first two months of this year, the profit volume among
Shanghai's industrial firms jumped 31.3 percent to 2.27 billion
yuan, while total losses of the money-losing firms dropped 16.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Currently, state-owned firms account for 22.8 percent of the
combined asset volume of all Shanghai industrial firms, down 6.3
percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The official said that losses have occurred as a result of
unreasonable product mix, declining prices, the interaction of the
forces of foreign exchange, tax and interest rates, a lack of
circulating funds, economic restructuring, and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Since the causes of the losses are clear, the objective of
significantly reducing the number of failing firms can be
accomplished as scheduled, he said.

Jiangsu's increased efforts in the area of technical renovation
has improved the province's economic structure, raising the
incremental value of its four pillar industries of machinery,
electronics, automobiles, and petrochemicals to 47.5 percent of
all industrial added value last year.
</P>
<P>
Technical renovation has also helped enhance cooperation with
overseas investors. Currently, more than one third of the world's
top 500 firms have established their presence in Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
The 15,500 operational overseas-funded enterprises in Jiangsu
generated a total of 8.06 billion U.S. dollars in foreign exchange
last year, or 51.5 percent of the province's total export foreign-
exchange earnings for the year.

<HEADLINE> China Leads World in Deep-Reservoir Oil Exploiting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China has dug 527 oil wells each
at a depth of more than 4,500 meters at the Tarim Basin in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
These wells, scattered among eight of the 14 oil fields in
Tarim, have produced 20 million tons of crude oil, said Wang
Yiqing , deputy chief engineer of the Tarim Oil Prospecting and
Exploiting Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Emerging as China's eighth-largest crude oil and natural gas
producer, the Tarim Basin has potential oil reserves of over 10.7
billion tons, and natural gas reserves of over 8.4 trillion cubic
meters, accounting for about 13 percent and 25 percent of the
current total respectively, according to an official resource-
assessment report.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the oil resources in Tarim were buried 4,500
meters beneath the ground surface. In addition, many oil layers
are located between gas-bearing and water structures.
</P>
<P>
Many hi-tech capabilities including air-pumping and reservoir
description technology are employed in drilling the ultra-deep
wells in Tarim, said 59-year-old Wang, who has headed a technical
group in Tarim for many years.
</P>
<P>
Oil workers have also developed technology for drilling oil
wells in the desert, for drilling five horizontal wells at the
Tazhong Oil Field to develop oil layers of the carboniferous
system, each with a daily output of 1,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Urges to Solve Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
Sunday urged the Israeli government to solve the dispute over
Jerusalem through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, the top Palestinian official in Jerusalem,
told reporters at the Orient House in east Jerusalem that the
Israeli government's order to close the Orient House may cause
unrest in the holy city.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Israeli government led by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted on its position over the issue of
Jerusalem and claimed the city as the indivisible and eternal
capital of Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the Palestinians also have the right to make
their position clear that they regard Jerusalem as the capital of
their future independent nation.
</P>
<P>
Husseini stressed that for this reason the dispute over
Jerusalem could be solved only through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's security cabinet ordered the closure of the
Palestinian National Authority's (PNA) offices in the Orient House
on Thursday, a day after Husseini invited European consuls to the
compound.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have noted that the peace agreement signed
between Israel and the PNA ban Palestinian activities in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Husseini told reporters that the Orient House does not
represent the PNA, noting that the compound has been working as a
Palestinian center for years.
</P>
<P>
He also indicated that Netanyahu was seeking publicity ahead
of the May 17 elections by ordering the closure.
</P>
<P>
Husseini did not specify how the Palestinians will react if
the closure is implemented, but said the closure will make "a lot
of problems" in the city.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian lawyer Jawad Boulos said on Friday that
he would appeal any closure orders to the Israeli Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
And legal experts quoted in Israeli newspapers said the
closure procedure would take at least two weeks and might be
stopped by the courts.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the traditionally Arab East Jerusalem from
Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed it. The
Palestinians want to establish a future capital in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to the peace agreements signed by the two sides, the
issue of Jerusalem should be settled in the final status talks.

TIANJIN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The container ship Cape Race of
the China Shipping Group left the port of Tianjin this morning to
begin the first voyage on the Asia-Europe route opened by the
Group.
</P>
<P>
This is another key measure adopted by the Group after it
opened a China-Australia route last month, which marked the
Group's entry into the global container transportation market,
noted the Group's president, Li Kelin, at a celebration ceremony
at the port this morning.
</P>
<P>
Li said the Group has nine ships capable of carrying 2,000-3,
000 containers each which will make the weekly Asia-Europe run.

<P>
The route, which includes ports of Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai,
Hong Kong, Singapore, Rotterdam and Hamburg, also forms a network
covering the main ports of China and of Japan, the Republic of
Korea and several Southeast Asia countries, according to Li.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Govt Slammed for Detaining Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan Association of
Journalists (ARJ) has strongly protested the illegal detention of
two journalists: John Eddie Mugabi and Amiel Nkuliza, the Rwanda
News Agency (RNA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a protest note addressed to President Pasteur Bizimungu on
Saturday asking for his intervention to help end harassment and
pressure on reporters in the country, ARJ condemned the arrest of
the two scribes.
</P>
<P>
''On the eve of May 3, the World Day on he Freedom of the
Press, we, members of the Association Rwandaise des Journalistes
(ARJ), do write to you Excellency, Pasteur Bizimungu, to protest
the arrest and detention of our members and colleagues,'' the note
said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabi, the News editor of the English monthly Newsline, and
Nkuliza, the "Directeur de Publication'' of Le Partisan were
respectively arrested on February 26, 1999, and May 14, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Mugabi is reportedly kept in custody on grounds of alleged
defamation of the Secretary General in the Ministry of Defense,
Colonel Frank Rusagara, whom he said in a story about a helicopter
deal which ''might have obtained a 10 percent commission through
underhand methods.''
</P>
<P>
The ARJ recalled that ''at the beginning of the year, the
helicopter saga was reported several times in Ugandan press where
the story featured prominently.''
</P>
<P>
It is said that Mugabi accepted responsibility of being the
author of the story during the interrogation by the Kigali
prosecutor, Emmanual Rukangira, but refused to disclose the source
of his news story.
</P>
<P>
''On being pushed further, Mugabi told the prosecutor that he
can only reveal the source before the Court,'' underscored the
ARJ.
</P>
<P>
Mugabi was subsequently thrown into prison and well-informed
sources say that he is detained at Remera Central Prison, in the
outskirts of the capital, together with genocide suspects.
</P>
<P>
''We find this uncalled-for pressure to force journalists to
reveal the source of his news story unacceptable,'' the ARJ told
president Bizimungu.
</P>
<P>
''For a government official of Mr. Rukangira's standing, and a
highly placed senior lawyer at that, to subject a journalist to
pressure in order to reveal the source of his news story under
duress is nothing but a violation of basic freedoms of journalists
in this country,'' it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The ARJ stated that they protest against the detention of
Mugabi as a criminal, while his case is civil one.
</P>
<P>
But argued Rukangira, Mugabi's case is a penal one, and it was
filed by Rusagara as any individual who felt offended by the
journalist's alleged defamation.
</P>
<P>
'It is unbelievable for a civil case of alleged defamation or
libel, which has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, to be
treated and handled as if it is a criminal one,'' ARJ stressed.
''At the time, the manner of his arrest was unfair, contestable
and unprocedural,'' observed the association.
</P>
<P>
The ARJ sees in Mugabi's case, the attempt by the government to
 intimidate and muffle the press which, in the past months, has
been very vitriolic about creeping corruption in the country, thus
triggering hostility in some quarters.
</P>
<P>
The Assumption by the ARJ stemmed from the fact that while
appearing before court on April 15, Mugabi was denied the release
on bail, because the prosecutor ''unfairly convinced the court to
deny him bail and insisted that he (Mugabi) should remain in
detention till the next hearing date.''
</P>
<P>
''We find this kind of prolonged detention contrary to the law,
indeed, a violation of Universal Law on Basic Human Rights and an
abuse to the liberties and freedoms of the press,'' highlighted
the ARJ.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the situation of Mugabi's family is precarious
because he was the sole bread winner before his arrest. He
reportedly left behind his wife an one day old baby, now faced
with a number of problems, starvation not withstanding.
</P>
<P>
''If we can report on some situations because they implicate
some members of the government, how is the media here going to
help redress the abuses of the past,'' one Kigali-based reporter
who asked not to be named told the Rwanda News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the case of Nkuliza remains a mystery, noted ARJ in
the note filed to Bizimungu. It is reported that there were at a
certain time allegations of involvement in the genocide, but this
changed into something else the association is not informed of.
</P>
<P>
''We believe that Mr Amiel is genuinely held under unclear
charges, which is yet another way of muzzling the press,''
observed the association.
</P>
<P>
The ARJ called for a partnership with the government in the
process of good governance and development.
</P>
<P>
Rukangira told RNA that he is no longer in charge of Mugabi's
case file, and directed the agency to seek explanation from a
judge at the Kigali Court of First Instance who is handling the
case.
</P>
<P>
The reaction of the government is yet to come, but already fear
among media practitioners has increased in face of alleged
harassment of the press which is seen as a big threat to its
rightful place in the rebuilding of genocide-torn Rwanda.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan opposition Sunday
reported new impetus in several northern provinces in a bid to
repel the Taliban armies since the capture of Bamyan city by the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the opposition Shiite Harakat-e-Islami Saad
Mohseni said in a message from Tashkent, capital of Tajikistan,
that Northern Alliance has intensified operation in Samangan,
Balkh, Faryab and Jawzjan provinces.
</P>
<P>
"Our commanders from Central Afghanistan have confirmed fierce
fighting in Kotal e Shebar, Kotal e Hajy Gak and Dara e Shekari,"
Mohseni said.
</P>
<P>
He said fighting has also flared up in Faryab following the
brief capture of Juma Bazaar by troops loyal to the alliance last
week.

<P>
Mohseni said that the much-publicized "mutiny" has been quelled
in Faizabad, capital of Badakhshan province.

<HEADLINE> Vaccination to Block Spread of Hepatitis B in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese health officials today
called for enhanced efforts to vaccinate newborn babies against
hepatitis B, saying this is the most efficient and economical
method to curb this contagious disease.
</P>
<P>
They said that if vaccinations are given to all newborns from
now on, the ratio of HBV (hepatitis B virus) carriers in the
Chinese population will drop below one percent in 50 years from
the current 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of an over 90 percent vaccination rate among urban
babies, only some 30 percent in the vast rural areas are
vaccinated against hepatitis B, mainly due to ignorance or lack of
money to pay for vaccinations," an official at the Ministry of
Health said at an event to publicize vaccinations with the theme:
Expand the Hepatitis B Immunization Program (EPI) in China.
</P>
<P>
China has about 120 million HBV carriers, and 12 million suffer
from chronic liver illnesses, 300,000 of whom die each year. Most
cases are the result of hepatitis B and C infection, according to
experts at the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine (CAPM).
</P>
<P>
"About 40 percent of hepatitis B infections are mother-to-
infant cases. But the virus in babies can be stopped if they are
vaccinated 24 hours after birth," said Professor Su Chong'ao of
the CAPM.
</P>
<P>
However, the rate of the vaccination remains around 30 percent
in the country's rural and poor areas where two-thirds of the
nation's population lives.
</P>
<P>
"Many parents in these areas are unaware of the importance of
vaccination, or they just can't afford it," the MOH official said.
</P>
<P>
The government decided to include hepatitis B vaccination in
the national EPI program in 1992, but provided few funds for
nationwide free services such as vaccination against polio.
</P>
<P>
Health economists have warned that the country could suffer 30
to 50 billion yuan (or about 3.6 to 6 billion U.S. dollars) in
extra medical expenditures annually due to the spread of hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
Several charity campaigns have been launched across the country
to raise funds and vaccine donations. The Chinese Foundation for
Hepatitis Prevention and Control, for example, has received 3.5
million yuan and 710,000 units of hepatitis A and B vaccine since
it was set up earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine has been sent to areas hit by last summer's floods
and poverty-stricken regions including the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region and Gansu Province, according to the foundation.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Economy to Grow 3.6 Pct This Year: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's economy is projected
to grow by about 3.6 percent in the current fiscal year ending
June 30, 1999, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The growth performance in recent years has been encouraging"
in Bangladesh, which "has been finally able to break the 4 percent
per annum growth barrier that existed in the 1970s and 80s,"
Phiphit Suphaphiphat, resident representative of the ADB, told
reporters while releasing the "Asian Development Outlook 1998."
</P>
<P>
The growth this year, however, was lower than last year's 5.7
percent, due to the impact of the devastating flood of 1998, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The outlook forecasts a 5.5 percent growth for the South Asian
nation in the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
It expresses concern at the high fiscal deficit, deterioration
in the financial position of state-owned enterprises, the recent
stagnation in the government's revenue collection, inflationary
pressures in the economy, and the low and declining levels of
foreign exchange reserves in the country.
</P>
<P>
The outlook is also concerned with the slow-down in the pace of
reforms in 1998, and hopes the Bangladeshi government would
"accelerate the pace of economic reforms to pave the way for
sustained and rapid economic development."
</P>
<P>
Suphaphiphat confirmed at the press conference that the
country's donors did not make any aid pledge at the Bangladesh
Development Forum held in Paris on Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The forum, previously known as the Paris Aid Consortium
meeting, had changed its format from a "aid-pledging session" to a
forum for discussing policy issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the donors would continue to provide assistance
to Bangladesh if the government kept its commitments to speeding
up reforms.

BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China filed to host the World
Women Champion Tournament at the last moment of the deadline,
rescuing the International Chess Federation (FIDE) from losing the
last edition of the 16-game top-levelled tournament, China Chess
Association announced here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
China raises Shenyang, the biggest city of the Northeast of
China, to be the site for the 100,000-U.S.-dollar FIDE final
series, which is scheduled on June 26-July 20.
</P>
<P>
Former world champion Chinese Xie Jun will challenge current
world champion Austria's Zsuzsa Polgar, the eldest one of the
famed "Sisters Polgar".
</P>
<P>
The FIDE had planned to find a third country outside of Austria
and China to stage the tournament, but failed to receive any
bidding offer after it sent the invitation last October, when Xie
won the right to play Polgar.
</P>
<P>
A second-round bidding searching started on February 16,
expired on April 15, but no entry filed. The FIDE extended the
deadline date to April 25.
</P>
<P>
This tournament would be canceled and played under new rules if
the FIDE could not find host country before the deadline.

BELGRADE, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Powerful bombings hit four
Serbian towns of Belgrade, Avala, Lucani and Nis on Sunday as NATO
air strikes against Yugoslavia entered the 33rd day.

Yugoslavia's official Tanjug news agency reported that NATO
bombings at 02:50 local time early Sunday destroyed a transformer

Four missiles hit the northeastern industrial area of Nis, 200

bridges across the Sava and Danube rivers, chanting songs in
protest against NATO's raids on Yugoslavia.

the central square in the Yugoslav capital at midday Saturday to

<HEADLINE> Death Toll of Ugandan Capital Bomb Blast Rises to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of the bomb blast,
which took place in downtown Kampala Saturday evening, has reached
four as an old lady of 65 died in hospital Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Kyomukama James, a police officer of Uganda's Criminal
Investigations Department (CID), told Xinhua in Mulago hospital
here Sunday morning that the newly dead is Woman Special Constable
Hajati Masitula.
</P>
<P>
Conditions of the remaining 13 people injured in the explosion
are stable and improving, he said.
</P>
<P>
The blast, which happened behind the Nakivubo Stadium at around
8:00 p.m. (local time), occurred minutes after a policeman was
shot dead in the same area.
</P>
<P>
Many people rushed to see what had happened to the policeman
when the terrorist threw the bomb into the crowd, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kyomukama said there has been no arrest so far and that it is
still too early for him to comment on the motive of the incident.
</P>
<P>
Ogwal Charles, a police officer attached to Old Kampala police
station who sustained knee and hand injuries in the blast, told
Xinhua in the hospital that the street is one of the busiest in
the capital city and that a local football match was going on in
the stadium before the blast.
</P>
<P>
When asked if more policemen will be deployed in the area
following two bomb blasts in the area two weeks ago, he said that
there is no reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
Terrorism-related bombing is a new phenomenon in Uganda and so
far more than 50 people have been killed during blasts of this
nature since 1997.

The area has been cordoned off to the public, with the street
still covered in glass and debris. Anti-terrorist officers were

<HEADLINE> Appeal of Former PM's Assassin's Friend Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Tel Aviv District Court
rejected on Sunday Margalit Har-Shefi's appeal that she was not
responsible for the assassination of former Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Three judges of the court passed their ruling with two to one,
maintaining that Har-Shefi was involved in the assassination by
failing to take reasonable steps to prevent the murder.
</P>
<P>
Her friend, Yigal Amir, killed Rabin with a hand gun on
November 4, 1995. He was sentenced to life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The ruling said that Har-Shefi, a law student of Bar-Illan
University from the West Bank settlement of Beit El, has to serve
nine months in prison passed on her by the Tel Aviv Magistrate
Court last September.
</P>
<P>
She told the police after Rabin's assassination that Amir had
told her about the assassination plan, but she did not inform the
police of that.
</P>
<P>
The Tel Aviv Magistrate Court ruled last June that Har-Shefi
was partially responsible for the murder because if she had tipped
off to the police, the assassination could have been avoided.
</P>
<P>
The Magistrate Court sentenced her to nine months in prison
last September and a 15-month suspended sentence.
</P>
<P>
Her-Shefi filed her appeal to the Tel Aviv District Court,
hoping to overturn the Magistrate Court's verdict.
</P>
<P>
Amir, a right wing activist, is now serving his prison terms at
Beer Sheba Jail in south Israel.

cultivation in the border areas and combating trafficking of
chemicals and materials for the production of narcotic drugs.

enforcement agencies for exchange of information on drug control
measures and enacting laws and rules on drug abuse control in the

<HEADLINE> Iraq: International Support for Lifting Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Iraq's National
Assembly (parliament) Saadoun Hammadi said on Sunday that
international support for Iraq's demand for lifting U.N. sanctions
is mounting up.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Iraqi News Agency, Hammadi, who had led
an Iraqi delegation to the International Parliamentary Federation
Conference which concluded lately in Brussels, said participates
of the conference called for lifting the sanctions and denounced
the on-going U.S-British air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed sweeping economic sanctions on Iraq
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait which touched off the 1991
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi said the Iraqi delegation had meetings with a number of
foreign parliamentary delegations on the sidelines of the
conference and discussed the current situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain launched four nights of
airstrikes against Iraq last December to retaliate what they
called Iraq's failure to fully cooperate with U.N. weapons
inspectors in charge of eliminating Iraq's banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
After the bombardment, Iraq declared it does not recognize the
two no-fly zones imposed by the U.S. and Britain after the Gulf
War, and vowed to fire at any allied warplanes violating its
airspace.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. and Britain said they were determined to
enforce the restricted zones, set up allegely to protect the Kurds
in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south of Iraq from
"Baghdad's repression."
</P>
<P>
The allied warplanes have been regularly attacking Iraqi
targets in the no-fly zones.

<HEADLINE> Institute: S.Korea GNP to Grow 4.3 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will see a 4.3 percent
economic growth for this year despite dim prospects for exports,
investments and balance of payments, the Korea Development
Institute) said.
</P>
<P>
The institute's 1999 economic forecast almost doubled the 2.2
percent growth rate predicted at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the adjusted prediction, the country's economic growth
will register a 2.9 percent rise in the first quarter, 4.8 percent
in the second, and 4.7 percent in the third and the fourth
quarters.
</P>
<P>
However, the surplus in balance of payments is likely to stand
at 21.3 billion U.S. dollars instead of 23.6 billion dollars as
initially projected, said the institute.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending will jump 4.1 percent based on more income,
rise in the value of personal assets and of the South Korean won.
</P>
<P>
Investments will post an average 2.2 percent increase, 9.6
percent hike for facility investments but minus 1 percent for
construction, the institute said.
</P>
<P>
Exports will grow 2.4 percent while imports will increase 20.5
percent and inflation will hover at 2 percent, added the report.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hostages Released, But Disputes Remain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippines' New People's Army
(NPA) released Sunday its last government captive for the
resumption of the peace talks between the NPA and the government,
but some disputes concerning the peace talks have to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Saturday, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said
that his government will immediately resume the peace talks with
National Democratic Front (NDF), the political arm of NPA, once
the latter releases Sgt. Wivino Demol whom it abducted on February
9, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The formal peace talks between the government and the NPA
suspended on Feb. 22 following the abduction by the NPA of Brig.
Gen. Victor Obillo and Capt. Eduardo Montealto on Feb.17.
</P>
<P>
Later the NPA also abducted police Chief Inspector Roberto
Bernal and Sgt. Alipio Lozada, on Feb. 22 and March 5
respectively.
</P>
<P>
An independent third-party group led by Davao Archbishop
Fernando Capalla negotiated for the release of the five government
hostages in the Netherlands on March 16 and 17. NDF leaders
finally promised to release the hostages on the condition that
government troops suspend offensive military operations in the
concerned area to facilitate the release.
</P>
<P>
NPA released Obillo and three other captives from April 9 to
16, but failed to release Demol by the deadline of April 19,
quoting the offensive operations launched by the government troops
as the reason.
</P>
<P>
Both the Philippine government and NPA have expressed their
hope to resume peace talks as soon as possible, but some disputes
about the peace talks have not been resolved.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada has stressed once and again that the formal
peace talks only take place in the Philippines, but NDF repeatedly
calls on the government to hold the peace talks in the
Netherlands, the present home base of self-exiled NDF founding
chairman Jose Ma. Sison.
</P>
<P>
"Why settle the problem in another country? If they want to
have peace, they should work for it here in the Philippines. I
will not allow any government official to conduct peace talks
with them abroad," Estrada once said.
</P>
<P>
The president also questioned the qualification of Luis
Jalandoni, chairman of the NDF peace panel to speak on behalf of
the NDF, saying Jalandoni is no longer a Filipino after he changed
his citizenship to Dutch.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Estrada set the end of this year as the deadline
for the government and the NDF panels to forge a formal peace
agreement, but Jalandoni said that "setting a deadline for the
satisfactory conclusion of the peace talks would not by fruitful."
</P>
<P>
Estrada stressed that the government is ready to resume
fighting with the NDF if the peace talks fail because of NDF's
insistence on a status of belligerency. In fact, the president
ordered the resumption of offensives against NPA on April 19, two
days after the release of Brig. Gen. Obillo.
</P>
<P>
"We will show them that there is only one Constitution, one
government. We will not recognize any other government in the
Philippines," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said the rebels should end their decades-old
insurgency and join his administration instead in helping uplift
the lives of the masses, which is "what they have been fighting
for."
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps, there is no more reason for them to fight the
government because all our projects are aimed at uplifting the
lives of the poor," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the New People's Army and the government soldiers
clashed many times across the country in these days, thus casting
a shadow over the peace process.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Allows Illegal Foreigners to Leave Without Paying Fines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will allow illegal
foreign workers to leave in May without paying fines, the Justice
Ministry said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After May, the law enforcement authorities will take measures
to punish illegal foreign workers and their South Korean employees,
a ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
More than 111,000 foreign laborers are illegally working in
South Korea and many of them cannot return to their countries
because of the millions of South Korean won in fines to the South
Korean Immigration Office.
</P>
<P>
The fines, which were originally intended to prevent foreigners
from overstaying their visas, are also preventing some illegal
foreign workers from returning home, said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Ration Card System Successful: Iraqi Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The ration card system adopted by
Iraq following the imposition of U.N. sanctions in distributing
foodstuff to all citizens has proved successful in organizing
family consumption, a Trade Ministry report said.
</P>
<P>
The report, carried by the Iraqi News Agency on Sunday, said
the ministry began applying such a system to "distribute basic
foodstuff on equal basis to all people in Iraq" on September 1,
1990.
</P>
<P>
However, the foodstuff items listed in the ration card can only
meet the minimum need for people to survive - about half the
virtual need of a human being, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The ration card provides only 2,030 calories and 47 grams of
protein daily, while an individual needs at least 2,206 calories
and 64.2 grams of protein each day.
</P>
<P>
Before the imposition of the United Nations sanctions on August
1990, the report said, the ministry allocated some 2.96 billion
U.S. dollars to import foodstuff every year.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions caused great hardships to the Iraqi people. In
late 1996 an oil-for-food deal was reached between Iraq and the
U.N., which allowed Baghdad to export 2 billion dollars worth of
oil every six months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
supplies for its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
The ceiling has been raised to 5.2 billion dollars since the
fourth phase which came into effect in May, 1998. But due to the
sagging oil prices and severe shortage of oil spare parts, Iraq
only exported 3 billion dollars worth of oil in the fourth phase.
</P>
<P>
The report blamed the the U.N. Security Council for failing to
fulfill its obligations to secure smooth arrival of foodstuff
purchased by Iraq, 850 days after the oil-for-food plan was
implemented.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq holds the United States and Britain responsible for
impeding the arrival of foodstuff and other materials to Iraq by
premeditatedly suspending the contracts," the report said.

<HEADLINE> 9 Tamil Rebels killed in Northern Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
Saturday killed nine Tamil rebels in separate clashes with the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the north of the
country, a military spokesman announced here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Rp Witana said the troops engaged a group of LTTE
rebels with small arms on Sunday afternoon and killed five rebels
and injured four others in the north of Oddusudan in the Northern
Province.
</P>
<P>
Around 10:50 a.m. Sunday in west of Paranthan, government
troops observed a group of LTTE female cadres moving towards
Paranthan and engaged them with machine guns and small arms,
killing at least three of them, he said.
</P>
<P>
Witana added that government troops operating ahead of defenses
sniped and killed one LTTE terrorist at Paranthan on Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been waging a war against the government
since 1983 for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the
country.

<HEADLINE> NATO Moves 23 Tanks to Northern Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) has moved 23 Leopard tanks to the border areas
in northern Macedonia over the past few days, said a report by the
Macedonian news agency MIA, which was monitored here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Seven Leopard tanks, along with 190 other military vehicles,
passed Bogorodica on the border between Macedonia and Greece, in
two convoys, between 05:00 a.m. and 07:00 a.m. local time (0300
GMT and 0500 GMT) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two convoys were part of NATO reinforcements to the 125,000
peacekeeping forces in Macedonia, said the MIA report.
</P>
<P>
NATO was reportedly sending a reinforcement of 2,000 German
troops and 2,000 British troops to Macedonia from Greece.
</P>
<P>
The German convoy was on its way to Krivolak while the other
convoy comprising Dutch soldiers was heading for Petrovec. Both
places are just dozens of kilometers away from the border between
Macedonia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The MIA said that another convoy of Leopard tanks passed the
border check point at Bogorodica later Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The convoy was heading for Strumica, also a Macedonian city
near the Macedonia-Kosovo border.
</P>
<P>
"With the previous four convoys, 312 German and 142 Dutch
soldiers from the NATO forces entered Macedonia this morning," the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
A large number of howitzers and other military equipment also
crossed the Macedonia-Greece border with the tank convoys.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia has been opposed to NATO's plan to launch a possible
ground offensive from its soil.
</P>
<P>
Macedonian leaders have repeatedly said that no NATO ground
attacks on Yugoslavia will be allowed from the territory of
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
In an exchange of letters with NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana on Friday, Macedonian Foreign Minister Aleksandar Dimitrov
reaffirmed that the NATO troops in Macedonia are not offensive.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO, embarrassed with its failure to make
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic bow after a month of massive
air bombardments on Yugoslavia, was reportedly planning for a
ground operation in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Rescind Decision to Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has asked Israel to rescind
its decision to close the Orient House in East Jerusalem, known as
the unofficial headquarters of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, the Jordan Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the Israeli government dated on Saturday,
Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah Khatib voiced his country`s
concern over the Israeli action to close the Orient House, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli move was unjustifiable and would further complicate
the situation in East Jerusalem while encroaching on the
Palestinian rights to self-determination, Khatib said in the
message.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Israeli government to reconsider its decision
to avoid any adverse effects on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday ordered the
closure of the Orient House following a meeting of Palestinian
officials and some Arab diplomats in the house on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu claimed that the meeting violated agreements barring
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) activity in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have denounced the move as a campaign ploy by
Netanyahu, noting that any attempt to close the Orient House,
registered as a private residence, would be illegal.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is currently lagging in opinion polls behind his
main rival for premiership Labor Party chief Ehud Barak for the
upcoming Israeli elections slated for May 17.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians railed against Netanyahu for trying to
fabricate an allegation of Palestinian threat to Israeli
sovereignty over Jerusalem as a central theme for his reelection
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied East Jerusalem in 1967 and later illegally
annexed it as part of its capital, while the Palestinians hope to
make the sector the capital of their own state.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebel Group Frees Last Captive Soldier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The National Democratic Front
(NDF) Sunday released its last hostage, S/Sgt. Wivino Demol, who
had been held captive for 14 months and 15 days, paving the way
for the resumption of peace talks between the NDF and the
government.
</P>
<P>
Demol was released around 12:30 (04:30 GMT) in Longos, Laguna,
the northern Philippines, according to the official Philippine
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Demol was reunited with his wife and children 30 minutes after
he was freed, and Lydia Demol cried when she saw her husband for
the first time in over 14 months, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference following his release, Demol said one
good thing that happened during his captivity was that he was able
to quit smoking and drinking.
</P>
<P>
Demol, who was captured in the town of Rodriguez, Rizal
Province, on February 9, 1998, was the fifth and last captive
freed by the NDF this month.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the NDF freed three army officers and one police
officer they captured in Mindanao and Bicol, the southern
Philippines, in February and March.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group abducted the five in an attempt to exchange
"prisoners of war" with the government. But President Joseph
Estrada rejected the demand and suspended peace talks indefinitely
with the NDF in February.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the government said it would resume peace talks with
the NDF if the rebel group freed all the five hostages safely.
</P>
<P>
Like the other four hostages, Demol will undergo intensive
debriefing by the Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines (ISAFP) in Camp Aguinaldo, Manila, the Philippine News
Agency said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Sets Up Task Force Against Sub-Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has set up
a task force to tackle the problem of sub-standard products since
imitations flood local markets, a senior official has said.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Deputy Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry,
Jazzman Chikwakwa said lately that "as a concerned government, we
can not allow such a state of affairs."
</P>
<P>
The task force was made up of officers from the Zambia Bureau
of Standards, the Zambia Revenue Authority, police, officials from
the ministries of health, local government and housing as well as
the commerce ministry, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the deputy minister toured some markets in capital
Lusaka in his campaign against expired foodstuffs, finding various
expired items on the shelves in dozens of supermarkets and other
retail outlets, the Sunday Times of Zambia reported.
</P>
<P>
In some cases, some supermarket owners simply defaced the
places where the production and expire dates are supposed to be
displayed on the products, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The problem is further exacerbated by the equally growing spate
of imitation products now flooding the market, it said.
</P>
<P>
A whole range of shadow "industries" engaged in this are now in
 operation, churning out various consumer products.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia Bureau of Standards, the government watchdog for
product standards and quality, feels the scourge is likely to grow
in view of the stiff competition entailed by economic
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
A senior standard official, Mataa Mukelabai was quoted as
saying that unable to beat the competition, an increasing number
of entrepreneurs have resorted to producing and selling imitation
products of popular brand names.
</P>
<P>
"Economic liberalization does not mean flouting regulations and
selling sub-standard products. Liberalization means competition
and quality products," the deputy minister stressed, adding that
those who can't produce quality products should not try to hide
behind other manufacturers' brand names.
</P>
<P>
"We'll ensure stern action is taken against all the culprits,"
Chikwakwa said.
</P>
<P>
Practically all manner of consumer products, from fruit juices
to washing detergents, electrical appliances to motor vehicle
spare parts, designer label clothes to designer label cosmetics
and several other items, all occupy space on many a selling shelf.
</P>
<P>
Mukelabai said as long as consumers are willing to buy products
of suspect quality simply because they have lower prices, it would
be difficult to combat the imitation scourge.
</P>
<P>
However, concerned at the growing trend and the serious
implications this has on the health and safety of consumers, the
Zambian government is stepping up its campaign against such
products.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading South African newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The 23-year-old daughter of a South African sheep farmer
this week told how she was thrown into jail by United States
immigration authorities, strip-searched and physically and
verbally abused because she had worked illegally as an au pair
girl.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- The day after stark evidence of South African police
brutality had been beamed into millions of homes across the world,
local experts gathered in Pretoria this week to mull over the
thorny question of when and how much force should be used in
apprehending suspected criminals.
</P>

City Press:

<HEADLINE> Jordan Asks Israel to Reopen Palestinian Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has asked Israel to rescind
its decision to close the Orient House in East Jerusalem, known as
the unofficial headquarters of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, the Jordan Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the Israeli government dated on Saturday,
Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah Khatib voiced his country`s
concern over the Israeli action to close the Orient House, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli move was unjustifiable and would further complicate
the situation in East Jerusalem while encroaching on the
Palestinian rights to self-determination, Khatib said in the
message.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Israeli government to reconsider its decision
to avoid any adverse effects on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday ordered the
closure of the Orient House following a meeting of Palestinian
officials and some Arab diplomats in the house on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu claimed that the meeting violated agreements barring
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) activity in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have denounced the move as a campaign ploy by
Netanyahu, noting that any attempt to close the Orient House,
registered as a private residence, would be illegal.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is currently lagging in opinion polls behind his
main rival for premiership Labor Party chief Ehud Barak for the
upcoming Israeli elections slated for May 17.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians railed against Netanyahu for trying to
fabricate an allegation of Palestinian threat to Israeli
sovereignty over Jerusalem as a central theme for his reelection
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied East Jerusalem in 1967 and later illegally
annexed it as part of its capital, while the Palestinians hope to
make the sector the capital of their own state.

MANILA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The anti-government National
Democratic Front (NDF) freed a government soldier Sunday in the
northern Philippines, paving the way for the resumption of peace
talks between the government and the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
S/Sgt. Wivino Demol, who was abducted by the NDF's armed wing

Demol was captured in Rizal, the northern Philippines, last

</P>
<P>
The NDF had held captive five government troops but four of
them had been released in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Those who were released earlier this month were Brig. Gen.
Victor C. Obillo, Capt. Eduardo Montealto, Sgt. Alipio Lozano and
Police Chief Insp. Roberto Bernal.
</P>
<P>
The NDF abducted these army officers in an attempt to exchange
"prisoners of war" with the government. However, President Joseph
Estrada rejected the rebels' demand and indefinitely suspended
peace talks with the group two months ago.
</P>
<P>
Later, the government said it would resume peace talks with the
NDF soon if the rebel group freed all the five hostages safely.

<HEADLINE> Wizards Strickland Arrested for DWI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Washington Wizards guard Rod
Strickland is in trouble again.
</P>
<P>
Strickland was arrested early this morning in the District of
Columbia and charged with driving while intoxicated and reckless
driving. He was released on citation and is scheduled to appear in
court on May 7.
</P>
<P>
According to police spokesman Joseph Gentile, two sergeants in
an unmarked police car spotted a gold Mercedes Benz change lanes
without signaling and then pass three red lights at approximately
3:35 a.m.
</P>
<P>
When Strickland was pulled over, he failed a field sobriety
test and refused to take a blood-alcohol test.
</P>
<P>
The alleged incident occurred hours after the Wizards suffered
an 89-78 home loss to the Atlanta Hawks. Strickland had 10 points
and 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
In April 1998, Strickland was convicted of driving while
impaired. He was ordered to perform community service and placed
on one-year probation, which expired earlier in the month.
</P>
<P>
Wizards general manager Wes Unseld issued the following
statement regarding Strickland's arrest.
</P>
<P>
"The Wizards organization is disappointed this event has
occurred because Rod has been exceptional this year in terms of
the fans and his commitment to the franchise. We hope to garner
more information, but for now the situation is in the hands of the
legal authorities."
</P>
<P>
Strickland, 32, signed a four-year, 40 million U.S. dollars
contract with the Wizards before the start of the lockout-
shortened season. He is averaging 15.5 points and 10.1 assists in
37 games.
</P>
<P>
Although regarded as one of the league's top point guards,
Strickland has often tested management's patience. He often is
late for practices and was involved in a fight with teammate Tracy
Murray last year.
</P>
<P>
Strickland was an All-NBA Second Team selection following the
1997-98 campaign, when he averaged 17.8 points and led the league
with 10.5 assists per game.

<HEADLINE> NATO Leaders Approve New Strategic Concept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Nineteen NATO member nations
on Saturday approved a new strategic concept that breaks the
original "collective defense" doctrine and assumes broader
functions to take actions outside alliance territory.
</P>
<P>
After overcoming Turkish objections, leaders also approved a
statement recognizing the 15-nation European Union's growing role
in security and defense and its right to approve military action
where the alliance as a whole is not engaged.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton gave this new EU function a guarded
welcome, saying: "I think it will strengthen the capability of the
alliance, and I think it will actually help to maintain America's
involvement with NATO."
</P>
<P>
The Washington Summit Communique, issued after the meeting by
the leaders, said that the new concept reaffirms commitment to
collective defense and the trans-Atlantic link.
</P>
<P>
The updated concept also "presents an Alliance ready and with a
full range of capabilities to enhance the security and stability
of the Euro-Atlantic area."
</P>
<P>
The communique said that the alliance will "provide one of the
indispensable foundations for a stable Euro-Atlantic security
environment...in which no country would be able to intimidate or
coerce any other through the threat or use of force."
</P>
<P>
NATO will also "deter and defend against any threat of
aggression against any NATO member states" and "stand ready, case-
by-case and by consensus...to contribute to effective conflict
prevention and to engage actively in crisis management, including
crisis response management."
</P>
<P>
Meeting under the shadow of NATO's airstrikes against
Yugoslavia over Kosovo, the leaders spent most of the second day
of their 50th anniversary summit discussing future missions beyond
NATO borders.
</P>
<P>
There were differences on the interpretation of the new
strategic concept.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac hailed it as a triumph for
France and said it meant "NATO cannot and will not be able to act
without the authorization of this international recognition,"
referring to the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
To allow NATO exceptions from U.N. jurisdiction would set a
dangerous precedent for states or organizations and could
ultimately lead to "the law of the strongest," he said.
</P>
<P>
But NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, asked whether the
alliance would need a Security Council resolution each time it
intervened outside its territory, said bluntly "No."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said he was pleased that the new
strategic concept endorsed specifically the NATO military campaign
against Yugoslavia over the Kosovo crisis, which did not have an
explicit U.N. mandate.
</P>
<P>
However, several European allies argued Kosovo was an exception
out of humanitarian purpose, and in other cases, a U.N. mandate
would be imperative.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said U.N. mandates were the
rule but there could be limited exceptions, although NATO could
not simply give itself a mandate to act "out of area."

BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese customs officials cracked
994 smuggling cases in the first quarter of this year, seizing 1.
46 billion yuan worth of goods.
</P>
<P>
The number of cases has declined by 19 percent while the value
of the goods seized has increased by 36 percent compared with the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of anti-smuggling police squads earlier this
year has helped reduce the number of smuggling cases. As a result,
the taxes collected by the customs have soared.

<P>
MANILA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The anti-government National
Democratic Front (NDF) freed a government soldier Sunday in the
northern Philippines, paving the way for the resumption of peace
talks between the government and the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
S/Sgt. Wivino Demol, who was abducted by the NDF's armed wing
-- New People's Army (NPA) -- a year ago, was freed in Sta. Cruz,
Laguna, 30 kilometers south of Manila, around 12:30 (04:30)
Sunday, according to a CNN television report.
</P>
<P>
Demol was captured in Rizal, the northern Philippines, last
year while disguising as a rice trader.
</P>
<P>
The NDF had held captive five government troops but four of
them had been released in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Those who were released earlier this month were Brig. Gen.
Victor C. Obillo, Capt. Eduardo Montealto, Sgt. Alipio Lozano and
Police Chief Insp. Roberto Bernal.
</P>
<P>
The NDF abducted these army officers in an attempt to exchange
"prisoners of war" with the government. However, President Joseph
Estrada rejected the rebels' demand and indefinitely suspended
peace talks with the group two months ago.
</P>
<P>
Later, the government said it would resume peace talks with the
NDF soon if the rebel group freed all the five hostages safely.

<HEADLINE> NATO Rejects Ukraine's Peace Proposal on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- NATO brushed off a proposal on
Saturday by Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma on peaceful
settlement of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome very much the tireless diplomatic efforts of the
Ukrainian government and of President Kuchma himself to resolve
the crisis," NATO Secretary General Javier Solana told a joint
news conference with Kuchma after he met NATO's 19 leaders.
</P>
<P>
But Solana indicated the proposal was short of the alliance's
five-point set of demands for the suspension of NATO's airstrikes.
He stressed Belgrade must assent to NATO's presence in Kosovo to
enforce a Western-imposed peace deal.
</P>
<P>
A declaration was issued after Kuchma met with NATO's 19
leaders. The declaration papered over the Kosovo issue by saying
both sides supported a peaceful multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The declaration did not mention Kuchma's peace proposal, which
envisages a simultaneous halt to NATO bombardment and deployment
of peacekeepers from neutral nations.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma also proposed a simultaneous ceasefire by Yugoslav
forces in Kosovo, and by ethnic Albanian guerrillas and by NATO
units bombing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis can be settled only by the concerted efforts of all
the parties involved," Kuchma told the joint news conference.
Ukraine's efforts were not a "solo performance" but a part of
wider international efforts to solve the conflict, he explained.
</P>
<P>
"These (Kosovo) events are taking place not far from our home.
We know what war is like and that is why we are so active in
seeking a peaceful settlement," he said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Union Leader Blasts Tokyo Governor (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washio Etsuya, president of the Japanese Trade Union
Confederation (GENGO), one of the most influential trade unions in
Japan, told Xinhua in an interview before concluding his China
visit that what Ishihara Shintaro has talked about on the issues
of Tibet and Taiwan recently are nonsense.
</P>
<P>
He said Shintaro's speeches, attempting to destroy Sino-
Japanese relations, have immediately aroused strong resentment
from people who love peace and try to maintain Japan-China
friendship in Japan and other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
A well-known unionist and politician in Japan, Etsuya noted
that Shintaro, out of political consideration, didn't make much
anti-China's speeches before his election because he knew that
Tokyo citizens would not support a governor who stands against
Japan-China friendship.
</P>
<P>
"He has cheated the Japanese people, and hurt the feelings of
the Chinese people as well," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president of GENGO since 1997 stressed that election in
itself is accidental to some extend. Ishihara Shintaro was opposed
at the begining of the election, for he had published anti-China
rethrics before.
</P>
<P>
He noticed that the magazine that published Shintaro's remarks
is known to few in Japan and is rarely read by Japanese readers.
</P>
<P>
But, the Japanese right-wing activists took use of his words to
make influence, which was detrimental to the will of the Japanese
people.

hoped for increased exchanges and cooperation between his
organization and Chinese trade unions.

<HEADLINE> Pension of Rural Workers to be Worked Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Labor and Social
Security is to unveil a prototype pension system at the turn of
the year for township enterprise workers who are not covered by
the present social security system.
</P>
<P>
The method will be based on experience from eight trial
projects to be started from May this year, "China Daily" quoted
Zhang Shouqi, vice-director of the ministry's rural social
insurance department, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises account for one-third of China's national
economy, and are sure to develop further with the transfer of more
rural labor and the establishment of more small towns, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The number of rural township workers surpassed that of urban
workers to reach 130 million in 1998. However, this large group is
not covered by the temporary social insurance system, which
concentrates on workers with urban residence registration.
</P>
<P>
"How to provide financial support for these farmer employees
after they retire is an unavoidable question, and is crucial to
completing China's social security system," he said.
</P>
<P>
A tentative plan will be drafted in November after summarizing
the experience of the eight projects. It will be discussed in
December.
</P>
<P>
The future rural worker pension system will not take the form
of the existing urban system, which relies on both personally
accumulated funds and a mutual account made up of funds from
individuals, enterprises, and the state.
</P>
<P>
It will rely only on a fund to which individuals contribute
from their salaries. The state will regulate the system to ensure
its smooth operation. The sum of deposit, which is collected
before tax, will not be fixed, but be in proportion with the
worker's salary.
</P>
<P>
The system should complement the urban system to establish a
unified, open, and orderly labor market in the future, Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (51) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 51 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Which organization shall be responsible for assessing
professional qualifications and issuing certificates for
practicing various professions in the Macao Special Administrative
Region?
</P>
<P>
Like in all countries and regions in the world, only those who
in Macao are professionally qualified and have acquired the
corresponding qualifications can practice in such professions as
law and medicine or as doctors, accountants and architects.
</P>
<P>
Owing to historical reasons, Macao does not have many
professionals among its local residents. Most of its
professionals are either Macao residents who have studied abroad
or people who have come from the mainland, Hong Kong or from
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
There are a few professional organizations in Macao such as
the Association of Auditors, the Association of Accountants, the
Association of Architects, the Society of Traditional Chinese
Medicine, Chinese Society of Medicine and the Association of
Engineers.
</P>
<P>
However, they are small in number, and there is no widely
representative and authoritative professional organization in
Macao. Because of this, it has been the responsibility of the
Macao Government to assess and award professional qualifications.
</P>
<P>
In view of this, Article 129 of the Basic Law stipulates that
the Government of the Macao Special Administrative Region shall,
on its own, establish a system concerning the professions and,
based on impartiality and rationality, formulate provisions for
assessing professional qualifications or qualifications for
practice in the various professions and issuing corresponding
certificates.
</P>
<P>
It is clear from this provision that the formulation of the
provisions for assessing professional qualifications and the
issuance of certificates for practice shall be conducted by the
Government on a fair and reasonable basis, and no professional
organizations shall be empowered to do so.
</P>
<P>
Will those who have already acquired professional
qualifications or qualifications for professional practice need to
re-register with the authorities for reassessing their
qualifications after the return of Macao?
</P>
<P>
Article 129 of the Basic Law clearly stipulates that persons
with professional qualifications or qualifications for
professional practice obtained prior to the establishment of the
Macao Special Administrative Region may retain their previous
qualifications in accordance with the relevant regulations of the
Macao Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
In other words, those who have previously obtained their
professional qualifications or qualifications for professional
practice need not re-register their qualifications through re-
examination and re-assessment.
</P>
<P>
The Government of the Macao Special Administrative Region
shall recognize their previous qualifications, so long as they are
consistent with the relevant laws and provisions concerning the
system on professionals of the Macao Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
For instance, accountants may continue to operate in the
accounting profession. It is also provided in this Article that
the Government of the Macao Special Administrative Region shall,
in accordance with the relevant regulations, recognize the
professions and the professional organizations that are recognized
prior to the establishment of the Region.
</P>
<P>
The Government of the Macao Special Administrative Region may,
as required by social development and in consultation with the
parties concerned, recognize new professions and professional
organizations.
</P>
<P>
These provisions of the Basic Law will not only ensure the
continuity of the existing system concerning professions in Macao,
but also help gradually develop and improve such a system of the
Macao Special Administrative Region.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (52) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 52 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
What will happen to offices set up by Taiwan in Macao after
the return of Macao?
</P>
<P>
Both Taiwan and Macao are inalienable parts of the territory
of the People's Republic of China. At present, Taiwan and Macao
maintain contacts and exchanges in the economic, trade, tourism
and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Especially with the opening of direct air links between Taiwan
and Macao after the completion of the international airport in
Macao, they will enjoy closer and more frequent exchanges and ties
in these fields. According to the one China principle, Taiwan is
not allowed to set up any official missions or offices in Macao.
But it may set up economic and trade offices there.
</P>
<P>
After China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Macao,
Taiwan's economic and trade offices in Macao and their staff can
in principle stay on and the two regions can continue to maintain
and develop contacts in the economic, trade, tourism and other
fields.
</P>
<P>
However,Taiwan should not set up any official missions in the
Macao Special Administrative Region. Taiwan's offices in Macao
and their staff should strictly abide by the one China principle,
the Basic Law and other laws of the Macao Special Administrative
Region.
</P>
<P>
They should not engage themselves in activities aimed at
creating two Chinas or "one China, one Taiwan", or do anything
harmful to the development of the relations across the Taiwan
Straits.

<HEADLINE> China Aims to Increase Exports of Electrical Appliances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China will try to increase its
exports of electrical appliances by 10 percent this year to 3.9
billion US dollars, Business Weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
The growth target is propelled by a weak growth on the domestic
market. Many manufacturers have turned to international
specialized exhibitions, employed qualified sales agencies,
established international sales networks, found distribution
centers and set up factories in foreign countries, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Many enterprises will also increase investment to speed up the
pace of technical renovations and new product development in a bid
to win market shares internationally.
</P>
<P>
Exports of air conditioners and microwave ovens with high
technical contents had the largest growth rate last year, up by 53
and 61 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Appliances producers are targeting new markets including Europe,
the Middle East, South America and Africa, says the report.
</P>
<P>
China's domestic market of appliances have witnessed cutthroat
competitions over the past few years. A new wave of price-cutting
campaign has been launched lately among leading manufacturers of
color TV sets.
</P>
<P>
Figures provided by the General Administration of Customs show
that China's exports of electrical appliances grew 9.3 percent in
1998 compared with a year ago, hitting 3.51 billion US dollars.

ROME, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Over 150,000 Italians Saturday
staged a demonstration in Rome protesting against NATO bombing
against Yugoslavia and calling for restoration of peace to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The widow of assassinated Israeli former Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, the Nobel peace prize winner and former Israeli Premier
Shimon Peres took part in the demonstration, organized by Italy's
largest ruling party of the Left Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had also been
expected to show up but in the end sent a representative to back

kicked off the proceedings in Rome's central Piazza del Popolo.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema stressed that Italy was doing everything possible to
find a political solution to the conflict in the Balkans, saying
that "Italy will be a main player in the creation of peace."
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret at being unable to attend the march but
said "we are busy working for the rapid restoration of peace."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chia's Fishing Ban Unlikely to Cause Market Fluctuations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The fishing ban in the South
China Sea in June and July will not cause a big fluctuation on the
domestic and international aquatic products markets, China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ban, to be imposed by the Ministry of Agriculture for the
first time in the South China Sea north of 12 degrees north
latitude, is aimed at protecting marine resources and guaranteeing
sustainable development in the fisheries industry, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Yang Jian, director of the Ministry's fisheries
bureau, as saying that the ban would not influence prices on the
domestic market nor reduce exports in the long run.
</P>
<P>
The aquatic products market in China was basically in an
oversupply condition, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
The average price of aquatic products decreased during the
first quarter of this year, according to industry statistics.
</P>
<P>
Also the ban only forbids fishing methods that kill large
amounts of small fry, while other methods can be continued to
catch high-grade large fish, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Fish breeding has developed rapidly in China and this will help
make up for any scarcity caused by the fishing ban, it said,
adding that Chinese fishing vessels may join other countries to
fish their waters and transport the catch to China.
</P>
<P>
Yang admitted, however, that shortage may occur in the supply
of some varieties in some areas.
</P>
<P>
But the smooth circulation channels in the market will
facilitate the transfer of such products to those areas in need,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
In short, the overall aquatic market nationwide is going to
remain stable, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the fishing ban will not pose a threat to China's
aquatic products exports as there remains some stock to supply the
international market, he said.
</P>
<P>
He cited past experience as saying that a fishing ban can
ultimately stimulate exports of aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
Last year China imposed a fishing ban for one month in the East
China Sea but exports of aquatic products went up 8.9 percent to
one million tons, China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
Overfishing in the South China Sea for many years has almost
depleted its fishery resources, resulting in many idle fishing
boats and reductions in fishermen's earnings, it said.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that fisheries industry authorities would take
measures to restrict the output of marine fishing in the near
future to achieve healthy progress in the industry.
</P>
<P>
This year marine fishing output is scheduled to realize zero
growth over last year's 14.96 million tons, which was nearly eight
percent more than the figure for 1997, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
China's total output of aquatic products rose 8.5 percent to 39
million tons last year. Industry officials predicted that the
output for this year will continue to grow, but only at a lower
rate.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Tones Down Italy's Economic Growth in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Italian economy will grow by
only 1.4 percent in 1999, the latest forecasts released by the
World Bank show.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's figures are more pessimistic than those
recently released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
Italian government.
</P>
<P>
The IMF revised its 1999 growth forecast for Italy down from 2.
5 percent to 1.9 percent in December, and then earlier this month
revised it downward again, arriving at 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Treasury Ministry, meanwhile, has also revised its
figures down, moving from the initial growth forecasts of 1.9
percent-2.5 percent to 1.5 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank was more optimistic about the prospects of
Italy's economic growth in 2000, forecasting a jump in gross
domestic product to 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Regarding inflation, the World Bank forecast an inflation rate
of 1.5 percent for Italy in 1999, rising to 1.8 percent in 2000,
compared to IMF's 1.3 percent for 1999 and 1.5 percent for 2000.
</P>
<P>
Economic observers here said that the recession of Italy's
economy has been caused by NATO's attacks against Yugoslavia and
insufficient stimulating policies on national economy.

<HEADLINE> Asian Crisis Dominates ADB Activity in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
said that it devoted much of its energy to easing Asia's
unprecedented crisis throughout 1998 by promoting growth, reducing
poverty and supporting human development in the region.
</P>
<P>
In its Annual Report 1998 released here Monday, the
Manila-based bank said that 1998 was "a difficult and damaging
year for Asia's economies" and economic growth in the region was
sharply curtailed.
</P>
<P>
"Throughout 1998, the bank devoted much of its energy to
responding to Asia's unhappy and unprecedented circumstances," it
said.
</P>
<P>
During the year, the bank said, it continued to emphasize its
five strategic objectives -- promoting economic growth, reducing
poverty, supporting human development, improving the status of
women and protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
The bank's total lending in 1998 amounted to about 6 billion
U.S. dollars for 57 projects, compared with 9.4 billion dollars in
the previous year when lending had been boosted by an exceptional
large financial sector program loan of 4 billion dollars to South
Korea, the ADB said.
</P>
<P>
"The financial sector again received the largest share of
lending (nearly 1.7 billion dollars). Borrowings amounted to 9.6
billion dollars, the largest ever in one year," it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said its cofinancing mobilized from all sources
amounted to about 3 billion dollars for 24 projects, including 950
million dollars for Thailand's export financing facility, close to
50 percent of the bank's total lending.
</P>
<P>
"This level of cofinancing, a 67 percent increase over that in
1997, was significant given the difficult market conditions," it
added.
</P>
<P>
The bank also said cumulative ADB lending, since the bank began
operation in 1966 up to the end of 1998, amounts to 77.3 billion
dollars for 1,500 projects in 37 developing members.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1966, the ADB engages in a wide range of social
and economic development activities aimed at improving the welfare
of the people in the region.
</P>
<P>
The bank's stock is owned by its 57 members, 41 of which are
from the Asian and Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> ADB Urges Members to Adopt Good Governance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
Monday urged its members to adopt good governance and
anti-corruption practices to promote economic development in the
Asian and Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
In its Annual Report 1998 released here, the bank said issues
of governance are at the center of many of the most pressing
challenges confronting countries throughout the Asian and Pacific
region today.
</P>
<P>
The bank defined governance as "the manner in which power is
exercised in the management of a country's social and economic
resources for development."
</P>
<P>
The bank said that in East and Southeast Asia, the need for
greater transparency and accountability in regulating the
financial sector has been one of the key problems behind the
currency turmoil, corporate bankruptcies and falling stock markets
that have plagued the region since July 1997.
</P>
<P>
In South Asia, the ADB said, issues of restricting the reach of
state intervention and improving the delivery of basic services,
such as health care and education, are high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Economies in transition in Central and Southeast Asia are
grappling with re-defining the role of state, shifting the balance
between central and local power and providing civil service
employees with appropriate skills for managing a market economy,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said each nation's path to good governance is
different, but governments face similar responsibilities in that
they need to establish a basic policy framework, provide critical
goods and services, protect and administer the rule of law and
advance social equity.
</P>
<P>
In executing these responsibilities, governments need to
perform a variety of similar tasks, such as organizing themselves
to formulate and coordinate specific policies and mobilizing human
and financial resources to implement their policies, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank's approach to helping its developing members improve
governance practices has sought to overcome problems of diversity,
the bank added.
</P>
<P>
In view of the corrosive effect of corruption on developing
countries, the bank also encouraged its members to adopt
anti-corruption measures.
</P>
<P>
Corruption exacts a heavy price from developing economies in
terms of reducing investment, increasing capital costs while
lowering asset life and hindering the development of a robust and
competitive private sector, it said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB annual report also reviewed the bank's operations
totaling 6.2 billion U.S. dollars in loans, equity investments and
technical assistance to its 57 members in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Two NATO Planes Violate Bulgarian Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SOFIA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Two NATO planes violated Bulgarian
airspace Friday night, the Government Information Service told the
Bulgarian Telegraph Agency.
</P>
<P>
It was probably the result of a temporary deviation from the
set course by the pilots of the two planes, according to a press
release.
</P>
<P>
The planes were 30 kilometers deep into Bulgarian airspace and
were monitored by the Bulgarian Air Defense from 1:30 a.m. to 01:
35 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
The planes were not more than 500 meters above the town of
Trun, west Bulgaria, when they entered Bulgarian sky. Having found
their mistakes, the two pilots made the planes climbing steeply.
Many residents of the town were awaken by the loud noise of the
engines, the press release says.
</P>
<P>
The planes left Bulgarian airspace in 4-5 minutes, heading for
the southwestern part of the border with Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The Air Defense Command of the Bulgarian Army has notified
NATO of the violation.

<HEADLINE> China to Revamp Water Pricing System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new pricing system is to encourage investors to run water
facilities efficiently, the newspaper's Business Weekly quoted an
official of the Ministry of Water Resources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The price of water for farm use will be at least tripled to
cover production costs, ensure proper water management, and raise
the potential for profits, the newspaper said, adding that some
400 billion cubic meters of water, or 70 percent of total water
supply, are used for farming each year.
</P>
<P>
Government administrations were exclusively responsible for
water distribution in China for decades while market forces were
shut out and private capital banned until a few years ago, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The price of water for urban residents and industrial and
commercial uses will also be raised, it said.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified official said there was room for higher prices
in the cities as water pay accounts for only two percent of the
cost of industrial production and urban household expenditure.
</P>
<P>
A market driven water distribution system is likely to be
established in urban areas next year in line with the country's
water industry policy, the official said.
</P>
<P>
However, the pricing reform may not be completed in rural areas
on schedule as the issue of property rights regarding water
facilities is complicated and surveillance is difficult, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Water prices in China have been kept artificially low for
decades by a rigid planning system, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Per capita water resources in China are only one-fourth of the
world average and the government is being urged to take action on
the country's deterioration water situation before it is too late,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the new pricing system is expected to help
foster a market that will appeal to investors, the ministry
official said, adding that the reform-oriented water industry
policy encourages diverse investment sourcing.
</P>
<P>
A revolution is already taking place as private capital,
including foreign direct investment, has flowed into small water
conservancy and tap water projects.
</P>
<P>
In Zhejiang Province, private water projects have already proved
themselves to be efficient.
</P>
<P>
The official, however, said that the government would remain
the owner and only investor in most medium-sized and all large
water projects for some time.
</P>
<P>
Many major water facilities also have flood-control and drought-
prevention functions, rather than being first-and-foremost profit-
making concerns.
</P>
<P>
The risks would be high for independent companies, and the
government cannot shoulder the risks for them, the ministry
official said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Customers Show Preference for Home Furniture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Attracted by potentially huge
profits, enterprises from Italy, Malaysia and the United states
are all investing in the Chinese furniture market. However, they
are not achieving very good results from residential furniture, "
China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign furniture is much more expensive because the
production cost is high," said Kang Xiaowei, marketing executive
of the Italian Vita furniture firm in China.
</P>
<P>
He said foreign enterprises spend much more on designs and
quality material, and aftersale services.
</P>
<P>
However, when it comes to buying furniture, Chinese consumer
habits are different, Kang said.
</P>
<P>
He said Chinese people are very brand-conscious when buying
clothes, food and cars. However, they do not care so much about
brand names when buying furniture.
</P>
<P>
"Most Chinese could name famous foreign brands of food, clothes,
cars and shampoos, but not of furniture," Kang said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, foreign furniture enterprises are not known
to many Chinese because they seldom spend money on TV commercials
and newspaper advertisements.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign enterprises were making good profits from
selling office furniture, mostly to mushrooming foreign
enterprises.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Arsenal Takes Top Place in Premier League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League title
holders Arsenal, with a 6-1 away victory over Middlesbrough on
Saturday, took over top spot from Manchester United for the first
time this season.
</P>
<P>
United, who reached the European Cup final in midweek, have two
games in hand but face a difficult match at fourth-placed Leeds
United on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal took Middlesbrough apart with first-half goals from
Dutch midfielder Marc Overmars, Frenchman Nicolas Anelka and
Nigerian Nwankwo Kanu. Kanu added a superb second after the
interval after Patrick Vieira had scored the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Anelka finished off the rout with his second, a crisp shot from
the edge of the area in the 78th minute before Alun Armstrong
scored a late consolation goal for Middlesbrough, only the 15th
goal Arsenal have conceded in 34 games.
</P>
<P>
The London club are now two points clear of United, who are
also in the F.A. Cup final, on a day which saw former European Cup
winners Nottingham Forest relegated after a 2-0 defeat at Aston
Villa.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy," said Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger after
what he called a high quality performance.
</P>
<P>
"We look to have found a good way of playing. We played at
great pace." Arsenal have four games left.
</P>
<P>
Defender Steve Bould added: "We have put ourselves where we
want to be. We know we have got to win a lot of games, possibly
all of them...Chelsea are still in it. It's still going down to
the wire."
</P>
<P>
Third-placed Chelsea, five points behind the leaders with a
game in hand, are also in action on Sunday away to Sheffield
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Charlton's hopes of premier league survival were hit hard by a
4-1 defeat by Everton who now look safe. In-form striker Kevin
Campbell scored another two crucial goals for the Liverpool side
who have spent more years in the top flight than any other club.
</P>
<P>
"Winning our last three games has lifted a bit of the gloom,"
Everton manager Walter Smith said.
</P>
<P>
The trio above Forest -- Blackburn Rovers, Charlton and
Southampton -- have 32 points. Southampton drew 0-0 at Derby
County while Blackburn were beaten 3-1 at home by Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
Charlton play Blackburn next weekend in a potentially decisive
match.
</P>
<P>
In other matches Leicester City beat Coventry City 1-0,
Wimbledon drew 1-1 against Cup finalists Newcastle 1-1 with
England captain Alan Shearer scoring Newcastle's goal, and
Tottenham Hotspur lost 2-1 at home to West Ham United.

<HEADLINE> Spain Wins 10th Youth Soccer Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The 10th World Youth Soccer
Championship ended Saturday at the National Stadium in Lagos with
girl musician Benita treating the capacity crowd to a farewell
song shortly after Spain spanked Japan 4-0 to lift the trophy.
</P>
<P>
As the spectators swayed to Benita's rendition of "God Bless
You Till We Meet Again", fireworks were set off to bring to a
close three weeks of top-class youth soccer.
</P>
<P>
The 38,000 non-partisan spectators had their fill as the two
teams exhibited what made them qualify for the final.
</P>
<P>
In the end, the Japanese, who had lifted Asian soccer profile
with their performance at the championship, crashed to a
technically-superior Spanish side.
</P>
<P>
Spain opened the floodgate of goals in the fifth minute when
Barkero scored off an indirect freekick within the box.
</P>
<P>
Spain's pablo, who eventually became a joint top scorer with
Malian Mahamadou Dissa, increased the tally in the 14th minute
after a dribble-run in which he waltzed his way past three
defenders.
</P>
<P>
He increased his goal haul to five in the 33rd minute to give
the Europeans a 3-0 lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
Tried as they did in the second half, the Japanese could not
hit the back of the net. The Spaniards began to celebrate when
Gabari increased the tally in the 52nd minute.
</P>
<P>
The win is Spain's first at the category after it was beaten by
Brazil at the 1985 final in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
For the Japanese, it was a first shot at the trophy, and
inexperience played a part in their defeat.

WASHINGTON -- Yugoslavia would not allow any presence of armed
foreign troops on territory to enforce a possible peace agreement
in Kosovo, Belgrade's Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic said in
an interview with the Washington Post published on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Such a peacekeeping force would contradict Yugoslavia's "
sovereignty and territorial integrity," and any ground invasion of
Yugoslavia would widen the conflict "beyond the borders of
Yugoslavia" and pose "dangers to the whole continent," Jovanovic
said.(Yugoslavia-Kosovo)

<HEADLINE> Mali Beats Uruguay to Take WYC Bronze Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Mali, the only African hope at the
10th FIFA World Youth Championship, beat Uruguay to win a third
place, the African team's best ever achievement in WYC history.
</P>
<P>
Mali's superior speed gave them the edge in a fairly uneventful
first half, but goalkeeper Carini should have held Keita Seydou's
free-kick that gave the Africans their half-time lead at the 30th
minute.
</P>
<P>
Both teams were more enterprising after the interval and
created several good chances but failed to take the best ones.
Mali retained their composure on the verge of their greatest
international achievement to date.
</P>
<P>
The Malian boys, termed by some as "outsiders" after their
found their way to the semifinal of the world youth tournament,
remained the only African team at the Nigeria '99, after the
continent's youth champions and runners-up, Ghana's Black
Satellite and hosts Nigeria's Flying Eagles were kicked out of the
match.
</P>
<P>
The Africans had placed high expectations on the tournament,
which is hosted for the first time in history by a Sub-Sahara
country. Ghana and Nigeria have been taken as Africa's hope to win
golden cup for the continent, but both failed.
</P>
<P>
Africa's other teams, host Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon and Zambia
had been very promising in the first round of matches.
</P>
<P>
Mali's dream of a final ticket on the WYC was broken by Spain
at the semi-final, when the later win 3-1 over the African team.

<HEADLINE> Japan Hailed as Heroes While Spain Wins WYC Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Spanish team held up the golden
cup after beating Japan 4-0 at the 10th FIFA World Youth Cup in
Lagos Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish showed their strength before 3,8000 spectators in
Lagos with an excellent start, taking the lead after just five
minutes on a free-kick by Saludes Barkero.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish midfield curtain proved impenetrable for Japan who
has hardly got into their game. The Spanish forwards cruised time
and again through the shaky Japanese defense with Coira Pablo
adding another two goals to his tally.
</P>
<P>
While Japan's astounding run through the competition ended
fruitless, the Spanish dominated also the second half with
Francisco Gabriel scoring another goal at the 51st minute.
</P>
<P>
A 4-0 victory won Spanish FIFA WYC golden cup.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese, who had been hailed as heroes with series of
victories at the Nigeria FIFA tournament, met their Waterloo,
ending fruitless against the Europeans, to echo their coach,
Frenchman Phillippe Troussier's words of satisfaction with a
second place at the world youth competition.
</P>
<P>
At the eve of the final match, Troussier, known in the football
circle as "white witch doctor" said that Japan "has already won by
just getting to the final and knowing that we at least have the
silver."
</P>
<P>
History really repeats.
</P>
<P>
The match between Japan and Spain at the FIFA World Youth
Championship, marked the second encounter between an Asian and a
European team for the title -- surprisingly with the same score.
</P>
<P>
Back in 1981, West Germany beat the surprise team of Qatar 4-0
for the trophy, now Spain, another European power beat Japan, also
4-0.
</P>
<P>
If the silver medal by the small Asian country of Qatar was a
big surprise, the Japanese boys who came to Nigeria as underdogs,
and for a time termed as "outsiders" when they entered the semi-
finals, have silenced the surprise bustles over the Asians' win
after beating U.S., England, Portugal, Mexico and Uruguay,
especially with Japanese boys' 2-1 win over Uruguay to get their
ticket for the final match against Spain.
</P>
<P>
They won instead showers of praise worldwide.
</P>
<P>
A FIFA press release even carried sentences which run as
follows: The continent is noted for its mastery of the martial
arts, But there has been a full blown development of soccer in the
far east generally and in Japan particularly which resulted in the
Japanese gaining their first qualification for the senior World
Cup at France '98.
</P>
<P>
But at the youth level, Japan cannot really raise its head high
amongst the best in the world......All that really has changed.
</P>
<P>
Taking Japanese team's achievement at the youth tournament as a
surprising promotion for world football, FIFA President Blatter,
on seeing Japan, along with teams from Africa, South America and
Europe, enter the semi-final, even said that it is encouraging to
see a balanced development of the sport.
</P>
<P>
Troussier, the Frenchman who is leading the Japanese boys to
such a glory, had predicted well before Japanese team got its
ticket for the final that "we should be in the finals because we
worked very hard to get to this stage of the competition."
</P>
<P>
The Japanese tried to continue their amazing run at the final,
with the loss of their captain Shinji Ono who is serving a one-
match ban following two yellow cards in the previous matches.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese boys, though failed to win the first place in
Nigeria, with a fruitless 90 minutes fight against the Spanish,
has already been taken as a big success in the whole Japan, where
people have been celebrating their boys victory these days.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts have even begun to think that the Japanese boys
excellent performances at the Nigeria '99 have given Asian
football a big push, like what Michael Chang offered Asians in the
tennis world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as the silver medalists' coach, Troussier's
extensive team preparations back home in Japan, in France and in
Africa have also paid off. Lost his job as Nigeria's Super Eagle
at the France '98 World Cup,
</P>
<P>
Troussier was welcomed as a hero in Nigeria when his Japanese
team won one victory after another.

<HEADLINE> Keegan: United Euro Win Boost England </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- England manager Kevin Keegan paid
his own tribute to the Manchester United stars who have helped
English football back onto Europe's center stage.
</P>
<P>
United's breathtaking comeback against Juventus in midweek has
given his England squad an adrenaline shot before this week's much-
maligned friendly international in Hungary. Now Keegan wants Alex
Ferguson's warriors to lift the Champions' Cup in May and send the
country into the summer's vital Euro 2000 double-header on the
crest of a wave.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said Saturday: "Their success gives English football
tremendous credibility. Now they've got to go on and win it and
then people will say English football is right back there at the
top of the tree. We can all gain confidence from them and their
success."
</P>
<P>
United's England stars face another month of high-octane
football after the Premiership has closed and that prompted
Keegan's offer to rest two of Ferguson's stars from the Hungary
fixture.
</P>
<P>
David Beckham and Gary Neville will sit it out and Keegan also
agreed to omit Tony Adams and Ray Parlour from his usual Arsenal
contingent as the Gunners defend their title.
</P>
<P>
United will still be gunning for more glory once the league
season ends. They take on Newcastle in the FA Cup final at Wembley
on Saturday May 22, before jetting out to Barcelona to face Bayern
Munich in the Champions' Cup final the following Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The England players will join Keegan's squad for a week of
preparation before crunch games against Sweden, at Wembley on June
5, and Bulgaria four days later in Sofia.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said: "It will be a great boost for England if United
can beat Bayern.
</P>
<P>
"In my experience as a player, when you're going like that, you
get in the zone and games can't come quickly enough. They didn't
look tired in extra time against Arsenal at Villa Park.
</P>
<P>
"Bill Shankly used to say: 'Don't listen boys' if the press
were told players they must be tired."

career that ended with the Reds' relegation from the Premiership.
Forest's 2-0 defeat at Aston Villa confirmed what had seemed
highly likely for much of the season, even after Atkinson was
called in by the City Ground club following the departure of
previous boss Dave Bassett.
</P>
<P>
"Everything must come to an end eventually and this seems as
good a time as any," said Atkinson, the former Cambridge, West
Brom, Manchester United, Sheffield Wednesday, Aston Villa and
Coventry manager. "I've just turned 60, which is a bit of a
watershed - but age doesn't come into it."

<HEADLINE> Doherty's Fightback in Snooker Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Ken Doherty produced a superb
fightback at the World Snooker Championships in Sheffield, England
on Saturday when he won seven out of eight frames and snatch a 13-
11 win over Nigel Bond in the second round.
</P>
<P>
Bond resumed 10-6 ahead but Doherty won the first three frames
after errors from the Derbyshire professional.
</P>
<P>
In frame 17 Bond missed the blue to let Doherty clear up and
two frames later a missed green let Doherty clear again and then
win on a respotted black.
</P>
<P>
Bond won the next to go 11-9 ahead but Doherty hit back,
leading for the first time at 12-11 before sealing victory and
taking his place in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
"At 10-6 down it looked pretty ominous," said Doherty, "but
winning three of today's first four frames gave me a realistic
chance.
</P>
<P>
"Something wasn't there yesterday but I just found it today and
that was more pleasing than anything.
</P>
<P>
"Without my experience of playing here and of lifting that cup
I wouldn't have won that match. That gives you belief and puts you
on a different level."
</P>
<P>
Defending champion John Higgins took just 10 minutes on
Saturday to wrap up a 13-4 victory over Mark King.
</P>
<P>
Higgins was denied a morning off by King after his 8-0 first
session rout as the Romford professional shared Friday's eight
frames with him.
</P>
<P>
But Higgins wasted little time in Saturday's first frame as
breaks of 80 and 28 completed his win.
</P>
<P>
He now faces a quarter-final clash against fellow Scot Alan
McMannus or Stephen Lee.
</P>
<P>
Matthew Stevens reached his second successive Crucible quarter-
final when he beat Tony Drago 13-8.
</P>
<P>
In doing so, Stevens condemned the 10th seeded Drago to a place
outside the top 16 for the first time in five years.
</P>
<P>
The Maltese Falcon started the day 6-2 adrift but two centuries
in three frames put him back in contention.
</P>
<P>
Drago's downfall came in the 20th frame when a miscued red and
a missed green let Stevens in for a 12-8 lead and the Welshman
finished with a century.

<HEADLINE> Tottenham Former Manager Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League football
club Tottenham Hotspur honored their most successful manager on
Saturday when the road leading up to their White Hart Lane stadium
in north London was named Bill Nicholson Way.
</P>
<P>
Nicholson, 80, became the first manager to win the English
first division and F.A. Cup double in the 20th century and won
England's first European trophy as well as numerous other domestic
cups in a 16-year reign.
</P>
<P>
He joined Spurs from school in 1936. After winning the league
championship with them as a player, he became manager in 1958.
</P>
<P>
His first game was a 10-4 victory over Everton, and he took
Spurs to the double in 1961, and the F.A. Cup and European Cup
Winners' Cup in the following two years.
</P>
<P>
His total haul included one League title, three F.A. Cups,two
League Cups, the European Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Cup in
1972.
</P>
<P>
He retired from management in 1974, but returned to work for
the club as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
He is now the club's president and was made a freeman of the
north London Borough of Haringey last year.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's ceremony before Tottenham's premier league game with
West Ham was attended by a host of his former players including
Pat Jennings, Dave Mackay and Martin Peters.
</P>
<P>
"This is a great honor for me. It's nice to see some familiar
faces, some of the smashing players I worked with, "Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
Nicholson still attends every Spurs home game and was at
Wembley for their League Cup victory over Leicester last month.
</P>
<P>
"It's good to see them winning trophies again, and I am sure
there is more to come under (manager) George Graham," he said. "I
feel the club is making great progress."
</P>
<P>
Former goalkeeper Jennings added: "Bill was one of the all-time
great managers, up there with the likes of (Liverpool's Bill
Shankly and Matt Busby (of Manchester United). He is the last of
that breed.
</P>
<P>
"Bill's record is fantastic and speaks for itself. He brought
the club great success over a long period of time," he said.

The silver went to Malian attacker Mahamadou Dissa while
Cameroonian Gaspard Komol and American Taylor Twellman were
jointly awarded the bronze with four goals each.
</P>

Although Pablo and Dissa scored five goals each in the

Komol and Twellman were rated higher than Bagayoko and Chevanto

<HEADLINE> NATO Leaders Approve New Strategic Concept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Nineteen NATO member nations on
Saturday approved a new strategic concept that finally breaks
original "collective defense" doctrine and assumes broader
functions to take actions outside alliance territory.
</P>
<P>
After overcoming Turkish objections, leaders also approved a
statement recognizing the 15-nation European Union's growing
role in security and defense policy and its right to approve
military action where the alliance as a whole is not engaged.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton gave this new EU function a
guarded welcome, saying: "I think it will strengthen the
capability of the alliance, and I think it will actually help to
maintain America's involvement with NATO."
</P>
<P>
Meeting under the shadow of their war with Yugoslavia over
Kosovo, the leaders spent most of the second day of their 50th
anniversary summit discussing future missions beyond NATO
borders.
</P>
<P>
There were differences on the interpretation of the new
strategic concept.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac hailed it as a triumph for
France and said it meant "NATO cannot and will not be able to act
without the authorization of this international recognization,"
referring to the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
To allow NATO exceptions from U.N. jurisdiction would set a
dangerous precedent for states or organizations and could
ultimately lead to "the law of the strongest," he said.
</P>
<P>
But NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, asked whether the
alliance would need a Security Council resolution each time it
intervened outside its territory, said bluntly "no".
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said he was pleased the new
strategic concept endorsed specifically the NATO military campaign
against Yugoslavia over the Kosovo crisis, which did not have an
explicit U.N. mandate.
</P>
<P>
However, Several European allies argued Kosovo was an
exception out of humanitarian purpose, and in other cases, a
U.N. mandate would be imperative.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said U.N. mandates were
the rule but there could be limited exceptions, although NATO
could not simply give itself a mandate to act "out of area."

BERLIN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Germany and Japan, both fielding

<HEADLINE> Thousands Protest NATO's Bombing in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- "Stop the bombing now!" "Stop
big lies!"
</P>
<P>
Thousands of demonstrators gathered outside the White House on
Saturday to condemn NATO's bombing against Yugoslavia as well as
the U.S. media's biased reports on the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Most of the protesters are Serbian-Americans from all across
the United States and some from Canada. As of nine o'clock in the
morning, crowds of demonstrators began to stream into the Lafayett
Park behind the White House.
</P>
<P>
Just a few blocks away, leaders from the 19 NATO members are
meeting in the Ronald Reagon International Trade Center to map out
the new strategy and plan to intensify its air campaign against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Here in the park, many of the protesters carried the red, white
and blue flag of Serbia, and nearly everybody raised a sign or a
poster against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and
war.
</P>
<P>
One sign paraphrases NATO as "NATO = North Atlantic Terrorist
Organization," another read: "NATO = North American Terrorist
Organization" while a third one read:"NATO = Nazi America
Terrorist Organization."
</P>
<P>
As the police lined up along the Pensylvania avenue, the crowds
shouted at the White House: "Hey, hey, U.S.A., how many kids you
killed today?"
</P>
<P>
Several people held a coffin with signs reading:"NATO VAMPIRE,
1949-1999," and marched around the park. The march draws applause
among the crowds.
</P>
<P>
On poster with the picture of the Yugoslav Radio and Television
building bombed by NATO earlier this week is held by a tall
American senior. On the top of the picture, a line of words
read:"What happened to Freedom of Speech"
</P>
<P>
The demonstrator, who refused to be identified, told Xinhua
that he downloaded the picture from the internet. "Nothing in the
building is military, nor is there any government organs inside.
Why should they bomb it?" he said.
</P>
<P>
The crowds chanted slogans like "CNN (the Cable News Network),
Stop Lies, Tell the Truth."
</P>
<P>
Dusan Jelaca, who drove several hours from Boston to join the
rally, told Xinhua that the Western media is always lying about
the crisis. "The refugees were created by NATO's bombing, not by
Serbs as the (U.S.) media alleged," he said, adding, "Whey didn't
they show the casualties of the Serbians on their TV?"
</P>
<P>
He said that he had done a research in the past year and find
that it is the United States that created the crisis because it
had attempted to break up Yugoslavia for the past decade.
"Yugoslavia has to defend its sovereignty," he said.
</P>
<P>
By the noon time, a pray service began. Dozens of black
balloons were released into the sky amid wild cheers. "The
balloons represent those victims killed in the conflict," Natalija
Djunckovic, one of the organizers from the Serbian Unity Congress
in the U.S., told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Djunckovic, who has many relatives in Yugoslavia, was born in
the United States. "My uncles, my cousins are in Serbia hiding in
bombshelters and I lost contact with them four days ago," she
said.
</P>
<P>
"As an American citizen, I feel how we are adrift from our
constitution. We are invading a sovereign nation, we are killing
innocent people," she added.
</P>
<P>
Raising a sign reading "Kosov, Another Vietnam" with one hand
and an American flag with another, Alex Johnson told Xinhua that
he feared that the bombing of Yugoslavia could ignite another
Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
"Many Americans are against this illegal and reckless war. If
they does not stop it now, it would lead to another Vietnam," said
the young man, who got up very early in the morning and drove
nearly 10 hours from Detroit to take part in the rally.
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Niketic of Chicago agreed. "NATO is violating every
international law, and is pure imperialism," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Why do we have violence in our schools? why? because we have a
violent government," Niketic said, referring to the school
shooting earlier this week in Denver, Colorado, in which 15 were
killed.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Clinton administration requested Congress to
approve an emergency budget of six billion U.S. dollars for the
airstrike against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Niketic stressed that the U.S. administration should invest
billions of U.S. dollars which it uses to bomb Yugoslavia in
education.
</P>
<P>
"We need to educate our kids to love peace," she said.

<HEADLINE> African Leaders, U.S. Firms Begin Trade Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOUSTON, United States, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A five-day
conference between African leaders and U.S. deal makers kicked off
here on Saturday afternoon to explore opportunities for two-way
trade and investment between Africa and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The theme for the 1999 Summit, "transforming natural wealth into
human capital," speaks to one of the most important challenges
facing Africa today.
</P>
<P>
The participants are expected to attend organized recreation
activities on Sunday. A series of workshops will formally start on
Monday, and will draw five heads of state, four prime ministers and
high-level representatives of more than 26 African countries,
senior U.S. government officials and entrepreneurs as well as the
chief executive officials of some of America's largest corporations.
</P>
<P>
The summit follows on the heals of the U.S.-Africa Ministerial
Meeting held in Washington D.C. last month, which involved 100
ministers from 46 African countries.
</P>
<P>
The gathering, entitled "Attracting Capital to Africa Summit," is
aimed at helping create joint ventures between U.S. and African
companies, encouraging U.S. investment in Africa and highlighting
investment opportunities on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Top U.S. government officials expected at the conference include
the secretaries of commerce, energy, transportation.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the summit is not isolated, but rather
an integral part of the redefinition of the U.S. ties with Africa.
</P>
<P>
On April 21, 1997, some 700 people gathered at Chantilly,
Virginia, to participate in a summit to attract American business to
Africa and to celebrate the economic renaissance of African
continent.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The NATO peacekeeping forces in
Macedonia were reinforced Saturday by 20 Leopard tanks, infantry
combat vehicles, armored personnel carriers and M109 artillery
guns.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the NATO peacekeeping forces in Macedonia,
Andrew Venus, said that the military vehicles and weapons were
moved in from Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian news agency ATA quoted Venus as saying that if an
agreement is reached with Yugoslavia on the Kosovo issue, they
will enter Kosovo to carry out the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Some more military vehicles will arrive in Macedonia from
Greece next week, he said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO has 12,500 troops stationed in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia has been opposed to any NATO ground attacks on
Yugoslavia to be launched from its soil.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian newspaper "Gazeta Shaiptare" reported that
Macedonia closed its border with Greece Friday in a bid to prevent
NATO from moving in troops and arms from the Greek port of
Selanik.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that NATO plans to send 2,000 German troops and
2,000 British troops to Macedonia.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal
Milo said Saturday that Albania will play a role of bridge tower
in a possible NATO ground attack against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said that as a NATO partner country, Albania is obligated to
cooperate with NATO so it will provide every convenience for a
NATO ground offensive in Kosovo, the southern Serbian province of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Albanian President Rexhep Mejdani urged NATO on
Friday to start ground attacks in Kosovo as soon as possible and
put Kosovo under an international protectorate.
</P>
<P>
The president, who is in Washington to attend the NATO summit
marking the 50th birthday of the Western military organization,
said that there will be no quick solution to the Kosovo crisis
without the interference of the NATO ground forces.

<HEADLINE> Germany Tunes Down Economic Growth Expectation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The German government was more
cautious about the country's economic perspective by tuning down
its expected growth rate for year 1999 to mere 1.5 percent, a
Finance Ministry spokesman said Saturday in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
However, next year the German economy would show 2.5 percent
growth, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Last Autumn, the government's panel of independent economic
advisers predicted a 2.0 percent growth rate in 1999. Until in
March experts had counted on a growth rate of 2.2 percent despite
many crises over the world.
</P>
<P>
But two influential news weeklies, Der Spiegel and Focus, have
expected the German economy to expanse by only 1.6 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
Hans-Olaf Henkel, President of the Federation of German
Industry, said that any expectation for a growth rate higher than
2 percent was impossible to realize.

The same group was one of four far-right organizations that
claimed to have left the nail bomb in Brixton, south London, which
injured 39 people a week ago.
</P>
<P>
The investigators said the latest attack, which happened at
Brick Lane in the East End of London, was similar to the one in
Brixton, and they are treating it as a racist attack which links
to last week's bomb explosion.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pleads for "Patience" with Bombing on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
acknowledging NATO's failure for a quick surrendering of
Yugoslavia by airstrikes, urged patience on Saturday in forcing
Belgrade to accept NATO's demands.
</P>
<P>
"In order for this strategy to succeed, we need two things:
vigorous execution and patience," Clinton told a news conference
on the second day of the three-day gathering of the NATO 50th
anniversary summit.
</P>
<P>
He noted that allies bombed Iraq for 44 days before beginning
a ground assault to force Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Noting the size of the Yugoslav force still in Kosovo,
Clinton said it would take time "to reverse that, but we are
working on it and we will prevail if we execute well with real
determination and if we have the patience."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also declared that the alliance would strongly enforce
an oil embargo against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also sought to ease mounting tensions with Russia --
one supplier of oil to Yugoslavia -- over the Kosovo crisis,
saying he welcomed Russia's efforts for a peace deal over the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Our alliance recognizes the tremendous importance of Russia
to our alliance's future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's foreign minister said on Saturday that his country
would ignore any oil embargo of Yugoslavia, claiming such a move
would violate international law.
</P>
<P>
"We Have to take every reasonable means" to enforce the ban
on oil shipments to Belgrade, Clinton said. However, NATO
officials said earlier on Saturday that an enforcement mechanism
hadn't been worked out yet.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the alliance had reaffirmed and intensified its
demands on Yugoslavia for an end to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't weakened our conditions," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Questions NATO Oil Embargo against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques
Chirac on Saturday raised legal reservations on NATO proposals
to stop and search tankers in the Adriatic carrying oil to
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He told a news conference that stopping a ship on the high
seas would be an act of war. So what NATO navies would do if a
ship refused to submit to a search?
</P>
<P>
NATO defense ministers instructed the Supreme Allied
Commander in Europe, General Wesley Clark, on Friday to
recommand rules of engagement for an operation to "visit and
search" shipping to prevent arms and petroleum products reaching
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
But Chirac said France had placed a reservation on the
decision.
</P>
<P>
He said it was legitimate for the allies to try to stop
supplies reaching the Serb military but "it's extremely
delicate, and that's an understatement."
</P>
<P>
"Intercepting a ship on the high seas is an act of war
in international law. That raises some problems and that is why we
said we have to be very careful in this matter and study all the
aspects carefully before taking a final decision," he said.
