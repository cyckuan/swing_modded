<HEADLINE> Ex-State Dept. Employee Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former coordinator for State Department  
efforts to remove land and sea mines pleaded guilty Monday to a 
misdemeanor conflict of interest and agreed to pay a $20,000 fine, 
the Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew E.A. Lorin, 33, of New York, admitted to participating  
personally as a federal employee in a business matter in which he 
and his outside employer had a financial interest. As part of a 
plea bargain, a single count was filed against him in U.S. District 
Court here. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Lorin was a special government employee of the State  
Department serving as special coordinator for the Public and 
Private Partnerships for President Clinton's 2010 Initiative of 
Demining in the Office of Humanitarian Demining. His job was to 
coordinate State's efforts to help remove land and sea mines 
worldwide with similar efforts by private groups. 
</P>
<P>
	During this period, Lorin was paid $20,000 by Americas Partners,  
a private, for-profit business, which was participating in a joint 
venture to develop a theme park, known as the Grand Oasis, in 
Israel and Jordan, the department said. Construction of the Grand 
Oasis required removal of land mines, and Americas Partners gave 
Lorin a 1 percent equity interest in the project. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1998, Lorin telephoned Ambassador Dennis B. Ross,  
who was the State Department's special Middle East coordinator, 
identified himself as a State Department employee, described Grand 
Oasis and recommended that State support it, the Justice Department 
said. Lorin then sought permission from his government ethics 
adviser to send Ross a memo recommending the project for State 
Department support. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Justice Department said that, the next day without  
waiting for the ethics adviser's approval, Lorin sent the memo to 
Ross and others in the State Department. Subsequently, the ethics 
adviser told Ross to cease all activity at State on behalf of 
Americas Partners. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lorin took no action to withdraw his memo or advise any  
recipient that he was prohibited from sending it, the Justice 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	A plea agreement said Lorin has admitted his offense and agreed  
to pay a $20,000 fine. Magistrate Judge Deborah A. Robinson set 
sentencing for July 7.

<HEADLINE> TV's Boys in Blue Need Police OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Standing in a makeshift New York police squad  
room, Larry Gregory and Dennis Higgins look every bit the cop. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory rests his hands comfortably on his gun belt; Higgins  
folds his arms authoritatively across his chest. Their uniforms, 
complete with rank and insignia, have that been-around-the-block 
look. 
</P>
<P>
	But these boys in blue are not officers.  
</P>
<P>
	They are three of about 200 actors who make a living playing  
cops in New York-based movies and television shows. Their uniforms 
look worn because any actor playing a New York cop needs his own -- 
and a police permit to buy one. 
</P>
<P>
	``It costs less to hire a few actors with their own police  
uniforms than to pay an actor and rent a uniform,'' said Greg 
White, an assistant producer on NBC's ``Law &AMP; Order,'' which uses a 
handful of the actors in every episode. 
</P>
<P>
	In cities with fewer police dramas -- San Francisco, home to CBS'  
``Nash Bridges,'' and Baltimore, where NBC's ``Homicide'' is filmed 
-- uniforms are either rented or purchased by production companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But New York has always been a magnet for police dramas, from TV  
shows like the 1960s' ``Naked City'' and the '70s series ``Kojak,'' 
to movies, such as ``Dog Day Afternoon'' and ``Serpico.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, shows such as ``New York Undercover'' on Fox  
and ``Law &AMP; Order'' have set up shop in the city, increasing 
interest by actors in making a steady living playing police. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, would-be actors of police roles must fill out an  
application with the Mayor's Office of Film and Television for 
permission to buy an NYPD uniform, which costs about $800 from a 
certified retailer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We forward it on to the police department, which then does a  
background check to make sure the applicant has no criminal 
background,'' said Julienne Cho, spokeswoman for the mayor's film 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Then they are told the rules: Do not wear the whole uniform in  
public and do not pass yourself off as a police officer. Both are 
punishable by jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Once approved, most register with casting agents who handle  
actors with ``special skills,'' such as those who own everything 
from police uniforms to antique cars, said Fleet Emerson of Sylvia 
Faye Casting. 
</P>
<P>
	The actors get paid $115 a day -- plus $18 for their uniform -- to  
work as police extras. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory, 49, started playing cops 15 years ago as a struggling  
actor when he was told that actors with uniforms work more often. 
Since then, he's parlayed it into a regular income. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want no part of real danger. I'm only brave when the  
camera's rolling,'' joked the 49-year-old Gregory, who has been 
acting for nearly 25 years. ``But I take everything I do seriously. 
If I can put a human face on a police uniform, then I've done my 
job as an actor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Higgins, 56, started as a professional dancer in off-Broadway  
productions, but he switched to police work 10 years ago because 
``all dancers have to eventually move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both have studied police officers' mannerisms and picked up cop  
talk to help them with their portrayals, but they say they are 
careful not to act like police officers in public. 
</P>
<P>
	``At no point do I ever think I'm a police officer,'' Gregory  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my pet peeves is when newer actors ... play with their  
guns on the set, not realizing how dangerous it is,'' he added. 
Blanks that the guns fire can cause harm. In 1984, actor Jon-Erik 
Hexum was fatally injured when he put a gun loaded with blanks to 
his head and pulled the trigger on the set of ``Cover Up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Gregory and Higgins say they have been approached, while on  
location around the city, by people asking for their assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell them I'm an actor and point them to a real police  
officer,'' Higgins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes that might be Lt. Dennis Cirillo, an NYPD veteran who  
acts in his spare time. ``The difference between them and me,'' he 
said, ``is that if I see something happen, I have to either take 
action or report it. This job never really stops.''

<HEADLINE> Italian, German Telecoms To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Telecom Italia SpA and Germany's Deutsche Telekom  
AG are expected to announce Tuesday that they are merging in a 
mega-deal that would create a new global competitor to U.S. giants 
such as AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	The two firms' chief executives -- Franco Bernabe and Ron Sommer  
-- will outline the merger agreement at a news conference in London, 
said an official at Telecom Italia who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned announcement ends days of frenzied speculation about  
such a move. A Telecom Italia-Deutsche Telekom combination would 
dwarf its competitors in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the deal could be upstaged by yet another that is  
reportedly in the works. The German business weekly Manager Magazin 
issued a news release Monday saying that Deutsche Telekom is also 
negotiating a takeover of U.S. telecommunications company Sprint 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a report to be published Friday in the magazine,  
Telekom boss Sommer has been negotiating a deal with Sprint Corp.'s 
Chief Executive William Esrey for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia confirmed late Sunday that it was examining the  
possibility of an industrial alliance with Deutsche Telekom. 
Telecom Italia is known to be seeking a white knight to save it 
from a hostile takeover bid by its smaller Italian rival, Olivetti 
SpA. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia have refused to say how they  
might share ownership in a combined company and have declined to 
say how they might calculate their respective values in any merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom has a market capitalization of about $117  
billion while Telecom Italia is at about $77 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema said today that any merger  
between Telecom Italia and Deutsche Telekom would require a 
privatization of the German company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot imagine that a privatized Telecom Italia may merge  
with a company whose main shareholder is the German state,'' 
D'Alema told reporters. Deutsche Telecom is 72 percent-owned by the 
German government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian government owns 3.4 percent of Telecom Italia, but  
it has veto power over the acquisition of more than 3 percent of 
the shares of the telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti has offered $12.31 a share for Telecom Italia. Olivetti  
plans to proceed with its tender offer despite the German-Italian 
merger talks, company spokesman Ugo Panerai said today. Olivetti 
has already filed a prospectus with the Italian regulatory body 
Consob. 
</P>
<P>
	In sheer size, merger between the German and Italian companies  
would rival the pending oil industry linkup between Exxon Corp. and 
Mobil Corp., now the largest in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia's board was meeting specifically today to address  
issues related to such a merger, the company official said from 
Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	A Deutsche Telekom spokesman in Bonn refused to say whether the  
German company's directors were planning a meeting of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deutsche Telekom is examining Telecom Italia's potential in an  
industry alliance, but the elements of such an alliance are still 
under evaluation,'' Stephan Althoff said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Althoff declined to comment on newspaper reports that the two  
companies planned to fold their stock into a new telecommunications 
holding company on a 60-40 percent basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian prime minister's office has said that any accord  
must be on an equal footing, underlining fears in Italy of foreign 
ownership of the strategic telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
	A merger also would raise a rash of regulatory issues. Deutsche  
Telekom has close financial and operational ties with another major 
telecommunications company, France Telecom. In addition, Deutsche 
Telekom is still majority owned by the German government, which 
would have to divest in order to gain approval of the deal from 
Italian regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	In Paris, France Telecom said today that Deutsche Telekom can't  
withdraw unilaterally from its strategic agreements with the French 
telecommunications group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our agreements with Deutsche Telekom are clear and  
incompatible with a unilateral strategic turnaround,'' France 
Telecom said. The companies own 2 percent of one another's stock.

<HEADLINE> Rain Forest Advocate Wins Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Two aboriginal protesters of an Australian  
uranium mine and an African who has worked to protect a huge 
tropical rainforest were among the winners of the Goldman 
Environmental Prize. 
</P>
<P>
	The $125,000 annuall prizes, to be awarded today, recognize  
efforts of grassroots environmentalism around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``The common theme as always is that one person can indeed make  
a difference,'' said Duane Silverstein, who oversees the awards. 
``You don't need a special education, special training or a special 
background to help save the earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The labors of Jacqui Katona and Yvonne Margarula have delayed  
mining of an estimated 20,000 tons of ore from Jabiluka, one of the 
world's richest untapped uranium bodies. The government-approved 
mine site is in an area surrounded by Aboriginal-owned Kakadu 
National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Katona and Margarula were convicted of trespassing  
following a protest against the mine. Later, Katona urged a United 
Nations panel to halt the mine operation, saying it amounted to an 
attack on the Mirrar, an Aboriginal clan that has cherished the 
land for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Samuel Nguiffo of Cameroon also won the prize for leading a team  
in the Congo Basin which informs forest dwellers of a law that 
allows inhabitants to manage lands prized by foreign logging 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unacceptable that the basis for life of millions of  
individuals be destroyed in order to satisfy the greed of a few 
private companies,'' Nguiffo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 20 million to 30 million people live in or near the central  
African rain forest, which is second in size only to the Amazon 
forest in South America. 
</P>
<P>
	Other recipients of the 10th annual Goldman awards were:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Ka Hsaw Wa, a member of the Karen ethnic minority in Burma,  
now known as Myanmar. He fled his home during military rule 10 
years ago. He has interviewed more than 1,000 victims of human 
rights abuses and documented environmental abuses, including 
increased logging and the hunting of elephants and tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Bernard Martin, a former fisherman from Newfoundland who has  
called for reduced fishing quotas after witnessing the collapse of 
Canada's east coast fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Jorge Varela, a conservationist who has worked to contain the  
expansion of shrimp farming along the Gulf of Fonseca in Honduras. 
Environmentalists say shrimp farming has destroyed critical coastal 
wetlands, displaced traditional fishing communities and 
contaminated fresh water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Michal Kravcik, a Slovakian hydrologist who galvanized support  
to stop a proposed dam that would have destroyed the environment 
and forced the evacuation of four 700-year-old villages.

<HEADLINE> Demitra Passes Up $500,000 Shot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Pavol Demitra had an easy $500,000 staring at  
him, but he passed. 
</P>
<P>
	It was more than an empty-net goal that the St. Louis Blues  
winger passed up in the final seconds of Sunday's 3-2 win over the 
Los Angeles Kings. That goal would have given Demitra 90 points 
this season and triggered a $500,000 bonus on the next two years of 
his contract, which will pay $1.1 million next season and $1.3 
million in 2000-2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Why pass up a half-million dollar shot?  
</P>
<P>
	Because winger Scott Young was skating on his left, down the  
slot, with a $300,000 bonus of his own set to kick in if he could 
score one more goal. So Demitra put his bonus in Young's hands in 
the hope that his teammate could cash in as well. 
</P>
<P>
	But with $800,000 on the line, Young fired a shot that Kings  
defenseman Jaroslav Modry went down to block, sending the puck to 
the corner as the final horn blew. 
</P>
<P>
	No goal. No bonus for Demitra or Young.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's the most unselfish thing I've ever seen,'' Blues  
defenseman Jamie Rivers said of Demitra's pass. ``That's why he's 
the ultimate team player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Blues spokesman on Monday said he didn't know if the team  
would consider awarding the bonuses, even though the players fell 
just short. 
</P>
<P>
	Young scored his 24th goal earlier in the game. Twenty-five  
would have triggered his bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what kind of angle he had, but he gave it to me  
and if I put it in, we both hit,'' Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	Demitra said he had a good angle. His reasoning for the pass?  
</P>
<P>
	``He needed a goal,'' Demitra said.  
</P>
<P>
	Demitra appeared to have his bonus midway through the first  
period when he set up an apparent goal by Lubos Bartecko, but the 
goal was disallowed because the video replay showed Bartecko was in 
the crease. 
</P>
<P>
	Demitra led St. Louis with 37 goals and 89 points, but he had  
six goals disallowed -- four on video review and two on referee's 
decisions.

<HEADLINE> Big Banks Report Solid Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Citigroup Inc., BankAmerica Corp. and the Bank  
of New York Co. all reported strong first-quarter profits Monday, 
as U.S. consumers ran up their credit card bills and businesses 
borrowed to expand their reach. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking industry's impressive results reflect an economy  
with strong consumer confidence, a turbocharged stock market, low 
unemployment and benign inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This morning's reports were nothing short of fantastic,'' said  
Michael Ancell, an analyst with Edward Jones. ``The market rebound 
we've seen over the last quarter or two has given a huge boost to 
the banks' underwriting and trading revenues, and that's resulted 
in most companies beating earnings estimates, and it's certainly 
lit fire to their stock prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bank stocks helped propel the stock market's rise Monday.  
Investors bid up the prices of several top banks on the hunch that 
Monday's solid results will be repeated Tuesday when Chase 
Manhattan Bank, Bank One and Mellon Bank report their profits for 
the first three months of the year. 

</P>
<P>
	 *Citigroup    	
</P>
<P>
	The banking and insurance behemoth posted net income of $2.36  
billion, or $1.01 a share, up 9 percent from the first-quarter last 
year, when Citigroup earned $2.16 billion or 90 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup's profits from operations, which is widely watched by  
Wall Street, totaled $2.42 billion, or $1.04 a share, handily 
beating analysts' average estimate of 87 cents a share, according 
to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based financial services company, which was formed  
last year by the merger of Citibank and Travelers Group, has cut 
more than 4,100 jobs to reduce expenses. Citigroup said it has 
already realized $900 million of its targeted $2 billion in annual 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's global consumer business, which includes its North  
American banking and lending operations, grew 33 percent to $1.05 
billion in the quarter. Business was strong across the board, but 
especially in North American credit cards, where earnings jumped 75 
percent to $268 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup has bought several credit card businesses, including  
its recent acquisition of Mellon Bank's card unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``That, combined with higher prices and fees has really helped  
their card business take off,'' Ancell explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Citigroup announced it was selling its $930 million  
automobile finance business to Dime Bankcorp Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	During the first quarter, Citigroup's electronic banking was one  
of the few weak spots. The loss at its e-Citi unit widened 20 
percent to $36 million as the company spent heavily to develop the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Results for the global corporate and investment bank operations  
rebounded sharply in the first quarter, rising 31 percent to $1.36 
billion over the comparable quarter in 1998 and more than doubling 
from the fourth quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The gain was most notable at the Salomon Smith Barney brokerage  
and investment banking unit, which posted record earnings on total 
revenues of $3.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Travelers Life &AMP; Annuity business saw a 20 percent increase  
in income to $147 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Reacting to the bottom line numbers, investors sent Citigroup's  
stock up $3.37 1/2 to $75 1/2 a share in midday trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
	 *BankAmerica    	
</P>
<P>
	BankAmerica, based in Charlotte, N.C., reported net income of  
$1.91 billion, or $1.08 a share, a 44 percent increase over the 
first quarter last year, when the bank earned $1.33 billion, or 75 
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	BankAmerica's performance beat analysts' estimate of $1.03 a  
share, according to First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	``BankAmerica had a good quarter, but not as good as the New  
York banks because their investment banking business was a bit 
sluggish,'' Ancell said. 
</P>
<P>
	BankAmerica's investment banking and securities revenue was hurt  
by an employee exodus at Montgomery Securities, and by the sale of 
its Robertson Stephens division last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's net interest income of $4.65 billion was virtually  
unchanged from a year ago, as loan and deposit growth offset 
declines in loan sales and interest rate spreads. 
</P>
<P>
	Average managed loans grew 11 percent to $385 billion,  
reflecting increases in both consumer and business loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Noninterest expenses fell by 5 percent to $4.45 billion,  
illustrating the effect of the job cuts and other cost reductions 
from the merger of BankAmerica and NationsBank. 
</P>
<P>
	Buoyed by the results, investors sent BankAmerica's stock up  
$2.87 1/2 to $75.87 1/2 at midday on the NYSE. 

</P>
<P>
	 *Bank of New York    	
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of New York Co. posted first quarter earnings of $316  
million, or 41 cents a share, matching Wall Street's estimate. 
Profits were up 12 percent from the first quarter last year, when 
the bank earned $284 million or 36 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Net interest income rose almost 8 percent to $436 million in the  
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Total noninterest income reached $625 million, up 5 percent from  
the year-ago period, driven by strong fees and a gain on 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Expenses were virtually flat at $509 million.  
</P>
<P>
	With few surprises in the numbers, investors reacted mildly,  
pushing the Bank of New York's stock up 43 3/4 cents to $38 at midday 
on the Big Board.

<HEADLINE> Iron Man Ripken on Disabled List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The words, in tiny type on the transaction  
list, had never before been written: 
</P>
<P>
	BALTIMORE ORIOLES -- Placed 3B Cal Ripken on 15-day disabled  
list. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, baseball's Iron Man, went on the disabled list Monday  
for the first time in his 19-year career. The move, made because 
Ripken has a sore back, is retroactive to Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's remarkable he's gone this long without being put on the  
disabled list,'' Orioles general manager Frank Wren said. ``The 
pounding he takes, the work ethic he has, it's just amazing this 
had not happened before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While playing in a record 2,632 straight games from May 1982 to  
September 1998, Ripken endured all sorts of bumps and bruises -- in 
addition to two sprained ankles and a twisted knee. 
</P>
<P>
	But the chink in his armor is apparently located at the base of  
his spine. 
</P>
<P>
	The third baseman missed his fourth game this season Sunday  
because of nerve irritation in his lower back and immediately 
traveled to Cleveland to receive treatment from Dr. Henry Bohlman, 
professor of orthopedics at Case Western University. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, 38, received a cortisone shot and was advised to stay  
off the field for the next couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now we're going with rehabilitation and therapy. He will  
get a few more cortisone shots, relax a little bit and take the 
full two weeks to work his way back,'' Wren said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wren said that surgery is not an option at this time.  
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, whose father, Cal Sr., died shortly before the season  
started, was removed in the third inning of the Orioles' opener on 
April 5 because of back pain. He then sat out Baltimore's next game 
-- the first game he missed because of injury since his rookie 
season in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken also missed the Orioles' next game and was benched in  
Toronto last week after committing two errors on one play the night 
before in New York against the Yankees. Ripken is 5-for-28 this 
season and has five errors in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question his back has affected his play,'' Wren  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Early last week Ripken said his back felt fine. But after he  
woke up in agony Sunday, he knew it was time to get further 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got a cortisone shot the last time he had trouble with his  
back, during the first week of the season,'' Wren said. ``He wanted 
to get back quickly, as one would expect. But this time he needs to 
go slower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last Sept. 20, Ripken voluntarily ended his record consecutive  
games streak by sitting out the Orioles' final home game against 
the New York Yankees. It was the first game he missed since 
beginning his record streak on May 30, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken will be replaced at third base by rookie Willis Otanez.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Edges Closer to Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, edging closer to running  
for Senate, opened a campaign-style swing today by declaring, ``I 
love New York,'' as her fledgling political operation combed the 
state for potential campaign workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm obviously still considering and exploring and am very  
interested,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet she tried to minimize the political implications of the  
trip, which included talks about the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo 
and other traditional first lady fare. The White House called the 
trip an official function, thus U.S. taxpayers picked up the tab. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an exploratory trip. This is a trip filled with  
events and occasions, some of which I agreed to do months ago,'' 
Mrs. Clinton told reporters after urging private foundations to 
help ease the Kosovo refugee crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Her aides, however, conceded the trip had political  
implications. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess anytime we're up here, it's part of the (exploratory)  
process,'' said press secretary Marsha Berry. ``She's thinking 
about this. I don't know when you turn it off and turn it on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and associates say Mrs. Clinton appears to be leaning  
toward a Senate bid, though some believe she will forego the race 
at the last minute. Their assessments are based on clues from 
private conversations with her and the full-speed-ahead groundwork 
being laid by top political aide Harold Ickes. 
</P>
<P>
	The former deputy White House chief of staff has begun compiling  
lists of campaign operatives in the event she takes the plunge. He 
has secured commitments from some potential staff, said a source 
close to Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	One longtime associate said Mrs. Clinton told him two weeks ago  
that she intended to run, but would not finalize her decision until 
June or July. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton scheduled scores of New York stops Monday, Tuesday  
and -- after returning to Washington on Wednesday -- again Thursday, 
from Long Island to Niagara Falls. Monday's unusually crowded 
schedule contained seven stops, including the Columbia College 
Teachers' College, the Ukrainian Institute, the Jewish Child Care 
Association and a fund-raiser for Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers, Ukrainians and the Jewish community are important  
Democratic constituencies. Nadler, a House Judiciary Committee 
member, staunchly defended President Clinton during the impeachment 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip brought Mrs. Clinton fresh evidence that a Senate race  
against probable Republican nominee Rudolph Giuliani would be 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest poll from Marist College's Institute for Public  
Opinion showed the pair in a dead heat, with half saying Mrs. 
Clinton should not run. The New York mayor has gained ground since 
a February Marist poll, which had Mrs. Clinton leading Giuliani, 49 
percent to 38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one said it was going to be a cakewalk,'' said Sen. Charles  
Schumer, D-N.Y., who ousted Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato last 
November and has urged the first lady to run. ``This is going to be 
a tough, tough race, but I think as people get to know her, she'll 
do better and better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers inside and outside the White House are studying whether  
Mrs. Clinton should form an exploratory committee to raise money 
that would defray the costs of future trips. She said would 
consider the move ``if it becomes appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief news conference, Mrs. Clinton explained for the first  
time why a Senate race interests her: ``I love New York, to start 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With gushing reverence, Mrs. Clinton called New York ``a  
microcosm of America,'' with a ``dynamic, diverse city'' that would 
enable her to deal with issues such as education and health care 
that are as important in New York as they are across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the collective ``we'' in a way that could include the  
first lady herself, Mrs. Clinton said, ``We have everything in New 
York that we have in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also announced plans to travel to Albania and Macedonia ``as  
soon as I'm given the green light'' by humanitarian workers, whose 
efforts she does not want to disrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	As for her career, Mrs. Clinton told several associates in  
recent days that she has concluded that serving in the Senate would 
be a good next step for her. When word first surfaced of her 
interest, Mrs. Clinton had told these same people she wasn't sure 
if she wanted to be in a Republican-controlled Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The new question: Is she willing to risk losing? Though a senior  
adviser said Mrs. Clinton is not afraid of defeat, other associates 
say she tends to avoid taking great risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Most friends and associates spoke on condition of anonymity.  
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of Teachers  
and a Mrs. Clinton supporter in New York, suggested the first lady 
is inclined to run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get a feeling that a final decision has been made yet,  
but I think she's very interested,'' Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was urged to run at every stop, including a Central  
Park event concerning hiking trails. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to wish her all the best as she hits a different kind  
of trail right here in New York state,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, 
D-N.Y., as Mrs. Clinton, from the front row, shook her head from 
side to side. At another event, NBC ``Today Show'' host Katie 
Couric joked that Mrs. Clinton was ``taking time out from apartment 
hunting'' in New York to appear.

<HEADLINE> Explosion on USS Iowa Marked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- A former commander of the USS Iowa  
criticized the Navy for failing to apologize today for the way it 
handled a probe into an explosion aboard the battleship in which 47 
men died. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Capt. Larry Seaquist said the Navy, which initially  
blamed a sailor for the blast, misled families about the nature of 
its investigation and harassed family members. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been very nice if the leadership of the Navy  
would have been here to say something simple to you, like `We 
apologize,''' Seaquist, the Iowa's skipper a year before the 
explosion, said during a service at the Norfolk Naval Base marking 
the 10th anniversary of the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Norfolk Naval Base spokesman Cmdr. Mike Andrews said, ``What  
Capt. Seaquist says is his opinion; that's his right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The World War II-era warship was conducting exercises in the  
Caribbean on April 19, 1989, when an explosion ripped through the 
turret of one of the ship's 16-inch guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy initially said the blast was caused by Clayton Hartwig,  
who they said committed suicide over a homosexual affair by 
deliberately detonating gunpowder. It later admitted there was no 
proof of that. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews noted that Adm. Frank B. Kelso III, then the chief of  
naval operations, publicly apologized in 1991 to Hartwig's family. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hartwig's sister, Kathy Hartwig-Kubicina of Cleveland, said  
she and other Iowa families were grateful to Seaquist for his 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we've ever asked for is somebody to stick up for us,''  
Mrs. Hartwig-Kubicina said. 
</P>
<P>
	The family's $12 million defamation suit is pending in federal  
court in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 veterans and relatives of the victims attended  
Monday's ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Dow Industrials Up Nearly 200 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average was soaring  
this morning and on track for a sixth straight record close, as 
blue-chips were helped by strong earnings reports and merger news. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow was up 189.00 at 10.682.89,  
and its gains later rose to more than 200 points. On Friday, the 
Dow posted its fifth consecutive closing high, rising 31.17 to 
10,493.89. The record for consecutive records is 12, set in early 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also were rising, with the Nasdaq  
composite up 0.53 at 2,484.57, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 
composite up 15.54 at 1,334.54. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a pretty impressive array of companies that are  
doing better right now,'' said Ned Collins, a trader at Daiwa 
Securities. ``It includes all segments. All in all, the market is 
giving a pretty good performance, it looks like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the earnings front, Citigroup was up 2 5/8 at 74 1/4 and  
BankAmerica was up 2 3/4 at 75 3/4, after both posted strong earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth's shares were up 1 at 42 3/16, after the company  
announced it will buy a 10 percent stake in Qwest Communications 
for $3.5 billion, increasing its presence in fiber optics. Qwest's 
shares were up 2 7/8 at 84 7/8 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq, which stunned Wall Street with dismal earnings  
projections earlier this month, disclosed on Sunday that chief 
executive Eckhard Pfeiffer had been ousted and its chief financial 
officer was leaving. The company's shares were up 5/16 at 23 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	But other computer-related shares were lower. IBM was off 1/4 at  
170 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a better than 3 to 1  
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 351.93 million 
shares, up from Friday's pace hectic pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian markets were mixed overnight, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng  
Index up 2.2 percent amid very strong foreign buying interest, but 
the Nikkei stock average in Tokyo down 1.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	European stock markets were mixed this afternoon. Germany's DAX  
index was up 1.24 percent, but Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.71 
percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.92 percent.

<HEADLINE> Baldwin Returns Speech Fee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Actor Alec Baldwin has returned the  
$21,500 fee he received from Syracuse University for a speech he 
gave there last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Baldwin spoke to 400 people on March 9 and decided to return his  
fee to the University Union Speakers Board, said Lisa Stone, the 
board's chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Baldwin's donation ... is a true testament to his generous  
and thoughtful character,'' Stone said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Baldwin, the star of such movies as ``The Edge'' and ``The Hunt  
for Red October,'' has in recent years taken to political activism 
and fund-raising for the Democrats. He has said he is not 
interested in running for office himself.

<HEADLINE> California Patrol Tests Volvos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO (AP) -- The car of choice for soccer moms and yuppies  
is about to be put to the test by the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two years, the CHP has been quietly testing Volvos  
on its high-speed tracks at its academy in West Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	Next month, it plans to start deploying the imports for patrol  
duty and more testing on roads and highways throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
	CHP Commissioner D.O. ``Spike'' Helmick said the department  
currently uses Fords. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no problem with continuing to buy Fords,'' Helmick  
said Sunday. ``But the concern is that if for some reason Ford got 
out of the business or the price went astronomically high, we've 
got to be prepared to go alternative ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A potential problem might be the cost. Now, the patrol pays  
$22,200 for a Crown Victoria compared with $27,500 for each Volvo 
test car.

<HEADLINE> RealNetworks Signs Broadcast Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Audio and video software developer RealNetworks  
Inc. has reached agreements with AT&AMP;T Corp. and other major 
telecommunications companies that provide backbone for the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The deals, announced Monday, are designed to boost the quality  
of video and audio broadcasts delivered over the net. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreements -- with Sprint Corp., GTE Corp. and other  
companies as well as AT&AMP;T -- will cut down on congestion by allowing 
RealNetworks to install sophisticated computer servers throughout 
the Internet network. 
</P>
<P>
	Those servers, connected to the company's RealBroadcast Network  
in Seattle via high-speed links, act as broadcasting hubs to handle 
local traffic. The servers also are equipped to shift traffic from 
one hub to another in cases of high demand. 
</P>
<P>
	RealNetworks already broadcasts news, special events and other  
material over the Internet. But the picture has not matched 
television standards, and some viewers of highly popular events 
like the Victoria's Secret fashion show earlier this year couldn't 
view the show live. 
</P>
<P>
	``This does make it very clear that not only are they a player,  
they are one of the significant players in the space, and it 
certainly shows a potential maturing of the Internet broadcast 
arena,'' said analyst Rob Enderle of Giga Information Group. 
</P>
<P>
	RealNetworks has about an 85 percent share of the market and  
about 57 million registered users.

<HEADLINE> Best Buy Won't Sell iMac Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) -- Some customers want blue, and some want  
green. But customers who head to Best Buy Co. stores looking for an 
iMac computer won't find any at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Best Buy hasn't stocked the iMac since early this year because  
it disagrees with Apple Computer's requirement that retailers stock 
all five colors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not carrying the iMacs right now because there isn't  
exactly a match between Apple's purchase requirements and our 
inventory management,'' Best Buy spokeswoman Joy Harris said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1,199 computers, on store shelves in five colors since  
January, have been most popular in blueberry and grape. The lime, 
tangerine and strawberry models have been less popular. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple recently shifted its policy, shipping four blues with one  
of each of the other colors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're definitely trying to work this out,'' said Apple  
spokeswoman Rhona Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the adjustments aren't working for Best Buy. The company  
did not specify which colors it does not want to stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Other computer stores said Monday they do not have a problem  
with Apple's policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzanne Shelton at Dallas-based CompUSA, said the purple models,  
dubbed ``grape,'' have been very popular. But she said that when 
those run out on store shelves, customers are content to buy 
whatever is in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of them are faster sellers than others,'' she said, ``but  
so far that hasn't proven to be a real problem for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A clerk at one California Fry's Electronics chain, where the  
shelves held plenty of blueberries and no tangerine, strawberry, 
lime or grape models, said customers will take what they can get. 
</P>
<P>
	Best Buy, which has 300 stores in 36 states, may eventually  
stock the iMacs, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just taking a lot of negotiations,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Angels' Edmonds To Undergo Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The injury curse has struck the Anaheim  
Angels again. 
</P>
<P>
	Center fielder Jim Edmonds, who won his second straight Gold  
Glove last season and has averaged nearly 28 homers over the last 
four years, will be sidelined about four months due to a severely 
injured right (non-throwing) shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmonds, 28, had been placed on the 15-day disabled list on  
April 4 with a strained groin and irritated shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	All along, it was expected he'd return to action sometime this  
month, but the Angels announced Monday he will undergo arthroscopic 
surgery Thursday to repair a torn labrum and possibly tighten his 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've tried a variety of avenues via medication and therapy to  
treat the shoulder,'' said Dr. Lewis Yocum, the Angels' medical 
director. ``The surgery should allow for full return of arm 
strength, but we will know more following the procedure. The 
minimum amount of recuperation time should be roughly four 
months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edmonds, who hit .307 with 25 homers and 91 RBIs last season,  
was expected to travel to Toronto with the Angels on Monday for 
their three-game series against the Blue Jays that begins Tuesday 
night. However, he arrived at Edison International Field for some 
early work with batting instructor Rod Carew, and was unable to 
participate in any drills. 
</P>
<P>
	He then informed the team of his desire to undergo surgery.  
</P>
<P>
	The Angels, who have a long history of injuries to key players,  
thus will be without two of their best -- Edmonds and shortstop Gary 
DiSarcina -- for more than half this season. 
</P>
<P>
	DiSarcina was hit in the left forearm by a fungo bat being swung  
by coach George Hendrick, who was hitting grounders before spring 
training had officially started in Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	DiSarcina suffered a broken bone in his left forearm, but was  
expected to return to action sometime this month. However, it was 
determined shortly before the start of the season that he needed 
surgery. Now, he's not expected back before the All-Star break in 
mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, first baseman Mo Vaughn, who signed an $80 million,  
six-year contract with the Angels last November, suffered a 
sprained ankle in the first inning of his first game with the team 
on April 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn is expected to be activated and back in the lineup late  
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The possibility of surgery was something that existed, the  
players and staff of this organization knew that,'' Angels 
spokesman Tim Mead said, alluding to the Edmonds announcement. 
``But while we look forward to Jim and Gary's return later this 
year, our players will remain focused on the task on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	After Vaughn was signed, many expected the Angels to trade  
either Edmonds or Garret Anderson because the team appeared to have 
a surplus of outfielders. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they have to be relieved they didn't make such a move.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were not going to give away one of those outfielders  
despite all the rumors,'' Mead said.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq May Extend Trading Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq Stock Market is moving closer to a  
decision on extending trading hours into the late evening, giving 
working folks, avid traders and global investors more time to buy 
and sell shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Securities Dealers, the governing  
body of Nasdaq, has formed a subcommittee to draw up a formal 
proposal, which will be presented to the NASD board May 27, NASD 
spokesman Scott Peterson said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The change, if approved by the board, would require approval by  
the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, NASD President Richard G. Ketchum said ``powerful  
demand'' from investors and firms obligated the association to 
respond. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, Ketchum said the after-hours session would most  
likely last from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson said Monday the exact hours were still under  
discussion.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Prices Drop, Corn Rises / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures were sharply lower Monday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and soybeans both posted gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were higher in early trading Monday before falling  
off. Bad weekend weather in growing regions of the United States 
probably did less damage to the crop than anticipated, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures opened lower Monday on follow-through from Friday's  
weak close. But by midmorning prices turned higher, analysts said, 
as updated weather forecasts called for a pattern of wet weather 
most of the week, which could delay planting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're kind of getting into a weather market here with cold and  
wet weather into last week ... and this week,'' said Jack Scoville, 
a trader with Price Futures Group in Chicago. ``All of the sudden 
now you're looking at a little delay'' in getting the crop in the 
ground.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Quizzes Darryl Strawberry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Major league baseball interrogated troubled New  
York Yankees outfielder Darryl Strawberry for several hours on 
Sunday about his latest arrest, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the questioning by baseball and players union  
officials, Strawberry was also given another drug test, the New 
York Daily News reported today, citing multiple sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Yankees general manager Brian Cashman told the newspaper  
he had no knowledge of Strawberry's meeting with baseball 
officials, the Daily News also reported that the results of a drug 
test taken by Strawberry on Tuesday in Tampa, Fla., was to be made 
available to the team today. 
</P>
<P>
	If Strawberry's drug tests were to come back clean, baseball is  
unlikely to take any action against the outfielder until the 
criminal charges of his arrest are resolved, a source familiar with 
Sunday's hearing told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry intends to plead not guilty to the charges of cocaine  
possession and solicitation for prostitution leveled against him as 
a result of Wednesday night's arrest, according to his Tampa 
attorney, Joseph Ficarrotta. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Strawberry has not been permitted to work out  
at the Yankees' complex in Tampa, where he has been while 
completing his chemotherapy treatments after colon cancer surgery. 
Also, the team has stopped payments of his $2.5 million salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry reportedly returned to Tampa after the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Awaits Drug Test Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball officials awaited Darryl Strawberry's  
latest drug test results Monday, still uncertain what the future 
held for the troubled outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry met Sunday with officials of the players'  
association, the commissioner's office and doctors from both sides, 
according to several sources familiar with the meeting who spoke on 
the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball continues to test Strawberry twice a week as part of  
the aftercare program that followed his 60-day suspension in 1995 
for a positive test for cocaine use. Strawberry has not tested 
positive for illegal drugs since then, the New York Yankees said 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said the team had not  
heard any new information from the commissioner's office on 
Strawberry, who was tested April 13 and again later in the week, 
after his arrest in Tampa, Fla., on charges of cocaine possession 
and solicitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, 37, was at the Yankees' training camp as part of its  
extended spring training program. He was still rehabilitating from 
colon cancer surgery in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``As of right now, he is not resuming workouts,'' Cashman said  
Monday. ``From the club's perspective, he's got his legal issues 
and personal issues to deal with. It's best for him at this 
particular moment to deal with that. Baseball is second right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear if the Yankees have stopped paying Strawberry, who  
is not on their 40-man roster. He has a minor league contract and a 
consulting deal with the team, which together total $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	New York had been advancing money to Strawberry and may have  
stopped those advances, one of the sources said.

<HEADLINE>  Toyota, GM To Make Fuel-Cell Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Toyota Motor Corp. and General Motors Corp. have  
reached a five-year agreement to jointly develop cars and trucks 
that can run off fuel cells and other environmentally friendly 
alternative-fuel technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pooling our efforts should result in commercially viable  
advanced technologies faster and at a lower cost to our customers, 
and as breakthroughs are reached, suppliers will be able to count 
on the volume of production from two of the world's largest 
automakers,'' GM vice chairman Harry Pearce said in remarks 
prepared for delivery today at a Detroit news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	GM, the world's largest automaker, and No. 3 Toyota have worked  
on several joint ventures, including a California-based venture to 
produce small cars and to market of GM's Cavalier cars through 
Toyota's sales network in Japan. They had been in talks on the 
advanced technology venture since last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The new venture will involve research and development of  
electric, hybrid electric and fuel-cell technology. Hybrid electric 
vehicles typically combine an electric motor with other power 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is to last through 2004, the year that GM, Ford Motor  
Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG have said they plan to be ready to 
produce fuel-cell vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's announcement also comes a day before Ford,  
DaimlerChrysler and Ballard Power Systems Inc., a fuel-cell 
developer, plan to announce a deal with oil companies to develop a 
demonstration fleet of fuel-cell powered vehicles in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuel cells produce electricity using a chemical reaction between  
hydrogen and oxygen and produce little or no emissions. The 
technology was developed for use in spacecraft, but problems in 
supplying and storing hydrogen have hampered plans to use it for 
cars. So far, fuel cells remain prohibitively expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler has been working on technology to convert  
gasoline to hydrogen on board the car, eliminating the need for a 
heavy, expensive hydrogen storage tank. 
</P>
<P>
	GM and Toyota have been working on alternative-fuel vehicles for  
years. GM was the first to mass-market an electric car, the EV1, 
which has failed to catch on in the markets where it is being 
leased. Toyota brought the first hybrid electric car to market, the 
Prius, in Japan two years ago. The Prius uses gasoline and 
electricity and is scheduled to go on sale in the United States and 
Europe next year.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up More Than 200 Points / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average was soaring at  
midday and on track for a sixth straight record close. Stocks got a 
lift from strong earnings reports as investors continued to shift 
millions of dollars out of technology stocks and into industrial 
companies that, until recently, have lagged glamorous Internet 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow was up 234.78, or 2.24 percent,  
at 10,728.67, having sped past the 10,500, 10,600 and 10,700 
markers. On Friday, the Dow posted its fifth consecutive closing 
high, rising 31.17 to 10,493.89. The record for consecutive records 
is 12, set in early 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	With the gains, which came in heavy trading, the Dow is up  
nearly 17 percent so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed, with the Nasdaq composite  
down 10.89 at 2,473.15 amid a backup in technology shares. But the 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite was up 16.26 at 1,335.26. 
</P>
<P>
	Ned Riley, chief investment officer at BankBoston, said  
industrial stocks are sharply higher because investors are flocking 
to this sector of the market, where there are far fewer shares 
outstanding than, say, technology companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are rotating out of stocks that had clearly been the  
winners in the last 15-24 months, into a market that has a much 
smaller market capitalization,'' Riley said. ``If the lemmings 
clearly are all trying to get through the door at the same time 
with mega-orders (for industrial stocks), that is clearly going to 
push the prices of these stocks higher because of the lack of 
liquidity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Alcoa, for example, were up 3 3/8 at 56 1/16.  
</P>
<P>
	Strong earnings reports were also pushing stocks higher.  
Citigroup was up 3 5/16 at 74 15/16, and BankAmerica was up 3 at 
76, both on earnings reports that surpassed analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Mergers and acquisitions also helped. BellSouth's shares were up  
1 1/4 at 42 8/16, after the company announced it will buy a 10 percent 
stake in Qwest Communications for $3.5 billion, increasing its 
presence in fiber optics. Qwest's shares were up 4 1/4 at 86 1/4 in 
Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	But technology shares continued to fall amid massive selling.  
IBM was down 2 7/8 at 168 1/2 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq was down 3/16 at 23 7/16, after giving up earlier gains.  
The computer maker, which stunned Wall Street with dismal earnings 
projections earlier this month, disclosed on Sunday that chief 
executive Eckhard Pfeiffer had been ousted and its chief financial 
officer was leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a better than 3 to 1  
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 530.91 million 
shares at midday, up from Friday's pace hectic pace.

<HEADLINE> Rodgers Fails To Break Over-50 Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- As disappointed as Bill Rodgers was in not  
finishing the 103rd Boston Marathon, he vowed it would not be his 
last attempt at conquering the difficult 26-mile, 385-yard course. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next year, I will run with my brother, Charlie,'' the  
51-year-old Rodgers said Monday, after dropping out with more than 
6 miles remaining, ``and we'll duke it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to end my marathon career with a DNF.''  
</P>
<P>
	This was Rodgers' 16th Boston Marathon and the third time he  
dropped out, but the first time since 1977. Sandwiched around that 
last DNF were victories in 1976, 1978, 1979 and 1980. Twice, he 
broke the course and American records. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Frank Shorter, the 1972 Olympic gold medalist and  
1976 silver medalist, Rodgers, also a four-time winner of the New 
York City Marathon, was responsible for the running boom in the 
United States. He was ranked the No. 1 marathoner in the world 
three times and won 21 marathons in his illustrious career. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston fans adore him. He was born in nearby Hartford,  
Conn., went to college at Wesleyan in Middletown, Conn., and earned 
his Masters degree in special education at Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
	He was given the nickname of ``Boston Billy.''  
</P>
<P>
	That's why so many of the enthusiastic fans who lined the course  
Monday were cheering loudly for Rodgers to do well. Rodgers had a 
goal -- to try to break the course record for an over-50 American of 
2 hours, 31 minutes, 34 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't to be.  
</P>
<P>
	After going through the half-marathon in a sprightly 1:14,  
Rodgers could manage only another seven miles before dropping out 
from dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm at an age where it wasn't a day to try for records,'' he  
said. ``Boston is one of the toughest races. Halfway I started to 
feel it. By the time I hit the hills, I was doing the marathon 
shuffle. I started to see some flashing lights, which is a sign of 
dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did my best. I made a smart decision. I did not want to keel  
over. I'm disappointed not to finish. I wanted to get to the line. 
Next time I run Boston I will be a back-of-the-pack runner and have 
some fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So if the youthful-thinking Rodgers returns in 2000, he will  
come back with a different attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can run the pace, but I can't push hard for records,'' he  
said. ``I have to run more carefully, then I'll finish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was Rodgers' first serious marathon since 1992 and his  
first legitimate attempt at Boston since 1990. He did run Boston in 
1996, but only because it was the race's 100th anniversary. His 
time of 2:53:23 was more than 33 minutes slower than his previous 
worst at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	He wanted to run Boston last year, but didn't train properly.  
This year, he thought he was ready, having prepared since December 
and competed in six shorter races, but the 60-degree heat, the 
demanding course and age combined to thwart his effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Rodgers will continue his heavy running program -- he ran 29  
races last year -- and keep pushing for a team training program to 
help United States marathoners. He also will maintain an interest 
in his Boston store that sells his line of clothing, help promote 
races, conduct clinics and make speaking appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he didn't finish the Boston Marathon on Monday, that  
doesn't mean his career is over. Far from it.

<HEADLINE> Basketball Coaches Sue Texas City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- The women's basketball coach at Hampton  
University, her husband and an assistant coach filed a $30 million 
lawsuit Monday over their detainment by Lubbock, Texas police who 
were investigating an alleged scam. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit contends police engaged in racially discriminatory  
behavior when they detained coach Patricia Bibbs, her husband Ezell 
and assistant coach Vanetta Kelso on Nov. 16. All three, who are 
black, have said they believe race played a role in how they were 
treated. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city of Lubbock and its police department have known and  
tolerated ... the selection and retention of police officers who 
have exhibited racist attitudes toward African-Americans and other 
minorities,'' the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit also contends police violated the constitutional rights  
of due process, equal protection and protection from unreasonable 
and illegal arrests, searches and seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Kelso, who is pregnant, claims she was humiliated,  
embarrassed and threatened by an emergency worker at the University 
Medical Center at Texas Tech because she vomited. The worker 
threatened to stuff a towel in her mouth, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bibbses and Kelso had no comment on the suit, said Victoria  
L. Jones, a spokeswoman for the university in southeastern 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Their attorneys, including O.J. Simpson lawyer Johnnie L.  
Cochran, filed the suit in U.S. District Court for the northern 
district of Texas in Wichita Falls. 
</P>
<P>
	Named as defendants were the city of Lubbock; Lubbock Police  
Chief Ken Walker; police officers David Houser, Keith Jobe, Brian 
McNeill, R. Hearron and Mike Overland; and unknown employees of the 
Emergency Medical Services at University Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Privett, a spokesman for the city of Lubbock, said city  
officials haven't seen the lawsuit ``and of course we cannot 
comment on something we haven't seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The medical center also had not been served with the suit Monday  
and does not comment on pending litigation, said spokeswoman 
Suzanne Evans. 
</P>
<P>
	The $30 million in damages include $2.5 million for each  
plaintiff for past and future loss of wages, medical expenses, pain 
and mental anguish, plus punitive damages of $7.5 million for each 
plaintiff. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs also want all the defendants to apologize, the  
court to supervise the police department and the department to 
adopt policies for hiring and promoting officers that the court 
deems nondiscriminatory. The department has hired fewer than 20 
blacks over the past 30 years, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs also want the creation of a program for the  
proper training and discipline of Lubbock police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bibbses and Kelso were detained Nov. 16 outside a Lubbock  
Wal-Mart by officers responding to a customer's complaint that 
someone tried to scam her. The three were handcuffed and held for 
several hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Police studied security tapes from the store, determined that  
the Bibbses and Kelso had no contact with the shopper and said no 
charges would be filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Lubbock Mayor Windy Sitton later flew to Hampton to apologize  
for the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hampton basketball team was in Lubbock for a Nov. 17 game  
against Texas Tech. The game was canceled.

<HEADLINE> Stars Shorthanded As Playoffs Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Stanley Cup playoffs begin Wednesday, and the Dallas Stars  
already are looking several games ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The top-ranked Stars, who open against Edmonton, will be without  
All-Star defenseman Derian Hatcher for the first five games of the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatcher is serving a suspension for attacking Phoenix forward  
Jeremy Roenick on April 14. Hatcher left his feet to hit Roenick, 
fracturing his jaw and keeping the Coyotes' leading scorer from the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas defenseman missed the last two games of the regular  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas-Edmonton game is one of four Wednesday night. The  
others are: Anaheim at Detroit, San Jose at Colorado and Buffalo at 
Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, the Stars do not need Hatcher to beat the Oilers. They  
were 3-0-1 against Edmonton during the season and won their second 
straight Presidents' Trophy with the NHL's best record. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, coach Ken Hitchcock is worried.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to play better offensive hockey,'' he  
said. ``Hopefully, we get a good offensive push from a couple of 
our key lines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock spoke following Sunday's season-ending 2-1 loss to  
Colorado. The Stars are No. 8 in scoring in the NHL, but first in 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Goaltenders Ed Belfour and Roman Turek gave up only 168 goals in  
82 games between them, giving Dallas the Jennings Trophy (fewest 
goals yielded) for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to feel confident when you win the Jennings and the  
Presidents' Trophy,'' forward Mike Keane said. ``We had a good 
year, but now it's a whole different season. We're ready to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday night, it's Pittsburgh at New Jersey, Boston at  
Carolina, Philadelphia at Toronto and St. Louis at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	A look at Wednesday's other openers:  
</P>
<P>
                         *Anaheim at Detroit    	
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings hope to win their third straight Stanley Cup,  
which would make them a rare bird. No team has won as many as three 
in row since the New York Islanders in 1980-83. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our job is to go out and play as physical as possible on those  
guys as we can,'' forward Kris Draper said of the Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mighty Ducks feature one of the most potent lines in the  
league with Teemu Selanne and Paul Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit won the season series 3-1.  
</P>
<P>
                        *San Jose at Colorado    	
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche took the season series, 3-1, and have been on a  
tear in the second half of the season after starting slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks, 21st in the league in scoring, simply can't match  
the firepower of the Avalanche. More bad news for the Sharks: 
Colorado goalie Patrick Roy has been at the top of his game 
lately. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Buffalo at Ottawa    	
</P>
<P>
	They played five overtime games this season, with the Senators  
holding a 1-0-4 edge. It will again be a battle of goalies: 
Buffalo's Dominik Hasek vs. Tugnutt or Damian Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Ottawa, you're dealing with a team that has great team  
speed,'' Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said. ``They've had one heck of a 
year. Both their goaltenders have had a heck of a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senators finished second in the Eastern Conference.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Dole Supports Ground Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole, a Republican presidential  
hopeful fresh from her trip to Macedonia, said Monday that U.S.-led 
NATO ground troops should be ``pre-positioned in the theater'' and 
prepared to attack if necessary to end the purge of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a war,'' she said in a telephone interview with The  
Associated Press. ``We've got to win it, and win it absolutely.'' 
If military leaders recommend a ground war, ``So be it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former American Red Cross president, a veteran of scores of  
humanitarian crises, said she was moved by her visit to refugee 
camps and the harrowing stories of Serbian attacks in Kosovo. 
``I've seen a lot of things that will haunt me forever,'' said Mrs. 
Dole, who returned to Washington late Sunday. ``This is among the 
worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole and a crowded field of attention-starved GOP  
presidential candidates are eager to find a voice in the debate 
over the Yugoslavia conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, urged the Clinton administration  
Friday to pursue mediation with Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic rather than escalate the conflict. With her remarks, Mrs. 
Dole staked out a hard-line stance with fellow GOP hopeful Sen. 
John McCain of Arizona, a former prisoner of war who has said for 
weeks that the United States must do whatever necessary to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush, early front-runner for the  
nomination, has been more reticent on the subject, to the point 
that he has been criticized. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain plans to introduce Senate legislation Tuesday that would  
ask President Clinton to use necessary force to bring the conflict 
to a conclusion. He has criticized Clinton for ruling out the use 
of ground troops, a stance Mrs. Dole echoed. 
</P>
<P>
	``With NATO meeting (in Washington) this week, the United States  
should demand military and humanitarian victories by calling for 
the pre-positioning of ground forces,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Would she support a ground war?  
</P>
<P>
	``If NATO commanders and the Joint Chiefs of Staff say ground  
troops, I say absolutely. I'd follow what they think is necessary. 
If that's ground troops, so be it,'' Mrs. Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should be pre-positioned in the theater so they'd be  
ready,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how many U.S. troops she thought might be killed in a  
ground war, Mrs. Dole said, ``That's not something I'm in position 
to know. All I know is we have to win this war absolutely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also called for more intense airstrikes, suggesting that the  
Clinton administration has hampered Pentagon planners. ``I think 
the political leaders have defined what we're doing, not the 
military leaders,'' she said. ``Let the military leaders do their 
jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, wife of 1996 presidential nominee Bob Dole, said  
Milosevic should be branded a war criminal and eventually brought 
to justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, what we have to do is drive him and his forces out  
of the area,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Roba Wins Third Straight in Boston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Fatuma Roba was tiring as she headed up a hill  
toward the end of the Boston Marathon. Then some friends handed her 
a red, yellow and green sweatband -- the color of the Ethiopian 
flag. 
</P>
<P>
	``The flag they gave me in the hilly area gave me a boost, and I  
started running at a faster pace,'' said the 27-year-old Ethiopian, 
who won her third Boston Marathon on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	After running even with Catherine Ndereba for a good part of the  
race, Roba pulled ahead near the three-fourths mark. While becoming 
just the second woman to win the event three times in a row, she 
posted the fourth-best time in race history -- 2 hours, 23 minutes, 
25 seconds -- for her gender. 
</P>
<P>
	Roba, the 1996 Olympic marathon champion, now holds the third-  
and fourth-fastest times for the Boston Marathon. She is bested 
only by Joan Benoit Samuelson, who finished in 2:21:43 in 1983, and 
by Uta Pippig, who ran it in 2:21:45 in 1994. Pippig is the only 
other woman to win three times in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Jennings, the 38-year-old runner with 10 USA Outdoor  
Championships and an Olympic bronze medal under her belt, outpaced 
all of her American competitors, coming in 12th overall with a time 
of 2:38:37. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only her second marathon. In 1978, when she was just a  
high school senior at the Bromfield School in Harvard, Jennings 
came in third as an unofficial entrant. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Jennings beat the time of 2:47 she set 21 years ago,  
perhaps starting a new phase of her 23-year running career as a 
marathoner. 
</P>
<P>
	She said after the race that she was happy she qualified for the  
Olympic trials by coming in under 2:42. 
</P>
<P>
	Her coach, John Babington, said she ran too fast early on.  
</P>
<P>
	``She was suffering, but she didn't break down completely,''  
Babington said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennings said she didn't expect to tire quite so early. She ran  
even with the leaders for the first half of the 26.2-mile race and 
then faded over the next few miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The race was a blur, she said, except for the cheering of the  
fans who lined the entire route from Hopkinton to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was absolutely carried along by the fans,'' said the  
Newmarket, N.H., resident. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of the race, 20-year-old Sun Yingje of China  
ran well ahead of the pack at a very fast pace, nearly a minute 
ahead of her closest pursuer. 
</P>
<P>
	Roba and Ndereba, 20, of Kenya, ran behind Sun until they caught  
her at about 12 1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Roba later said she didn't even notice Sun until the middle of  
the race. 
</P>
<P>
	For the next four miles, the two African women were locked in a  
stride-for-stride battle until Roba began to open up against 
Ndereba. 
</P>
<P>
	Ndereba, making her marathon debut, fell behind 32-year-old  
Franziska Rochat-Moser at the three-quarter mark and finished 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Rochat-Moser also is a lawyer who owns a gourmet restaurant in  
her hometown of Crissier, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Yukio Arimori, 32, finished third. She is a heroine in her  
native Japan for her second-place finish in the 1992 Olympic 
marathon and third at the 1996 Atlanta Games.

<HEADLINE> US Airways Top Airline in Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a complete turnaround, US Airways placed  
first in a survey of U.S. airline quality released Monday, one year 
after it finished dead last. 
</P>
<P>
	The change was an exception in a year that continued to see a  
decline in airline quality, as measured by two university 
professors who looked at on-time performance, denied boardings, 
mishandled luggage and passenger complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``Generally, airlines do a good job of getting you from point A  
to point B on time and with your luggage,'' Dean Headley, associate 
professor of marketing at Wichita State University in Kansas, said 
in a statement. ``Evidently, the consumer is finding fault in the 
manner in which these services are being delivered. The airlines 
seem to be taking the attitude, `We get you there safely with your 
belongings. What else do you want?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Passenger dissatisfaction with such treatment has fueled a spate  
of legislative proposals aimed at securing new privileges for 
airline passengers. The congressional measures collectively have 
been dubbed an airline passenger's ``Bill of Rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Headley in the study was Brent Bowen, director of the  
Aviation Institute at the University of Nebraska. Their index used 
15 criteria for ranking airline quality. The information is drawn 
from government reports and other data readily available and deemed 
relevant to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	In the pair's 1997 survey, Southwest Airlines placed first and  
US Airways was last among the 10 major carriers, defined by the 
Transportation Department as airlines with operating revenue of $1 
billion or more per year. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Southwest dropped to fifth and US Airways vaulted to  
the top of the pack. Propelling US Airways were relatively low 
claims of denied boardings -- when a ticketed passenger is denied a 
seat on a full aircraft -- and mishandled bags. 
</P>
<P>
	The full ranking was: US Airways, Continental Airlines, American  
Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, America West 
Airlines, TWA, Alaska Airlines, Northwest Airlines and United 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	United had the worst baggage handling record of all the majors,  
according to the survey.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Cut Runner Terry Allen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Terry Allen, who holds Washington's  
single-season rushing record, was released Monday by the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	The move had been long expected. After his 1,353-yard season  
three years ago, the 31-year-old Allen was sidelined several times 
with injuries. He missed six games last year with a sprained ankle, 
although he still led the team in rushing with 700 yards on 148 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the development of young backs Stephen Davis and  
Skip Hicks made him expendable. By cutting him, the Redskins are 
spared from paying the last two years of the four-year, 
$14.8-million contract Allen signed after his record-breaking 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen's release is part of an overall youth movement pursued by  
the Redskins this off-season. On Saturday, they released 
33-year-old cornerback Cris Dishman. Linebacker Marvcus Patton and 
safety Stanley Richard have been allowed to leave through free 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins signed running back Leroy Collins, an undrafted  
free agent from Louisville. He is the first of several players not 
selected in the weekend's NFL draft whom the Redskins will sign 
this week before the start of spring minicamp Friday.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Sits Out Second Straight Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds has a bone spur in his left  
elbow and was out of the lineup for the second straight day as the 
San Francisco Giants played the Florida Marlins on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds, batting .366 with four home runs and 12 RBIs, was seeking  
a second opinion from San Jose Sharks physician Dr. Art Ting. 
Results of those tests were expected Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star left fielder's status remained day-to-day.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no determination until we know what's wrong,'' Giants  
manager Dusty Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds had an MRI on Monday that revealed the spur. He missed  
Sunday's game against the Arizona Diamondbacks with soreness. 
</P>
<P>
	Stan Javier took Bonds' place in left field, and Ellis Burks  
assumed Bonds' No. 3 spot in the batting order. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you lose a superstar, sure it's going to be different,''  
Baker said. ``But you've got to do what you've got to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds, an eight-time All-Star, has been on the disabled list  
just once in his 14-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been speculation Bonds might have been injured during  
Friday's brawl with the Diamondbacks, during which Giants third 
baseman Charlie Hayes and Arizona pitcher Todd Stottlemyre got into 
a bench-clearing melee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me clear that up right now: Barry told me it was bothering  
him on Friday during batting practice,'' Baker said. ``That wasn't 
it at all, that's 20 years of throwing.''

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Probed for War Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With as many as 100,000 ethnic Albanian men  
unaccounted for, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is being 
investigated as a war crimes suspect, says the U.S. ambassador for 
war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	David Scheffer said Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor at the U.N.  
war crimes tribunal in the Netherlands, told Milosevic in a letter 
that the investigation is due to his position as head of a state 
alleged to be committing war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Scheffer agreed with the investigation during an appearance on  
``Fox News Sunday.'' Asked if Milosevic is a war criminal, he said 
the Yugoslav president ``certainly (is) a prime target for 
investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for a NATO claim that ethnic Albanian refugees had reported  
3,200 deaths at the hands of Serb security forces, he said: 
``That's a very low estimate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Based on unconfirmed refugee reports and other sources of  
information, Scheffer said: ``You're actually looking at the 
possibility of tens of thousands of Kosovars who not only are at 
risk, but also may actually have perished by this stage. ... We 
have upwards to about 100,000 men that we cannot account for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scheffer displayed side-by-side photographs of the west-central  
Kosovo ethnic Albanian town of Izbica that he said proved mass 
killings by Serbs. The photos depicted an area taken at different 
times. In one picture, up to 150 graves appeared where nothing had 
existed before. 
</P>
<P>
	Scheffer called it ``a classic example of ethnic cleansing.''  
</P>
<P>
	``The Serbs came in, torched the town and then proceeded with  
massacres of individual groups of Kosovars,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO released the photographs Saturday in Brussels, Belgium. On  
Sunday, the alliance said it has graphic evidence of 43 other mass 
gravesites, some dug by Kosovo Albanian prisoners forced by Serb 
troops to bury fellow ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees have spoken of ethnic Albanian men, largely those of  
fighting age, being separated from relatives before the families 
were forced to flee. ``We have no idea where those men are now,'' 
Scheffer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scheffer, the United States' first ambassador-at-large for war  
crimes, said the United States will provide prosecutor Arbour with 
``as much information as possible ... to support her 
investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Serbia is providing sanctuary to war crimes suspects  
already indicted for alleged atrocities during the Bosnian war of 
the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pressure is going to remain on Slobodan Milosevic until  
... anyone indicted on his territory is, in fact, transferred,'' 
Scheffer said. ``If there's any thought that Serbia will somehow 
join the new Europe or the international community until that is 
done, that's a false hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scheffer acknowledged that with dozens of wars under way,  
prosecuting all war criminals will be a huge task. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``One of the great challenges, I think, of the  
21st century is to ensure that there is individual accountability 
for the commission of these crimes. ... It's going to take a lot of 
hard work over the coming years to get a grip on this and to 
establish a principle of deterrence that, hopefully, 30, 40, 50 
years from now will begin to sink in.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Owners Visit Los Angeles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ed Roski, who has led the drive to bring pro  
football back to the Los Angeles Coliseum, says he won't stand in 
the way of a league auction of an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	Roski, a developer, holds exclusive rights to any NFL deal with  
the Coliseum. But those rights would be relinquished if he were 
reimbursed for his expenses -- capped at $5 million -- incurred while 
seeking the league's 32nd franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've told them (the NFL) all along that we're not going to  
stand in the way of football in LA,'' Roski said Monday. ``We would 
suggest a couple of things, local ownership, and reimburse us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean that Roski, whose group includes wealthy  
entrepreneur Eli Broad, would bow out as possible owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole purpose was to bring NFL football back to LA, and  
the Coliseum and we would like to be a bidder,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven NFL team owners are in town for a two-day visit and are  
expected to formally announce Tuesday that the Coliseum is the 
preferred site for the new team. 
</P>
<P>
	Remaining to be resolved would be the team's ownership.  
</P>
<P>
	``They (the NFL) didn't tell us until recently that there was  
going to be an auction for this, didn't tell (Robert) McNair and 
(Michael) Ovitz about the auction until recently,'' Roski said. 
``It's their prerogative. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're willing to do whatever they need.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Coliseum, which would be completely gutted inside and  
rebuilt, became the easy -- and lone viable -- LA choice after Ovitz 
bowed out of the Carson proposal last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's team owners obviously prefer competitive bidding  
for the deal, which could carry a final price tag as high as $1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Roski spearheaded the building of the new Staples Center  
downtown and also gave the New Coliseum proposal life. Broad, who 
could provide solid financial backing for an NFL team, joined the 
Coliseum efforts later. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL owners have seemed interested in having Ovitz involved in  
any deal with the Coliseum. NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue called 
the Hollywood deal-maker ``a visionary,'' and implied that the 
league could benefit from Ovitz's experience in the entertainment 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no guarantee that Los Angeles will even get a team. The  
owners, well aware that the area represents the nation's 
second-largest TV market, voted 29-2 at their meetings last month 
to spurn McNair's Houston bid and award the franchise to the Los 
Angeles area on a conditional basis. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, suburban Carson also was in the running for the  
team. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL gave Los Angeles until Sept. 15 to put together an  
ownership and stadium package that meets the league's approval. If 
a deal can't be reached, the new team, which would begin play in 
2002, probably will go to Houston.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 53 After 270-Point Gain / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials squandered a 270-point gain  
in heavy trading this afternoon as traders dumped technology shares 
and sent the Nasdaq composite index reeling. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the technology heavy Nasdaq composite  
was down 89.91 points, or by nearly 4 percent, at 2,394.13. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was up 53.36 at 10,547.25 as  
the final hour of trading began and flirting with a sixth 
consecutive closing high. But the Dow then turned to negative 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous record, 10,493.89, was set Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	It was a rough ride, with the Dow up as much as 271.85 after  
racing through the 10,500, 10,600 and 10,700 levels by early 
afternoon before selling picked up to cash in on the rally and as 
technology stocks plunged. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite was down 14.87 at 1,304.13.  
</P>
<P>
	Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at Everen Securities  
in Chicago, said tech stocks had gone up for a long time ``without 
any particular relationship to value, and now they being sold 
aggressively, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning early last week, investors have been swapping tech  
shares for industrial names that have been out of favor for a long 
time, and the shift has pushed the Dow to new heights. But even a 
string of six straight records would be far from the record of 12 
set in early 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Today the Dow was led higher by such deeply cyclical names as  
International paper, up 3/4 at 55 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were taking body blows. Dow member IBM was  
down 3 7/16 at 166 15/16. AOL had plunged 18 5/8 to 121 1/8 in leading 
volume on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Hyman, senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum,  
explained the pullback in the Dow this afternoon by saying that the 
market ``could only run so far on the backs of'' the newly favored 
industrial stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The industrial stocks are cheap relative to the previously  
high-flying technology sectors, but they can't play the role of 
long-term leaders because they represent a much smaller portion of 
the market than technology shares do, Hyman said. 
</P>
<P>
	'' At some point in time, the tech stocks have to participate  
again if we're going to get a major rally here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq was down 1/2 at 23 1/8, after giving up earlier gains. The  
computer maker, which stunned Wall Street with dismal earnings 
projections earlier this month, disclosed on Sunday that chief 
executive Eckhard Pfeiffer had been ousted and its chief financial 
officer was leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong earnings reports were pushing some stocks higher. Dow  
member Citigroup was up 2 1/16 at 73 11/16, while BankAmerica was 
up 3/4 at 73 3/4, both on earnings reports that surpassed analysts' 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a better than 2 to 1  
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was very heavy at 
982.34 million shares at late afternoon, up from Friday's hectic 
pace.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Called Racist for Essay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- He's been called a racist, shunned by  
fellow professors and threatened for his beliefs. But psychologist 
Glayde Whitney says his theory must be heard. 
</P>
<P>
	The professor at Florida State University has long believed that  
blacks are generally less intelligent than whites. He has expressed 
his views in academic papers but it wasn't until he wrote the 
foreword for a book by a former Ku Klux Klan leader that people on 
campus seemed to notice. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitney's beliefs have sparked a debate about racism and free  
speech that's engaged hundreds of students and faculty. He has been 
the target of biting editorials statewide as well as phone calls 
that both attack him and praise him. 
</P>
<P>
	In his new book, ``My Awakening,'' David Duke raises the idea of  
a separate homeland for blacks -- a concept with which Whitney 
disagrees but says it's based on ``good science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike environmental psychologists who believe intelligence has  
more to do with living conditions than race, Whitney, 59, contends 
most blacks are destined to fail. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it a nice idea to have a society where you have a lot of  
mentally not very smart people, and you tell them as children that 
they can all be astronauts or neurosurgeons if they want to be, and 
it's just not true?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	The professor advocates separate schools for advanced and  
remedial students and says blacks would make up ``easily less than 
2 percent'' of the upper-level classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 100 genetic biologists helped guide Duke in his research  
for his book, but when it came time to compile an acknowledgments 
page, most of them ran for cover, Whitney said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm such a nonpolitical, naive person, that just seemed silly  
to me,'' he said. ``I thought, if you support the science as decent 
stuff, why be afraid to say it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Whitney wrote an admiring -- almost gushy -- foreword. In it,  
he calls Duke a ``seeker of truth'' not unlike many of history's 
great thinkers including Socrates and Isaac Newton. 
</P>
<P>
	``He challenges the sacred cows of modern life, and he does so  
with intelligence and emotion,'' Whitney wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke said he feels the same about Whitney.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's certainly one of the giants in this science,'' said Duke,  
a Louisiana state legislator and former Klan grand wizard who is 
seeking the congressional seat once occupied by would-be House 
Speaker Bob Livingston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's very unjust what's occurring,'' Duke said. ``He's  
obviously a man with a lot of courage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As in Duke's book title, what's occurring at the Tallahassee  
campus is an awakening to a litany of social and political 
questions that have long dwelled below the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions like: When, if ever, does educational free speech go  
too far? Is racism rooted in belief or action? And, what do you do 
about a tenured professor who, rightly or wrongly, has been tagged 
a racist? 
</P>
<P>
	Student groups have given vocal answers at protests, and last  
week, those questions were debated at a town meeting attended by 
about 300 students and faculty. 
</P>
<P>
	There, Florida State President Sandy D'Alemberte concluded this  
episode may be a perfect example of the power of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find that opinion obnoxious; I find it entirely wrong,''  
D'Alemberte told the crowd. ``But, if there's any place in our 
society that deserves to have robust free speech, it's the 
university.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State has made dramatic strides in recent years to  
welcome minorities to campus and some faculty members fear 
Whitney's recent publicity may tarnish that reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Black Studies Professor William Jones said at the forum that  
academic freedom should be no haven for ``those who make a learning 
environment hostile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even harsher words have come from students, but not necessarily  
the students in Whitney's upper-level history and systems course. 
</P>
<P>
	Four students declined to give their names Thursday as they  
entered the class, but all four said Whitney was a fair teacher who 
never tried to indoctrinate them. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Contreras, who heads the university's psychology  
department, said there's been no faculty revolt, even though the 
department's other professors have publicly separated their beliefs 
from Whitney's. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's upset some people, but surprisingly, it hasn't fractured  
our department as well as I can tell,'' Contreras said. ``People 
are not slamming doors or refusing to speak to Professor Whitney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Whitney, a University of Minnesota graduate who has been at  
Florida State for 30 years, continues to teach, with few 
restrictions or fear of losing his job. 
</P>
<P>
	The university did step in to make sure psychology students have  
the option of taking another professor for the required class 
Whitney teaches. At one time, he was the only instructor available.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Genes, Cardiac Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Men who lose a parent to sudden cardiac death are  
twice as likely as other men to meet the same fate, a new study 
found. And men whose parents both die from sudden heart death face 
a ninefold risk of dying the same way, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, believed to be first showing that sudden cardiac  
death runs in families, could help identify unsuspecting people at 
high risk for the condition. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 481,000 heart attacks occur each year, and about half  
of those -- 250,000 -- are sudden deaths, which occur within an hour 
of the onset of symptoms. The heart stops working abruptly in a 
person who may or may not have been diagnosed with heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	A typical heart attack, by contrast, usually occurs when an  
artery serving the heart muscle is blocked. The heart continues to 
beat and victims usually survive even if care is delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Physicians generally ask patients whether they have a family  
history of heart attacks,'' noted French cardiologist Dr. Xavier 
Jouven, lead author of the study published Tuesday in Circulation, 
a journal of the heart association. ``It would now be useful to ask 
patients about a possible parental history of sudden death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers followed 7,079 middle-aged men who worked for the  
city of Paris. The men were studied for an average of 23 years. Of 
the 118 men who died of sudden cardiac death, 22, or 18.6 percent, 
had a parent who had died the same way. 
</P>
<P>
	When the researchers controlled for other risk factors like age,  
blood pressure and tobacco use, the risk of sudden death among men 
whose mother or father had experienced sudden death was almost 
double that of men whose parents did not suffer sudden death. Men 
with two parents who suffered sudden death had a risk nine times 
higher than those whose parents did not suffer sudden death. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would consider this a significant contribution to the  
literature on our understanding of sudden cardiac death,'' said Dr. 
Richard L. Page, associate professor of internal medicine at 
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. He was 
not involved in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the next step is to figure out what the abnormality is so  
we can better establish which patients are at greatest risk.''

<HEADLINE> Unions Giving More Support to GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Labor union leaders -- the Democrats' steadfast  
allies and dependable source of campaign cash -- are increasingly 
consorting with Republicans, even writing them fat checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the 20 labor unions that gave the most to  
congressional candidates for last year's elections increased their 
contributions to Republicans by almost one-third -- to a total of 
$2.1 million -- over the 1996 cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Which is not to say the unions are abandoning their old friends:  
The same political action committees contributed far more, $27.2 
million, to Democrats, a review of disclosure reports found. 
</P>
<P>
	But political reality is forcing organized labor to reach out to  
moderates in the party that controls Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, the National Education Association has given  
$55,000 in unregulated ``soft money'' and PAC contributions to 
national Republican Party committees and $5,000 to Rep. Johnny 
Isakson, the Georgia Republican elected to complete the 
congressional term of former Speaker Newt Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making a concerted effort to do our politics based on  
the issue and not based on the party,'' said Mary Elizabeth 
Teasley, the NEA's director of government relations. ``We 
contribute based on how they measure up on the issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NEA's political action committee still overwhelmingly favors  
Democrats over Republicans, some of whom have sought to abolish the 
U.S. Department of Education and to use tax dollars for private 
schools. But the ratio is shifting. 
</P>
<P>
	The NEA's PAC gave $97,850 to Republicans candidates in last  
year's races -- eight times its $11,850 in contributions to GOP 
candidates for the previous election. 
</P>
<P>
	The hefty $1.8 million the NEA gave Democrats for 1998's races  
was a drop from the $2.3 million it gave Democrats for the 1996 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Labor realized after '96 that Republicans were here to stay,''  
said Rep. Peter King of New York, a pro-union Republican. ``They 
would have to deal with Republicans. One of the ways is by 
attending Republican events and socializing with Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It also helps to contribute rather than being marked as the  
enemy,'' King said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Republicans won control of Congress in 1994, the 20  
unions analyzed by The Associated Press gave only $881,630 to 
Republican candidates over the 1993-1994 election cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor unions remain dedicated to helping Democrats wrest control  
of the House from the GOP in 2000, pledging not only PAC 
contributions but millions of dollars for issue advertising. Giving 
a little more to the Republicans, especially to moderates, is a way 
to hedge their bets and move toward a truce. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO's political director, Steve Rosenthal, made a  
conciliatory move recently, assuring Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, 
chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, that 
unions would support pro-labor Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last couple of years, we have tried hard to find  
those Republicans who are willing to take hard stands, usually 
against the party leadership, in support of issues that really 
matter to working people,'' Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
	But a skeptical NRCC Executive Director Scott Hatch said he was  
waiting to see ``if the union bosses back up their rhetoric.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NRCC officials also met with International Brotherhood of  
Teamsters representatives. Mike Mathis, the Teamsters' director of 
government affairs, said he was working to arrange a meeting 
between new union President James P. Hoffa and House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the union to fully represent our membership, we need to  
have our doors open to politicians who will support working 
families regardless of which party they're in,'' Mathis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters PAC boosted its Republican giving to $151,800 for  
last year's races, up from $100,810 for the 1996 election. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee gave 13 times that amount to Democrats: $2  
million. But that was down from $2.4 million Democratic candidates 
received in 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic National Committee spokesman Rick Hess said unions  
overwhelmingly favor his party because of its lawmakers' stands on 
issues including minimum wage, Medicare and Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not concerned that some members of the Republican Party  
are starting to moderate their anti-union concerns,'' Hess said. 
``We are concerned that the party that currently controls Congress 
has such a terrible labor record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King said contributions to Republicans help him argue against  
union-bashing within the House GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's wrong for Republicans to write off labor the way we  
started doing in '94,'' King said. ``And it's just as wrong for 
labor to write off Republicans.''

	NATO Targets Serb Cities  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- On the 27th night of allied bombing,  
Yugoslavian TV reported that 10 missiles slammed late Monday into 
targets around Nis, a major military garrison city in southern 
Serbia. A Belgrade TV station said a military barracks was hit 
along with a tobacco factory, setting off a huge fire. Several 
other missiles struck Cacak, an industrial town 60 miles south of 
Belgrade, which has been attacked repeatedly since the air campaign 
began. Tanjug, the official Yugoslav news agency, reported that 
Rep. James Saxton, R-N.J., was on a mission to Belgrade and had 
spoken to the Yugoslav foreign minister.

</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO showed dramatic aerial footage  
narrated by a U.S. Air Force general to explain how allied planes 
may have hit civilians during an airstrike in southwestern Kosovo. 
Despite Brig. Gen. Dan Leaf's detailed analysis and videotape of 
exploding vehicles, NATO said it may never know exactly what 
happened in raids on convoys last week. The attack has dogged 
NATO's air campaign for five days, but allied warplanes have 
continued airstrikes, striking today a government building in 
Serbia's second-largest city and a television transmitter in 
Kosovo.

	Mrs. Dole Supports Ground Troops  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole, a Republican presidential  
hopeful fresh from her trip to Macedonia, said today that U.S.-led 
NATO ground troops should be ``pre-positioned in the theater'' and 
prepared to attack if necessary to end the purge of Kosovo. The 
former American Red Cross president said she was moved by her visit 
to refugee camps and by the harrowing stories of Serbian attacks in 
Kosovo. Mrs. Dole and a crowded field of GOP presidential 
candidates are eager to find a voice in the debate over the 
Yugoslavia conflict.

Macedonia ``as soon as I'm given the green light'' by humanitarian

Guiliani.

	MIAMI (AP) -- Smoke turned daylight to darkness today near a fire  
in the Everglades that has charred about 120,000 acres, prompting 
authorities to warn some people with respiratory problems. In 
communities immediately east of the fire -- about 25 miles northwest 
of Miami -- people with asthma, bronchitis and emphysema were urged 
to stay indoors if possible. The smoke from the blaze also 
blanketed south Florida's main east-west highway, Interstate 75,

Mercedes-Benz side air bags could seriously injure a young child 
leaning against a door pressing his face against the window or 
leaning out the window. The National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration convened a public meeting today to encourage 
automakers voluntarily to develop common testing procedures for 
side air bags after conducting more tests of its own. Automakers

<HEADLINE> Senate Will Honor Rosa Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate voted unanimously today to award  
Rosa Parks a Congressional Gold Medal, four decades after her 
refusal to surrender her bus seat to a white man helped spark the 
civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators approved the measure 86-0, and House passage was  
expected on Tuesday. President Clinton is certain to sign the 
legislation, which would bestow Congress' highest civilian award on 
the 86-year-old civil rights pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1955, Parks refused to give up her front seat on a bus in  
Montgomery, Ala. Her arrest led to a yearlong boycott of the city's 
buses by blacks, which lasted until the Supreme Court ruled the 
city's bus segregation law unconstitutional and the law was 
changed. That boycott was led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., 
who at the time was a local minister. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her quiet dignity ignited the most significant social movement  
in the history of the United States,'' said the bill authorizing 
the medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure's sponsors include Sens. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich.;  
Carl Levin, D-Mich.; and Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. Parks moved to 
Detroit in 1957.

<HEADLINE> Asian Economies Starting To Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Asia's crisis-hit economies are starting to  
rebound but the recovery is fragile and clouded with uncertainties, 
the Asian Development Bank said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The outlook for 1999 depends on how governments carry out  
reforms to combat the causes of the turmoil and the mood of world 
financial markets, the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said an unexpected slowdown in the United States or Europe  
and continuing stagnation in Japan, the region's economic 
locomotive, could stall recovery by reducing the demand for 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the financial crisis still reverberates throughout  
the region, we are seeing distinct signs that this sharp 
contraction may be bottoming out,'' bank Vice President Peter 
Sullivan said, presenting the bank's annual ``Asian Development 
Outlook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kicking off the spring meetings of the International Monetary  
Fund and the World Bank, the IMF will present its ``World Economic 
Outlook'' on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the Asian Development Bank, a regional development  
bank based in Manila, Philippines, says growth in the developing 
economies of East and Southeast Asia, excluding China, was the 
lowest since World War II, averaging more than negative 7 percent. 
Only Taiwan weathered the storm with little damage. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1999, Sullivan said, the pace of recovery will vary, but the  
most dramatic turnaround is expected in Korea, which may record 2 
percent growth, compared with a negative 5.5 percent for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	China, which rode out the crisis despite a slight decline in  
exports, will see growth slow to around 7 percent. India, Asia's 
other giant, which was not affected by the crisis, will continue to 
grow at last year's rate of nearly 6 percent if it can avoid 
political turbulence, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Southeast Asia's more developed countries, the Philippines  
and Malaysia are most likely to grow in 1999, although at modest 
rates, the bank said. In Thailand, where the crisis began 21 months 
ago, success depends implementing financial and corporate sector 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank expects average growth for developing Asia to increase  
from 2.6 percent in 1998 to 4.4 percent this year and reach 5.1 
percent in 2000. Average inflation should moderate from 6.5 percent 
to about 4 percent in 1999 as the shock of the late 1997 currency 
depreciations dies out. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we would love to say that the recovery is secure,''  
Sullivan said, ``there are clearly risks to our forecast,'' among 
them continued poor performance in the banking sector. Asian banks 
have been plagued by bad loans and bank failures. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia will continue to have the group's most uncertain  
prospects as its economy tries to fight back from the ``verge of 
total collapse,'' the bank said. Until the results of the June 
presidential elections are known, Sullivan said, it is hard to 
predict when Indonesia will see growth resume. 
</P>
<P>
	The unpredictability of financial flows into and within the  
region is also a source of uncertainty, the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Decisions in Brief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Supreme Court took the following actions Monday:  
</P>
<P>
	--Agreed to decide whether people convicted of a crime have a  
constitutional right to refuse the help of lawyers and represent 
themselves on appeal. Salvador Martinez says California courts 
wrongly refused to let him serve as his lawyer in appealing an 
embezzlement conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	--Agreed to decide whether people can avoid using inherited money  
to pay overdue federal taxes by disclaiming their rights to the 
inheritance. An Arkansas man says his disclaimer under state law 
meant he never had an interest in his mother's estate to which the 
government could attach a lien. 
</P>
<P>
	--Heard arguments in a Colorado case in which the justices must  
decide whether government ownership of the coal located on an 
Indian reservation includes ownership of the methane gas found with 
the coal. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allowed two women to sue Volusia County, Fla., under the  
federal Endangered Species Act trying to force the county to do 
more to protect endangered and threatened sea turtles. The county 
had argued it could not be sued for allegedly doing a bad job of 
regulating private citizens' conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	--Refused to kill a lawsuit by a New York man that accuses the  
federal government of letting zoos and research facilities keep 
chimpanzees and other primates in inhumane conditions. A medical 
research group had argued that the man could not sue on his claim 
that seeing the animals in those conditions caused him emotional 
distress.

<HEADLINE> Linux Guru, Gates Star at Comdex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Microsoft's Windows might dominate the operating  
system wars right now, but you wouldn't know it from the enthusiasm 
surrounding upstart Linux. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day when Microsoft chairman Bill Gates was proudly  
introducing Windows 2000 at the Comdex computer conference, scores 
of techies instead focused Linus Torvalds, who developed the Linux 
operating system as a student in Finland in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pleeeeeeeease, Linus, will you sign this?'' pleaded Margaret  
Hadam, a 20-year-old Loyola University student, jamming a program 
guide in Torvalds face. 
</P>
<P>
	Linux is a version of the Unix operating system used by  
businesses to run computer networks and Internet sites. Linux can 
be downloaded for free off the Web; commercial versions with 
additional features can be bought at retail stores for as little as 
$30. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hadam and others praise Linux because its source code -- the  
programming language that makes Linux run -- is also freely 
available, allowing programmers to personalize it to suit their 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Torvalds said his system is gaining popularity because it gives  
people what they want. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't get to this point because of the hype,'' Torvalds  
said. ``It got here because it does what people want it to do. 
Let's not forget that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he also wants to provide computer users with an option  
to Windows, used to run roughly 90 percent of the world's personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Linux's use in business computers is a tiny fraction of  
more established Unix systems and Windows NT, and the software 
rarely appears on desktop computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Windows 2000, the other operating system on center  
stage Monday, was debuted by Gates in a presentation that included 
techno music and tongue-in-cheek videos. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has high hopes for Windows 2000, the latest generation  
of the Windows NT business-oriented operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials say the latest test version of Windows 2000  
will be distributed to companies nationwide by next month and be on 
the market by the end of the year. Improvements include easier ways 
for company employees to transfer computer documents into laptops 
to take on the road, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates also showed his sense of humor by showing a clip of last  
year's embarrassing computer crash during the debut of Windows 98. 
In it, his assistant Chris Cappesello looked unpleasantly surprised 
when a blue ``error'' screen popped up for all the world to see. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people have asked me in the last year, 'What happened  
to that guy?' '' Gates told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Cappesello then walked onto the stage Monday to the tune of ``I  
Will Survive'' and successfully orchestrated a demonstration of 
Windows 2000 as well as other new Microsoft products, including a 
new computer mouse that has no dust-prone moving parts underneath 
and can operated on most surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft employees also demonstrated Windows-based computers'  
ability to receive images and data by infrared light, rather than a 
hardwire connection -- an option that brought ``oohs'' from the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone was impressed, however. ``Microsoft does a really,  
really good job of selling,'' said Mike Ho, a student at 
Northwestern University who attended Gates' speech. ``But a lot of 
the things from today I've already seen from other companies, like 
Apple.''

<HEADLINE> FCC Eyes Licenses for Radio Pirates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- For five years Stephen Dunifer was a radio  
pirate, pounding the airwaves in Berkeley, Calif., with garage rock 
music, political documentaries and programs by homeless people. 
Then the government's airwaves police nabbed him, and Dunifer's 
50-watt FM station went silent. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunifer, 47, was operating ``Free Radio Berkeley'' without a  
license from the Federal Communications Commission. He knew it was 
illegal but felt the community needed an alternative voice. ``It 
was a form of electronic civil disobedience,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a time when hundreds of radio stations nationwide try to  
operate without licenses -- and as technology makes it easier to set 
up a station -- the government is looking at ways to open the 
airwaves to more new voices. The FCC proposed in January issuing 
very low-power licenses to help churches, schools and other 
community groups get legally on the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans and the National Association of Broadcasters,  
meeting this week in Las Vegas, actively oppose the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very concerned that the FCC proposal may have the effect  
of legitimizing pirates,'' the NAB's president, Edward Fritts, said 
Monday. The FCC has not decided whether pirates who have refused to 
shut down would be eligible for the new licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the NAB believes the stations' signals could  
interfere with FM stations. Others fear that white-supremacists or 
other controversial groups could get low-power licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1997, the FCC has tracked down 430 pirate radio stations,  
ranging in power from 1 watt to 800 watts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of them are just the average citizen wanting to serve  
their community,'' said the FCC's top point man on the issue, 
Richard Lee. ``I was totally surprised. I expected -- I won't say 
militants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 75 percent of those 430 stations shut down  
voluntarily. But for the remaining 25 percent, the FCC had to 
obtain court orders that either prohibited the stations from 
broadcasting or allowed officials to confiscate equipment and force 
them off air. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 25 percent, the FCC found about six stations operating  
with equipment interfering with air traffic control communications 
at nearby airports. Those stations were shut down within hours of 
detection. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are trying to land a plane at an airport and the radio  
tower has interference from the pirated station, you are not going 
to be real happy about it,'' said FCC Commissioner Susan Ness. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunifer wouldn't voluntarily shut down after the FCC found his  
illegal station in 1993, which touched off a five-year legal battle 
that became a rallying point for the movement. Last June, the FCC 
obtained a federal court order that forced off the air his 
commercial-free, 24-hour station at 104.1 FM. Dunifer's appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the station -- without his involvement, Dunifer says --  
has been on and off the air since, with help from sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
	A 50-watt station like Dunifer's typically can reach listeners  
within a radius of about 2 1/2 miles, depending on the antenna's 
height and the terrain. Dunifer's station sometimes operated from 
different locations. On a good day its signal could reach a 
five-mile radius, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dunifer shuns the word ``pirate,'' preferring the term  
micropower broadcasters. ``The whole point is that the corporations 
that dominate the airwaves are the real pirates,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The broadcasters' group disagrees. They note that in return for  
using the public airwaves for free, licensed stations must abide by 
government rules including providing cheap air time to political 
candidates and not airing indecent material. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pirates have no rules,'' Fritts said.  
</P>
<P>
	The FCC does not have historical data to determine whether the  
number of pirate stations is growing. But it's clear that new 
technology has made it very easy to build a radio transmitter, the 
key component. 
</P>
<P>
	Those with little technical skill can even buy inexpensive radio  
kits. ``You're up within hours,'' Lee said. Dunifer has a Web site 
where he sells kits that enable people to build low-power stations 
for $285 to $595. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC proposal would create thousands of licensed, low-tech FM  
radio stations from 1 watt to 1,000 watts, after a roughly 20-year 
ban on such licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency wants any new low-power stations to meet the same  
standards as higher-power commercial FM broadcasters: To be 
licensed, such companies generally must show a desire to serve a 
particular area and must provide information about past criminal 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunifer believes that would still be too burdensome and  
expensive for the average radio enthusiast. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a way, we are better off being illegal,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> RFK Jr. Going Into Water Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says he's going  
into the bottled water business to protect tap water. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy has helped set up a company that will sell Keeper  
Springs Mountain Spring Water, which has the following message on 
its turquoise labels: ``Every American has the right to crystal 
clean drinking water from a public water supply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keeper Spring water, which comes from a spring in Saratoga  
Springs, goes on the market Tuesday in the New York area, with 
plans for it to gradually become available around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is to capture some of the $4 billion spent each year on  
bottled water. Kennedy will not take a salary, and he said any 
profits -- he's hoping for ``a couple of million dollars a year'' -- 
will go toward clean-water campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who drink bottled water are making a statement that  
they are turning their back on a public water supply,'' said 
Kennedy, son of the slain Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and an 
environmental law professor at Pace University in White Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	``It occurred to me that the best way to reach those people is  
on the label of a bottle of water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy said he's so adamant about his campaign that he won't  
drink Keeper Springs. ``I drink tap water,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Columbia Offers $6.6B for Gas Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Columbia Energy Group has offered $6.68  
billion in cash and stock for Consolidated Natural Gas Co., topping 
the $5.5 billion that Dominion Resources Inc. offered for CNG under 
a deal approved two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter Sunday to Pittsburgh-based CNG, Columbia Energy  
chairman and chief executive Oliver G. Richard III made an 
unsolicited offer of $70 a share for CNG stock -- $45.50 in cash and 
$24.50 in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer represents a 33 1/2 percent premium above CNG's closing  
share price Friday of $52.43 3/4 and a 21 percent premium above 
Dominion Resources' stock offer, Richard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard asked CNG chairman and CEO George A. Davidson Jr. for a  
response by May 3 to his request for formal merger talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter Applewhite, a spokesman for Dominion Resources, said the  
company believed its merger was a superior deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Dominion Resources today announced it was  
restructuring its Virginia Power and Dominion Energy divisions into 
a unit to handle power generating and another unit to handle 
transmission and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominion Generation will become responsible for the 80 fossil,  
nuclear and hydroelectric generating units Virginia Power owns in 
Virginia, West Virginia and North Carolina and the 24 generating 
facilities in which Dominion Energy has ownership or operating 
interests in five U.S. states, Argentina, Belize, Bolivia and Peru. 
It will also hold a generating plant Dominion Resources owns in the 
United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	A second subsidiary will retain the name Virginia Power and  
manage the utility's retail, customer service, transmission and 
distribution and operations functions. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization was approved late Friday by the Dominion  
Resources board of directors but was not announced until today 
after Columbia Energy's unsolicited offer to CNG. Dominion 
Resources' chairman, Thomas E. Capps, said the plans to merge with 
CNG helped create the perfect oppurtunity for the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Energy had offered $66 to $70 a share for CNG two days  
before the Dominion Resources deal was announced Feb. 22, according 
to Richard's letter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to believe a combination of our two companies  
would be an excellent financial and strategic fit,'' Richard wrote. 
``... We have adequate sources of financing and therefore our 
proposal is not subject to any financing conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dominion Resources-CNG deal would create a company serving  
nearly 4 million customers with $8.8 billion in annual revenue. 
When the merger was announced, CNG shares were at $55.18 3/4 and the 
deal was valued at $6.3 billion. But CNG and Dominion Resources 
shares have fallen since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday, shares of CNG rebounded 7 percent, or $3.56 1/4, to close  
at $56 on the New York Stock Exchange. Dominion rose $1.56 1/4, or 4 
percent, to close at $39.62 1/2. Shares of Columbia fell $1.50, or 3 
percent, to close at $46.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Energy, based in Herndon in the northern Virginia  
suburbs of Washington, had 1998 revenues of nearly $6.6 billion. 
Its natural gas business includes exploration and production, 
transmission, storage and distribution, as well as propane sales 
and electric power generation. It serves customers in 34 states and 
the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	CNG supplies natural gas to 1.9 million customers in Ohio,  
Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. It also owns 7,600 miles 
of gas pipelines in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, West 
Virginia and Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominion Resources, the parent company of electricity supplier  
Virginia Power, had $6 billion in revenues last year. It has 
operations in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Argentina, 
Belize, Bolivia and Peru.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Stock Down After CEO Ousted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. stock was retreating in  
afternoon trading after the company ousted its chief executive, 
Eckhard Pfeiffer, in a bid to turn around slumping profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfeiffer, who built Compaq into the world's largest personal  
computer maker, has struggled to maintain profits while PC prices 
are plunging. The company has also had difficulty integrating two 
acquisitions, Digital Equipment Corp. and Tandem Computers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been making the right decisions, but with the world  
moving at Internet speed we have to be quicker than we were,'' 
Compaq chairman Benjamin M. Rosen said of the decision this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq's stock gave up early gains by afternoon on the New York  
Stock Exchange, down 2 percent, or 56 1/4 cents a share at $23.06 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time in nine days Compaq delivered a piece of  
stunning news. On April 9, the company revealed that its 
first-quarter results -- due out Wednesday -- are expected to show a 
profit of 15 cents per share on revenue of $9.4 billion -- $600 
million lower than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfeiffer resigned Sunday, one day after the board of directors  
told him they wanted new leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is surprising is the decisiveness with which the board  
took action in such a short period of time,'' said US Bancorp Piper 
Jaffray Inc. analyst Ashkok Kumar, a vocal critic of Compaq's 
business model. 
</P>
<P>
	Earl Mason, Compaq's chief financial officer, also resigned  
Sunday. While the company called his move unrelated, the two 
departures will mean broad changes in Compaq's leadership as it 
copes with the biggest challenge since its founding in 1982 as an 
upstart to then-dominant IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major, major admission or realization that this  
management team is not cutting it,'' said Aaron Goldberg, chief 
analyst for Ziff-Davis Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Compaq, which traded as high as $51.25 earlier this  
year, dropped 22 percent on April 12, the first day of trading 
after the announcement. In recent days, Compaq has been flirting 
with its 52-week low of $22.93 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen says that there's no place to go but up for the sleeping  
giant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have re-energized this company before and, working  
together, we will do it again,'' Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Pfeiffer stuck to the positive. ``Compaq has  
come a long way since I joined the company in 1983,'' he said. ``We 
are a world leader in personal computing, enterprise computing and 
Internet applications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen said Mason was leaving because he was offered ``every  
CFO's dream: to be chief executive officer of a company.'' He 
didn't identify the company, other than to say that it was in a 
different industry. Compaq treasurer Ben Wells will take on Mason's 
duties on an interim basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfeiffer took over as CEO in October 1991 and also held the  
title of president. His belief in a computer run by a Microsoft 
Windows operating system and powered by an Intel microchip help 
solidify the ``Wintel'' platform as the dominant one in the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Compaq shipped 12.8 million computers worldwide to gain  
14 percent of the market, according to the research firm Dataquest 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	But Compaq has struggled to maintain profits in an environment  
in which prices are dropping fast and sales of personal computers 
for under $500 -- or even less -- are growing. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq sells computers through a traditional distribution  
structure that includes resellers, who take a share of the profits. 
This has placed it at a disadvantage against companies such as Dell 
Computer Co. and Gateway Inc., which sell directly to customers and 
allow them to create any kind of system they want. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq has faced difficulty emulating this model. Analysts said  
it has alienated its resellers who are apt to see Compaq as a 
potential sales rival and instead may focus on selling other 
companies' brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen indicated Compaq will continue to allow customers a choice  
in how they buy computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our feeling now is that we shouldn't dictate how a customer  
buys a computer, whether it's directly, through a value-added 
reseller or through the Internet,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen said Compaq is well-positioned as a major player on the  
Internet, but Goldberg said the company has done little to take 
advantage of the Net so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like the NFL draft: You have 31 guys based on potential,  
but haven't done anything yet. Compaq has tremendous potential but 
hasn't done anything yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq has also said it plans to boost the computer services it  
offers business customers as a way to shore up declining profits 
from computer sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to its woes, analysts say Compaq's purchase of Digital  
Equipment last year for $9 billion, has yet to pay off. Sales of 
Digital's minicomputers -- medium-sized corporate computing systems 
that are smaller than mainframes -- have disappointed Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Compaq has had its hands full swallowing Tandem  
Computers, which it bought in 1997. Tandem makes computer systems 
with technology that helps clusters of computers run together and 
continuously, overcoming such problems as power failures.

<HEADLINE> BellSouth To Invest $3.5B in Qwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- BellSouth, long-silent in the scramble of mergers  
and alliances reshaping the telephone industry, is speaking up with 
a $3.5 billion investment in a long-distance company that's 
building a national fiber-optic network. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Monday gives BellSouth a 10 percent stake in  
Qwest Communications International, a fast-growing, Denver-based 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Coordinated marketing efforts will begin now, but the real  
payoff for BellSouth depends on whether it finally wins state and 
federal clearance to enter long-distance market. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth and the other regional telephone monopolies can't  
offer long-distance to their customers until they convince 
regulators that they've opened their markets to competition for 
local calling service. 
</P>
<P>
	Until those conditions are satisfied, BellSouth and the other  
``Baby Bells'' are limited to 10 percent ownership in any 
long-distance company. 
</P>
<P>
	But once those hurdles are removed, BellSouth and Qwest would be  
free to package a comprehensive set of high-speed data, image and 
voice communications for business and residential customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest is completing an 18,500-mile fiber optic network serving  
more than 130 U.S. cities and has other high-capacity 
infrastructure projects under way. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth's primary service area is in Alabama, Florida,  
Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South 
Carolina and Tennessee. As a first step, it has applied to offer 
long distance in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	The link-up with Qwest follows a series of much larger deals in  
the telecommunications industry, including SBC Communications' 
planned acquisition of Ameritech and Bell Atlantic's agreement to 
purchase GTE. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, industry analysts and investors were pleased with the  
partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may look like a smaller move, but it has a very distinctly  
different flavor,'' said Phil Asmundson, a telecommunications 
partner with Deloitte Consulting. He said Qwest has been a ``very 
aggressive long-distance network builder,'' and the deal ``sets a 
platform'' for future growth for the two companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In Monday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, BellSouth  
rose 68 3/4 cents per share, or 1.7 percent, to $41.87 1/2. But in Nasdaq 
trading, Qwest finished unchanged at $82 a share, surrendering an 
early $10 gain amid a sharp downturn on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the rapid change occurring in the communications  
industry today, there is no doubt that together we have the 
potential to be an even more significant driving force,'' said 
Duane Ackerman, BellSouth's chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman expressed optimism Monday that his Atlanta-based  
company will gain permission sometime this year to offer 
long-distance service in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement with Qwest, BellSouth will pay $1.93 million  
in cash for roughly 20.3 million Qwest shares. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Qwest's principal stockholder, Anschutz Co., will  
sell 16.65 million of its shares to BellSouth for about $1.57 
billion. This will reduce Anschutz's stake in Qwest to about 39 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is expected to close by the end of May.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to local service, BellSouth provides wireless  
communications, digital television, and Internet and data services 
in 19 countries. Its primary service area 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest has more than 8,000 employees and 80 sales offices in  
North America, Europe and Mexico.

<HEADLINE> New York Will Fund Jewish Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani appears to have settled a  
dispute over funding for the Museum of Jewish Heritage, announcing 
that the city will pay $22 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months ago, Giuliani accused Gov. George Pataki of reneging  
on an agreement to match the city's $11 million contribution. 
Pataki insisted the state had only agreed to provide the land for 
the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Without fanfare, the mayor released a statement Sunday saying  
the city would fund the entire $22 million. Another $23 million 
needed for the expansion will be raised from private donors. 
</P>
<P>
	The 80,000-square-foot expansion will include a new wing that  
will house a theater, family history center, classrooms and special 
exhibition galleries.

	NATO Bombs Several Yugoslavia Sites  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) --Yugoslavia slammed shut the main  
crossing point for ethnic Albanian refugees fleeing Kosovo as NATO	
struck at a variety of sites on the 26th day of its air campaign.	
Allied airstrikes reportedly targeted a government building in	
Serbia's second-largest city and a television transmitter in	
Kosovo. The state-run Tanjug news agency reported four powerful	
detonations in Baric, site of a chemical plant 12 miles southwest	
of Belgrade. Meanwhile, refugee traffic from Kosovo into Albania,	
site of the main crossing point, Macedonia and Montenegro slowed to	
a trickle. The U.N. refugee agency said the Serbs apparently were	
turning back the refugees.

	Clinton Seeks Money for Conflict  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton asked Congress for $6  
billion in emergency money for the Kosovo conflict today, saying 
``there are literally lives hanging in the balance.'' The 
administration's spending package would cover both the U.S. share

refugees ``as soon as I'm given the green light to go.'' She made 
the remarks after meeting with the heads of several private

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A fierce selloff in technology shares this

a 270-point gain in the Dow Jones industrials. The Nasdaq closed 
down 138.19 points at 2,345.85. The only time the index had a 
steeper one-day point drop was the 140.43-point drop on Aug. 31,

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal law aimed at limiting e-mail smut

The court's unanimous decision rejected ApolloMedia Corp.'s 
argument that one part of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 
threatens free-speech rights. The challenged provision of the law 
makes it a crime to transmit a ``communication which is obscene, 
lewd, lascivious, filthy or indecent with intent to annoy, abuse,

	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- The discount retailer Best Buy Co.  
and Apple Computer are locked in a dispute over colors that has 
kept Apple's iMac computer off Best Buy's shelves for months. Best 
Buy hasn't stocked the iMac since early this year when Apple 
started selling the computer in five colors. Apple demands that 
retailers offer all five. But carrying the iMac in blueberry, 
grape, lime, strawberry and tangerine would have created inventory 
problems, a Best Buy spokeswoman said. The dispute leaves CompUSA 
as the only national retail chain offering the iMac.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gives Back Most of 270-Pt. Gain / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a stunning and swift market swing, the Dow  
Jones industrial average nearly squandered a 270-point gain this 
afternoon as investors took profits in industrial stocks and 
technology shares tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow was up 17.97 at 10,511.86,  
after erasing all of a 271.85-point and then beginning to climb 
back. The Dow was on its way to making its sixth consecutive 
closing high, having risen 31.17 to 10,493.89 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators retreated, giving up early gains, with  
the Nasdaq composite down 83.26 at 2,400.78 amid aggressive selling 
of technology shares. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite was down 
14.19 at 1,304.81. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Hyman, senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum,  
said the market ``could only run so far on the backs of'' the 
industrial stocks that had suddenly come into favor last week and 
taken the Dow to new heights. 
</P>
<P>
	The industrial stocks are cheap relative to the previously  
high-flying technology sectors, but they can't play the role of 
long-term leaders because they represent a much smaller portion of 
the market than technology shares do, Hyman said. 
</P>
<P>
	'' At some point in time, the tech stocks have to participate  
again if we're going to get a major rally here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Industrial stocks were still leading the Dow average higher,  
with International Paper, for example, up 2 5/16 at 57 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	But technology stocks were still lower amid massive selling. IBM  
was down 5 13/16 at 164 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq was down 5/8 at 23, after giving up earlier gains. The  
computer maker, which stunned Wall Street with dismal earnings 
projections earlier this month, disclosed on Sunday that chief 
executive Eckhard Pfeiffer had been ousted and its chief financial 
officer was leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong earnings reports were pushing some stocks higher.  
Citigroup was up 2 1/2 at 74 1/8 on earnings reports that surpassed 
analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a better than 2 to 1  
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was heavy at 841.49 
million shares at midafternoon, up from Friday's hectic pace.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is up more than  
100 points in the first half-hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange hold a 3-1 lead over  
decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 16 points and the S&AMP;P 500 Index  
is up nearly four points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow tries today to add to its string of five straight record  
closes. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip index rose 320 points last week, although there  
was some weakness in the high-tech arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate earnings news will once again be the main focus for  
the market, with reports this week expected from the likes of 
Microsoft, McDonald's, Procter &AMP; Gamble, IBM and dozens of others.

	Analysts say thus far, corporate profits have proven somewhat  
better than had been expected, with very few negative surprises.

<HEADLINE> Wage Restraints Needed in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singapore's labor chief told citizens they  
should not expect wage restraints to be lifted this year, despite 
reports of an economic recovery, a newspaper reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we push for too much wage increase, we may stall the  
recovery,'' Lim Boon Heng, head of the National Trades Union 
Congress and Minister without Portfolio, was quoted as saying by 
The Straits Times on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	To help citizens ride out the regional economic crisis,  
Singapore adopted a multibillion-dollar cost-cutting package last 
year that slashed the average resident's income by at least 15 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But hopes for an early recovery were revived in recent weeks,  
following a rise in the stock and property markets, as well as 
official announcements that economic growth this year could be 
higher than previously expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite signs that the Singapore economy is bouncing back, Lim  
cautioned that the recovery is ``fragile and uncertain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is better that we be cautious and continue broadly with the  
consensus we reached last year than to say we should go for 
specific wage increases,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lim added that factors outside Singapore, like social and  
political problems in neighboring countries, will determine how 
fast the city-state can pull out of the recession.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves New Breast Cancer Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A device that uses electricity to map possible  
breast lumps may reduce the number of women who get unnecessary 
biopsies because their mammograms are unclear, the government said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration approved TransScan Medical  
Inc.'s T-Scan 2000 as an extra tool for radiologists to use in 
determining whether women with ambiguous mammogram results need an 
immediate biopsy to check for cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	American women undergo 30 million mammograms a year. The breast  
X-ray is the gold standard in detecting breast cancer, particularly 
early tumors. 
</P>
<P>
	Mammograms often clearly show which breast lesions should be  
biopsied immediately. But they also can be ambiguous, leaving a 
doctor in doubt as to whether to do a biopsy immediately, or to 
wait six months and X-ray again. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 800,000 biopsies are done every year, from which 180,000  
women are diagnosed with breast cancer. The rest are benign lumps. 
So scientists have hunted ways to reduce unnecessary biopsies 
without missing women who have cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Some doctors use ultrasound machines that use sound waves to  
picture lumps as an addition to the mammogram's X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
	The T-Scan 2000 is another alternative. It uses electricity to  
create a map of the breast. 
</P>
<P>
	A one-volt shot of electricity is sent into the hand, where it  
travels through the body into the breast. A handheld probe is moved 
over the breast, where it measures the electrical conductivity of 
breast cells. Cancer cells conduct much less electricity than 
healthy cells -- so when the probe flashes its findings onto a 
computer screen, possible tumors show up as bright white spots. 
</P>
<P>
	TransScan's studies suggest that adding the electricity test for  
women with ambiguous mammograms can improve diagnostic accuracy and 
lower unnecessary biopsies by about 20 percent, said company 
president George Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
	The T-Scan should be used only in women whose doctors cannot  
decide about ordering a biopsy based on other standard procedures, 
said Dr. Dan Schultz, FDA's chief of radiological devices. Women 
with ambiguous mammograms may need biopsies anyway, based on 
results of clinical breast exams or if they have close relatives 
with breast cancer. Those women don't need the T-Scan test. 
</P>
<P>
	What if the T-Scan incorrectly suggests that a woman doesn't  
need an immediate biopsy? Doctors already order a new mammogram 
within six months for women with ambiguous X-rays, advice that the 
T-Scan doesn't change, Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new scan should add less than $100 to a woman's exam,  
Solomon said.

<HEADLINE> US Airways Top Airline in Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a complete turnaround, US Airways has moved  
from worst to first in a survey of major U.S. airline quality. 
</P>
<P>
	The change was an exception in a year that continued to see a  
decline in airline quality, as measured by two university 
professors who looked at on-time performance, denied boardings, 
mishandled luggage and passenger complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``Generally, airlines do a good job of getting you from point A  
to point B on time and with your luggage,'' Dean Headley, associate 
professor of marketing at Wichita State University in Kansas, said 
in a statement released Monday. ``Evidently, the consumer is 
finding fault in the manner in which these services are being 
delivered. The airlines seem to be taking the attitude, `We get you 
there safely with your belongings. What else do you want?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Passenger dissatisfaction with such treatment has fueled a spate  
of legislative proposals aimed at securing new privileges for 
airline passengers. The congressional measures collectively have 
been dubbed an airline passenger's ``Bill of Rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Headley in the study was Brent Bowen, director of the  
Aviation Institute at the University of Nebraska. Their index used 
15 criteria for ranking airline quality. The information is drawn 
from government reports and other data readily available and deemed 
relevant to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	In the pair's 1997 survey, Southwest Airlines placed first and  
US Airways was last among the 10 major carriers, defined by the 
Transportation Department as airlines with operating revenue of $1 
billion or more per year. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Southwest dropped to fifth and US Airways vaulted to  
the top of the pack. Propelling US Airways were relatively low 
claims of denied boardings -- when a ticketed passenger is denied a 
seat on a full aircraft -- and mishandled bags. 
</P>
<P>
	The full ranking was: US Airways, Continental Airlines, American  
Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, America West 
Airlines, TWA, Alaska Airlines, Northwest Airlines and United 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	United had the worst baggage handling record of all the majors,  
according to the survey.

<HEADLINE>  Mrs. Clinton Edges Closer to Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, edging closer to running  
for Senate, opened a campaign-style swing Monday by declaring, ``I 
love New York,'' as her fledgling political operation combed the 
state for potential campaign workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm obviously still considering and exploring and am very  
interested,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet she tried to minimize the political implications of the  
trip, which included talks about the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo 
and other traditional first lady fare. The White House called the 
trip an official function, thus U.S. taxpayers picked up the tab. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an exploratory trip. This is a trip filled with  
events and occasions, some of which I agreed to do months ago,'' 
Mrs. Clinton told reporters after urging private foundations to 
help ease the Kosovo refugee crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Her aides, however, conceded the trip had political  
implications. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess anytime we're up here, it's part of the (exploratory)  
process,'' said press secretary Marsha Berry. ``She's thinking 
about this. I don't know when you turn it off and turn it on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and associates say Mrs. Clinton appears to be leaning  
toward a Senate bid, though some believe she will forgo the race at 
the last minute. Their assessments are based on clues from private 
conversations with her and the full-speed-ahead groundwork being 
laid by top political aide Harold Ickes. 
</P>
<P>
	The former deputy White House chief of staff has begun compiling  
lists of campaign operatives in the event she takes the plunge. He 
has secured commitments from some potential staff, said a source 
close to Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	One longtime associate said Mrs. Clinton told him two weeks ago  
that she intended to run, but would not finalize her decision until 
June or July. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton scheduled scores of New York stops Monday, Tuesday  
and -- after returning to Washington on Wednesday -- again Thursday, 
from Long Island to Niagara Falls. Monday's unusually crowded 
schedule contained seven stops, including the Columbia University's 
Teachers College, the Ukrainian Institute, the Jewish Child Care 
Association and a fund-raiser for Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers, Ukrainians and the Jewish community are important  
Democratic constituencies. Nadler, a House Judiciary Committee 
member, staunchly defended President Clinton during the impeachment 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip brought Mrs. Clinton fresh evidence that a Senate race  
against probable Republican nominee Rudolph Giuliani would be 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest poll from Marist College's Institute for Public  
Opinion showed the pair in a dead heat, with half saying Mrs. 
Clinton should not run. The New York mayor has gained ground since 
a February Marist poll, which had Mrs. Clinton leading Giuliani, 49 
percent to 38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one said it was going to be a cakewalk,'' said Sen. Charles  
Schumer, D-N.Y., who ousted Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato last 
November and has urged the first lady to run. ``This is going to be 
a tough, tough race, but I think as people get to know her, she'll 
do better and better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers inside and outside the White House are studying whether  
Mrs. Clinton should form an exploratory committee to raise money 
that would defray the costs of future trips. She said would 
consider the move ``if it becomes appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief news conference, Mrs. Clinton explained for the first  
time why a Senate race interests her: ``I love New York, to start 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With gushing reverence, Mrs. Clinton called New York ``a  
microcosm of America,'' with a ``dynamic, diverse city'' that would 
enable her to deal with issues such as education and health care 
that are as important in New York as they are across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the collective ``we'' in a way that could include the  
first lady herself, Mrs. Clinton said, ``We have everything in New 
York that we have in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also announced plans to travel to Albania and Macedonia ``as  
soon as I'm given the green light'' by humanitarian workers, whose 
efforts she does not want to disrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	As for her career, Mrs. Clinton told several associates in  
recent days that she has concluded that serving in the Senate would 
be a good next step for her. When word first surfaced of her 
interest, Mrs. Clinton had told these same people she wasn't sure 
if she wanted to be in a Republican-controlled Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The new question: Is she willing to risk losing? Though a senior  
adviser said Mrs. Clinton is not afraid of defeat, other associates 
say she tends to avoid taking great risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Most friends and associates spoke on condition of anonymity.  
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of Teachers  
and a Mrs. Clinton supporter in New York, suggested the first lady 
is inclined to run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get a feeling that a final decision has been made yet,  
but I think she's very interested,'' Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was urged to run at every stop, including a Central  
Park event concerning hiking trails. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to wish her all the best as she hits a different kind  
of trail right here in New York state,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, 
D-N.Y., as Mrs. Clinton, from the front row, shook her head from 
side to side. At another event, NBC ``Today Show'' host Katie 
Couric joked that Mrs. Clinton was ``taking time out from apartment 
hunting'' in New York to appear.

<P>

ruble made foreign goods too expensive for most Russians, officials

	GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization approved U.S.  
sanctions against the European Union today in a dispute over the 
import of bananas, trade diplomats said. The United States claims 
the EU discriminates unfairly against bananas imported from Latin 
American nations and favors those from former European colonies in 
the Caribbean and Africa. The WTO did not say when the sanctions 
would start. Washington has said it will slap tariffs of up to 100 
percent on products including French handbags, German 
coffee-makers, bed linen and cardboard packing material.

<HEADLINE> GM, Toyota May Seek Broader Linkup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The No. 2 executive at General Motors Corp.  
hinted Monday that a new technology partnership between GM and 
Toyota Motor Corp. could lead to a broader linkup of the 
automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	A merged GM and Toyota would account for more than one quarter  
of the world's car and truck sales, but GM vice chairman Harry 
Pearce stopped short of predicting a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would certainly be premature to talk about a merger,''  
Pearce said in an interview. ``But I think it's important for both 
companies to have a very open mind in terms of where this kind of 
collaboration takes us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce's provacative comment came after he and Toyota vice  
president Akihiro Wada announced a five-year deal to jointly 
research and develop alternative-fuel vehicles. Pearce said both 
sides expected the venture to last well beyond five years as ``a 
long-term and continuing collaboration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've both proven ourselves to be technical innovators  
in a variety of ways that make this a very, very strong 
combination,'' Pearce said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM is the world's largest automaker; Japan's Toyota is ranked  
third, behind Ford Motor Co. Pearce said their joint efforts in 
advanced technology research would give them a tremendous 
competitive advantage. He said he hoped it would lead to joint 
production of nonpolluting vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	David Cole, who directs the University of Michigan's Office for  
the Study of Automotive Transportation, said an GM-Toyota merger 
seems unlikely because of the antitrust issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though it may not be the barrier that it once was, it would be  
fascinating to see,'' Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM chairman Jack Smith and Toyota chairman Shoichiro Toyoda have  
had a close relationship for more than 15 years, dating back to 
their establishment of a joint assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., 
that still produces Toyota Corollas and Chevrolet Prizm 
subcompacts. 
</P>
<P>
	``What that sort of backdrop says is this is not something new  
or unique,'' Cole said of the technology deal. ``With the richness 
of the relationship that has developed, it creates the foundation 
for some very deep relationships in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GM-Toyota research will initially focus on vehicles powered  
by fuel cells, batteries and hybrid propulsion systems that combine 
different technologies, such as electric motors and high-efficiency 
gasoline engines. Fuel cells generate electricity using a chemical 
reaction between hydrogen and oxygen and produce little or no 
emissions. So far they are too expensive for mass production cars. 
</P>
<P>
	GM was the first major automaker to mass-market a modern  
electric car, the EV1. Though demand has been disappointing, it has 
provided a real-world test of the technology that will be used in 
developing other electric propulsion systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota was the first to sell a hybrid electric car in Japan, the  
Prius, which will go on sale in the United States and Europe next 
year. Wada said Toyota is working to bring the subcompact's cost 
down to about the price of a Corolla in the United States and to 
make a profit. Currently, the car is a money-loser. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce, meanwhile, would not rule out the possibility that GM  
would rename the Prius as a Chevrolet. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers have become increasingly competitive in trying to  
establish themselves as leaders in environmentally friendly 
technology to impress Wall Street, consumers and to attract 
high-tech talent. 
</P>
<P>
	GM-Toyota's announcement came one day before Ford,  
DaimlerChrysler AG and fuel-cell developer Ballard Power Systems 
Inc. planned to announce a deal with three oil companies to develop 
a demonstration fleet of fuel-cell powered vehicles in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce and Wada declined to say how much they would spend on  
their collaboration but Pearce said it would be substantial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking hundreds and hundreds of engineers, and major  
dedication of human resources and capital and laboratory facilities 
around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that suppliers likely will contribute much of the  
technology and engineering that will go into the cars of the 
future. That's where the combined size of GM-Toyota will make a 
difference, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were a resident in the supplier community and I was  
approached by a partnership or collaboration that represented a 
quarter of the world's market, I would pay a lot of attention to 
that,'' Pearce said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce also said the deal will allow GM and Toyota to take  
advantage of their combined size to get the lowest prices for 
materials and parts, and to define technical standards for emerging 
technologies.

<HEADLINE>  Mrs. Clinton Edges Closer to Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, edging closer to running  
for Senate, opened a campaign-style swing Monday by declaring, ``I 
love New York,'' as her fledgling political operation combed the 
state for potential campaign workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm obviously still considering and exploring and am very  
interested,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet she tried to minimize the political implications of the  
trip, which included talks about the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo 
and other traditional first lady fare. The White House called the 
trip an official function, thus U.S. taxpayers picked up the tab. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an exploratory trip. This is a trip filled with  
events and occasions, some of which I agreed to do months ago,'' 
Mrs. Clinton told reporters after urging private foundations to 
help ease the Kosovo refugee crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Her aides, however, conceded the trip had political  
implications. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess anytime we're up here, it's part of the (exploratory)  
process,'' said press secretary Marsha Berry. ``She's thinking 
about this. I don't know when you turn it off and turn it on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and associates say Mrs. Clinton appears to be leaning  
toward a Senate bid, though some believe she will forgo the race at 
the last minute. Their assessments are based on clues from private 
conversations with her and the full-speed-ahead groundwork being 
laid by top political aide Harold Ickes. 
</P>
<P>
	The former deputy White House chief of staff has begun compiling  
lists of campaign operatives in the event she takes the plunge. He 
has secured commitments from some potential staff, said a source 
close to Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	One longtime associate said Mrs. Clinton told him two weeks ago  
that she intended to run, but would not finalize her decision until 
June or July. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton scheduled scores of New York stops Monday, Tuesday  
and -- after returning to Washington on Wednesday -- again Thursday, 
from Long Island to Niagara Falls. Monday's unusually crowded 
schedule contained seven stops, including the Columbia University's 
Teachers College, the Ukrainian Institute, the Jewish Child Care 
Association and a fund-raiser for Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers, Ukrainians and the Jewish community are important  
Democratic constituencies. Nadler, a House Judiciary Committee 
member, staunchly defended President Clinton during the impeachment 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip brought Mrs. Clinton fresh evidence that a Senate race  
against probable Republican nominee Rudolph Giuliani would be 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest poll from Marist College's Institute for Public  
Opinion showed the pair in a dead heat, with half saying Mrs. 
Clinton should not run. The New York mayor has gained ground since 
a February Marist poll, which had Mrs. Clinton leading Giuliani, 49 
percent to 38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one said it was going to be a cakewalk,'' said Sen. Charles  
Schumer, D-N.Y., who ousted Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato last 
November and has urged the first lady to run. ``This is going to be 
a tough, tough race, but I think as people get to know her, she'll 
do better and better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers inside and outside the White House are studying whether  
Mrs. Clinton should form an exploratory committee to raise money 
that would defray the costs of future trips. She said would 
consider the move ``if it becomes appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief news conference, Mrs. Clinton explained for the first  
time why a Senate race interests her: ``I love New York, to start 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With gushing reverence, Mrs. Clinton called New York ``a  
microcosm of America,'' with a ``dynamic, diverse city'' that would 
enable her to deal with issues such as education and health care 
that are as important in New York as they are across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the collective ``we'' in a way that could include the  
first lady herself, Mrs. Clinton said, ``We have everything in New 
York that we have in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also announced plans to travel to Albania and Macedonia ``as  
soon as I'm given the green light'' by humanitarian workers, whose 
efforts she does not want to disrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	As for her career, Mrs. Clinton told several associates in  
recent days that she has concluded that serving in the Senate would 
be a good next step for her. When word first surfaced of her 
interest, Mrs. Clinton had told these same people she wasn't sure 
if she wanted to be in a Republican-controlled Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The new question: Is she willing to risk losing? Though a senior  
adviser said Mrs. Clinton is not afraid of defeat, other associates 
say she tends to avoid taking great risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Most friends and associates spoke on condition of anonymity.  
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of Teachers  
and a Mrs. Clinton supporter in New York, suggested the first lady 
is inclined to run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get a feeling that a final decision has been made yet,  
but I think she's very interested,'' Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was urged to run at every stop, including a Central  
Park event concerning hiking trails. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to wish her all the best as she hits a different kind  
of trail right here in New York state,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, 
D-N.Y., as Mrs. Clinton, from the front row, shook her head from 
side to side. At another event, NBC ``Today Show'' host Katie 
Couric joked that Mrs. Clinton was ``taking time out from apartment 
hunting'' in New York to appear.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Coalition Likely Forming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Nationalist parties dominated Turkish  
elections yesterday and appear poised to form a coalition 
government, an administration that will likely rule out compromises 
with Kurdish activists and adopt a tough policy toward Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
	A coalition between Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's Democratic  
Left Party and the far-right Nationalist Movement Party, which led 
the voting, is also likely to lead to a chill in relations with the 
European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey is a NATO member and a key U.S. ally in the unstable  
Middle East and Balkans. U.S. warplanes that patrol northern Iraq 
are based in southern Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation has had six governments since 1995, and an unstable  
coalition would jeopardize the chances for needed economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit's party and the Nationalist Movement Party, or MHP, were  
leading the vote with 22 percent and 18 percent respectively, 
according to results based on a count of 75 percent of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	A coalition government must be formed, and the most likely  
parties to do so would be Ecevit's party, the MHP and the 
center-right Motherland Party, which was taking 14 percent of the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Islamic Virtue Party -- the largest in parliament -- took only  
15 percent of the vote. The military, which has seized power three 
times since 1960, has ruled out any changes to the country's 
secular system and was at constant odds with Islamic activists. 
</P>
<P>
	``The voters don't want a military coup in Turkey. People saw  
that Virtue could have led to one,'' wrote Ismet Berkan, a 
columnist for the daily Radikal. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people who voted for Virtue's predecessor, the Welfare  
Party, apparently voted for the MHP, which is also deeply religious 
but does not mix Islam and politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said that fears of Kurdish activism also pushed voters  
toward Ecevit and the MHP. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the backlash,'' said Dogu Ergil, a political science  
professor at Ankara University. 
</P>
<P>
	It is almost certain that Ecevit, a staunch secularist who is  
popular with the military, will not invite the Islamic party into 
any coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	The nationalist coalition that appears most likely would be led  
by Ecevit, who ordered the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus and saw 
his popularity soar after Turkish commandos captured Kurdish 
guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit's policies are likely to be strengthened further in such  
a coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the foreign policy stage, there would be an absolute  
toughening,'' said Coskun San, a sociology professor at Ankara 
University. ``No concessions will be given on Cyprus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The island has been divided into a Greek Cypriot south and a  
Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded in 1974 after a coup by 
supporters of union with Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	The MHP is adamantly opposed to any compromises with Kurdish  
activists and is against any concessions on Cyprus. It also calls 
on Turkey to focus its foreign policy on the Turkic Central Asian 
states such as Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan rather than Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The party's sudden rise has worried some Turks, who identify the  
movement with the Gray Wolves, the party's youth branch. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gray Wolves battled leftists in the 1970s in clashes that  
killed 5,000 people and prompted the military to seize power in 
1980. Mehmet Ali Agca, the man who shot Pope John Paul II in 1981, 
was a Gray Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
	The party, however, has recently softened its image and now  
calls for an end to government corruption and respect for 
tradition. It is not clear how much influence they would have in an 
Ecevit government. 
</P>
<P>
	In the southeast, a pro-Kurdish party won the mayorships of at  
least six cities, the first time such a group has won local 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	But the chances of the Kurds achieving any reforms on the  
national level seem to have diminished with the success of the MHP.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Kids Find Metric Label Error </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EASTCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Those little pink Sweet'N Low packets  
are undergoing a subtle design change. Chalk up a victory for 
sharp-eyed middle school students who make up the ``metric 
patrol.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Adults are always telling us what to do,'' said Noelle  
Ruggiero, 13. ``Now we're telling them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noelle and her earth-science classmates at Eastchester Middle  
School scan products for metric mistakes in labeling. They've 
written to companies whose products -- bubble bath, vitamins, even a 
Harley-Davidson engine -- were mislabeled. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Noelle noticed that Sweet'N Low packets say they  
contain ``1G'' of artificial sweetener. But Noelle knew that the 
correct abbreviation for gram is a lower-case ``g.'' Under Commerce 
Department guidelines, an upper-case ``G'' stands for giga-, the 
prefix that means one billion, as in gigabytes. 
</P>
<P>
	She wrote to Cumberland Packing Corp., the New York-based  
manufacturer of Sweet'N Low. Her classmates were busy writing other 
companies with metric mistakes. But only Noelle got such a quick 
result. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are correct, our packets should be labeled 1g instead of  
1G,'' said a letter from Abraham Bakal, a consultant for Sweet'N 
Low. ``We are now in the process of correcting this printing 
error.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that was real nice of them,'' Noelle said. ``They  
didn't insist they were right or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bakal said the new and improved design should find its way to  
consumers within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teaching kids to pay attention to details is very important,''  
Bakal said Friday. ``Most consumers don't even notice it. But you 
teach kids to pay attention to details and to be precise, and 
that's why I felt it was a cute letter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noelle seems unimpressed by her impact on the company that makes  
50 million packets of sweetener a day, but she did like the T-shirt 
that Bakal sent along. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has the Sweet'N Low logo on it,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It made her the envy of the class,'' said her teacher,  
JulieAnn Hugick. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the other companies cited by the students haven't  
responded or have sent form letters. Harley-Davidson insists that 
``cc'' is still correct for cubic centimeters though the standards 
called for a ``cm'' with a little ``3'' for ``cubed'' above it. 
</P>
<P>
	But there have been some successes.  
</P>
<P>
	Gojo Industries, maker of a waterless hand cleaner, told  
13-year-old Michael Pierorazio that its packaging already had been 
changed, correcting the abbreviation for milliliters from ``ML'' to 
``ml.'' But the president thanked him and sent free samples. 
</P>
<P>
	And the people at Dixon-Ticonderoga, after insisting that ``GR''  
was a proper abbreviation for grams on their glue sticks, agreed to 
change them and sent 13-year-old Chris Orth some free pencils with 
aliens on them. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, unreformed products are on display in a cabinet in Mrs.  
Hugick's classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	It's labeled ``Metric Jail.''

<HEADLINE> Lilly To Develop Cancer Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Eli Lilly and Co. announced a joint venture  
Monday with French drugmaker Sanofi to develop a treatment for 
colorectal cancer in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, the latest in a string of partnerships to tap  
innovations at other companies, may help Lilly carve out a new 
identity as a leading marketer of cancer therapies, chairman and 
chief executive Sidney Taurel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanofi developed oxaliplatin, a platinum-based cancer agent  
that's already being sold in 14 countries as a first- or 
second-line treatment for advanced colorectal cancer, in 
combination with a second drug called 5-FU. 
</P>
<P>
	The venture plans to submit oxaliplatin for review by the Food  
and Drug Administration by the end of September. It would seek 
approval to sell the drug as a first-line treatment for metastatic 
colorectal cancer, in combination with 5-FU. Approval could take a 
year or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly did not disclose financial details of the partnership,  
other than to say it would pay Sanofi an upfront fee and other 
payments for a share of U.S. sales of oxaliplatin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are bringing to the party our knowledge of the cancer  
market in the U.S. and an established sales force which has 
established relationships with cancer specialists,'' Taurel said at 
a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxaliplatin joins a new-drug pipeline at Lilly that includes a  
product called MTA to treat tumors in breasts, lungs, the pancreas, 
colon, head and neck, and a hormone treatment for breast cancer. 
Lilly also is studying the potential of its osteoporosis drug 
Evista to prevent breast cancer.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Resists Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The British and Irish prime ministers tried in  
vain today to get Northern Ireland's rival political leaders to 
form a Protestant-Catholic government and keep the peace accord 
afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Politicians from three key parties left London unable to agree  
on a way to form a government, the centerpiece of the 1998 Belfast 
accord aimed at stopping three decades of bloodshed in the 
British-ruled province. 
</P>
<P>
	They did agree, however, to meet again next week at the London  
office of British Prime Minister Tony Blair. 
</P>
<P>
	David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, insisted  
that the Irish Republican Army promise to disarm before his 
Protestant supporters would join a government that includes the 
IRA-linked Sinn Fein party. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks ago Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern  
proposed a compromise plan after round-the-clock negotiations in 
Northern Ireland: Sinn Fein would receive its two positions in the 
envisioned 12-member government, but only if the IRA promised to 
destroy a cache of weapons within a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ulster Unionists and the major Catholic party, the moderate  
Social Democratic and Labor Party, or SDLP, both supported the 
approach. But Sinn Fein rejected it, prompting Monday's 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair and Ahern devoted most time to the six-member Sinn Fein  
delegation, spending the last hour talking exclusively with party 
leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men have been identified as senior IRA commanders in the  
1970s, when the outlawed group's now-suspended campaign to break 
Northern Ireland's links with Britain was at its bloodiest. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel McLaughlin accused both  
governments of deliberately misinterpreting the peace agreement to 
suit Ulster Unionist demands.

	``The two governments keep pressing Sinn Fein for things which  
we simply cannot deliver,'' said McLaughlin, who emphasized that 
the accord specified only that Sinn Fein should use its influence 
with the IRA to achieve disarmament by May 2000. He said the accord 
``is in free fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ahern, who said he had spent 30 hours over the weekend talking  
with Northern Irish politicians by phone, testily rejected Sinn 
Fein's assertion that the agreement was collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein, Ahern said,  
``I'm not asking anyone to concede totally on their position. I'm 
asking both parties to try and assist us in developing a 
compromise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seamus Mallon, a SDLP leader who would be Trimble's deputy in  
the new government, accused both parties of maintaining positions 
that could ``destroy something which can create a totally new way 
of life for all of us.''

<HEADLINE> Work of Breast Implant Panel Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- A federal judge Monday refused to throw  
out the work of an expert panel that found no link between breast 
implants and disease, rejecting women's claims that members were 
biased toward manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Sam Pointer ruled that the findings of the  
four-person panel were not tainted by the fact one member took a 
$750 honorarium from a company that used to make implants. 
</P>
<P>
	Pointer said he should have been more explicit in explaining  
what was expected of committee members, whom he appointed to be 
completely impartial and free of any conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take some responsibility for that,'' said Pointer, who  
presides over thousands of federal lawsuits filed by women who 
claim breast implants harmed their health. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision cleared the way for attorneys to begin taking sworn  
testimony from committee members this week. Videotapes of the 
sessions will be available for use in implant cases nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's attorneys last week asked Pointer to block the testimony  
and disband the committee since one member, rheumatologist Peter 
Tugwell, accepted $750 from former implant maker Bristol-Myers 
Squibb Co. to attend a three-hour meeting dealing with issues other 
than implants. 
</P>
<P>
	Tugwell, chairman of medicine at the University of Ottawa, also  
solicited $5,500 in donations from Bristol-Myers Squibb and 3M, 
another defendant in implant cases, to sponsor conferences he 
helped organize. And a close colleague accepted at least $200,000 
to do work for a Bristol-Myers Squibb subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Knowles, representing women with implants, said Tugwell's  
1996 appointment to the panel would have been ``dead on arrival'' 
had Pointer known of all his dealings with implant companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But attorneys for Bristol-Myers Squibb and the science panel  
argued that Tugwell followed all the court's rules and had no 
dealings involving breast implants with any company. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no conflict of interest, certainly as defined by this  
court,'' said John Kobayashi, representing the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	While refusing to overturn the work of the committee, Pointer  
said women's lawyers could question Tugwell about his ties to 
implant companies during his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of women have sued claiming implants are to blame for  
illnesses including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, aches, fatigue, 
memory loss and hardening of the breasts. They contend science 
backs up the claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Implant makers deny their products are a threat, and they say  
the work of the science panel and researchers proves it. They 
contend women's attorneys built their cases on bogus science. 
</P>
<P>
	Pointer, who has been in charge of all federal implant cases for  
more than six years, appointed the panel to sort out the 
conflicting scientific opinions.

<HEADLINE> Florida Fires Burn 130,000 Acres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Smoke turned daylight to darkness Monday near a  
fire in the Everglades that has charred about 130,000 acres, 
prompting authorities to warn some people with respiratory problems 
to stay indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks worse than midnight out there,'' said Florida Highway  
Patrol Lt. Greg Edwards. ``Visibility's less than 100 feet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The smoke blanketed south Florida's main east-west highway,  
Interstate 75, and forced authorities to keep about 60 miles of it 
closed. The road, known as Alligator Alley, could be closed for 
days, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
	In communities immediately east of the fire -- about 25 miles  
northwest of Miami -- people with asthma, bronchitis and emphysema 
were urged to stay indoors if possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was threatening two Indian reservations.  
</P>
<P>
	It had reached the Miccosukee Indian Reservation, where several  
hunting camps and shacks were in danger earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Just to the north, the blaze was about two miles east of the Big  
Cypress Seminole Indian Reservation. No structures were threatened 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters had hoped the Miami Canal, which runs about 70  
miles from Lake Okeechobee to Miami, would serve as a barrier to 
keep the flames from advancing farther. But the blaze jumped the 
canal Monday and was advancing toward the Miccosukee Indian 
Reservation. No evacuations were ordered, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters were trying to keep the flames back at an airboat  
trail that offers a watery break in the dry sawgrass, said David 
Stull, an operations specialist with the state Division of 
Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials expected erratic winds and dry weather to remain in  
the coming days, making new fires quick to start and difficult to 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters set controlled blazes to help contain the  
Everglades flames, which charred dry marsh grass and darkened the 
sky in the Fort Lauderdale and Miami areas with clouds of thick 
smoke over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire began in the eastern Everglades late last week,  
possibly ignited by heat from a vehicle's catalytic converter. 
Aided by swirling winds, it quickly became the largest of at least 
2,515 fires that have burned more than 130,000 acres in Florida 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters from Texas and Arizona have been called in to help.  
</P>
<P>
	With rainfall far below normal during Florida's  
December-through-April dry season, officials fear a repeat of last 
summer, when fires scorched nearly 500,000 acres and forced 100,000 
people from their homes.

	Clinton Asks $6B for Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton asked Congress today for $6  
billion in emergency spending to sustain the U.S. military 
engagement in Kosovo and increase aid to ethnic Albanians fleeing 
the province. He urged quick, bipartisan action, and congressional 
leaders said they would give the request prompt attention.

	NATO: We May Have Killed Civilians  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- After five days of agonizing, NATO  
acknowledged today that it may have killed an undetermined number 
of civilians in an attack on a convoy in Kosovo. In an elaborate 
explanation by Brig. Gen. Dan Leaf, commander of the air wing at 
Aviano air base in Italy, NATO described attacks last week near the 
town of Djakovica. Yugoslav officials reported about 80 people dead 
from the April 14 attack in the Yugoslav province, but NATO and 
other officials question the casualty figure as well as other 
details of the Serb report.

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan said today he  
will go to Moscow next week to discuss the Kosovo conflict. Annan 
told the Security Council in closed consultations of his plans to 
add a day onto a previously scheduled visit to Germany from April 
26-28. U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard confirmed that Annan had 
consulted with the Russian government and decided to travel to 
Moscow on April 29. Last Friday, Yugoslavia rejected the key 
element of Annan's Kosovo peace initiative, saying an international 
military force in Yugoslavia was unacceptable.

alternative-fuel technology. The joint effort should lead to result 
in commercially viable advanced technologies faster and at a lower 
cost to customers, GM vice chairman Harry Pearce said. The new 
venture will involve research and development of electric, hybrid 
electric and fuel-cell technology. Hybrid electric vehicles

building bombing were brought. In the low-key ceremony marking the

	Spacecraft's Main Antenna Stuck

<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The main communications antenna on  
NASA's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft has become stuck and unable 
to automatically point toward Earth. Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
spokeswoman Mary Hardin said today that a hinge on the antenna 
stopped moving late last week and flight controllers were unable to 
solve the problem during the weekend. The antenna can still be used 
even if the hinge doesn't work. But that requires periodically 
halting the collection of science data and turning the entire 
spacecraft to point the antenna at Earth.

Chebet, who finished second to countryman Moses Tanui by three

<HEADLINE> Holyfield-Lewis II Is a Hot Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON (AP) -- The site and purse for the Lennox Lewis-Evander Holyfield rematch might be  
decided next month. 
<P>
	Lewis promoter Panos Eliades said Monday that Holyfield's  
promoter, Don King, Lewis' representatives and HBO cable network 
officials were expected to meet, possibly in London, in mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when the crunch will come,'' Eliades said.  
</P>
<P>
	New York and Las Vegas are in contention for the bout, which  
will be held Nov. 6 or 13. Britain has been ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
	Eliades said Madison Square Garden, the site of the disputed  
heavyweight title draw on March 13, wants the rematch and is trying 
to make a bid of more than $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas reportedly has offered $10  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time Lennox will probably step into the ring as  
favorite,'' Lewis manager Frank Maloney said. ``Boxing needs this 
fight ... They had to have this fight to put the record straight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The outcome in New York prompted boxing's governing bodies to  
demand a rematch while the judging sparked several investigations.

<HEADLINE> NHL Playoffs Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With Wayne Gretzky retiring, the NHL lost its biggest name. Now,  
some teams will be playing without their own big names when the 
Stanley Cup playoffs begin Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia's Eric Lindros, Phoenix's Jeremy Roenick and Derian  
Hatcher of the Dallas Stars are among those who will be out of 
action when the NHL opens postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody realizes that Eric won't be back for the first  
round, and it's not an issue,'' linemate John LeClair said. ``We're 
not just sitting here wishing he was back, we're going ahead 
without him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers will open at Toronto, and Phoenix will face St. Louis  
at home on Thursday, while Dallas will play host to Edmonton on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros is recuperating from a collapsed lung suffered more than  
two weeks ago in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	Roenick has a broken jaw as the result of a hit by Hatcher,  
along with a broken thumb. Hatcher is in the midst of a seven-game 
suspension as the result of that illegal hit, and will miss the 
first five games of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas-Edmonton game is one of four Wednesday night. The  
others: Anaheim at Detroit, San Jose at Colorado and Buffalo at 
Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	In other Thursday night games, it's Pittsburgh at New Jersey and  
Boston at Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars, who won the Presidents' Trophy with the NHL's best  
record and the Jennings Trophy for fewest goals yielded, also are 
expected to miss high-scoring forward Pat Verbeek. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter, said forward Mike Keane.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're pretty confident,'' he said. ``You have to feel  
confident when you win the Jennings and the Presidents' Trophy. We 
had a good year, but now it's a whole different season. We're ready 
to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Oilers might be in trouble. They were 0-3-1 vs. Dallas  
during the season and two of their top players -- Bill Guerin and 
Josef Beranek -- are out with knee injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Detroit Red Wings are going for their third  
straight Stanley Cup, which would put them in pretty good company. 
No NHL team has won that many in a row since the New York Islanders 
pulled off four straight in 1980-83. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Larry Murphy strikes a cautious note.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at every team out there in the west, it's going to  
be a battle again. ... You can't take anything for granted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings and Mighty Ducks are two of the few teams without  
any major injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're deeper than we ever have been in past years, in every  
position,'' said Detroit goaltender Chris Osgood. 
</P>
<P>
	Since an 0-4-1 start, the Avalanche have been on a tear --  
particularly in the second half of the season. And goaltender 
Patrick Roy, who has already won three Stanley Cups, has never 
looked better. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo and Ottawa played five overtime games this season, with  
the Senators holding a 1-0-4 edge. It will again be a battle of 
goalies: Buffalo's Dominik Hasek vs. Ron Tugnutt or Damian Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Ottawa, you're dealing with a team that has great team  
speed,'' Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said. ``They've had one heck of a 
year. Both their goaltenders have had a heck of a year.''

<HEADLINE> Marathon's Hill Does Its Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDITOR'S NOTE: AP Cleveland correspondent John Affleck ran his  
first Boston Marathon on Monday. His goal had been to finish in	
under 3 hours. This is the fourth and last of his stories about his	
experience.	
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Veterans of the Boston Marathon spook race rookies  
with tales of Heartbreak Hill the way grandparents scare their 
grandchildren with ghost stories. 
</P>
<P>
	And like those youngsters, the rookies listen with a mix of fear  
and skepticism. How bad could Heartbreak be, they think, even if it 
is the most famous climb at Boston and comes between the 20- and 
21-mile marks of the race? 
</P>
<P>
	After running my first Boston Marathon on Monday, I can say  
this: it can be pretty darn bad. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-mile Newton hills stretch of the course, which  
culminates with Heartbreak, took me from racing mode to survival 
mode. It feels good to be alive now. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, I ran 3 hours, 4 minutes, and -- I think -- about 10  
seconds, although, frankly, I was so bleary coming across the 
finish line I didn't stop my watch for a few more seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	That was slower than my ultimate goal in this race, breaking the  
3-hour barrier, but I don't feel down. In fact, I'm quite happy 
(when I don't have to walk) because I beat my personal best time by 
about 4 minutes and got to enjoy the spectacle of one of the 
world's great marathons. 
</P>
<P>
	And it is a spectacle.  
</P>
<P>
	From the start at Hopkinton on, the field is a lovely mass of  
color in motion. Fans are vociferous and everywhere -- from the 
patrons of a biker bar blasting Van Halen's ``Running with the 
Devil'' at 2 miles to the huge crowds lining the downtown streets 
down the home stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorable crowd moment: early in the race, I caught up to a  
training buddy from my hometown of Cleveland who had a slightly 
better seeding than I did. 
</P>
<P>
	My friend, Jeff Ziol, and I had agreed that we would focus on  
trying to break 3 hours and ignore the crowd, particularly the 
women at Wellesley College near the halfway point. While their 
cheering is wonderful, and nearly deafening, it can also pump up 
runners too much, causing them to speed up and waste energy. 
</P>
<P>
	But as Ziol and I cruised past Wellesley, we found ourselves  
egging on the crowd to get louder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh well,'' Ziol said. ``So much for that.''  
</P>
<P>
	``What the heck,'' I said. ``How often do you get screamed at  
like a Beatle?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ziol and I pushed each other pretty hard before we reached the  
hills at 16 miles. After the race, we realized both of us had 
wanted to slow down a little bit but we were afraid to tell each 
other for fear of seeming wimpy. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, I paid the price more than Ziol, who finished in  
2:57. As we climbed through the Newton hills, the effect of going 
up and down, up and down, on a hot day took its toll. My legs were 
cramped, peripheral vision diminished and brain started to fog. 
</P>
<P>
	By Heartbreak, I was jogging -- not racing. It was time for a new  
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	I told myself what remained of the race was just like my daily  
run. I went from drinking two cups of water a mile to three. I 
decided to enjoy the crowd a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a singlet emblazoned with the name of my alma mater,  
Notre Dame, I tried to feed off the dozens of spectators who yelled 
``Go Fighting Irish!'' and the drunk guy who tried to sing the 
school's fight song. 
</P>
<P>
	Gradually, five miles to go became four, three, two and I was  
downtown, turning on Boylston Street for the last quarter-mile. 
</P>
<P>
	I remembered the advice of a friend who said I should wave to  
the crowd and blow kisses in those last yards. ``It's our Super 
Bowl,'' he said. But if this was the Super Bowl, the Boston course 
was the Denver Broncos and I was the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, I managed a smile as I crossed the line -- what a relief.  
A post-race feeling of good will has now set in, and I'm not 
worried about soreness or blisters. 
</P>
<P>
	But I know that sometime in the next few days a little voice in  
my head will say, ``You know, if you just go out a little slower, 
you might be able to break 3 hours at Boston.'' And pretty soon 
after that, I'll be back out on the hills, running long. 
</P>
<P>
	Wait 'til next year.

<HEADLINE> Ben Johnson Can Appeal Lifetime Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Disgraced former Olympian Ben Johnson took his  
first step toward reinstatement Monday, but the sprinter is still a 
long way from lining up in the starting blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Adjudicator Graeme Mew ruled that the 37-year-old Johnson's  
application for reinstatement in Canada should be allowed to go 
ahead, pending certain conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never lost faith,'' said Johnson, stripped of his Olympic  
gold medal and 100-meter world record after testing positive for 
steroids at the 1988 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has big plans in the event he is reinstated by the  
International Amateur Athletics Federation, track's world governing 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they approve my application by May or June, I could run in  
the world championships in Spain,'' he said. ``I would run in 
Barcelona, Zurich, Cologne. I would like to run in Sydney at the 
Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mew's ruling was based on procedural errors in the handling of  
Johnson's 1993 lifetime suspension for a second positive drug test 
-- at an indoor competition in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	But the decision does not vindicate Johnson over the sanction,  
nor does it allow him to compete anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling does mean Athletics Canada must file an application  
to the IAAF seeking Johnson's reinstatement. What happens after 
that is up to the IAAF. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the former world 100-meter champion remains  
under lifetime suspension by the IAAF. 
</P>
<P>
	One condition of Mew's ruling was that Johnson not attempt to  
compete in Canada until the issue is settled by the international 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's agent, Morris Chrobotek, said he expects to complete  
Johnson's application by week's end and have it in the hands of 
IAAF officials early next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been tough, but it took me 15 years to become the No. 1  
in the world, so I have enough patience to get through this,'' 
Johnson said. ``I'm very happy, but I don't have time to jump 
around and celebrate. I still can't compete and we still have some 
things to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A conditioning program is foremost among them.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not in running shape right now, but I can be in no time,''  
Johnson said. ``I've been doing this for 22 years. I know what it 
takes. I weigh 188 pounds right now. I'll be down to 174 by the end 
of May.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Johnson and Chrobotek have maintained that the sprinter  
never received a fair hearing after his 1993 drug test. 
</P>
<P>
	In his ruling, Mew suggests ``that Mr. Johnson was not  
adequately informed of the options available to him,'' and that in 
1993 Athletics Canada ``misinformed'' Johnson about the type of 
hearing he was entitled to following the IAAF doping commission's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Mew's ruling also stated that the IAAF did not adequately inform  
Johnson of his procedural options. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who still vehemently denies ever taking a banned  
substance, is anxious to have his day in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to tell my side of the story and clear my name,'' he  
said. ``My job is to run, and that is where I belong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Athletics Canada and the Canadian Centre for Ethics in  
Sports say they will support Johnson's attempt for reinstatement by 
the IAAF. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will do it in writing and, if necessary, with a physical  
presence,'' said Athletics Canada president John Thresher.

<HEADLINE> New Asthma Drug May Fight Allergies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merck &AMP; Co. has made a mild splash with its  
first asthma medicine, a chewable pill called Singulair that 
children can take once a day. But the drug's big payoff could come 
treating a much more common respiratory nuisance: hay fever. 
</P>
<P>
	A Merck-funded study of 458 patients last year showed those who  
combined Singulair with the best-selling allergy pill Claritin had 
substantially milder hay fever symptoms -- such as runny nose and 
itchy eyes -- than those who used Claritin alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Buoyed by these early findings, some allergists have already  
begun prescribing Singulair for seasonal allergies and Merck is 
continuing to research the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Combining Singulair and Claritin into one pill could make for a  
blockbuster drug, according to experts. 
</P>
<P>
	About 35 million Americans suffer from hay fever, twice as many  
as those with asthma. And, about half of all people with asthma 
also suffer from hay fever. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes clinical, scientific and practical sense to treat  
with one medication,'' said Eli Meltzer, a principal investigator 
on the Singulair-Claritin study and professor of pediatrics at 
University of California-San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schering-Plough Corp.'s patent on Claritin runs until 2004,  
so industry analysts say Merck will either have to wait or sign a 
co-marketing agreement with its competitor. Or it could set its 
sights lower simply by seeking Food and Drug Administration 
approval to sell Singulair alone for allergies. Neither company 
would disclose whether they are in talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering likely has little interest in Singulair, one analyst  
said. ``It already has a perfect drug. It does not need anything to 
muddy the waters,'' said David Sachs of Gruntal &AMP; Co. 
Schering-Plough also is in advanced human testing of its 
second-generation Claritin drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Claritin, which had U.S. sales of $1.9 billion last year is one  
of the most popular prescription medicines in the country. Claritin 
has more than 50 percent of the allergy market, largely due to its 
status as the only once-a-day antihistamine that does not cause 
drowsiness. Schering-Plough's heavy TV, magazine and billboard 
advertising has further pushed demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Singulair was launched in March 1998 and had sales of $194  
million last year. Its introduction was billed as big step forward 
in treating childhood asthma. Its most important benefit is that 
the chewable pill is significantly easier for children to use 
compared to corticosteroids, which must be taken by high-pressured 
inhalants that are difficult to use. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the convenience, some doctors still consider Singulair a  
weak sister to the more potent corticosteroids. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Singulair sales were somewhat disappointing last  
year considering many expect the drug to eventually hit $1 billion 
in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Singulair sales could grow by hundreds of millions if it could  
get U.S. approval for the drug as a supplement to Claritin, 
analysts said. ``It could be humongous,'' said Sachs. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck has experience finding new uses for established drugs.  
Last year, it started selling a version of its prostate drug 
Proscar as a hair growth pill called Propecia.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Get More Union Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Labor unions are hedging their bets by  
increasing campaign contributions to moderate Republicans as they 
pledge millions of dollars to help their longtime allies the 
Democrats win control of the House in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the 20 labor unions that directed the most money to  
congressional candidates for last year's elections increased their 
contributions to Republicans by almost one-third, to $2.1 million, 
over the two-year 1996 election cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Although union money still overwhelmingly favors Democrats, a  
pattern of increasing contributions since Republicans took control 
of Congress in 1994 shows some unions believe if you can't beat 
'em, join 'em at a fund-raising dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real effort on our part to ensure that moderate  
Republicans -- those who are standing with working families -- are 
getting support from the labor movement,'' said Steve Rosenthal, 
the AFL-CIO's political director. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Republicans won control of Congress in 1994, the 20 union  
political action committees analyzed by The Associated Press gave 
only $881,630 to Republican candidates over the 1993-1994 election 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Labor unions are now falling into the pattern that we already  
saw in previous elections with other major PACs, which is to 
increase their funding to members of the majority party,'' said 
Anthony Corrado, a professor of government at Colby College in 
Waterville, Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this represents is basically conceding to the fact of  
Republican control of the Congress and the need to gain access to 
the members who will make the important decisions,'' Corrado said. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not to say the unions are abandoning their old friends:  
The same 20 labor PACs contributed far more, $27.2 million, to 
Democrats in 1997-98, a review of disclosure reports showed. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, AFL-CIO leaders have pledged to raise more than $40  
million for television ads and mobilizing voters for the 2000 
election, an effort that would primarily help Democratic 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Political reality, however, is forcing organized labor to reach  
out to moderates in the party that controls Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're always contributing to Democrats, it's going to be  
hard for them to get into the door to even meet Republicans,'' said 
Rep. Peter King of New York, a pro-union Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO's Rosenthal made a conciliatory move recently,  
assuring Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, chairman of the National 
Republican Congressional Committee, that unions would support 
pro-labor Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	NRCC officials also met with International Brotherhood of  
Teamsters representatives. Mike Mathis, Teamsters director of 
government affairs, said he was working to arrange a meeting 
between new union President James P. Hoffa and House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Education Association and its PAC so far this year  
have given $55,000 to national GOP committees and $5,000 to Rep. 
Johnny Isakson, the Georgia Republican elected to complete the 
congressional term of former Speaker Newt Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
	Another union, the American Federation of State, County and  
Municipal Employees, more than doubled its Republican giving, from 
$41,925 in 1995-96 to $92,000 in 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were not looking at parties. We were looking at records of  
candidates of both parties who stood with working families,'' 
federation spokeswoman Cheryl Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans welcome the union support.  
</P>
<P>
	``Union bosses and the Democrat Party have long marched together  
on the wrong side of issues affecting working Americans, like tax 
relief and job creation,'' Republican National Committee spokesman 
Tim Fitzpatrick said. ``This shift, small as it is, is an overdue 
sign that union leaders are finally listening to tens of thousands 
of American workers who vote Republican.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic National Committee spokesman Rick Hess said unions  
overwhelmingly favor his party because of its lawmakers' stands on 
issues including minimum wage, Medicare and Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not concerned that some members of the Republican Party  
are starting to moderate their anti-union concerns,'' Hess said. 
``We are concerned that the party that currently controls Congress 
has such a terrible labor record.''

<HEADLINE> Black Men Complain of Govt. Bias </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Black male employees of the Social Security  
Administration alleged today that the agency discriminates against 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Black males, in general, do not have a career at Social  
Security ... they have a job. There's a difference between the 
two,'' Harry Dunbar told a news conference. He was among scores of 
black men who work at Social Security headquarters near Baltimore 
who traveled by bus to the media event outside the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission's offices here. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunbar and two others filed a class-action complaint with the  
EEOC in 1995, alleging that black men get fewer promotions and more 
unsatisfactory job evaluations than warranted by their numbers at 
SSA headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	After a four-year delay caused by SSA's challenges to the men's  
right to pursue the complaint jointly, the EEOC ruled this year 
that the case could move forward. The commission has made no ruling 
yet on the merits of the complaints. A preliminary hearing before 
an EEOC judge is scheduled for May 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security officials denied that the agency treats black  
male employees unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Social Security is one of the most diverse, if not the most  
diverse agency in all of government,'' said Paul Barnes, SSA's 
deputy commissioner of human resources. ``We really do look like 
the America we serve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes said that at SSA headquarters, where the bias complaints  
are being made, 6.7 percent of workers are black men, compared with 
5.2 percent in the civilian work force nationally. Of the most 
senior executives, 10 percent are black men. And last year, 6.1 
percent of SSA headquarters employees who received promotions were 
black men. 
</P>
<P>
	As required by law, Social Security has notified 612 current and  
former black male employees of the agency's headquarters who are 
potential members of the class-action complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the three men who originated the charges -- Dunbar,  
Gilbert A. Jefferson and Kenneth A. Burden -- said they have heard 
from more than 100 others who claim to have had similar 
experiences. They are seeking monetary compensation for the men and 
changes in Social Security's personnel system to ensure fairness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Systematic discrimination has been going on against African  
Americans at the Social Security Administration for decades,'' said 
Michael Kator of the Washington labor-law firm Kator, Scott &AMP; 
Parks. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Kator said statistics on black women's experiences at  
SSA ``didn't bear out as great a disparity,'' as for black men. 
</P>
<P>
	According to 1994 figures reported by Social Security, Kator  
said, black men working at the agency's headquarters were twice as 
likely to receive ``unacceptable'' job evaluations as their numbers 
warranted and less than half as likely to receive ``outstanding'' 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	In one SSA department -- the Office of the Deputy Commissioner  
for Finance, Assessment and Management -- which employed 3,000 
people in 1994, black men comprised 9 percent of the work force. 
But they received 51.9 percent of the disciplinary actions, 75 
percent of the discharges and only 6.3 of the promotions to the top 
three federal pay grades.

<HEADLINE> Unions Giving More Support to GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Labor union leaders -- the Democrats' steadfast  
allies and dependable source of campaign cash -- are increasingly 
consorting with Republicans, even writing them fat checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the 20 labor unions that gave the most to  
congressional candidates for last year's elections increased their 
contributions to Republicans by almost one-third -- to a total of 
$2.1 million -- over the 1996 cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Which is not to say the unions are abandoning their old friends:  
The same political action committees contributed far more, $27.2 
million, to Democrats, a review of disclosure reports found. 
</P>
<P>
	But political reality is forcing organized labor to reach out to  
moderates in the party that controls Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, the National Education Association has given  
$55,000 in unregulated ``soft money'' and PAC contributions to 
national Republican Party committees and $5,000 to Rep. Johnny 
Isakson, the Georgia Republican elected to complete the 
congressional term of former Speaker Newt Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making a concerted effort to do our politics based on  
the issue and not based on the party,'' said Mary Elizabeth 
Teasley, the NEA's director of government relations. ``We 
contribute based on how they measure up on the issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NEA's political action committee still overwhelmingly favors  
Democrats over Republicans, some of whom have sought to abolish the 
U.S. Department of Education and to use tax dollars for private 
schools. But the ratio is shifting. 
</P>
<P>
	The NEA's PAC gave $97,850 to Republicans candidates in last  
year's races -- eight times its $11,850 in contributions to GOP 
candidates for the previous election. 
</P>
<P>
	The hefty $1.8 million the NEA gave Democrats for 1998's races  
was a drop from the $2.3 million it gave Democrats for the 1996 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Labor realized after '96 that Republicans were here to stay,''  
said Rep. Peter King of New York, a pro-union Republican. ``They 
would have to deal with Republicans. One of the ways is by 
attending Republican events and socializing with Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It also helps to contribute rather than being marked as the  
enemy,'' King said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Republicans won control of Congress in 1994, the 20  
unions analyzed by The Associated Press gave only $881,630 to 
Republican candidates over the 1993-1994 election cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor unions remain dedicated to helping Democrats wrest control  
of the House from the GOP in 2000, pledging not only PAC 
contributions but millions of dollars for issue advertising. Giving 
a little more to the Republicans, especially to moderates, is a way 
to hedge their bets and move toward a truce. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO's political director, Steve Rosenthal, made a  
conciliatory move recently, assuring Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, 
chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, that 
unions would support pro-labor Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last couple of years, we have tried hard to find  
those Republicans who are willing to take hard stands, usually 
against the party leadership, in support of issues that really 
matter to working people,'' Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
	But a skeptical NRCC Executive Director Scott Hatch said he was  
waiting to see ``if the union bosses back up their rhetoric.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NRCC officials also met with International Brotherhood of  
Teamsters representatives. Mike Mathis, the Teamsters' director of 
government affairs, said he was working to arrange a meeting 
between new union President James P. Hoffa and House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the union to fully represent our membership, we need to  
have our doors open to politicians who will support working 
families regardless of which party they're in,'' Mathis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters PAC boosted its Republican giving to $151,800 for  
last year's races, up from $100,810 for the 1996 election. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee gave 13 times that amount to Democrats: $2  
million. But that was down from $2.4 million Democratic candidates 
received in 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic National Committee spokesman Rick Hess said unions  
overwhelmingly favor his party because of its lawmakers' stands on 
issues including minimum wage, Medicare and Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not concerned that some members of the Republican Party  
are starting to moderate their anti-union concerns,'' Hess said. 
``We are concerned that the party that currently controls Congress 
has such a terrible labor record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King said contributions to Republicans help him argue against  
union-bashing within the House GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's wrong for Republicans to write off labor the way we  
started doing in '94,'' King said. ``And it's just as wrong for 
labor to write off Republicans.''

<HEADLINE> Aetna Sued Under Racketeering Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Three Aetna Inc. members and a consumer  
group on Monday sued the giant health maintenance organization for 
false advertising. It was the first lawsuit against an HMO under a 
federal anti-racketeering law. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, claims Aetna  
attracted potential customers by saying it was dedicated to quality 
medical care. Instead, the company encourages system-wide 
cost-cutting that undermines medical care, the lawsuit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed by Joseph and Jo Ann Maio of Philadelphia  
and Gary Bender of suburban Philadelphia on behalf of nearly 6 
million people who enrolled or renewed HMO membership in Aetna from 
July 1996 to the present. The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer 
Rights, a Santa Monica, Calif., consumer group, is representing the 
HMO members. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages and asks that  
Aetna stop misleading customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with Aetna, based in Hartford, Conn., refused to  
comment on the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aetna should no longer be able to advertise and represent that  
they are primarily committed to quality, when in fact they have 
systems in place that eviscerate quality medical care,'' said Jamie 
Court, advocacy director for the consumer group. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia, is  
believed to be the first filed against an HMO under the federal 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. A series of 
Supreme Court rulings in the past year has permitted broad use of 
RICO, a law originally aimed at mobsters, and allowed lawsuits by 
anyone allegedly harmed by a pattern of illegal activities. The law 
has been invoked to accuse numerous huge corporations of 
racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accused Aetna of undermining medical care, in part,  
by offering financial incentives to doctors who see more patients 
and penalizing doctors who do not.

<HEADLINE> Salon.Com Planing IPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The online magazine Salon.com plans to  
raise as much as $34 million in an initial public offering by 
auctioning its stock over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Bids were being taken online Monday through W.R. Hambrecht +  
Co.'s OpenIPO system. Daiwa Securities America Inc. also is 
underwriting the IPO. 
</P>
<P>
	Salon is offering 2.5 million shares of common stock at $10.50  
to $13.50 a share in the auction, which is expected to close June 
14. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the auction, Investors can bid what they think is a fair  
price for a stake in Salon. When the auction closes, those with the 
highest bids will purchase shares -- but at the lowest winning bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Salon, with 74 employees and 1.2 million readers, hopes to  
become a premier Internet destination, attracting advertisers and 
business partners with its network of ten demographically-targeted 
Web sites and a variety of online communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Company executives wouldn't comment on the IPO Monday, citing  
federal rules against influencing the stock sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Internet content providers trying to attract premium  
audiences have struggled to make money. Microsoft's Slate magazine 
dropped its subscription fee in February, joining other publishers 
that failed to attract enough paying customers. 
</P>
<P>
	But many recent Internet IPOs have fared well. Last month,  
shares of iVillage, a Web site for women, tripled on their first 
day of trading, raising $88 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Salon Magazine changed its name to Salon.com earlier this month  
after buying the domain name www.salon.com from a Texas hairdresser 
for an unannounced price. Before, Salon was stuck with the more 
prosaic salonmagazine.com, and many would-be readers were led to 
the wrong site in frustration.

<HEADLINE> Little Insight on India's New Govt. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Photos DEL108    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Sonia Gandhi and the Congress Party said  
today they are waiting for India's president to ask them to lead a 
new government, but gave no clue about what form it would take. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi, the widow of assassinated Prime Minister Rajiv  
Gandhi, met with her 140 lawmakers to discuss a Congress-led 
coalition to replace the Hindu nationalist-led one that collapsed 
by one vote on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are certainly going to form the government,'' Mrs. Gandhi  
said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consultations are going on with members of the other  
parties,'' she said. But differences are already flaring up among 
the groups that could support a Congress government. Two of the 
five communist and leftist parties that Mrs. Gandhi needs said they 
opposed joining Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we didn't have differences why would we be meeting?''  
communist leader A.B. Bardhan told The Associated Press after a 
gathering of communist groups. He said further discussions would be 
held after India's national budget is approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress leaders said they had unanimously agreed to let the  
Italian-born Mrs. Gandhi, their choice for prime minister and a 
political novice, make whatever decisions are needed to form a new 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as there is an invitation from the president, Sonia  
Gandhi will call on him,'' Congress party spokesman Arjun Singh 
said. ``There will be no problem in forming an alternative 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Bharatiya Janata Party, which led the government  
that collapsed Saturday, charged that Congress does not have enough 
support to form a long-term majority coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	The BJP demanded that the president reject anything less than a  
solid majority, since he required that Prime Minister Atal Bihari 
Vajpayee show he had support from a majority of Parliament before 
he took office 13 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Congress party can't provide a viable alternative  
government,'' BJP spokesman Venkaiah Naidu said Monday. ``The 
choice is the Vajpayee government or fresh elections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Congress party agreed that the proposed budget of  
the outgoing government would be adopted Wednesday without debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not want to create any financial crisis arising out of  
the non-passage of the annual budget,'' Mrs. Gandhi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Politicians believe President K.R. Narayanan is waiting for the  
budget to actually pass the fractious 45-party lower house on 
Wednesday before inviting anyone to form a government. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market, which plunged 7 percent when Vajpayee lost the  
confidence vote Saturday, responded positively to the news that the 
pro-business budget would pass by rising 3.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a budget, the government would run out of spending power  
by mid-May, tax provisions that went into effect in April would 
have to be reversed, and investors would see India as even more 
risky. 
</P>
<P>
	But business and industry remain nervous about the strong  
possibility of India's third election in as many years if Congress, 
which has fewer seats in Parliament than Vajpayee's BJP, fails to 
muster a stable government.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Foes Target High Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- With a promise to attack the ills of  
America, abortion protesters showed graphic photos outside two high 
schools today in an effort to end teen sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Handfuls of demonstrators, members of a group staging a weeklong  
Operation Save America campaign here, displayed signs and pictures 
of aborted fetuses outside the schools as part of a ``truth 
campaign'' intended to promote abstinence and prevent unwanted 
pregnancy and abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	While some students averted their eyes from the graphic photos,  
others were indifferent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of the Constitution,'' shrugged Jeremy Peters, a  
sophomore at Kenmore East High School. ``As long as they don't hurt 
anyone, it really doesn't bother me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abortion rights activists have condemned the timing and choice  
of location for Operation Save America. The campaign was announced 
a week after last October's sniper killing of abortion provider Dr. 
Barnett Slepian inside his home in the Buffalo suburb of Amherst. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schopf said the event was planned long in advance of the  
doctor's death, which remains unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Demonstrators also targeted Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders  
bookstores for selling books by photographers Jock Sturges and 
David Hamilton that contain nude photos of children. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're using our children as sexual toys,'' the Rev. Flip  
Benham, national director of Operation Rescue, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 demonstrators, who seemed evenly divided between  
anti-abortion and abortion-rights activists, stood today outside 
Barnes &AMP; Noble in East Amherst. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-abortion demonstration annoyed store patron Art Plant,  
a retired teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pro-life and a Christian and this is ridiculous,'' Plant  
said. ``This is not what Christ would have wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I can understand their being upset with abortion clinics,''  
Plant said, ``but bookstores have a right to sell what they deem 
appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Barnes &AMP; Noble said the bookseller will not  
remove books from the shelves. Supporters of the two photographers 
say the books are art, not pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the years, we have received countless requests and  
demands to stop selling everything from `The Merchant of Venice' to 
`The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,' `The Rise and Fall of the 
Third Reich,' even `The Living Bible,''' said Mary Ellen Keating. 
</P>
<P>
	The weeklong campaign began Sunday with a noisy clash with  
abortion rights supporters on the steps of a federal courthouse. 
The crowd of about 150 people appeared evenly divided between 
abortion opponents, abortion rights supporters and reporters and 
photographers. 
</P>
<P>
	Local and national organizers sent out 60,000 invitations to  
this week's activities, but only a fraction of that number -- 200 to 
600 people -- were expected to participate. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no indication whether demonstrators will obey a court  
order that they remain 15 feet to 60 feet away from specified 
doctors' offices, clinics and hospitals. Protesters who invade the 
buffer zones may face contempt and trespassing charges carrying 
jail terms of up to two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel we need to honor God's law first. No man's law can be  
worthy unless it first honors God's law,'' Eileen Schopf, 
spokeswoman for Operation Save America and Last Call Ministries, 
said Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Ripken Put on DL for First Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken, baseball's Iron Man, was placed on  
the disabled list Monday for the first time in his 19-year career 
because of a bad back. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baltimore Orioles third baseman missed his fourth game this  
season Sunday because of nerve irritation in his lower back. He was 
placed on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, 38, woke up in agony Sunday morning and was treated  
Monday in Cleveland by Dr. Henry Bohlman, professor of orthopedics 
at Case Western University. Ripken received a cortisone shot and 
was advised to stay off the field for the next couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken is batting only .178 and has five errors in eight games.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right now we're going with rehabilitation and therapy. He will  
get a few more cortisone shots, relax a little bit and take the 
full two weeks to work his way back,'' Orioles general manager 
Frank Wren said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wren said that surgery is not an option at this time.  
</P>
<P>
	``He got a cortisone shot the last time he had trouble with his  
back during the first week of the season,'' he said. ``He wanted to 
get back quickly, as one would expect. But this time he needs to go 
slower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last Sept. 20, Ripken voluntarily ended his record consecutive  
games streak by sitting out the Orioles' final home game against 
the New York Yankees. It was the first game he missed since 
beginning his record streak of 2,632 games on May 30, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, whose father, Cal Sr., died shortly before the season  
started, was removed in the third inning of the Orioles' opener on 
April 5 because of back pain. He sat out Baltimore's next game -- 
the first game he missed because of injury since his rookie season 
in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken also missed the Orioles' next game and was benched in New  
York last week after committing two errors on one play the night 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question his back has affected his play,'' Wren  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the streak Ripken survived two ankle injuries, a twisted  
knee and a herniated disk in his back in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	None of those injuries affected him the way his back injury has.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's remarkable he's gone this long without being put on the  
disabled list,'' Wren said. ``The pounding he takes, the work ethic 
he has, it's just amazing this had not happened before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken will be replaced at third base by rookie Willis Otanez.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Euro, Down Vs. Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the euro and other major  
European currencies Monday as the chief of the European Central 
Bank said the bank had no plans to intervene in foreign exchange 
markets to aid the ailing new currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell slightly against the yen as U.S. stocks  
plummeted Monday, wiping out gains the U.S. currency made following 
statements by Japanese officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0638, down  
from $1.0702 late Friday. During the trading day, the euro reached 
$1.0590, the lowest point since its launch at the beginning of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was worth 117.58 Japanese yen, down from 117.85 yen.  
</P>
<P>
	Traders sold off their European currencies Monday after ECB  
President Wim Duisenberg said bluntly that the ECB had done its 
share of work protecting the euro, including lowering interest 
rates, and that it is not likely to intervene to help further. 
</P>
<P>
	ECB officials have recently said that individual countries must  
make the necessary structural and other reforms to strengthen their 
faltering economies. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro, the currency of 11 European nations, has fallen nearly  
9 percent since its launch in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, it's out of the central bank's hands,'' said  
Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer at Bank Leumi USA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Duisenberg's comments (help explain) why traders who like to  
push the limits will test how far they can push the dollar against 
the euro.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traders also perceive that Europe will be financing any ground  
war that occurs in Yugoslavia, where NATO's air campaign entered 
its 24th day Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dollar is gaining strength on the euro because the  
military action in Yugoslavia is not coming to a quick 
conclusion,'' Waxman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar initially gained against the yen as Eisuke  
Sakakibara, Japan's vice minister of Finance for international 
affairs, said that Japan would prevent what he called premature 
strengthening of the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Dow Jones industrial average took a wild swing Monday,  
erasing a 270-point gain to end 53 points lower and blunt the 
dollar's gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 1.5035 Swiss francs, up from 1.4961,  
and 1.4855 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4795. The British pound was 
quoted at $1.6116, up from $1.6142. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro no  
longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8386 
German marks, up from 1.8275; 6.1652 French francs, up from 6.1275; 
and 1,818.18 Italian lire, up from 1,808.32.

<HEADLINE>  Toyota, GM To Make Fuel-Cell Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Toyota Motor Corp. and General Motors Corp. have  
reached a five-year agreement to jointly develop cars and trucks 
that can run off fuel cells and other environmentally friendly 
alternative-fuel technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pooling our efforts should result in commercially viable  
advanced technologies faster and at a lower cost to our customers, 
and as breakthroughs are reached, suppliers will be able to count 
on the volume of production from two of the world's largest 
automakers,'' GM vice chairman Harry Pearce said in remarks 
prepared for delivery today at a Detroit news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	GM, the world's largest automaker, and No. 3 Toyota have worked  
on several joint ventures, including a California-based venture to 
produce small cars and to market of GM's Cavalier cars through 
Toyota's sales network in Japan. They had been in talks on the 
advanced technology venture since last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The new venture will involve research and development of  
electric, hybrid electric and fuel-cell technology. Hybrid electric 
vehicles typically combine an electric motor with other power 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is to last through 2004, the year that GM, Ford Motor  
Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG have said they plan to be ready to 
produce fuel-cell vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's announcement also comes a day before Ford,  
DaimlerChrysler and Ballard Power Systems Inc., a fuel-cell 
developer, plan to announce a deal with oil companies to develop a 
demonstration fleet of fuel-cell powered vehicles in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuel cells produce electricity using a chemical reaction between  
hydrogen and oxygen and produce little or no emissions. The 
technology was developed for use in spacecraft, but problems in 
supplying and storing hydrogen have hampered plans to use it for 
cars. So far, fuel cells remain prohibitively expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler has been working on technology to convert  
gasoline to hydrogen on board the car, eliminating the need for a 
heavy, expensive hydrogen storage tank. 
</P>
<P>
	GM and Toyota have been working on alternative-fuel vehicles for  
years. GM was the first to mass-market an electric car, the EV1, 
which has failed to catch on in the markets where it is being 
leased. Toyota brought the first hybrid electric car to market, the 
Prius, in Japan two years ago. The Prius uses gasoline and 
electricity and is scheduled to go on sale in the United States and 
Europe next year.

<HEADLINE> CDC Eases Mercury Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal health agency relaxed its standard  
Monday on when mercury contamination, especially from eating fish, 
poses a threat to human health, prompting complaints from some 
members of Congress and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised health standard issued by an arm of the Centers for  
Disease Control and Prevention allows three times as much mercury 
contamination as the standard currently used by the Environmental 
Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said the ``dramatic relaxation'' of  
the standard by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease 
Registry ``will only cause more confusion'' about how much mercury 
consumption poses a danger to health. 
</P>
<P>
	The health impact of low levels of mercury contamination has  
been widely disputed. Congress last year barred further regulation 
of mercury until the National Academy of Sciences completes a study 
of the health effects next year. 
</P>
<P>
	But environmentalists as well as some state officials said the  
easing of the standard by the federal health agency will send the 
wrong message to the public -- as well as to industry -- that mercury 
contamination is not an urgent problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The health agency said that based on the latest studies people  
can consume as much as 0.3 micrograms of mercury per kilogram of 
their body weight without health risks. Its previous standard and 
the standard used by the EPA has been 0.1 microgram. 
</P>
<P>
	The standard, formally known as the ``minimal risk level,'' is  
often used by state health officials to calculate maximum fish 
consumption and, in turn, fishing advisories. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATSDR, as the agency is known, said the revised standard, or  
toxicity profile, should not be used by states and other agencies 
to change existing fish advisories nor cause the federal Food and 
Drug Administration to change its consumption advisories of 
commercial fish. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics said they were concerned that easing of the standard  
will be used by the fishing industry to argue against fish 
advisories and by electric utilities to argue against regulation of 
mercury emissions from power plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The health agency ``is doing the downfield blocking on the  
mercury issue for special interest groups,'' complained Michael 
Bender, director of the Mercury Policy Project, based in 
Montpelier, Vt., an advocacy group active in lobbying for tighter 
controls on mercury emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Skipper, a spokeswoman for the ATSDR, said the change in  
the agency's minimum toxicity standard ``reflects the latest 
studies'' on mercury contamination and ``adds to the body of 
knowledge.'' She said it may be further revised once the National 
Academy of Sciences findings come out next year. 
</P>
<P>
	But environmentalists argued that the health agency has relied  
too heavily on a disputed study of mercury exposure to pregnant 
women in the Seychelles Islands that minimized the health impact, 
while given less importance to another study in the Faroe Islands 
off Scotland that had opposite findings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (the ATSDR) have an agenda that they only want to push  
the Seychelles study,'' argued Bender.

<HEADLINE> GM-Toyota Deal May Bring More Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- An advanced-technology research and development  
deal between General Motors Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp. could lead 
to even broader cooperation between the two global automakers, GM's 
No. 2 executive says. 
</P>
<P>
	A merged GM and Toyota would account for more than one quarter  
of the world's car and truck sales, but GM vice chairman Harry 
Pearce stopped short Monday of predicting such a linkup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would certainly be premature to talk about a merger,''  
Pearce said in an interview. ``But I think it's important for both 
companies to have a very open mind in terms of where this kind of 
collaboration takes us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce's provocative comment came after he and Toyota vice  
president Akihiro Wada announced a five-year deal to jointly 
research and develop alternative-fuel vehicles. Pearce said both 
sides expected the venture to last well beyond five years as ``a 
long-term and continuing collaboration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've both proven ourselves to be technical innovators  
in a variety of ways that make this a very, very strong 
combination,'' Pearce said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM is the world's largest automaker; Japan's Toyota is ranked  
third, behind Ford Motor Co. Pearce said their joint efforts in 
advanced technology research would give them a tremendous 
competitive advantage. He said he hoped it would lead to joint 
production of nonpolluting vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	David Cole, who directs the University of Michigan's Office for  
the Study of Automotive Transportation, said a GM-Toyota merger 
seems unlikely because of the antitrust issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though it may not be the barrier that it once was, it would be  
fascinating to see,'' Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM chairman Jack Smith and Toyota chairman Shoichiro Toyoda have  
had a close relationship for more than 15 years, dating back to 
their establishment of a joint assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., 
that still produces Toyota Corollas and Chevrolet Prizm 
subcompacts. 
</P>
<P>
	``What that sort of backdrop says is this is not something new  
or unique,'' Cole said of the technology deal. ``With the richness 
of the relationship that has developed, it creates the foundation 
for some very deep relationships in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GM-Toyota research will initially focus on vehicles powered  
by fuel cells, batteries and hybrid propulsion systems that combine 
different technologies, such as electric motors and high-efficiency 
gasoline engines. Fuel cells generate electricity using a chemical 
reaction between hydrogen and oxygen and produce little or no 
emissions. So far they are too expensive for mass production cars. 
</P>
<P>
	GM was the first major automaker to mass-market a modern  
electric car, the EV1. Though demand has been disappointing, it has 
provided a real-world test of the technology that will be used in 
developing other electric propulsion systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota was the first to sell a hybrid electric car in Japan, the  
Prius, which will go on sale in the United States and Europe next 
year. Wada said Toyota is working to bring the subcompact's cost 
down to about the price of a Corolla in the United States and to 
make a profit. Currently, the car is a money-loser. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce, meanwhile, would not rule out the possibility that GM  
would rename the Prius as a Chevrolet. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers have become increasingly competitive in trying to  
establish themselves as leaders in environmentally friendly 
technology to impress Wall Street, consumers and to attract 
high-tech talent. 
</P>
<P>
	GM-Toyota's announcement came one day before Ford,  
DaimlerChrysler AG and fuel-cell developer Ballard Power Systems 
Inc. planned to announce a deal with three oil companies to develop 
a demonstration fleet of fuel-cell powered vehicles in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce and Wada declined to say how much they would spend on  
their collaboration but Pearce said it would be substantial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking hundreds and hundreds of engineers, and major  
dedication of human resources and capital and laboratory facilities 
around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that suppliers likely will contribute much of the  
technology and engineering that will go into the cars of the 
future. That's where the combined size of GM-Toyota will make a 
difference, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were a resident in the supplier community and I was  
approached by a partnership or collaboration that represented a 
quarter of the world's market, I would pay a lot of attention to 
that,'' Pearce said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce also said the deal will allow GM and Toyota to take  
advantage of their combined size to get the lowest prices for 
materials and parts, and to define technical standards for emerging 
technologies.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Dole Supports Ground Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole, a Republican presidential  
hopeful fresh from her trip to Macedonia, said today that U.S.-led 
NATO ground troops should be ``pre-positioned in the theater'' and 
prepared to attack if necessary to end the purge of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a war,'' she said in a telephone interview with The  
Associated Press. ``We've got to win it, and win it absolutely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former American Red Cross president, a veteran of scores of  
humanitarian crises, said she was moved by her visit to refugee 
camps and the harrowing stories of Serbian attacks in Kosovo. 
``I've seen a lot of things that will haunt me forever,'' she said. 
``This is among the worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole and a crowded field of attention-starved GOP  
presidential candidates are eager to find a voice in the debate 
over the Yugoslavia conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, urged the Clinton administration  
Friday to pursue mediation with Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic rather than escalate the conflict. With her remarks, Mrs. 
Dole staked out a hard-line stance with fellow GOP hopeful Sen. 
John McCain of Arizona, a former prisoner of war who has said for 
weeks that the United States must do whatever necessary to win. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain has criticized Clinton for ruling out the use of ground  
troops, a stance Mrs. Dole echoed. 
</P>
<P>
	``With NATO meeting (in Washington) this week, the United States  
should demand military and humanitarian victories by calling for 
the pre-positioning of ground forces,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Would she support a ground war?  
</P>
<P>
	``If NATO commanders and the Joint Chiefs of Staff say ground  
troops, I say absolutely. I'd follow what they think is necessary. 
If that's ground troops, so be it,'' Mrs. Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should be pre-positioned in the theater so they'd be  
ready,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how many U.S. troops she thought might be killed in a  
ground war, Mrs. Dole said, ``That's not something I'm in position 
to know. All I know is we have to win this war absolutely.'' 
</P>

	She also called for more intense airstrikes, suggesting that the  
Clinton administration has hampered Pentagon planners. ``I think 
the political leaders have defined what we're doing, not the 
military leaders,'' she said. ``Let the military leaders do their 
jobs.''

	Mrs. Dole, wife of 1996 presidential nominee Bob Dole, said  
Milosevic should be branded a war criminal and eventually brought 
to justice.

of the area,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Cops Criticized in Freaknik Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Extra police called out for the annual Freaknik  
weekend were sometimes too aggressive, said a member of the city's 
advisory committee for the event that draws thousands of college 
students and sometimes turns violent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Markel Hutchins said yesterday that police stopped him  
twice during the weekend and he had heard of other party-goers 
being verbally assaulted by officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe in police doing their job but we do not believe in  
excessive policing and police brutality,'' said the 21-year-old 
Morehouse College student. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchins said he saw groups of young men on a downtown sidewalk  
and in Lenox Mall being told by police that they would be ticketed 
if they didn't move on. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is America. You can stand on the sidewalk and have a  
conversation,'' he said. ``This is not against the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Party-goers, vendors and police said the crowd at Freaknik '99  
was down drastically from years past. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than traffic tie-ups caused by students cruising around  
downtown, there were few signs of the uninhibited partying that has 
become associated with Freaknik, also called Black College Spring 
Break. The event has previously generated complaints of loud music, 
public lewdness, drunkenness and traffic gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to Hutchins' criticism, police spokesman John  
Quigley said, ``The police have to be deployed in preparation of a 
heavy volume, because we don't want to get caught short.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By Sunday night, police had made 353 arrests. There were 481  
arrests last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Quigley said no sexual offenses were reported and no other  
serious incidents were associated with this year's Freaknik. 
</P>
<P>
	During last year's event, four rapes, six sexual assaults and  
four shootings were reported.

</P>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Grace Zia Chu, who introduced Americans to  
Chinese cooking through her book ``The Pleasures of Chinese 
Cooking, died Thursday. She was 99. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Chu, who assumed that her readers knew nothing about  
Chinese cuisine, wrote clearly and simply to tailor her recipes for 
American kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Chu lived in Washington during World War II when her  
husband was posted as a military attache to the Chinese embassy, 
but returned to China at the end of the war. 
</P>
<P>
	They returned to the United States in 1950, settling in  
Manhattan in 1955. She wrote ``The Pleasures of Chinese Cooking'' 
in 1962. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- James Copp, a cabaret singer and society  
columnist who also wrote children's songs, died April 7 of 
respiratory problems, the Los Angeles Times reported. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Copp collaborated with Ed Brown, a University of Southern  
California graduate, linguist and designer and wrote scripts for 
the albums. They were recorded at Copp's Los Angeles home. 
</P>
<P>
	The zany songs described quirky characters such as the Glup  
family who traveled in a broken-down car with their pet cow. The 
duo made nine albums, and they are considered classics among 
children's recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	His act, called James Copp III and His Thing, caught the eye of  
a Columbia Records talent scout and Copp soon headlined with 
performers such as Billie Holiday, Art Tatum and Lena Horne in New 
York cabarets. 
</P>
<P>
	After serving in the Army during World War II, he returned to  
Los Angeles and wrote the column ``Skylarking with James Copp,'' 
for the Los Angeles Times, beginning in 1950.

	BEIJING (AP) -- Cao Huoxing, whose best-known song, ``Without the  
Communist Party there would be no new China,'' died Friday at age 
75, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cao began composing at age 16 and wrote more than 1,500 songs.  
</P>

</P>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Former East German Premier Willi Stoph, who was  
dropped as a defendant in a manslaughter trial for killings at the 
Berlin Wall because of illness, died April 13 of a long illness. He 
was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoph joined a Communist youth group in 1928. He served in  
Hitler's army as a private in the artillery from 1940-42 and was 
released after being wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	He became East Germany's first defense minister in 1956 and was  
known as the architect of the East German People's Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoph moved up in East Germany's Politburo hierarchy to become  
premier in 1970, succeeding Otto Grotewohl. 
</P>
<P>
	As East Germany's communist rulers faced growing pressure for  
reform from a peaceful, popular uprising, Stoph was ousted Nov. 7, 
1989, along with East German leader Erich Honecker. Two days later, 
the Berlin Wall was opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Honecker and four other defendants, Stoph went on  
trial in Berlin on Nov. 13, 1992, charged with 13 counts of 
manslaughter in the killings of people trying to escape East 
Germany. He was dropped from the case in August 1993 after the 
court decided he was too sick to continue because of heart 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Honecker was also dropped from the trial due to illness. He died  
in exile in Chile in 1994.

<HEADLINE> 'Freedom Rides' To Be Recreated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Civil rights and Jewish leaders said today  
they plan to recreate the historic bus rides of the 1960s that 
carried thousands of college students and other activists to the 
segregated South. 
</P>
<P>
	The caravans, planned for June, will commemorate the murders in  
Philadelphia, Miss., of three civil rights activists in the summer 
of 1964, said Rabbi David Saperstein, director of the Religious 
Action Center of Reform Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
	James Chaney, a black Catholic from Mississippi, and Andrew  
Goodman and Michael Schwerner, two Jewish men from New York, were 
killed by the local Ku Klux Klan. The three were members of CORE, 
the Congress of Racial Equality, and were active in helping 
disenfranchised blacks register to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The rides will mirror the civil rights activism of the decade,  
with young adults retracing the steps of the original ``freedom 
riders,'' as they were called, and stopping at historic sites and 
mostly black colleges and universities along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Saperstein was joined for the announcement by Julian Bond,  
chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored 
People, and Ben Chaney, national director of the Chaney Goodman 
Schwerner Unity Coalition, whose brother was one of those killed.

<HEADLINE> Teacher of Year Makes Lessons Fun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Andrew Baumgartner, a Georgia kindergarten  
teacher, will try just about anything to coax his kids to learn. 
</P>
<P>
	Baumgartner, who has held a wedding for Sleeping Beauty complete  
with limousine and cake, was honored by President Clinton today as 
the 1999 National Teacher of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The role of teachers, while hard to exaggerate, unfortunately  
is too often easy to overlook,'' Clinton said at the White House 
ceremony in Baumgartner's honor. ``The best way we can honor 
America's teachers is for the rest of us to give them the tools to 
succeed with our children in the 21st century,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``Classes should be an adventure every day,'' said Baumgartner,  
who was teaching at A. Brian Merry Elementary School, in Augusta, 
Ga., when he went on leave last year to tour for his honor of 1998 
Georgia Teacher of the Year. ``They (classes) should be places 
where children discover ... where failure is kept at bay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baumgartner, 46, the first Georgia winner of the national  
contest, believes in spreading the magic of learning at the 
530-student school, where 58 percent of students get a free lunch, 
educators' most common measure of student poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	A teacher for 23 years, Baumgartner has battled his share of  
educational demons, even in his own family. He went through the 
pain of watching his son, diagnosed with multiple learning 
disabilities, fail in class and eventually drop out of school in 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is one of the students who fell between the cracks,''  
Baumgartner said in a recent interview. ``When a school fails a 
child, it fails an entire family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His son, now 21, got his general equivalency certificate and is  
enrolled in an Augusta technical school. The experience forced 
Baumgartner to re-evaluate his own teaching style: ``It turned me 
into the teacher who became the teacher of the year. I had to dig 
down deep and figure out who I was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baumgartner, a former Marine who went on to earn a master's  
degree in early childhood education from North Georgia College, 
never thought the littlest kids would be too tough to handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a real thirst for learning,'' he said. ``They're  
still very eager to try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's also fought to overcome skepticism toward male teachers,  
especially ones in the early grades. More than three-fourths of the 
nation's teachers are women. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stereotype was they had to be motherly women, maternal,''  
he said. ``I had to show that I could be paternal, which is just as 
good or better since many of these kids don't have fathers at 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Little boys in school need to see men succeeding.''  
</P>
<P>
	Baumgartner, originally from Savannah, Ga., was inspired to  
teach by his minister father. ``We were taught that we'd been so 
blessed by God that it was our duty to give something back. I did 
that by having a career in service,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He will spend a year on promotional tours as teacher of the  
year. The award is sponsored by the Council of Chief State School 
Officers and Scholastic Inc., the educational publishers. 
</P>
<P>
	Baumgartner wants to use his tenure to emphasize that teachers  
and principals shouldn't be alone in setting high academic 
standards for schoolchildren 
</P>
<P>
	``Every one must be accountable for the public education  
system,'' he said. ``That's why it's called the public education 
system.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Labs Have Ignored Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department ignored many warnings  
about security risks at nuclear weapons labs over decades as 
dangers ``languished for years without resolution or 
repercussions'' against responsible officials, congressional 
investigators conclude in a scathing report. 
</P>
<P>
	With the labs now under heightened scrutiny because of  
allegations that China stole nuclear secrets, the General 
Accounting Office documented the warnings it has issued in 32 
reports over the past 19 years, citing nearly 50 recommendations it 
claimed were mostly neglected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Managers and contractors have shown a lack of attention and/or  
priority to security matters,'' according to testimony prepared for 
a House Commerce Committee hearing Tuesday and obtained by The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Victor S. Rezendes, director of the GAO division that studies  
energy and scientific issues, said the Energy Department recently 
brought in the FBI to assist with counterintelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents had been brought in a decade ago for similar help but  
left in the early 1990s ``because of resistance within DOE to 
implementing the measures the FBI staff believed necessary to 
improve security,'' reported the GAO, Congress' investigative arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Monday the department is  
taking ``very aggressive steps'' to fix the problems cited by the 
GAO, including: 
</P>
<P>
	--Increasing the counterintelligence budget from $2.6 million to  
$39.2 million since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	--Appointing a CIA and FBI veteran, Ed Curran, as director of  
counterintelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	--Placing seasoned counterintelligence professionals at nuclear  
weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Instituting a new lie detector program.  
</P>
<P>
	--Revamping the foreign visitors' program, to include background  
checks for all visitors from countries considered ``sensitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Since taking over as secretary of energy (in August 1998),  
nothing has been more important to me than ensuring that the 
security and counterintelligence capabilities of the department are 
top-notch,'' Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House Commerce  
Committee reviewing the labs' practices, said he wanted to see 
``whether the administration's announced reforms will truly do the 
job, but if history is any guide, I have my doubts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rezendes said the most serious problems that were not addressed  
by the department over the past two decades were: 
</P>
<P>
	--Ineffective controls over foreign visitors to the most  
sensitive Energy Department facilities. In 1988 and again in 1997, 
the GAO found ``that foreign visitors are allowed into ... nuclear 
weapons design laboratories with few background checks'' and that 
counterintelligence programs ``received little priority and 
attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Weaknesses in efforts to control and protect classified and  
sensitive information. In one instance, a facility could not 
account for 10,000 classified documents. 
</P>
<P>
	--Lack of physical security such as fences and security personnel  
who, through the years, have proved unable to demonstrate basic 
skills such as arresting intruders, shooting accurately or using 
handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Backlogs in security clearances. And at times when backlogs  
were reduced, contractors were failing to verify background 
information on prospective employees. 
</P>
<P>
	--A failure to track and control nuclear materials, including  
material sent overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Efforts to address security problems have languished for years  
without resolution or repercussions to those organizations 
responsible,'' the investigators reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, DOE disclosed that it had evidence indicating  
China obtained information about the United States' most advanced 
nuclear warhead and had used that information to develop its own 
smaller, more deliverable nuclear weapons. A Los Alamos, N.M., 
laboratory employee was fired, but no charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
	As an example of the lingering, unaddressed problems, the GAO  
report cited findings -- originally in 1988 -- that the required 
background checks were performed for fewer than 10 percent of the 
visitors from sensitive countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result, visitors with questionable backgrounds --  
including connections with foreign intelligence services -- obtained 
access to the laboratories without DOE's knowledge,'' the report 
said. The agency wasn't even aware of many visits, the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the agency reviewed the same problem in 1997, ``procedures  
for obtaining background checks had not been effectively 
implemented and at two facilities, background checks were being 
conducted on only 5 percent of visitors from all sensitive 
countries and on less than 2 percent of the visitors from China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Alamos facility in New Mexico allowed ``unescorted,  
after-hours access to controlled areas'' to preserve an ``open 
campus'' atmosphere, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Two Mnths Until Women's World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rarely has the future of a sport depended so  
much on the achievements of one team. 
</P>
<P>
	That seems to be the case for women's soccer, at least in the  
United States, which will play host to the Women's World Cup this 
summer. For the women's brand of the planet's most popular sport, 
this is a pivotal tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	And if the American team doesn't fare well, it could mean a  
farewell to any thoughts of establishing a women's professional 
league in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is not necessarily to get a league,'' Kristine Lilly,  
who has appeared in more internationals than any American soccer 
player, said Monday at a news conference to unveil FIFA's 
tournament trophy and the official song for the event. ``We want 
one, and if we do well it will get a league, so that definitely is 
in the back of our minds. But that's all it can be. 
</P>
<P>
	``This World Cup is what we have been waiting for, the moment  
for people to start watching us and for us to get more fans each 
and every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1994 men's World Cup -- FIFA's most-attended event -- led to  
the establishment of the MLS. That occurred even though the 
American's men's team hasn't been anywhere near as successful as 
the women. The U.S. women won the inaugural World Cup in 1991 and 
took the Atlanta Olympics gold medal three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we won the world championship, there was one reporter  
there,'' Lilly said. ``But after the Olympic gold medal, people 
began to care about us. If we are not successful, people will still 
want to see women's soccer, but it might be more difficult to put 
together (a league).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tournament organizers aren't looking that far ahead. Instead,  
they are emphasizing strong ticket sales, which have exceeded 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial estimates in 1997 of potential sales were 312,000. The  
World Cup already has sold more than 325,000 tickets and the 
projections are for 475,000. Single-game tickets went on sale 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Marla Messing, president of the organizing committee, said she  
thinks more than 500,000 tickets will be sold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the 1994 men's World Cup opened the eyes of the U.S.  
public to what World Cup soccer is all about,'' she said. ``The 
Atlanta Olympics opened eyes to the power and excitement of women's 
team sports. We are bringing both of those to bear to show the 
importance and attraction of this event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-team tournament begins June 19 with two games at East  
Rutherford, N.J. More than 44,000 tickets have been sold for the 
doubleheader: United States vs. Denmark followed by Mexico vs. 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Average ticket sales for first-round doubleheaders not involving  
the U.S. team are at 14,257.

<HEADLINE> DiCaprio Safe After Boat Capsizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The hero of ``Titanic'' survived a  
real-life boat sinking in Thailand -- but despite some local media 
reports, his producer insisted today there were no sharks in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	DiCaprio and co-star Tilda Swinton were riding in a long tail  
boat -- a traditional fishing canoe with an outboard motor -- when it 
went down Friday in heavy seas during a sudden storm. The two were 
filming ``The Beach'' off Phi Phi Island in the Andaman Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	But contrary to front page reports in some Thai newspapers, no  
sharks were seen near the boat, said Santa Pestanij, the Thai 
coordinator for the 20th Century Fox film who was present when the 
boat capsized. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not underestimate the sea. There were at least four  
security boats present and prepared for the unpredictable,'' Santa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dive operators contacted by The Associated Press said some small  
sand sharks might swim near the islands, but they had never heard 
of a shark attack in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Santa said Dicaprio remained calm for the five to ten minutes he  
was in the water and helped soothe crew members who feared 
drowning. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a real gentleman. A hero,'' Santa said.  
</P>
<P>
	DiCaprio is anything but a hero, however, to local environmental  
activists who are suing him and the film company in a Thai court 
for allegedly damaging the ecosystem of Maya Beach on the island. 
</P>
<P>
	The activists have staged several protests against DiCaprio,  
wearing masks made from a photo of his face with the addition of 
vampire fangs. Security has been extremely tight on the set to keep 
the protesters away. 
</P>
<P>
	Santa said the boat accident cost tens of thousands in damage to  
camera equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The film is scheduled to finish shooting on Saturday, but Santa  
said DiCaprio wants to spend a few more days in Thailand and make a 
trip to Bangkok.

<HEADLINE>  Former E. German Premier Stoph Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Former East German Premier Willi Stoph, who was  
dropped as a defendant in a manslaughter trial for killings at the 
Berlin Wall because of illness, has died at age 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoph died April 13 in Berlin following a long illness, Hanno  
Harnisch of the Party of Democratic Socialism, which succeeded the 
East German communist party, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Berlin on July 9, 1914, to a working-class family, Stoph  
joined a Communist youth group in 1928. He served in Hitler's army 
as a private in the artillery from 1940-42 and was released after 
being wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	According to his biography, Stoph studied at the Lenin Academy  
in the Soviet Union after the war and attended Soviet army weapons 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	He became East Germany's first defense minister in 1956 and was  
known as the architect of the East German People's Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoph moved up in East Germany's Politburo hierarchy to become  
premier in 1970, succeeding Otto Grotewohl. He met the same year 
with then-West German Chancellor Willy Brandt for talks to ease 
relations between the communist East and capitalist West. 
</P>
<P>
	As East Germany's communist rulers faced growing pressure for  
reform from a peaceful, popular uprising, Stoph was ousted Nov. 7, 
1989, along with East German leader Erich Honecker. Two days later, 
the Berlin Wall was opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Honecker and four other defendants, Stoph went on  
trial in Berlin on Nov. 13, 1992, charged with 13 counts of 
manslaughter in the killings of people trying to escape East 
Germany. He was dropped from the case in August 1993 after the 
court decided he was too sick to continue because of heart 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Honecker was also dropped from the trial due to illness. He died  
in exile in Chile in 1994.

<HEADLINE>  Germany Reclaims 'New' Reichstag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- With brass bands, waving flags and beaming  
politicians, parliament inaugurated its new home in the stately, 
restored Reichstag today, a landmark occasion in the government's 
return to its prewar capital Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	A solemn tone tempered the celebration. Chancellor Gerhard  
Schroeder noted that the move back to the capital -- scene of 
Prussian militarism and Third Reich totalitarianism -- came just as 
German troops were participating in NATO airstrikes against 
Yugoslavia, their first attack on a sovereign nation since World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our democracy and our parliament are strong and stable,''  
Schroeder said. ``The move to Berlin is not a break in the 
continuity of German postwar history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chancellor, speaking inside the building's new glass-walled  
parliament chamber, defended Germany's role in NATO airstrikes as 
its ``historic responsibility ... as a land that had two 
dictatorships in this century, as a land that brought genocide and 
aggression over our continent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder also reflected on the importance of Berlin, once  
divided into communist East and Allied-controlled, capitalist West, 
as the ``hinge of European unity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moving to Berlin means shifting Germany's seat of power  
eastward, which politicians also hope will bridge the gap between 
the nation's former communist eastern states and its more 
prosperous west. 
</P>
<P>
	Parliament's meeting in the Reichstag is the first big step in  
the move from Bonn, the provincial western city where West 
Germany's capital was relegated after World War II. Next come the 
election of a new German president in May and the new parliament 
session in September, the first to open in the new building. 
</P>
<P>
	To thunderous applause, parliament President Wolfgang Thierse  
promised lawmakers that the change in location did not mean a 
change in politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want another kind of policy, but as tranquil a move  
as possible from Bonn to Berlin,'' he declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Berlin's grim past had raised concern about the government's  
return there. But the new Reichstag, transformed by architect Sir 
Norman Foster's $330 million renovation, is as light as the 
capital's legacy is dark. 
</P>
<P>
	The glass walls around the central parliament chamber, plus a  
viewing ledge from the second floor, mean visitors can see and hear 
what lawmakers are doing inside. An immense, new glass dome atop 
the old building channels natural light to the lawmakers below. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want this glass dome to become a symbol for the openness and  
transparency of our democratic politics,'' Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to modern changes, the architect preserved the  
building's original 19th-century exterior, as well as wartime scars 
inside --damage from bombs and fires, and graffiti left behind by 
Soviet soldiers who seized the building in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	More than any other building in Berlin, the Reichstag has  
represented the different phases of Germany's turbulent, terrible 
history over the passing century. 
</P>
<P>
	It was burned during the Nazi era and bombed by Allied forces.  
East Germany built the Berlin Wall just a few steps from the 
Reichstag's back entrance. After the Wall came down, the artist 
Christo celebrated the end of communism by wrapping the Reichstag 
in a million square feet of silvery fabric. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1995 wrapping was the last big event held at the building  
until today's ceremony, kicked off by architect Foster's presenting 
a 20-inch-long key of his own design to the parliamentary 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Thierse grinned and held it over his head in celebration.  
Afterward, Lutheran and Roman Catholic bishops blessed the 
building.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks To Block Oil to Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton asked Congress today for $6  
billion in emergency spending to sustain the U.S. military 
engagement in Kosovo and increase aid to ethnic Albanians fleeing 
the province. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are literally lives hanging in the balance,'' Clinton  
said. ``I hope that the Congress, in the spirit of bipartisanship, 
will pass the package right away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the emergency spending would ``ensure that we have  
the resources to sustain the air campaign to ensure that we achieve 
our goals while maintaining our high level of general military 
readiness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders promised to give the measure prompt  
attention, but Republicans suggested they would try to expand it to 
cover longer-range needs of the Pentagon. ``This emergency funding 
measure cannot be shortsighted -- it cannot simply replace bullets 
for bullets and bombs for bombs spent in Kosovo,'' said House 
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the United States is seeking NATO support for cutting  
off seaborne shipments of oil into Yugoslavia to limit President 
Slobodan Milosevic's ability to fight ethnic Albanians. Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright did not rule out the possibility of a 
naval blockade of Yugoslav ports. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, after noting that a relentless NATO bombing campaign  
has heavily damaged Yugoslavia's oil refining capacity, said, 
``We're taking all kinds of steps to limit the ability of outside 
powers to ... deliver oil. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Croatians have turned off their oil pipeline. And we are  
talking with our NATO allies about taking stricter action in order 
to limit the amount of oil that goes in,'' she said Sunday on ABC's 
``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Would that include a blockade of ports? Albright was asked.  
``Well, there is a way to visit and search ships and we're looking 
at a variety of way to tighten the screws on him (Milosevic) 
economically,'' she replied. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke with Russian President Boris Yeltsin today for 45  
minutes. Yeltsin has been critical of the NATO campaign, but a 
White House official said the two emphasized the things they agreed 
upon, such as the need for Serb forces to withdraw from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time that Clinton and Yeltsin had spoken since  
the start of the airstrikes, and the conversation came after 
Yeltsin named a special envoy for the crisis last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're looking for ways to be helpful. There's broad  
agreement that we can't allow the relationship to be damaged by 
Kosovo,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Queried about the possibility of a naval blockade, White House  
press secretary Joe Lockhart would say only that NATO was 
considering ``a variety of things'' that could loosen Milosevic's 
grip on power. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that these are ideas that are worth pursuing, and  
that's what's being discussed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's only seaports are in Montenegro. Kosovo is a  
province of Yugoslavia's other republic, Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	There were weekend reports that oil was still being delivered  
through Montenegrin ports and that the United States was reluctant 
to impose a blockade. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported today that when the United States  
raised the issue of a naval blockade with NATO allies last week, 
France objected on grounds that would require endorsement by the 
United Nations Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said NATO will fight to the end to wear down Milosevic.  
Yugoslavia's military is being weakened by NATO bombing, she said. 
``Our allies are all determined to prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said Clinton still has no intention of sending ground troops  
into Yugoslavia to follow the air attacks that begin March 24. A 
ground plan shelved last fall could be updated quickly, she said, 
although military experts have said it would take two to three 
months to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana agreed, saying, ``At this  
point, the alliance has no plans to go into an invasion.'' However, 
he added, ``If the moment comes when it is necessary, I'm sure the 
countries that belong to NATO will be ready to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to maintain the air campaign to the end,'' he  
said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	British Prime Minister Tony Blair and German Chancellor Gerhard  
Schroeder affirmed allied unity. ``I think the important thing is 
to see the strategy we have through,'' Blair said on CBS' ``Face 
the Nation.'' Schroeder told CNN's ``Late Edition'' he sees ``no 
reason whatsoever'' to change current policy. ``Airstrikes have to 
be continued, and they have to be sharpened as well,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding a new lethal element to the air campaign, the first of 24  
Apache attack helicopters are to arrive early this week in Albania 
for possible strikes against Serb forces, whose campaign against 
Kosovar Albanians hasn't been interrupted by high-flying NATO jets. 
The Serbs have chased more than 1 million ethnic Albanians from 
their homes, half the Kosovo population. 
</P>
<P>
	The helicopter gunships, one of the most effective antitank  
weapons, have been delayed by bad weather and a crowded airfield in 
the Albanian capital of Tirana handling humanitarian missions for 
refugees. The Apaches are armed with up to 16 Hellfire missiles 
designed to knock out tanks and other armor, plus 70mm rockets and 
a 30mm cannon that can fire 625 rounds per minute. 
</P>
<P>
	To protect the helicopter runs, rocket launchers also are being  
placed in Albania along with U.S. Bradley Fighting Vehicles, 
British tanks and at least 3,000 American troops. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional 8,000 allied troops will provide humanitarian  
relief in Albania. And 12,000 NATO troops, including 600 Americans, 
are in Macedonia as the vanguard for any peacekeeping mission. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's military commander, Army Gen. Wesley Clark, meanwhile, is  
awaiting Pentagon approval for more than 300 additional U.S. 
aircraft to boost the alliance total to about 1,000 warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	The increased air power will require Clinton to call up as many  
as 33,000 military reserves, mostly for refueling and 
administration duties, with the order expected this week.

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) --Yugoslavia slammed shut the main  
crossing point for ethnic Albanian refugees fleeing Kosovo, leaving 
uncertainty Monday about the fate of the tens of thousands whom aid 
officials had believed were on their way to the border. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO struck at a variety of sites on the 26th day of its air  
campaign, reportedly including a government building in Serbia's 
second-largest city and a television transmitter in Kosovo. But it 
said its operations were limited by poor weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite continuing defiance by Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic and his military forces in Kosovo, NATO's chief spokesman 
expressed confidence the strategy will pay off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since when was a dictator defeated in 24 hours?'' Jamie Shea  
said at the NATO briefing in Brussels, Belgium. ``It took six years 
to defeat fascism in the middle of Europe in the 20th century. I 
think we can take two or three months to defeat President 
Milosevic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bombings aim to force Milosevic to accept a peace plan for  
Kosovo, a province in Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugee traffic from Kosovo into Albania, Macedonia and  
Montenegro slowed to a trickle Monday. The U.N. refugee agency said 
the Serbs apparently were turning back the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all sounds fairly ominous and we don't know to what end  
they're doing it,'' said Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	Albanian soldiers swarmed around the Morini border station -- the  
main entry point into Albania -- and ordered reporters away. 
International monitors reported daytime shelling along the border, 
one day after Yugoslavia broke off diplomatic relations with 
Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of Kosovo Albanians who have fled or been forced  
out of the Serbian province since NATO airstrikes began March 24 
have come to Albania -- 365,000 of more than 600,000. Over the 
weekend, an estimated 40,000 either left Kosovo for neighboring 
territories or were at its borders, aid officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very clear that there are large numbers of more people  
who would like to come,'' UNHCR spokeswoman Paula Ghedini said in 
Macedonia. ``Either new fighting is preventing people from 
crossing, or Serbs are preventing them from crossing the border.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The handful of refugees who crossed into Macedonia on Monday  
said there were many more who had been turned back by Serb police. 
At the country's main border, Blace, two tractors hauling trailers 
crowded with refugees were seen heading back from the border zone 
into the hills. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, residents of three  
Muslim villages near the border with Kosovo said the Yugoslav army 
expelled them to turn their communities into a second front line. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Yugoslav federal army troops stepped up  
security along the Montenegrin border with Bosnia. Numerous 
checkpoints were seen on roads leading toward the capital 
Podgorica. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear why the refugee flow out of Kosovo  
was halted, as it had been periodically in past days. The Yugoslav 
government made no statement on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO, meanwhile, reported that all its planes had returned  
safely overnight, although a Danish F-16 patrolling Bosnia in 
conjunction with the airstrikes made an emergency landing at 
Sarajevo's airport Sunday night due to what NATO officials said was 
an engine problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The state-run Tanjug news agency reported four powerful  
detonations early Monday in Baric, site of a chemical plant 12 
miles southwest of Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	A top official in Belgrade reiterated warnings of an ecological  
disaster if NATO strikes the chemical plant, although for the 
second straight night it appeared to be targeting a nearby site 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any direct hit or a stray shrapnel striking the plant's  
storage would heat up the acid, causing a catastrophic explosion,'' 
Deputy Mayor Milan Bozic told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant normally processes components for detergent and has  
180 tons of highly toxic hydrofluoric acid in its systems, Serb 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	A missile also slammed into a provincial government building in  
the heart of Novi Sad, Serbia's second largest city, Tanjug 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Rebel fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army captured three  
soldiers from the Yugoslav army and planned to turn them over to 
NATO officials, said KLA spokesman Luzim Bakalli in Tirana, 
Albania. They were captured last week during fighting near Junik, 
Kosovo, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the Clinton  
administration is seeking NATO support to prevent ``outside 
powers'' from delivering oil to the Serb military through ports in 
Montenegro. She did not elaborate, nor did she rule out the 
possibility of a naval blockade of Yugoslav ports.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Looks for Hope in Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- In tiny, mountainous Hong Kong, where property  
is a precious and scarce commodity, investors are hoping the first 
land auction in nine months will answer a key question: Is the 
recession-mired economy finally headed for recovery? 
</P>
<P>
	The government halted land sales in June to curb a slide in  
property prices. Tuesday's auction is a small one, with just three 
prime residential locations. 
</P>
<P>
	But the issues have drawn keen bidding interest and indications  
of satisfactory prices. Analysts expect the sales to fetch about 
1.2 billion Hong Kong dollars, or $154 million. That's less than 
the government could have gotten in the market's peak in 1997 but a 
figure analysts say would be respectable in the shrinking economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks in key property developers rallied Monday, helping to  
pull the blue-chip Hang Seng Index up by 2.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The auction will reflect developers' confidence in the market.  
Prices they offer for the sites will translate into the kind of 
property prices they expect to see in the next few years,'' 
predicted Kinson Au, a property analyst for Amsteel Research (HK) 
Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's leaders are anxious for a good showing. The  
government ``has engineered the auction so that it would not 
fail,'' said Otto Wong, a property analyst for Salomon Brothers 
Hong Kong Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Property prices in this congested city with a fast-growing  
population are among the highest in the world because land suitable 
for construction is scarce. 
</P>
<P>
	In the real-estate industry's heyday, developers' offices were  
swamped with speculators any time new developments went on sale. 
Rampant speculation drove prices out of reach of most middle-income 
families, many of whom live in government-subsidized housing. 
</P>
<P>
	But last year, Asia's financial turmoil sent property prices  
plunging by 50 percent and officials halted all land sales in June 
to try to prop up the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the drop, apartments are still more expensive than in  
most major cities, with a tiny two-bedroom apartment in a central 
location easily going for 3.3 million Hong Kong dollars ($420,000). 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, the real-estate industry has gained optimism as  
interest rates have eased and foreign funds have returned to Asia, 
driving regional stock markets up. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index has 
risen nearly 25 percent since the beginning of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the improving market sentiment, analysts are not  
expecting any big surprises Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Developers will remain cautious because the profit margins  
remain quite low after the financial crisis, judging from property 
prices today,'' Au of Amsteel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Tsang, the territory's financial secretary, told  
reporters that property prices will unlikely shoot back to the 
levels seen before the financial crisis because the government is 
committed to ensuring adequate land supply to house the growing 
population. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market will not go erratic,'' he said. But with land  
supply still at a premium, Hong Kong ``will not become a very cheap 
real estate market.''

<HEADLINE>  Former E. German Premier Stoph Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Former East German Premier Willi Stoph, who was  
dropped as a defendant in a manslaughter trial for killings at the 
Berlin Wall because of illness, has died at age 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoph died April 13 in Berlin following a long illness, Hanno  
Harnisch of the Party of Democratic Socialism, which succeeded the 
East German communist party, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Berlin on July 9, 1914, to a working-class family, Stoph  
joined a Communist youth group in 1928. He served in Hitler's army 
as a private in the artillery from 1940-42 and was released after 
being wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	According to his biography, Stoph studied at the Lenin Academy  
in the Soviet Union after the war and attended Soviet army weapons 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	He became East Germany's first defense minister in 1956 and was  
known as the architect of the East German People's Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoph moved up in East Germany's Politburo hierarchy to become  
premier in 1970, succeeding Otto Grotewohl. He met the same year 
with then-West German Chancellor Willy Brandt for talks to ease 
relations between the communist East and capitalist West. 
</P>
<P>
	As East Germany's communist rulers faced growing pressure for  
reform from a peaceful, popular uprising, Stoph was ousted Nov. 7, 
1989, along with East German leader Erich Honecker. Two days later, 
the Berlin Wall was opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Honecker and four other defendants, Stoph went on  
trial in Berlin on Nov. 13, 1992, charged with 13 counts of 
manslaughter in the killings of people trying to escape East 
Germany. He was dropped from the case in August 1993 after the 
court decided he was too sick to continue because of heart 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Honecker was also dropped from the trial due to illness. He died  
in exile in Chile in 1994.

<HEADLINE>  'Finnish Flash' Is Big NHL Scorer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The ``Finnish Flash'' is the perfect  
nickname for Teemu Selanne, a blur on and off the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Selanne's life adventures include teaching kindergarten,  
serving as a patrol point man with Finland's army, collecting 
antique cars, driving race cars, being a devoted family man, and 
performing countless hours of charity work. 
</P>
<P>
	The right wing for the playoff-bound Anaheim Mighty Ducks also  
has been able squeeze in enough time to score more goals than any 
other player in the NHL over the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a guy who loves life and loves the game,'' Anaheim coach  
Craig Hartsburg said as the Ducks prepared for their first-round 
playoff series against Detroit Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
	Selanne's zest is obvious in his pleasant demeanor and seemingly  
ever-present smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teemu gets as mad as anyone else when we lose, but I think he  
forgets it quickly,'' said linemate Paul Kariya, who along with 
Selanne gives the Mighty Ducks one of the NHL's highest-scoring 
duos. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teemu keeps everybody on an even keel. When things are going  
poorly, he's upbeat and he keeps everybody loose. When things are 
going well, he's the same, so we always know what to expect from 
him. Guys get down, but he's there picking us up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Always a target for defenders, Selanne has some experience with  
facing challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finding a way to handle 20 kids was a challenge,'' he said,  
recalling his three years of teaching kindergarten in his homeland. 
``I just made sure everybody was happy and playing games. I had 
fun. It was only for four hours a day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selanne grinned and added, ``Eight would have been too much.''  
</P>
<P>
	He played hockey in the evenings while he was teaching, and also  
managed to play during his rigorous, 11-month tour of army duty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really stayed in good shape,'' he said. ``I woke up at 6,  
was with the army until 3, then played hockey at night. It was a 
long day, but I was OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selanne has 313 career goals, most in the league over the past  
seven years. He had his string of 50-goal seasons end at three this 
year, but his 47 goals still led the league. His 107 points also 
ranked him No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's probably the best pure goal scorer in the league,''  
Kariya said. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Hartsburg: ``Teemu's such a gifted player, has great speed,  
great hands, and a great demeanor. He also has great hockey sense, 
which is something you can't teach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis goaltender Grant Fuhr agreed Selanne is a threat at  
all times. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to respect where he is on the ice because he skates  
better than most people,'' Fuhr said. ``He gets loose, and once he 
gets loose, he can shoot the puck pretty well. He seems to create 
chances and as long as he's creating chances, they're going to get 
a lot of goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selanne said, ``I think I like to take advantage of the speed,  
and try to be in the right place at the right time. It's really a 
pleasure to play with Paul; he makes me much more effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although easygoing, Selanne can be tough on himself at times.  
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing it that I really want to play well all the  
time and sometimes that doesn't happen,'' he said. ``I respect the 
guys who play for a long time and stay just as hungry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selanne feels his life off-the-ice, including spending as much  
time as possible with his wife, Sirpa, and their two young sons, 
keeps him fresh for his sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never have been a guy who thinks about hockey all the time.  
I get my mind out of hockey, don't take my work home with me,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	His extremely active life provides him with many rewards, he  
said, including the summers when he's back home in Finland and sees 
the children he used to teach. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I go back, parents come up to me and tell me that I  
started their children liking sports, even the girls, too,'' he 
said. ``I like that.''

<HEADLINE> Import-Users Want off 'Hit List' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The owner of a trendy French bistro and the  
operator of a German delicatessen were upset. Ditto for the Swedish 
farmer, the owner of an Irish food delicacies mail-order firm and 
representatives for thousands of U.S. motorcycle enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
	All trooped to a government hearing room Monday to plead for  
removal from a $900 million ``hit list'' of products facing 
punitive tariffs threatened by the Clinton administration in a 
decade-long fight over Europe's ban on American beef containing 
growth hormones. 
</P>
<P>
	Importers of foie gras, truffles, Belgian chocolates, Perrier  
and other European mineral waters and a host of other European 
delicacies appeared to make the case that their products should not 
be on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Buben showed up in his chef's uniform to say he was  
worried that business at Bistro Bis, his new French restaurant in 
Washington, would be hurt if he could no longer get the Dijon 
mustard he uses in many of his dishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dijon mustard is a unique product, and nothing else in the  
United States comes close,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The punitive tariffs are designed to knock European products out  
of the U.S. market in retaliation for Europe's ban on American beef 
from cattle treated with growth hormones. The World Trade 
Organization has ruled in favor of the U.S. industry's arguments 
that the ban was not justified on scientific grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The beef fight is one of two trade wars the United States is  
engaged in with the European Union. The administration has imposed 
punitive 100 percent tariffs on $191.4 million of European products 
including high-fashion hand bags and bed linens in retaliation for 
the EU's refusal to abide by another WTO ruling that it drop import 
barriers on bananas grown by American companies. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Agriculture  
Secretary Dan Glickman met Monday with Sir Leon Brittan, the EU's 
chief trade negotiator, in a search for resolution of the beef 
dispute to avert the threatened sanctions, which could take effect 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key question is whether the EU will respect the clear and  
unambiguous WTO ruling to lift its ban on U.S. meat,'' Barshefsky 
said after the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	The $900 million targeted in the beef battle primarily covers  
food products, although the preliminary sanction list also includes 
European motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
	Importers of these small-engine motorcycles made in Italy,  
Spain, France and Austria said thousands of mom-and-pop motorcycle 
shops in the United States could be forced to lay off workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where is the beef in motorcycles?'' Edward W. Moreland,  
Washington representative of the 234,000-member American Motorcyle 
Association, asked the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Some motorcyle officials warned that the government was putting  
at risk the safety of thousands of owners of European motorcyles 
who won't be able to get replacement parts for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hildi Fehr, owner of a German delicatessen and restaurant just a  
few blocks from the White House, said her business will suffer 
unless the government takes a number of items off the target list 
from Rittersport chocolate to Zweiback toast. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Schwartau raspberry jam is very important to me,'' she  
told the hearing panel, calling it a key ingredient in her 
Linzertortes. ``I have tried to use American substitutes ..., but 
the small jars don't have the same intense flavor or consistency as 
the German raspberry jam,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of American breakfast cereals could go up if the  
government keeps oats on the list, because the United States 
imports one-third of the oats it uses, mainly from Canada, Sweden 
and Finland, officials representing American cereal makers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Claes Nilsson, a farmer in Sweden who appeared on behalf of an  
association of Swedish grain farmers, said he is reducing his oat 
acreage by 50 percent because of the threat of U.S. sanctions. He 
predicted other farmers will do the same, which will drive up oat 
prices and lower prices of substitute crops such as barley. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Capalbo, owner of Capalbo Gift Baskets Inc. of Nutley,  
N.J., said his life has been a nightmare the past few months 
because of constantly changing government threats. He said he was 
relieved that at the last minute the government decided to remove 
sweet biscuits from the banana hit list only to find out that a 
number of other food items in his catalogue of Irish products were 
being targeted in the beef fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The continuing threat is terrible for our business,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But representatives of the U.S. beef industry also appeared at  
the hearing, arguing that the sanctions were the only thing left to 
try to force the EU to drop its ban on U.S. beef. They urged the 
panel to consider a rotating list of products that would change 
every six months in order to bring maximum pressure on EU countries 
to come into compliance with the WTO ruling.

<HEADLINE> Bite Taken Out of Hot-Dog Artist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- If you smear yourself with pureed hot dogs  
and invite a bunch of pooches over for a sniff, you have to expect 
some problems. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a lesson performance artist Zhang Huan learned the hard  
way when a dog taking part in one of his pieces took a bite out of 
his butt. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhang doffed his clothes and lay face-down on a cypress branch.  
An assistant spread hot dog puree all over him and sprinkled him 
with flour. Then eight dogs were brought in, one by one. 
</P>
<P>
	The moment of truth arrived when marketing consultant Lee McCoy,  
who was dog-sitting for Dan Stern, brought Stern's Akita, Hercules, 
in for a taste. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty embarrassed,'' said McCoy. ``I was afraid Hercules  
might pee on the tree, but he bit him in the (behind) instead. Wait 
until Dan finds out I didn't take his dog to the beach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zhang's performance Saturday, part of an exhibition at the Asian  
Art Museum called ``Inside Out: New Chinese Art,'' was entitled 
``Dream of the Dragon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zhang, who lost a drop of blood but only flinched after Hercules  
mistook his keister for kibble, said his aim was to ``explore the 
physical and psychological effects of human violence in modern 
society.''

<HEADLINE> D.C. Residents Seek Voting Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Residents of the nation's capital looked to a  
panel of federal judges today to provide them with voting rights 
that many Americans take for granted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time that Congress stopped treating the District of  
Columbia like a colony,'' said George Laroche, an attorney 
representing district residents involved in a class-action voting 
rights lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge panel is being asked to decide the issues in a  
pair of cases consolidated in U.S. District Court for the District 
of Columbia. One of the cases seeks full voting rights in Congress 
for representatives chosen by district residents. The other case 
seeks an end to territorial control of district affairs by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The district is represented in Congress only by a delegate in  
the House who can vote in committee, where legislation is prepared, 
but not on the House floor, where it is passed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're (residents) subject to the draft, they are taxed, but  
they have no role in the political life of the United States,'' 
said Laroche. Although the judges could rule in a month, Laroche 
and other attorneys expect the case ultimately to wind up before 
the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``The constitution defines the capital as a district, separate  
and apart from the states,'' said John Tyler, a Justice Department 
attorney representing the executive branch. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the District of Columbia Board of Elections and  
Ethics, 345,199 voters were registered as of last September. The 
Census Bureau estimates the district's overall population at about 
529,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress, in its role as national legislature, determines how  
district taxes will be spent and often attaches restrictions on how 
laws will be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
	During the past year, district issues on which Congress has had  
the last word include allowing public aid for private and religious 
schools and banning public funds for abortions, needle exchanges 
for intravenous drug users and a referendum on medical marijuana.

<HEADLINE> Unions Giving More Support to GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Labor union leaders -- the Democrats' steadfast  
allies and dependable source of campaign cash -- are increasingly 
consorting with Republicans, even writing them fat checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the 20 labor unions that gave the most to  
congressional candidates for last year's elections increased their 
contributions to Republicans by almost one-third -- to a total of 
$2.1 million -- over the 1996 cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Which is not to say the unions are abandoning their old friends:  
The same political action committees contributed far more, $27.2 
million, to Democrats, a review of disclosure reports found. 
</P>
<P>
	But political reality is forcing organized labor to reach out to  
moderates in the party that controls Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, the National Education Association has given  
$55,000 in unregulated ``soft money'' and PAC contributions to 
national Republican Party committees and $5,000 to Rep. Johnny 
Isakson, the Georgia Republican elected to complete the 
congressional term of former Speaker Newt Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making a concerted effort to do our politics based on  
the issue and not based on the party,'' said Mary Elizabeth 
Teasley, the NEA's director of government relations. ``We 
contribute based on how they measure up on the issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NEA's political action committee still overwhelmingly favors  
Democrats over Republicans, some of whom have sought to abolish the 
U.S. Department of Education and to use tax dollars for private 
schools. But the ratio is shifting. 
</P>
<P>
	The NEA's PAC gave $97,850 to Republicans candidates in last  
year's races -- eight times its $11,850 in contributions to GOP 
candidates for the previous election. 
</P>
<P>
	The hefty $1.8 million the NEA gave Democrats for 1998's races  
was a drop from the $2.3 million it gave Democrats for the 1996 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Labor realized after '96 that Republicans were here to stay,''  
said Rep. Peter King of New York, a pro-union Republican. ``They 
would have to deal with Republicans. One of the ways is by 
attending Republican events and socializing with Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It also helps to contribute rather than being marked as the  
enemy,'' King said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Republicans won control of Congress in 1994, the 20  
unions analyzed by The Associated Press gave only $881,630 to 
Republican candidates over the 1993-1994 election cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor unions remain dedicated to helping Democrats wrest control  
of the House from the GOP in 2000, pledging not only PAC 
contributions but millions of dollars for issue advertising. Giving 
a little more to the Republicans, especially to moderates, is a way 
to hedge their bets and move toward a truce. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO's political director, Steve Rosenthal, made a  
conciliatory move recently, assuring Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, 
chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, that 
unions would support pro-labor Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last couple of years, we have tried hard to find  
those Republicans who are willing to take hard stands, usually 
against the party leadership, in support of issues that really 
matter to working people,'' Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
	But a skeptical NRCC Executive Director Scott Hatch said he was  
waiting to see ``if the union bosses back up their rhetoric.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NRCC officials also met with International Brotherhood of  
Teamsters representatives. Mike Mathis, the Teamsters' director of 
government affairs, said he was working to arrange a meeting 
between new union President James P. Hoffa and House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the union to fully represent our membership, we need to  
have our doors open to politicians who will support working 
families regardless of which party they're in,'' Mathis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters PAC boosted its Republican giving to $151,800 for  
last year's races, up from $100,810 for the 1996 election. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee gave 13 times that amount to Democrats: $2  
million. But that was down from $2.4 million Democratic candidates 
received in 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic National Committee spokesman Rick Hess said unions  
overwhelmingly favor his party because of its lawmakers' stands on 
issues including minimum wage, Medicare and Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not concerned that some members of the Republican Party  
are starting to moderate their anti-union concerns,'' Hess said. 
``We are concerned that the party that currently controls Congress 
has such a terrible labor record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King said contributions to Republicans help him argue against  
union-bashing within the House GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's wrong for Republicans to write off labor the way we  
started doing in '94,'' King said. ``And it's just as wrong for 
labor to write off Republicans.''

<HEADLINE> Religious Advertising Pops Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- It's not every day you see a message from  
God. Especially on a billboard. 
</P>
<P>
	But there it is, overlooking a weedy lot and the parking lots of  
a strip mall on the north end of town: ``Come on over, and bring 
the kids. -- God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Standing underneath the sign is Bob Lord, general manager of  
Adams Outdoor Advertising, one of dozens of billboard companies 
that are posting divine messages as sly, attention-grabbing and 
often funny one-liners. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a powerful message. When have you seen anything like  
this?'' Lord asks. 
</P>
<P>
	A lot of people are getting the message. The billboards are now  
in 200 cities in 40 states, on more than $13 million worth of 
donated billboard space, said Sheila Hays, spokeswoman for the 
Outdoor Advertising Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Smith, who owns the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., advertising firm  
that designed the campaign, said it began last year when a 
well-known Florida man -- who wants to remain anonymous -- walked 
into Smith's office with an idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a religious person, and he thought if people started  
thinking about God, maybe things would get better around the 
world,'' Smith said. ``He wanted to reach those people who had gone 
to church before but stopped, or who had gone to synagogue before 
but stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Out were stern reminders to pray and go to church. In were lines  
like, ``What part of 'Thou shalt not ...' didn't you understand? -- 
God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or, ``Let's meet at my house Sunday before the game. -- God.''  
And ``I can think of 10 things that ARE carved in stone. -- God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the first anonymously sponsored billboards popped up  
around Fort Lauderdale, the Outdoor Advertising Association of 
America adopted the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly raises the idea of God in people's minds in a way  
and a place when you certainly wouldn't expect it,'' said the Rev. 
Edward Roberts, director of evangelization for the Catholic Diocese 
of Peoria. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is catching people, in a sense, off guard, and giving them  
pause to reflect,'' Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirley Happs, a clerk in The Church Mouse Thrift Shop, around  
the corner from one billboard in downtown Peoria, thinks the signs 
are a little unusual for religious advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't think He needs advertisement. ... This is just a  
little bold,'' Happs said. ``I will say this much. It attracts your 
attention right away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The billboard messages are drawing a positive reaction from the  
public, in part because they are nondenominational, Lord said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People take from it what they will,'' he said. ``They see it  
and the rest is up to them. ... But they are certainly seeing it.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton To Visit Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, in New York  
for a trip largely designed to explore a potential Senate race, 
said today she plans to go to Albania and Macedonia to meet with 
refugees ``as soon as I'm given the green light to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is very important for me to go to Kosovo  
eventually, but I want to go when my going does not interfere with 
the work and in any way displace resources'' of the international 
community trying to help thousands of refugees fleeing from the 
fighting in Kosovo, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been asked to go. I've expressed my very strong interest  
in going and as soon as I'm given the green light to go, I intend 
to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She made the remarks after meeting with the heads of several  
private foundations raising money to help the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's meeting with the foundations was the first event  
in a crowded schedule that seems designed to stoke interest in a 
potential Senate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady is expected to decide in June or July whether to  
seek the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said she is seriously considering whether to run  
but insisted her schedule on this trip was a typical one for a 
first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm obviously still considering and exploring (the Senate  
race) and interested in doing so but right now I'm very focused on 
the situation in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a new poll, from Marist College's Institute for Public  
Opinion, 52 percent of New Yorkers polled said Mrs. Clinton should 
not run, up from 37 percent in a February survey. Forty-two percent 
of voters in the latest poll said she should run, down from 56 
percent in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 512 registered voters was conducted  
Tuesday and Wednesday and has a margin of error of plus or minus 
4.5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Because this was billed as an official White House trip, the  
taxpayers are paying for the first lady's travel. Her most recent 
foreign trip, a journey to North Africa that ended earlier this 
month, was also considered official business and paid with public 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said she might consider establishing an exploratory  
committee to defray the costs of her travel ``if it becomes 
appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also will be in New York Tuesday and Thursday, mostly for  
events unrelated, such as an education speech this afternoon at 
Columbia Teachers College.

<HEADLINE> UN Panel Tries To Save Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Forests have virtually disappeared in 25  
countries and will continue to vanish unless governments change 
their policies now, an international commission warned as it 
proposed new initiatives to save the world's trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually the only economic value officially assigned to forests  
today is timber. But the report Monday from the World Commission on 
Forests and Sustainable Development suggests the world can satisfy 
its material needs from forests without jeopardizing their 
ecological benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The report recommends the creation of a Forest Capital Index,  
which would measure the real value of forests in terms other than 
timber, such as the role they play in water management and 
stabilizing the climate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Making an index is not the same as being able to charge people  
for services,'' said the commission's co-chairman, Ola Ullsten, the 
former Swedish prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the index can be the basis for a financial  
mechanism -- such as credits for greenhouse gas emissions -- to 
compensate developing countries for lost income from cutting down 
forests, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also proposed a host of community-based  
initiatives to monitor forests, develop policies to protect them 
and encourage corporations and countries to conserve them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fixing the forest crisis is basically a matter of politics,''  
Ullsten said. ``It's about governments assuming their mandate to 
protect their national resources -- including forests -- for the 
long-term benefit of their citizens.''

<HEADLINE> Mass. Man Celebrates Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Marlon Passley had maintained all along  
that he was wrongly convicted of a fatal shooting four years ago. 
His prosecutors now say he may have been telling the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	After serving three years of his life sentence, Passley was  
released from prison Friday by authorities who said new evidence 
indicates it is unlikely that he committed the crime for which he 
was convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	But questions still remain both about the 1995 killing and  
Passley's future. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's sort of in limbo to the extent we're waiting for the  
other shoe to drop,'' said Mark Horrigan, the attorney who 
represented Passley at trial. ``This is a good kid and this 
shouldn't have happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Passley, 26, celebrated his release with his mother and  
girlfriend, while prosecutors and detectives remained tightlipped 
on the potentially exculpatory evidence they say has emerged. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy he's home, but we really don't want to talk to the  
press,'' said a woman who answered the door at Passley's family's 
apartment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims who survived the shooting still insist Passley was the  
gunman who pumped bullets into three men, killing one. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury convicted Passley of killing Tennyson Drakes, 18, and  
wounding two other men in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood on Aug. 
11, 1995. Prosecutors had said Passley, riding on a motorcycle, 
shot at a group of men as they stood in a driveway. He then 
returned, again allegedly opening fire on the victims as they lay 
on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Several witnesses later identified Passley from photographs  
shown to them by police. At his trial, four witnesses fingered 
Passley as the shooter. 
</P>
<P>
	But seven of Passley's friends and relatives testified that he  
was with them at his cousin's graduation ceremony from an Upward 
Bound program in Wellesley when the shootings happened. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Passley was convicted and sentenced to life in prison  
without possibility of parole, along with concurrent sentences of 
15 to 20 years for wounding the other men. In February, the state's 
highest court concluded Passley's trial had been fair and upheld 
the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Thompson, 33, who still has four of the eight bullets that  
struck him lodged in his chest and waist, said police notified him 
of Passley's release Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know who shot me. It was Marlon,'' Thompson said.  
</P>
<P>
	But a source close to the case said there's very little chance  
Passley -- who is free under a judge's temporary lifting of the 
sentence -- will ever go to jail again for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said evidence which has emerged in the last two  
weeks points to a ``substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of 
justice'' but wouldn't say what the evidence was. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Borghesani, spokesman for the Suffolk County district  
attorney's office, would neither confirm nor deny reports that 
prosecutors were focusing on another suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Passley has maintained his innocence all along, even as he faced  
spending the rest of his life in prison. ``I don't think he ever 
gave up hope,'' said Horrigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Horrigan added that Passley has a huge capacity for forgiveness,  
recalling that when he was released from the state's custody, he 
hugged the very prosecutor who had put him in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very dignified,'' recalled the prosecutor, Assistant  
District Attorney Leslie O'Brien. ``I was impressed by his stoicism 
and his dignity in the face of this.''

<HEADLINE> Scientists Seek Secret of Longevity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- MIT professor Dirk Struik is an authority on math.  
He also knows his history, having witnessed more than a century's 
worth. 
</P>
<P>
	But ask the 104-year-old widower about the secret to living a  
long life, and he comes up short. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lived this long because I didn't die,'' deadpanned  
Struik, a native of the Netherlands who began teaching at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1926. ``I have good 
friends. I'm healthy. Above all, I'm active.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those are important factors in living long and staying healthy,  
according to two Harvard scientists who studied more than 100 
centenarians to try to unlock the secret of longevity. 
</P>
<P>
	Though only the genetically blessed can expect to live more than  
a century, the researchers say they have identified some factors 
that could help everyone extend life and keep its quality high. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trick is not staying young; it's aging well,'' said Dr.  
Thomas Perls, director of the New England Centenarian Study and 
co-author of the recently published book ``Living to 100.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to say everyone can live to 100,'' said the  
book's other author, Margery Silver, associate director of the 
study and a neuropsychologist. ``But most people do not live up to 
their genetic potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study, a joint project of Harvard Medical School and Beth  
Israel Deaconess Medical Center, began in 1994 and looked at 
centenarians -- 85 percent of them women, 15 percent men -- in eight 
Boston-area communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Several factors showed up in the lives and personalities of many  
of the subjects, including what Perls and Silver call the 
``centenarian personality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They handle emotional stress incredibly well,'' said Perls,  
39. 
</P>
<P>
	Study subjects had lost spouses, endured hardships, even  
survived the horrors of the Holocaust. Yet they were generally 
optimistic and, in most cases, funny. ``They use humor all the 
time,'' Perls said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another common feature among centenarians was their continued  
acceptance of mental challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the factors Perls and Silver did not find to be  
significant in the lives of the over-100s were diet and education. 
</P>
<P>
	Diet, considered by many doctors to be central to long life, was  
tough to study because it varied widely, Perls said. Researchers 
did find one common factor: nearly all subjects reported they had 
always eaten in moderation. 
</P>
<P>
	There are as many as 64,000 centenarians in the country,  
according to U.S. Census Bureau statistics. By 2050, that number 
could surge to between 500,000 and 1 million, Perls said.

<HEADLINE> Chebet Wins Boston Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The winner said it best.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody in the world is trying to catch the Kenyans, but  
they can't,'' said Joseph Chebet, who should know. He became the 
ninth straight Kenyan champion at the Boston Marathon on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chebet, a runner-up in his previous three marathons, won in 2  
hours, 9 minutes, 52 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	That equaled the race record set by U.S. runners between 1916-25  
at a time when few foreigners entered the race. There was no 
individual competition in 1918, only a team race. 
</P>
<P>
	For the women, Ethiopia's Fatuma Roba has piled up a formidable  
Boston streak of her own, winning her third straight. 
</P>
<P>
	The smooth-gliding 1996 Olympic gold medalist eased to victory  
at 2:23:25, matching the three consecutive titles won by Germany's 
Uta Pippig from 1994-96. They are the only two to win three in a 
row since women officially became part of the race in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	While Chebet and Roba overwhelmed their opposition, two crowd  
favorites -- defending champion Moses Tanui of Kenya and four-time 
champion Bill Rodgers -- did not finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanui, also the champion in the race's centennial year in 1996,  
apparently was bothered by leg cramps and dropped out near the 
23-mile mark. Rodgers, seeking to break the course record for 
over-50 by an American, dropped out shortly before the 21-mile mark 
because of dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can run the race,'' the 51-year-old Rodgers said, ``but I  
can't push hard for records. I have to run more carefully, then 
I'll finish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another popular New Englander, Lynn Jennings, was 12th among the  
women in her first official marathon at 2:38:37. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennings, 38, had run the marathon as an unofficial competitor  
in 1978 when she was a 17-year-old high school senior and ran about 
2:46, a time that would have placed her third. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a rough go,'' Jennings said. ``It's slower than I  
thought, but I'm glad I qualified for the Olympic trials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Chebet, whose previous two losses were by three seconds  
each, this was his third victory. He won the first two marathons he 
entered, at Amsterdam in 1996 and at Turin, Italy, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	After his heartbreaking losses last year, Chebet said he had to  
train harder to win again, and this time, he began preparing about 
two months ahead of his previous schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The dogged Chebet took the lead for good just past 22 miles from  
Ecuador's Silvio Guerra. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerra, seeking to become the first South American winner since  
Colombia's Elviro Mejia in 1971, built his lead between miles 17 
and 22 to as much as a quarter-mile before he began laboring. 
</P>
<P>
	``To win a race, you have to take a risk, so I took the lead,''  
Guerra said. ``I started to push hard, but after 20 miles, I 
started to get blisters on my feet and slowed down. I didn't know 
how hard it would be in the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was ready for this race. I had been training in Boulder  
(Colo.) for six months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guerra held on to finish second at 2:10:18 and was followed by  
two South Africans -- Frank Pooe at 2:11:37 and Abner Chipu at 
2:12:45. Kenya's John Kagwe, who beat Chebet at New York in 1997 
and 1998, wound up fifth for the second straight year at 2:13:57. 
</P>
<P>
	As often happens in a marathon, the early pacesetters eventually  
dropped from the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Cheruiyot of Kenya, a first-time marathoner, led most of  
the way through mile 17 before dropping out. For the women, 
20-year-old Sun Yingjie of China -- with her unusual running style -- 
was in front until just after the halfway mark, when Roba and 
Kenya's Catherine Ndereba, making her marathon debut, swept past 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun, running with her hands mostly at her sides, reeled off some  
sensational early splits before her relative inexperience showed, 
and she began faltering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that the pace was very fast, so I had to run fast,  
too,'' Roba said, after running the fourth-fastest women's time at 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Roba ran the final miles with a headband given to her by fans  
along the course. The large Ethiopian community in the Boston area 
have given Roba great support. 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave me a big boost,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Roba was followed by 1997 New York City champion Franziska  
Rochat-Moser of Switzerland at 2:25:51, two-time Olympic medalist 
Yuko Arimori of Japan at 2:26:39 and South African Colleen de Reuck 
at 2:27:53. 
</P>
<P>
	The wheelchair champions each won for the third consecutive  
year, with Franz Nietlispach of Switzerland taking the men's title 
at 1:21:36 and Louise Savage of Australia edging seven-time winner 
Jean Driscoll of Champaign, Ill., for the women's crown, with both 
timed at 1:42:23. 
</P>
<P>
	The 103rd running of the race, held annually on Patriot's Day,  
drew a field of 12,797, the second-largest in history, behind only 
the 38,708 who started in 1996. This was the 75th year the race 
began in the sleepy little town of Hopkinton. Before that, the 
distance was only 24 miles and started in Ashland, and was run on 
dirt roads. This also was the 25th year for the wheelchair 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Chebet and Roba completed two days of marathon prowess by  
Africans. On Sunday, Abdelkader El Mouaziz of Morocco and Joyce 
Chepchumba of Kenya won in London, and Kenyans Japhet Kosgei and 
Tegla Loroupe won in Rotterdam.

<HEADLINE>  Jones Cruises To 400 Meters Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALNUT, Calif. (AP) -- Marion Jones, who plans to go for four  
gold medals in this summer's World Championships and five in the 
2000 Olympics, cruised to an easy 400-meter victory Sunday in the 
Mt. SAC Relays. 
</P>
<P>
	In a family sweep, C.J. Hunter, Jones' husband, upset world  
champion and No. 1-ranked John Godina in the shot put. 
</P>
<P>
	Not long after Hunter had unleashed a lifetime best throw of 70  
feet, 3 inches, to win his event on the Mt. San Antonio College 
infield, Jones won the 400 with a time of 50.79 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, ranked tops in the world last year in the 100, 200 and  
long jump, competes in the 400 mostly for training purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my last open 400-meter race of the year, but I hope to  
be selected for the U.S. 1600-meter relay team for the World 
Championships in Spain this August,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't run a personal best today, but I'm still happy with  
my time. I was hoping to run below 50 seconds because this is a 
homecoming meet for me. It's my only race in Southern California 
this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seeming to glide along effortlessly, Jones quickly moved in  
front and widened her lead to 30 yards with 100 yards to go. But, 
clearly in control, she slowed noticeably in the final strides, 
still winning easily but with a pedestrian -- for her -- time. 
</P>
<P>
	LaDonna Antoine of Canada finished a distant second in 52.94.  
</P>
<P>
	Jones lost just once in 35 finals last year, her only defeat  
coming in the World Cup long jump won by Germany's Heike Drechsler. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones hopes to compete in both sprints, the long jump and a  
relay in Spain, and hopes to add another relay for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if I can stay healthy, I think I have a chance at five  
events in the Sydney Olympics,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ato Boldon, whose 100-meter winning time of 9.86 last year at  
the Relays turned out to be 1998's fastest time in the world, came 
back to win the 200 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon, a native of Trinidad and a former NCAA champion at UCLA,  
eased in front coming out of the turn and went on to win in 20.19. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal for 1999 is the gold medal in the 100 at the World  
Championships,'' Boldon said. ``I want to win two gold medals in 
the sprints in Sydney and if I succeed, maybe just one more World 
Championships and then call it a career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old Boldon, who finished third in both sprints in  
the 1996 Olympics, added, ``If I had won gold in Atlanta, I'd be 
out of the sport now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice Greene, the world No. 1 in the 100 last year, was  
scheduled to run in the event at Mt. SAC, but did not because of a 
slight leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Derrick Adkins, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist in the 400  
hurdles who had a forgettable year in 1998, looked sharp again in 
winning his speciality with a 48.71 clocking. 
</P>
<P>
	Another former Olympic gold medal winner in the 400 hurdles,  
Barcelona champion Kevin Young, finished seventh in 50.60.

<HEADLINE> Starter Files for Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Sports clothing manufacturer Starter  
Corp., which made a splash in the 1980s and early 1990s with lines 
of team logo jackets, jerseys and other sportswear, has filed for 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection from its creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	The company listed assets of $118.1 million and liabilities of  
$120.5 million. Employees at the New Haven headquarters and at a 
manufacturing plant in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, were told to go home 
Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also has a distribution center in Memphis, Tenn.,  
and 19 outlet stores located in 10 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The filing will enable Edison to facilitate a restructuring or a  
sale of all or parts of the retail organization, or to keep 
operating under a court's supervision while it develops a plan for 
returning to solvency. 
</P>
<P>
	Starter has yet to file its 1998 10-K annual report with the  
Securities and Exchange Commission. In a statement Monday, Starter 
said the delay was due to ongoing negotiations with its investors 
and creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials in New Haven did not return repeated telephone  
calls seeking further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was founded in 1971 and became one of the largest  
manufacturers of team-licensed sportswear, with contracts to pro 
basketball, baseball, football and hickey and more than 100 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
	Starter, which also makes uniforms for some major league teams,  
had struggled in recent years as competitors entered the market and 
demand for their product slipped. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the unsecured creditors listed in Monday's filing in U.S.  
Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., were NBA Properties, $15.6 
million; Major League Baseball Properties, $1.6 million; NFL 
Properties, $1.2 million; and NHL Enterprises, $903,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Starter has always been a very strong partner and supporter of  
Major League Baseball, and it's very unfortunate that we may not be 
able to continue this partnership,'' said Derrick Johnson, a 
spokesman for Major League Baseball Properties. 
</P>
<P>
	Also filing for Chapter 11 protection from creditors were the  
company's affiliates, Starter Outlet Stores Inc., Starter Galt 
Inc., and Starter Delaware Inc.

<HEADLINE> Brewers Put Pulsipher on 15-Day DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Milwaukee Brewers placed pitcher Bill  
Pulsipher on the 15-day disabled list Monday, retroactive to 
Saturday, because of a lower back strain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fifteen days should be fine for him,'' manager Phil Garner  
said. ``I don't anticipate that to be a problem. He's a maximum 
effort-type guy. He hits the ground hard when he comes off the 
mound and it hurts his back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pulsipher was 1-1 with a 6.75 ERA in two starts. He was  
scheduled to start Wednesday against St. Louis; Rafael Roque will 
pitch in his place. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking Pulsipher's spot on the roster is right-hander Steve  
Falteisek, whose contract was purchased from Triple-A Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to use him and he's ready to go,'' Garner said of his  
new reliever. ``He has a heavy sinker and a hard slider. If he 
throws strikes, he'll be extremely successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pulsipher had back surgery during the off-season. The back  
problem was aggravated during his last start against the Cubs in 
the home opener last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Falteisek was 1-1 with a 2.89 ERA in five relief appearances at  
Louisville. In 1997, he was 0-0 with a 3.38 ERA in five games for 
Montreal.

<HEADLINE> Court Accepts Inheritance Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide  
whether people can avoid using inherited money to pay overdue 
federal taxes by disclaiming their right to the inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said it will hear an Arkansas man's argument that the  
federal government could not seize the money from his mother's 
estate because he had given up his right to collect it. 
</P>
<P>
	Irma Drye died without a will in 1994 in Pulaski County, Ark. At  
the time, her son, Rohn F. Drye Jr., owed the federal government 
about $325,000 in overdue taxes following the bankruptcy of his 
engineering firm. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1995, Drye filed legal papers disclaiming his right to  
his mother's estate, which was worth $236,000 including a $75,000 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	A state probate court ruled that under Arkansas law, Drye's  
disclaimer meant he had no interest in Mrs. Drye's estate. The 
court ordered the estate given to his daughter, Theresa K. Drye, 
who put the money in a family trust with Rohn Drye, his wife and 
daughter named as beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service then filed a lien against the trust  
and collected $134,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust sued the government, saying that because Drye  
disclaimed his inheritance, he never had an interest in the estate 
to which the government could attach a lien. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled for the government, as did the 8th U.S.  
Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeals court said Drye's right to 
inherit his mother's estate should be considered property to which 
the federal lien could be attached. Drye's disclaimer did not void 
the lien, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal granted review today, Drye's lawyer said the 8th  
Circuit court ruling ``effectively strips the states of their 
traditional power to define property rights.'' About 35 other 
states have similar laws, the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers said people cannot avoid paying  
federal taxes through ``legal fictions'' in state law that make a 
disclaimer of an inheritance retroactive, with the intended effect 
that the person never inherited the money at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Drye vs. U.S., 98-1101.

<HEADLINE> Nice Guy Robinson Finishes Last </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Larry Robinson's pleasant demeanor  
helped cost him his job as coach of the Los Angeles Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	The team said Monday it was not renewing Robinson's contract,  
which expired after four seasons. He had a 122-161-45 record, and 
the Kings missed the playoffs three of the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our performance this year was less than expected,'' general  
manager Dave Taylor said. ``We lacked consistency, and at times we 
lacked the work ethic. That's not acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also out of jobs are assistants Don Edwards, Rick Green and Jay  
Leach. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who won six Stanley Cups during a Hall of Fame playing  
career with Montreal, came to the Kings after being an assistant 
with New Jersey when the Devils won the Stanley Cup in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was well liked by his players, and left wing Luc  
Robitaille suggested that niceness might have been his undoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a guy's not producing, he always gave them an extra  
chance and unfortunately, guys didn't realize how lucky they 
were,'' Robitaille said. ``I don't know that we need a new coach, 
but we need a new attitude from everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The soft-spoken Robinson acknowledged he probably should have  
been tougher on the players, but he said that's not his nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this day and age, I guess you've got to do a lot of  
screaming and yelling, and that in itself is a lot of wear and 
tear,'' he said. ``I don't feel my demeanor works well with problem 
super athletes. I'm a good teacher and I work well with young 
kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, 47, never pulled punches, whether he was talking to  
team management, his players or the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't guard my words, I speak from the heart,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	So when he declined to sign a three-year contract extension  
offered last September, musing out loud that he wasn't sure he 
wanted to continue coaching, Taylor interpreted it negatively. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was difficult to understand why he didn't accept the  
extension,'' Taylor said. ``He was not sure of himself and that has 
given the wrong image. 
</P>
<P>
	``The players look to the coach for leadership. For him to have  
any hesitation is the wrong message back to the players. There was 
a lot of speculation to Larry's future all year and that was a 
distraction to the club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he was troubled by the mounting losses and numerous  
injuries, Robinson later decided he wanted to stay with the Kings. 
He asked Taylor about his job status before Sunday's 3-2 loss to 
St. Louis, and was told he would not be back. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not what I envisioned,'' Robinson said. ``I still feel  
there was a lot to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings had a 32-45-5 record this season, a year after they  
finished second in the Pacific Division, made the playoffs and 
Robinson was runner-up for NHL coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	But this season, the team lost 25 games by one goal, had one of  
the league's worst power plays and lost 335 man-games to injuries 
or illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're as talented as we were made out to be,''  
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was known for exhibiting patience during trying times --  
including the loss of goalies Stephane Fiset and Jamie Storr to 
groin injuries in the early weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players who had career years last season failed to  
repeat those performances, including Jozef Stumpel, who led the 
team in points last season with 79, but had just 34 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you instill heart, drive and intestinal fortitude in  
people who don't have it or don't want to have it?'' Robinson 
asked. ``We had more talkers than leaders and not enough doers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen a place where the players aren't held  
accountable for their lackluster play. With the way some of these 
guys played, they would've been run out of Montreal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said the Kings have not yet begun a search for Robinson's  
replacement, and said there is no timetable for hiring someone. 
</P>
<P>
	There could be more changes in store.  
</P>
<P>
	Taylor planned to meet today with individual players to discuss  
their performances. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be some players that will not be back next year,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> WTO OKs Sanctions in Banana Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The European Union promised to change its banana  
import policies after the World Trade Organization approved tough 
U.S. sanctions against European products on Monday, a victory for 
Washington in the long-running trade dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States claims the EU discriminates unfairly against  
bananas imported from U.S. multinational companies in Latin America 
and favors those from former European colonies in the Caribbean and 
Africa. The WTO had already ruled the EU policies illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Washington has announced a package of sanctions  
worth $191.4 million a year imposing tariffs of up to 100 percent 
on a list of products, effectively doubling the price of some 
items. 
</P>
<P>
	Products affected include French handbags, German coffee-makers,  
bed linens, cardboard packing material and felt paper. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky  
welcomed the WTO authorization of American sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This action validates what the United States has been saying  
for the past year -- the EU has not complied with its obligations 
and this failure is damaging the United States,'' Barshefsky said 
in a statement. She said that in imposing the sanctions the United 
States wanted to send ``a clear message to the EU that 
protectionism has a price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a WTO expert panel approved the sanctions, EU trade  
ambassador Roderick Abbott said the EU would change its licenses 
and quotas to comply with WTO rules. It may take until next year to 
put the changes through. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have expressed our intention to comply fully,'' Abbott  
said. ``That is not to say it is going to be easy, because we are 
consulting with people whose interests are diametrically opposed to 
each other, but at any rate we will try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Changes in the EU regulations have to be approved by all 15  
member states. Abbott said any changes would probably not come 
before January and could even be delayed till autumn by upcoming 
European elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very much in hopes that the retaliation can end and  
will end very quickly,'' U.S. trade ambassador Rita Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States said Monday that it would make the sanctions  
retroactive to March 3, the date on which it started forcing 
importers to post a bond for the proposed tariffs. The arbitration 
panel was supposed to report back on that date, but missed its 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	EU members and many other WTO countries argue that sanctions can  
only start from the day of WTO approval, Abbott said. The EU will 
seek consultations with the United States over the issue, he said.

<HEADLINE> Van Breda Kolff Hired at Pepperdine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- Jan Van Breda Kolff, who quit following  
Vanderbilt's 14-15 season, was hired Monday as Pepperdine's 
basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Breda Kolff, who spent six years with the Commodores,  
succeeds Lorenzo Romar. Romar went to Saint Louis last month, 
leaving with a 42-44 record in three seasons at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is some solid returning talent on the roster, and I  
would think that we can battle Gonzaga for the conference 
championship and an NCAA bid,'' Van Breda Kolff said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	At Vanderbilt, Van Breda Kolff's teams went 104-81 and played in  
the 1997 NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jan is a tremendous fit for Pepperdine, and he has the  
reputation for being a tireless worker who is dedicated to both 
academic and athletic excellence,'' Pepperdine athletic director 
John Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Breda Kolff played at Vanderbilt and in the NBA for nine  
years. The 47-year-old coach was an assistant under Pete Carril for 
six seasons at Princeton. He was head coach at Cornell for two 
years before moving to Vanderbilt. His college coaching record is 
127-110. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Butch Van Breda Kolff, coached at Princeton and four  
other colleges, and was a pro coach with five teams, including the 
Los Angeles Lakers for two years in the late `60s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Waves next season are expected to have four returning  
starters from a team that was 19-13 and lost to Colorado in the 
first round of the NIT. Pepperdine earned eight NCAA tournament 
bids from 1979-94, but none since. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other recent Pepperdine coaches moved to higher-profile jobs  
-- Jim Harrick (UCLA, Rhode Island, Georgia) and Tom Asbury (Kansas 
State).

<HEADLINE> High Human Cost in All Wars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Wars by the dozen have convulsed parts of the world this decade,  
killing people by the million. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict in Yugoslavia is but one. Death tolls or estimates  
in a sampling of conflicts fought in the 1990s, starting with the 
most costly in civilian and military casualties: 
</P>
<P>
	AFGHANISTAN: 2 million, 1979-1992: Soviet-backed coup put  
pro-Moscow regime in power, backed by more than 100,000 Soviet 
soldiers. Rebel groups drove Soviets out and seized power, turning 
against each other. Civil war continues between Taliban militia and 
alliance of opposition forces. 
</P>
<P>
	SUDAN: 1.5 million, 1983-99: Rebels from the Christian and  
animist south have been fighting for autonomy from the Arab and 
Muslim north in a conflict marked by famine. 
</P>
<P>
	RWANDA: 500,000 to 800,000, 1994: A 90-day slaughter of Tutsis  
or moderate Hutus by soldiers, militia and others under the 
influence of the Hutu government, finally put down by Tutsi-led 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	ANGOLA: 500,000, 1975-1999: Civil war between the government and  
UNITA rebels first erupted after Angola's 1975 independence from 
Portugal. Peace accords signed in 1991 and 1994 both collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	BOSNIA: 250,000, 1991-95: Military conflict and civilian  
massacres following the breakup of Yugoslavia, settled with a 
U.S.-brokered peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	GUATEMALA: 200,000, 1960-96: Civil war ended with peace  
agreement between leftist rebels and the government. 
</P>
<P>
	LIBERIA: 150,000, 1989-97: Civil war sparked by rebellion to  
oust ethnic dictatorship. Democratic government installed, but 
sporadic armed clashes have followed. 
</P>
<P>
	BURUNDI: 150,000 to 250,000: 1993-99: Tutsis and Hutus have been  
fighting since the 1993 assassination by Tutsis of the first 
democratically elected president -- a Hutu -- and a coup in 1996 that 
brought a Tutsi government to power. 
</P>
<P>
	ALGERIA: 75,000, 1992-98: An insurgency touched off when the  
army canceled elections the Islamic Salvation Front was poised to 
win. Algeria is getting its first civilian chief of state since 
1965, but the election brought charges of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	ETHIOPIA-ERITREA: Unknown, 1998-99: A continuing border war, one  
of Africa's worst conflicts, with each country claiming to have 
killed tens of thousands of soldiers on the other side, but no 
reliable estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	COLOMBIA: 1,200 civilians, 1998: Thousands die yearly in  
violence perpetrated by drug traffickers, leftist rebels, 
right-wing paramilitary squads and wayward army soldiers in a 
decades-long struggle. The country's ombudsman says civilian 
massacres rose 16 percent last year, to 1,200, and more than 
300,000 people were displaced by violence. 
</P>
<P>
	ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS: 125,000, 1948-1997: The private Center for  
Defense Information's count since the establishment of Israel as a 
modern state. 
</P>

<P>
	SIERRA LEONE: 14,000, 1992-99: Continuing war between the  
Revolutionary United Front and the government, with the rebels 
backed by an ousted military junta and the government by a 
Nigerian-led intervention force. 
</P>
<P>
	PERSIAN GULF WAR: 4,500 to 45,000, 1991: Widely disputed even  
now, the estimated civilian death toll from allied bombing has been 
put as low as 2,500 by U.S. officials and as high as 35,000 by 
Iraq. Estimates of Iraqi military deaths also vary widely, starting 
at about 1,500. U.S. officials say 147 Americans died in action 
during Desert Storm bombing and ground campaign; 289 more died in 
accidents before and during the war and related Gulf operations 
since. 
</P>
<P>
	NORTHERN IRELAND: 3,250, 1968-1998: Street clashes between  
Catholic protesters and Protestant police, leading in 1970 to the 
start of bombings and shootings by the IRA and then random killings 
by Protestant groups. 
</P>
<P>
	KOSOVO: 2,000, 1998: A death toll that has risen this year to  
unknown heights since Serbs intensified their ethnic purge of 
Kosovars and NATO started bombing to stop the repression. Mass 
graves have been reported in Kosovo. NATO has acknowledged bombing 
a passenger train and possibly a refugee convoy; Serbs said about 
75 died as a result. 
</P>
<P>
	SPAIN: 800, 1961-99: Basque separatists declared a truce six  
months ago in their armed campaign for independence, although it

<HEADLINE> Pa. Halts Sales of Grain Alcohol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Hoping to reduce binge drinking on  
college campuses, the state has banned liquor stores from selling 
grain alcohol to the general public. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite a concerted effort by Pennsylvania colleges and  
universities to deal with alcohol problems in their communities, we 
have found that a disproportionate number of grain alcohol sales 
are still occurring in college areas,'' John E. Jones III, the 
state's Liquor Control Board chairman, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain alcohol -- a potent form of alcohol also called ethanol --  
will continue to be sold to hospitals and other businesses that 
need permits to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's liquor board, which oversees all of Pennsylvania's  
648 liquor stores -- the only places that sell hard liquor by the 
bottle -- also licenses beer distributors, taverns and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders went out over the weekend to the state's Wine &AMP; Spirits  
Shoppes to stop sales to the general public -- at least partly in 
commemoration of April as Alcohol Awareness Month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's better to walk the walk than simply talk the talk,'' said  
Jones, who was flanked by board members and legislators at a 
Capitol news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain alcohol was sold along with other types of liquor at state  
stores until 1990, when the board ordered it removed from the 
shelves and made it available to customers only upon request. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales plummeted from more than 121,000 bottles in fiscal 1990 to  
fewer than 65,000 the next year. Sales continued to decline until 
last year, when the number increased by 5 percent to nearly 54,000 
bottles. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said grain-alcohol sales are highest at stores closest to  
college and university campuses, although he acknowledged officials 
have only anecdotal evidence about the extent of binge drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain alcohol also is used to clean machine parts and as a  
preservative. ``It's high octane, super-strength,'' said Dr. Robert 
S. Muscalus, the state physician general. 
</P>
<P>
	Muscalus said the action will both discourage people from using  
grain alcohol as a quick and comparatively inexpensive way to get 
drunk and may protect those who unwittingly consume it in spiked 
punch. 
</P>
<P>
	College students and anyone else who wants to buy grain alcohol  
can still buy it in neighboring states, but they could be fined $25 
per bottle if they are caught transporting it back into 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and West Virginia all allow sales  
of grain alcohol, while Ohio sells it only by special permit, and 
New York has banned sales altogether, board officials said.

<HEADLINE> Hockey Is a Big Hit in Music City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Charlie Tidwell promised he ``wouldn't  
be caught dead'' at a Nashville Predators game. 
</P>
<P>
	Tidwell's game was golf.  
</P>
<P>
	He didn't know anything about hockey and didn't want to learn.  
The NHL's newest franchise couldn't entice him with a splashy ad 
campaign featuring country music's biggest stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, Tidwell had two season tickets, but those were business  
purchases and he planned to give them all away. Then his son-in-law 
convinced him to go to a game. Tidwell was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
	He bought two more season tickets in December -- for himself and  
his wife. They also purchased matching Predators sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just full of action,'' Tidwell said. ``It's just  
completely fun. ... We're upgrading our seats for next year if we 
can. That's after me saying I wouldn't be caught dead down here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Move over NASCAR. Watch out college basketball and football.  
Music City is becoming a hockey town. 
</P>
<P>
	The Predators concluded their inaugural season as the NHL's  
attendance leader in markets under 2 million people, despite a 
28-47-7 record. They averaged 16,145 a game, and 10 of their 17 
sellouts came after January, when their playoff hopes had dimmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fan support in the stands and Nashville in general has  
been fantastic,'' general manager David Poile said. ``The Nashville 
Arena sort of become the place to be in Nashville. It's been really 
a rewarding experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the NHL granted Nashville a franchise in 1997, the worry  
was the city was ``too Southern'' to embrace such a Northern game. 
The team quickly changed that sentiment with a flashy ad campaign 
and sabre-tooth tiger logo that became popular with fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Once they got people in the door, Predators officials promised  
them they would like what they saw. Each game was a party where 
fans could rub elbows with country stars like Vince Gill and Reba 
McEntire, participate in contests and a listen to a live band. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans who didn't know a two-line pass from a two-step got help  
from the Predators, who held ``Hockey 101'' and ``Predators 
University'' clinics to teach the fans the game. The public address 
announcer explained calls during the games, sometimes in 
excruciatingly basic terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The explanations were so simple some of the Predators players  
thought fans might be offended. Instead, fans appreciated the 
helping hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Captain Tom Fitzgerald has been amazed at how knowledgeable the  
fans have become in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are their team. It's been very overwhelming,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Predators got their foot in the door with fans by using  
country music stars in its ``Got Tickets?'' campaign, which 
featured celebrities like Garth Brooks sporting a blacked-out tooth 
and asking fans, ``Got tickets?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tradeoff has been that many country music stars are hooked  
on hockey, giving the Predators a celebrity cachet usually found in 
Los Angeles or New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Gill has season tickets near the ice. McEntire has her own  
suite. Barbara Mandrell is a regular on the arena's Celebrity Cam 
shots on the Jumbotron along with singers like Mindy McCready and 
Deana Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	McEntire, whose son plays in a children's hockey league, hadn't  
seen an NHL game before the Predators' debut. Now she hates to miss 
a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I go to as many games as my schedule will allow, which about  
half the games this year. I will attend as many game as possible 
next year and can't wait for the new season,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Predators' biggest challenge will be avoiding a sophomore  
slump as the franchise builds toward the playoffs through draft 
picks rather than aging veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is confident Nashville fans will stay with the team  
through its growing pains. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been bitten,'' Fitzgerald said. ``They've got the bug,  
and it's been great. I hope I'm around a lot of years to see it 
keep growing.''

<HEADLINE> Pincay Wins Twice at Santa Anita </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Laffit Pincay, within striking range of  
Bill Shoemaker's record of 8,833 career riding victories, was 
aboard two winners Monday including the feature race on closing day 
of Santa Anita's winter-spring meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Pincay rode Enjoy The Moment to a half-length triumph over  
Champ's Star in the $107,900 Valiant Pete Handicap. Pincay was also 
aboard the winner in the 10th and final race of the day, putting 
him at 8,731 career wins -- 102 behind Shoemaker's record. 
</P>
<P>
	Pincay rode at least one winner on the final nine days of the  
Santa Anita meeting and wound up third in the jockey standings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should be leading rider,'' Pincay said. ``I'm a senior  
citizen -- 52 years old -- so I should get 20 winners before the meet 
starts, like a golf handicap. If they had, I probably would have 
ended up leading rider.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That honor went to David Flores, who led his first major race  
meeting with 75 victories. Alex Solis finished second with 65 wins 
while Pincay had 58. 
</P>
<P>
	Enjoy The Moment, who carried 117 pounds, beat males in the  
Valiant Pete race, covering six furlongs in 1:08 4-5. The 
4-year-old daughter of Slew's Royalty was the 5-2 favorite and paid 
$7.20, $4.20 and $3.40. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was the seventh in 12 lifetime starts for Enjoy The  
Moment and was worth $64,740, raising her career earnings to 
$301,520. 
</P>
<P>
	Champ's Star returned $6.20 and $4.40. Peach Flat paid $5.40 to  
show.

determining whether women with ambiguous mammogram results need an 
immediate biopsy to check for cancer. Some 800,000 biopsies are 
done every year, from which 180,000 women are diagnosed with breast 
cancer. So scientists have hunted for ways to reduce unnecessary 
biopsies without missing women who have cancer.

	EU To Ease Banana Import Policies  
</P>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The European Union promised to change its banana  
import policies after the World Trade Organization approved tough 
U.S. sanctions against European products. The United States claims 
the EU discriminates unfairly against bananas imported from U.S. 
multinational companies in Latin America and favors those from 
former European colonies in the Caribbean and Africa. Washington 
had announced a package of sanctions worth $191.4 million a year 
imposing tariffs of up to 100 percent on a list of products. 
Products affected include French handbags, German coffee-makers, 
bed linens, cardboard packing material and felt paper. After a WTO 
expert panel approved the sanctions, EU trade ambassador Roderick 
Abbott said the EU would change its licenses and quotas to comply 
with WTO rules. It may take until next year to put the changes 
through.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Calls for Halt to Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- In their first talks since the onset of the NATO  
airstrikes on Yugoslavia, Russian President Boris Yeltsin conferred 
today with President Clinton. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan 
scheduled a peace mission to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian leader urged Clinton to call off the NATO airstrikes  
that began March 24, the Kremlin press service said. Russia has 
staunchly opposed the NATO airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Deeply divided over the Kosovo crisis, NATO and Russia cracked  
open the door to an Annan initiative last week, in a sign that both 
sides view the secretary-general as a possible mediator. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan's mission comes even though Yugoslavia rejected the key  
element of his Kosovo peace initiative, saying an international 
military force in Yugoslavia was unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	In their phone conversation Monday, Clinton and Yeltsin also  
discussed the plight of the ethnic Albanian refugees fleeing 
Kosovo, the Interfax news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, a White House official said the discussion  
largely centered on matters the two leaders agree on, including the 
need for Serb forces to withdraw from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin has ruled out Russian military intervention in  
Yugoslavia, and has sought to help bring about a diplomatic 
settlement. However, Russia's influence with Yugoslavia is limited, 
and NATO has ignored Moscow's calls to stop the daily bombing 
raids. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite sharp disagreements on the strikes, Russia and the  
United States have pledged to work together to try to settle the 
conflict. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright agreed in meetings 
last week with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov that there must 
be an end to repression, a pullout of Serb troops and police from 
Kosovo, a return of displaced refugees to their homes and access 
for humanitarian organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, senior Russian officials claimed that NATO,  
frustrated by the lack of success of its airstrikes, was preparing 
for an invasion on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov said Monday the alliance was denying plans for sending  
ground troops into combat only to assuage public opinion in NATO 
member countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov warned of dire consequences, ``not only for Europe but  
for the world as a whole,'' should ground troops be deployed. He 
stressed that any such offensive will only hurt chances for a peace 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kosovo problem has no military solution,'' Ivanov said.  
``The war must be stopped today. Every day that passes makes the 
problem more difficult to solve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO says it has no intention of launching ground combat in  
Yugoslavia, though it would deploy troops to implement a peace 
settlement. Russia contends NATO ground forces should not go into 
Yugoslavia at all, unless they are invited in by the Yugoslav 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's protests have been largely symbolic. The country's  
military and its economy are both in shambles, leaving it with few 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin said Monday that Russia had decided not to send any  
additional ships into the Adriatic. Russia has sent only one ship 
into the Adriatic to monitor NATO warships.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities rose in Monday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $7.52 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.230 percent, up from 4.190 percent last 
week. An additional $7.51 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.370 percent, up from 4.320 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the highest since April 5, when the  
bills sold for 4.265 percent. The six-month rate was the highest 
since March 22, when the rate was 4.420. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.346 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,893.10 and 4.543 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,779.10. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, rose to 4.67 
percent last week from 4.66 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> GM, Toyota May Seek Broader Linkup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The No. 2 executive at General Motors Corp.  
hinted Monday that a new technology partnership between GM and 
Toyota Motor Corp. could lead to a broader linkup of the 
automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	A merged GM and Toyota would account for more than one quarter  
of the world's car and truck sales, but GM vice chairman Harry 
Pearce stopped short of predicting a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would certainly be premature to talk about a merger,''  
Pearce said in an interview. ``But I think it's important for both 
companies to have a very open mind in terms of where this kind of 
collaboration takes us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce's provacative comment came after he and Toyota vice  
president Akihiro Wada announced a five-year deal to jointly 
research and develop alternative-fuel vehicles. Pearce said both 
sides expected the venture to last well beyond five years as ``a 
long-term and continuing collaboration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've both proven ourselves to be technical innovators  
in a variety of ways that make this a very, very strong 
combination,'' Pearce said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM is the world's largest automaker; Japan's Toyota is ranked  
third, behind Ford Motor Co. Pearce said their joint efforts in 
advanced technology research would give them a tremendous 
competitive advantage. He said he hoped it would lead to joint 
production of nonpolluting vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	David Cole, who directs the University of Michigan's Office for  
the Study of Automotive Transportation, said an GM-Toyota merger 
seems unlikely because of the antitrust issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though it may not be the barrier that it once was, it would be  
fascinating to see,'' Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM chairman Jack Smith and Toyota chairman Shoichiro Toyoda have  
had a close relationship for more than 15 years, dating back to 
their establishment of a joint assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., 
that still produces Toyota Corollas and Chevrolet Prizm 
subcompacts. 
</P>
<P>
	``What that sort of backdrop says is this is not something new  
or unique,'' Cole said of the technology deal. ``With the richness 
of the relationship that has developed, it creates the foundation 
for some very deep relationships in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GM-Toyota research will initially focus on vehicles powered  
by fuel cells, batteries and hybrid propulsion systems that combine 
different technologies, such as electric motors and high-efficiency 
gasoline engines. Fuel cells generate electricity using a chemical 
reaction between hydrogen and oxygen and produce little or no 
emissions. So far they are too expensive for mass production cars. 
</P>
<P>
	GM was the first major automaker to mass-market a modern  
electric car, the EV1. Though demand has been disappointing, it has 
provided a real-world test of the technology that will be used in 
developing other electric propulsion systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota was the first to sell a hybrid electric car in Japan, the  
Prius, which will go on sale in the United States and Europe next 
year. Wada said Toyota is working to bring the subcompact's cost 
down to about the price of a Corolla in the United States and to 
make a profit. Currently, the car is a money-loser. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce, meanwhile, would not rule out the possibility that GM  
would rename the Prius as a Chevrolet. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers have become increasingly competitive in trying to  
establish themselves as leaders in environmentally friendly 
technology to impress Wall Street, consumers and to attract 
high-tech talent. 
</P>
<P>
	GM-Toyota's announcement came one day before Ford,  
DaimlerChrysler AG and fuel-cell developer Ballard Power Systems 
Inc. planned to announce a deal with three oil companies to develop 
a demonstration fleet of fuel-cell powered vehicles in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce and Wada declined to say how much they would spend on  
their collaboration but Pearce said it would be substantial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking hundreds and hundreds of engineers, and major  
dedication of human resources and capital and laboratory facilities 
around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that suppliers likely will contribute much of the  
technology and engineering that will go into the cars of the 
future. That's where the combined size of GM-Toyota will make a 
difference, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were a resident in the supplier community and I was  
approached by a partnership or collaboration that represented a 
quarter of the world's market, I would pay a lot of attention to 
that,'' Pearce said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce also said the deal will allow GM and Toyota to take  
advantage of their combined size to get the lowest prices for 
materials and parts, and to define technical standards for emerging 
technologies.

<HEADLINE> Big Banks Report Solid Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Citigroup Inc., BankAmerica Corp. and the Bank  
of New York Co. all reported strong first-quarter profits Monday, 
as U.S. consumers ran up their credit card bills and businesses 
borrowed to expand their reach. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking industry's impressive results reflect an economy  
with strong consumer confidence, a turbocharged stock market, low 
unemployment and benign inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This morning's reports were nothing short of fantastic,'' said  
Michael Ancell, an analyst with Edward Jones. ``The market rebound 
we've seen over the last quarter or two has given a huge boost to 
the banks' underwriting and trading revenues, and that's resulted 
in most companies beating earnings estimates, and it's certainly 
lit fire to their stock prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bank stocks rallied in the morning, but were dragged down with  
the market and ended the day mixed. Investors had bid up the prices 
of several top banks on the hunch that Monday's solid results will 
be repeated Tuesday when Chase Manhattan Bank, Bank One, Wells 
Fargo and Mellon Bank report their profits for the first three 
months of the year. 

</P>
<P>
	 *Citigroup    	
</P>
<P>
	The banking and insurance behemoth posted net income of $2.36  
billion, or $1.01 a share, up 9 percent from the first-quarter last 
year, when Citigroup earned $2.16 billion or 90 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup's profits from operations, which is widely watched by  
Wall Street, totaled $2.42 billion, or $1.04 a share, handily 
beating analysts' average estimate of 87 cents a share, according 
to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based financial services company, which was formed  
last year by the merger of Citibank and Travelers Group, has cut 
more than 4,100 jobs to reduce expenses. Citigroup said it has 
already realized $900 million of its targeted $2 billion in annual 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's global consumer business, which includes its North  
American banking and lending operations, grew 33 percent to $1.05 
billion in the quarter. Business was strong across the board, but 
especially in North American credit cards, where earnings jumped 75 
percent to $268 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup has bought several credit card businesses, including  
its recent acquisition of Mellon Bank's card unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``That, combined with higher prices and fees has really helped  
their card business take off,'' Ancell explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Citigroup announced it was selling its $930 million  
automobile finance business to Dime Bankcorp Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	During the first quarter, Citigroup's electronic banking was one  
of the few weak spots. The loss at its e-Citi unit widened 20 
percent to $36 million as the company spent heavily to develop the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Results for the global corporate and investment bank operations  
rebounded sharply in the first quarter, rising 31 percent to $1.36 
billion over the comparable quarter in 1998 and more than doubling 
from the fourth quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The gain was most notable at the Salomon Smith Barney brokerage  
and investment banking unit, which posted record earnings on total 
revenues of $3.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Travelers Life &AMP; Annuity business saw a 20 percent increase  
in income to $147 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Reacting to the bottom line numbers, investors sent Citigroup's  
stock up as high as $76.25, but the shares ended the day off $1 at 
$70.62 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
	 *BankAmerica    	
</P>
<P>
	BankAmerica, based in Charlotte, N.C., reported net income of  
$1.91 billion, or $1.08 a share, a 44 percent increase over the 
first quarter last year, when the bank earned $1.33 billion, or 75 
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	BankAmerica's performance beat analysts' estimate of $1.03 a  
share, according to First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	``BankAmerica had a good quarter, but not as good as the New  
York banks because their investment banking business was a bit 
sluggish,'' Ancell said. 
</P>
<P>
	BankAmerica's investment banking and securities revenue was hurt  
by an employee exodus at Montgomery Securities, and by the sale of 
its Robertson Stephens division last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's net interest income of $4.65 billion was virtually  
unchanged from a year ago, as loan and deposit growth offset 
declines in loan sales and interest rate spreads. 
</P>
<P>
	Average managed loans grew 11 percent to $385 billion,  
reflecting increases in both consumer and business loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Noninterest expenses fell by 5 percent to $4.45 billion,  
illustrating the effect of the job cuts and other cost reductions 
from the merger of BankAmerica and NationsBank. 
</P>
<P>
	BankAmerica's stock closed down $1.25 at $71.75 on the NYSE.  

</P>
<P>
	 *Bank of New York    	
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of New York Co. posted first quarter earnings of $316  
million, or 41 cents a share, matching Wall Street's estimate. 
Profits were up 12 percent from the first quarter last year, when 
the bank earned $284 million or 36 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Net interest income rose almost 8 percent to $436 million in the  
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Total noninterest income reached $625 million, up 5 percent from  
the year-ago period, driven by strong fees and a gain on 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Expenses were virtually flat at $509 million.  
</P>
<P>
	With few surprises in the numbers, investors reacted mildly,  
pushing the Bank of New York's stock up 12 1/2 cents to $37.68 3/4 on the 
Big Board.

<HEADLINE> Team Begins Searching for Capsule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- An underwater salvage team set off  
today in search of Mercury astronaut Gus Grissom's space capsule, 
entombed in the Atlantic for 38 years. 
</P>
<P>
	A 180-foot ship, the Needham Tide, headed for the 3-mile-deep  
waters 300 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral. The ship was a day 
late raising anchor; the crew needed time to get a new switch for a 
hydraulic power unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anxious to get going,'' said Curt Newport, the expedition  
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport estimated it would take at least one day to reach the  
area where he believes Grissom's Liberty Bell 7 lies on the ocean 
floor. His calculations are based on 14 years of poring over NASA 
charts and photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	The capsule splashed down July 21, 1961, following Grissom's  
15-minute suborbital flight, which made him only the second 
American in space. The hatch blew open too soon, and the capsule 
became waterlogged and was too heavy to be lifted by helicopter. 
The rescue line was cut, and the capsule sank. 
</P>
<P>
	Grissom, who nearly drowned, insisted until his death in the  
1967 Apollo launch pad fire that he did nothing wrong. Many have 
speculated that he may have bumped something or panicked and blown 
the hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	If the capsule and hatch can be found, the mystery might be  
solved. The hatch will be especially difficult to find; Newport 
said it could be up to a mile from the capsule. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport and his team will use sonar to survey a 24-square-mile  
area. They will be probing 3,000 feet deeper than the Titanic 
wreckage site in the North Atlantic.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Vehicles Rigged To Steal Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- You didn't want to get caught waiting behind  
Alberto Perez when he got the itch to fill up his rickety van at 
the gas station. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say Perez's vehicle held 600 gallons -- allowing him  
to make regular trips to neighbors' houses to sell the fuel for as 
little as 70 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in Florida say vans and trucks like Perez's -- shabbily  
rigged to hold as much as 1,000 gallons -- are increasingly being 
used to steal and resell gas across Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, gas peddlers use stolen credit cards to fill up the  
rigged vehicle at a service station, often returning several times 
to the same station. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, when they deliver the gas to customers, usually at their  
homes or at a secret meeting place, the sellers use a hose with a 
meter that tells them how many gallons the customer bought. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to see a lot more of it,'' said Tony Pilla of the  
state Department of Transportation's law enforcement division, who 
noted that recently increasing fuel prices will boost demand for 
black-market gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Gas prices have soared roughly 25 percent over the past six  
weeks. The authoritative Lundberg Survey showed the average price 
was nearly $1.23 a gallon last week. Three weeks ago, it was $1.09, 
and in late February a stunningly low 99.8 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Since it's not illegal to sell gasoline, those caught with large  
quantities of fuel have been charged with illegally transporting 
hazardous materials. Since late 1997, 20 people, including Perez, 
have faced such charges in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. 
</P>
<P>
	But with overhead cheap, vendors can simply pay their fines,  
which range from $500 to $3,000, and return to work, authorities 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Advertising is also easy and inexpensive, Pilla said. The word  
spreads to relatives and friends who want in on inexpensive gas. 
</P>
<P>
	And legitimate gas sellers aren't the only ones hurt by the  
scam. Some say the rigged vehicles amount to rolling bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	A van like Perez's could have pulverized with the force of six  
sticks of dynamite -- damaging as much as an entire neighborhood 
block, Pilla said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to take out a few houses, of course,'' he said.  
``They're parking them in residential areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to combat the problem, authorities have warned gas  
stations to be alert to people filling up with large quantities. 
And Pilla said he is gathering material for legislation that would 
result in stiffer penalties for violators in Florida.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Ford's Brazilian subsidiary denied  
reports Monday it would suspend work on a $1 billion plant after 
the governor of a southern state retracted millions of dollars in 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate affairs director Celio Batalha brushed aside the  
reports, made by the O Globo news agency, explaining the company 
was still negotiating ``an end to the impasse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rio Grande do Sul state's previous government had enticed Ford  
and General Motors to build plants in the state with offers of $468 
million in financial aid and infrastructure projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Rio Grande do Sul state government said last month it  
would not honor the commitments, saying it needed the money for 
other spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has already received $22.8 million of a total $249.2  
million. GM has already received $188.3 million of a total of 
$219.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	According to O Globo, Rio Grande do Sul's decision had also  
caused General Motors to delay the scheduled year-end opening of 
its new plant in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors and Rio Grande do Sul officials were not  
immediately available for comment.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Federal agents have arrested a former state  
police commander and a soldier suspected of leading a drug 
distribution ring in southern Mexico, a newspaper reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Romeo Espinoza Pimentel, a former state judicial police  
commander in Chiapas state, and Moises Montejo Lopez were arrested 
Sunday in the state capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez, the Mexico City 
daily Reforma reported. Montejo's rank was not given. 
</P>
<P>
	The two are suspected of running a drug ring that distributed  
cocaine and marijuana in the city, according to the federal 
attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Three men and two women suspected of being part of the band also  
were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators searched five homes in the city and discovered  
nearly 160 pounds of marijuana and 1.76 ounces of cocaine. They 
also found pistols, ammunition, military uniforms and T-shirts with 
the federal judicial police logo.

	SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- About 40 members of the  
Lutheran church in El Salvador called on NATO to stop bombing 
Yugoslavia in a prayer for peace Monday outside the U.S. Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters, including several Americans, carried signs and  
shouted slogans denouncing the bombing campaign, which entered its 
26th day Monday. Police watched over the demonstration but took no 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	``May God enlighten the mind of NATO. In the name of God we ask  
that they cease these bombings against the people of Yugoslavia,'' 
the Rev. Roberto Pineda shouted.

<HEADLINE> Man Nabbed in Wyo. Hypothermia Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- A man has been arrested on a murder charge  
in the death of the mother of a man who took part in the beating 
death of gay college student Matthew Shepard, authorities said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrested on felony murder was Dennis L. Menefee Jr., 28, of  
Hastings, Fla., who was residing in Laramie at the time of Cindy 
Lee Dixon's death in January, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no connection between Dixon's death from hypothermia  
and Shepard's, Albany County Sheriff Jim Pond said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Dixon, 40, of Laramie, was found dead on Jan. 3 along a  
snow-covered rural road north of Laramie. Police did not provide 
details of Menefee's alleged role in the death. Pond could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dixon was the mother of Russell Henderson, 21, who pleaded  
guilty to murder and kidnapping in the October death of Shepard. 
Henderson received two consecutive life sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron McKinney, 21, was also charged in the death and is  
scheduled to go on trial in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Menefee was arrested after a tip indicated he may have been  
involved in Dixon's death, authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Oil Higher, Wheat Lower Monday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures were higher Monday on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange, continuing their climb amid reports that the major oil 
producing nations will follow through on promised production cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, orange juice futures were higher and wheat  
sharply lower Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil prices reached their highest level in more than a year  
Friday, and eclipsed those prices Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	There is growing confidence among market participants that the  
proposed production cuts will become reality, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Organization of Petroleum Producing Countries,  
along with a few non-OPEC nations, agreed to the output cuts last 
month following a plunge in oil prices to a 12-year low in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement helped boost prices more than 50 percent in the  
last two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Light sweet crude oil for May delivery rose 43 cents to $17.76 a  
barrel; heating oil for May delivery rose .38 cent to 43.70 cents a 
gallon; and May unleaded gasoline climbed .38 cent to 53.20 cents a 
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were sharply lower Monday on the Chicago Board of  
Trade, while corn and soybeans both posted gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were higher in early trading Monday before falling  
off. Bad weekend weather in growing regions of the United States 
probably did less damage to the crop than anticipated, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures opened lower Monday on follow-through from Friday's  
weak close. But by midmorning prices turned higher, analysts said, 
as updated weather forecasts called for a pattern of wet weather 
most of the week, which could delay planting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're kind of getting into a weather market here with cold and  
wet weather into last week ... and this week,'' said Jack Scoville, 
a trader with Price Futures Group in Chicago. ``All of the sudden 
now you're looking at a little delay'' in getting the crop in the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures followed corn higher and received support from  
soy meal, which was boosted by talk of loading delays in Brazil, 
Scoville said. That could mean more business for U.S. growers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cold weather in Brazil also provided support.  
</P>
<P>
	In trading Monday, wheat for May delivery was down 4 1/4 cents to  
$2.52 1/4 a bushel; May corn rose 2 1/2 cents to $2.20 1/2 a bushel; May 
oats fell 1/4 cent to $1.20 3/4 a bushel; and May soybeans rose 1 1/4 cents 
to $4.88 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle, feeder cattle and pork futures prices were mixed  
Monday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose 0.10 cent to 63.45 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle rose 0.10 cent to 71.70 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
climbed 0.63 cents to 55.30 cents a pound; and May pork bellies 
rose 1.00 cents to 56.60 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange juice futures rose Monday on the Board of Trade of the  
City of New York with forecasts for continued dry weather in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	There was some weekend rain in the state but not enough to  
significantly improve a crop that has suffered through dry weather 
for two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Frozen concentrated orange juice for delivery in May rose 4.60  
cents to 85.15 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE>  Mrs. Clinton Edges Closer to Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, edging closer to running  
for Senate, opened a campaign-style swing Monday by declaring, ``I 
love New York,'' as her fledgling political operation combed the 
state for potential campaign workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm obviously still considering and exploring and am very  
interested,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet she tried to minimize the political implications of the  
trip, which included talks about the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo 
and other traditional first lady fare. The White House called the 
trip an official function, thus U.S. taxpayers picked up the tab. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an exploratory trip. This is a trip filled with  
events and occasions, some of which I agreed to do months ago,'' 
Mrs. Clinton told reporters after urging private foundations to 
help ease the Kosovo refugee crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Her aides, however, conceded the trip had political  
implications. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess anytime we're up here, it's part of the (exploratory)  
process,'' said press secretary Marsha Berry. ``She's thinking 
about this. I don't know when you turn it off and turn it on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and associates say Mrs. Clinton appears to be leaning  
toward a Senate bid, though some believe she will forgo the race at 
the last minute. Their assessments are based on clues from private 
conversations with her and the full-speed-ahead groundwork being 
laid by top political aide Harold Ickes. 
</P>
<P>
	The former deputy White House chief of staff has begun compiling  
lists of campaign operatives in the event she takes the plunge. He 
has secured commitments from some potential staff, said a source 
close to Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	One longtime associate said Mrs. Clinton told him two weeks ago  
that she intended to run, but would not finalize her decision until 
June or July. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton scheduled scores of New York stops Monday, Tuesday  
and -- after returning to Washington on Wednesday -- again Thursday, 
from Long Island to Niagara Falls. Monday's unusually crowded 
schedule contained seven stops, including the Columbia University's 
Teachers College, the Ukrainian Institute, the Jewish Child Care 
Association and a fund-raiser for Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers, Ukrainians and the Jewish community are important  
Democratic constituencies. Nadler, a House Judiciary Committee 
member, staunchly defended President Clinton during the impeachment 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip brought Mrs. Clinton fresh evidence that a Senate race  
against probable Republican nominee Rudolph Giuliani would be 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest poll from Marist College's Institute for Public  
Opinion showed the pair in a dead heat, with half saying Mrs. 
Clinton should not run. The New York mayor has gained ground since 
a February Marist poll, which had Mrs. Clinton leading Giuliani, 49 
percent to 38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one said it was going to be a cakewalk,'' said Sen. Charles  
Schumer, D-N.Y., who ousted Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato last 
November and has urged the first lady to run. ``This is going to be 
a tough, tough race, but I think as people get to know her, she'll 
do better and better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers inside and outside the White House are studying whether  
Mrs. Clinton should form an exploratory committee to raise money 
that would defray the costs of future trips. She said would 
consider the move ``if it becomes appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief news conference, Mrs. Clinton explained for the first  
time why a Senate race interests her: ``I love New York, to start 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With gushing reverence, Mrs. Clinton called New York ``a  
microcosm of America,'' with a ``dynamic, diverse city'' that would 
enable her to deal with issues such as education and health care 
that are as important in New York as they are across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the collective ``we'' in a way that could include the  
first lady herself, Mrs. Clinton said, ``We have everything in New 
York that we have in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also announced plans to travel to Albania and Macedonia ``as  
soon as I'm given the green light'' by humanitarian workers, whose 
efforts she does not want to disrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	As for her career, Mrs. Clinton told several associates in  
recent days that she has concluded that serving in the Senate would 
be a good next step for her. When word first surfaced of her 
interest, Mrs. Clinton had told these same people she wasn't sure 
if she wanted to be in a Republican-controlled Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The new question: Is she willing to risk losing? Though a senior  
adviser said Mrs. Clinton is not afraid of defeat, other associates 
say she tends to avoid taking great risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Most friends and associates spoke on condition of anonymity.  
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of Teachers  
and a Mrs. Clinton supporter in New York, suggested the first lady 
is inclined to run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get a feeling that a final decision has been made yet,  
but I think she's very interested,'' Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was urged to run at every stop, including a Central  
Park event concerning hiking trails. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to wish her all the best as she hits a different kind  
of trail right here in New York state,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, 
D-N.Y., as Mrs. Clinton, from the front row, shook her head from 
side to side. At another event, NBC ``Today Show'' host Katie 
Couric joked that Mrs. Clinton was ``taking time out from apartment 
hunting'' in New York to appear.

<HEADLINE> Five To Compete in Domain Name Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Five companies will be chosen this week to  
compete with Network Solutions Inc. in the business of registering 
Internet addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	But complicating the situation is the matter that Network  
Solutions and the federal government have yet to reach an agreement 
on how the company's rivals will get their hands on the domain-name 
database, The New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Sticking points include how much data and software Network  
Solutions must share, and how much the new registrars must pay 
Network Solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Herndon, Va.-based Network Solutions has had an exclusive  
contract with the federal government for registering World Wide Web 
addresses, such as those ending in with .com, .net and .org, since 
1993. With the explosive growth of the Internet, the company moved 
from obscurity to Fortune 500 status. 
</P>
<P>
	The government moved to end that monopoly last year by creating  
the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, a 
nonprofit group established to take over administration of the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	That group on Wednesday will name the five applicants to begin  
the first test round of competition with Network Solutions. It 
hopes to open the competition to an unlimited number of companies 
worldwide by summer.

<HEADLINE> Russian Grain Supply Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's grain stocks are less than half of last  
year's level, but officials insist the supply will be enough to 
cover the country's needs until the harvest in the late summer and 
fall, a news report said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's grain reserves stood at 16.8 million tons on April 1,  
or 51 percent less than on the same date last year, the Interfax 
news agency reported, citing the State Statistics Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain reserves will be down to 2 to 4 million tons by July -- the  
lowest level in years, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock should be enough to cover Russia's grain needs until  
this year's harvest, the Interfax news agency said, citing sources 
on the statistics committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's harvest last year was just 47.8 million tons -- the  
country's worst in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The worry about possible shortages in northern regions drove the

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Whitney's Essay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from the foreword written by Florida State University  
professor Glayde Whitney to the book ``My Awakening,'' by David 
Duke, former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard who is running for Congress: 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Duke has endured an intense and unrelenting smear campaign for  
decades. Once you read this book you will know why he has been 
attacked by those of immense power. He challenges all the sacred 
cows of modern life, and he does so with intelligence and 
emotion.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``One of his honest truths is that from a thorough immersion in  
modern science he became convinced that racial egalitarianism is 
the scientific equivalent of the flat-Earth theory.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The technical questions had always been why -- what were the  
reasons for the large intellectual gap between blacks and whites? 
As the hard scientific data came in, it became more certain that 
genetic differences (heredity) played a large role in the 
discrepancy. But in public it became politically incorrect to even 
acknowledge that there was a difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Individuals of Jewish ancestry are vastly overrepresented in  
the ranks of highly successful scientist. They are among my best 
students and closest friends. Organized Jewry, on the other hand, 
dogmatically attempts to keep the general population from awareness 
of the findings of modern science.''

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Resists Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The British and Irish prime ministers tried in  
vain today to get Northern Ireland's rival political leaders to 
form a Protestant-Catholic government and keep the peace accord 
afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Politicians from three key parties left London unable to agree  
on a way to form a government, the centerpiece of the 1998 Belfast 
accord aimed at stopping three decades of bloodshed in the 
British-ruled province. 
</P>
<P>
	They did agree, however, to meet again next week at the London  
office of British Prime Minister Tony Blair. 
</P>
<P>
	David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, insisted  
that the Irish Republican Army promise to disarm before his 
Protestant supporters would join a government that includes the 
IRA-linked Sinn Fein party. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks ago Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern  
proposed a compromise plan after round-the-clock negotiations in 
Northern Ireland: Sinn Fein would receive its two positions in the 
envisioned 12-member government, but only if the IRA promised to 
destroy a cache of weapons within a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ulster Unionists and the major Catholic party, the moderate  
Social Democratic and Labor Party, or SDLP, both supported the 
approach. But Sinn Fein rejected it, prompting Monday's 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair and Ahern devoted most time to the six-member Sinn Fein  
delegation, spending the last hour talking exclusively with party 
leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men have been identified as senior IRA commanders in the  
1970s, when the outlawed group's now-suspended campaign to break 
Northern Ireland's links with Britain was at its bloodiest. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel McLaughlin accused both  
governments of deliberately misinterpreting the peace agreement to 
suit Ulster Unionist demands. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two governments keep pressing Sinn Fein for things which  
we simply cannot deliver,'' said McLaughlin, who emphasized that 
the accord specified only that Sinn Fein should use its influence 
with the IRA to achieve disarmament by May 2000. He said the accord 
``is in free fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ahern, who said he had spent 30 hours over the weekend talking  
with Northern Irish politicians by phone, testily rejected Sinn 
Fein's assertion that the agreement was collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein, Ahern said,  
``I'm not asking anyone to concede totally on their position. I'm 
asking both parties to try and assist us in developing a 
compromise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seamus Mallon, a SDLP leader who would be Trimble's deputy in  
the new government, accused both parties of maintaining positions 
that could ``destroy something which can create a totally new way 
of life for all of us.''

<HEADLINE> Lilly Earns Rise, Prozac Sales Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Eli Lilly and Co.'s first quarter profit  
excluding one-time items rose 12 percent despite a 4 percent 
decline in sales of its best-selling drug, the antidepressant 
Prozac. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings were in line with expectations but Lilly shares  
tumbled on disappointment over the decline in Prozac sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Lilly closed down $9.43 3/4 or 11.5 percent, to $72.87 1/2  
in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly earned $625.7 million, or 56 cents per share, during first  
quarter ended March 31, compared with $521.1 million, or 46 cents 
per share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time items, the profit was up a more modest 12  
percent to $588.8 million or 53 cents per share. That was in line 
with Wall Street forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall sales rose 8 percent to $2.26 billion from $2.09 billion  
in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Lilly's top drug, Prozac, the world's top-selling  
antidepressant, fell 4 percent worldwide to $589.9 million. Lilly 
said the drug's U.S. sales tumbled 6 percent because of competition 
and because of stocking by U.S. wholesalers at the end of 1998. 
Lilly expected that inventory problem to continue this quarter as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemant K. Shah, an independent analyst who covers the drug  
industry, said other drugs such as Zoloft, Paxil and Serzone are 
stealing market share from Prozac. During the first two months of 
the year, new prescriptions for Prozac fell 7 percent while the 
market overall rose 6 percent, he said. ``Other products are being 
perceived as better products,'' Shah said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly did report some good news on Prozac. The Food and Drug and  
Administration has granted the company an additional six months of 
sales exclusivity as a result of Lilly testing the drug in patients 
under 18. That means Lilly will not face generic competition for 
Prozac until mid-2004 unless pending court appeals result in one of 
Lilly's patents on the drug being thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Lilly drugs had rapid growth in the quarter. They  
include the antipsychotic agent Zyprexa, which rose 40 percent to 
$287 million, lung and pancreatic cancer drug Gemzar, which doubled 
to $114.4 million, and Evista, an osteoporosis drug, rose 63 
percent to $54.6 million. Lilly is also studying Evista for the 
prevention of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	One-time events were a gain of $174.3 million from the January  
sale of PCS Health Systems Inc. pharmacy benefits subsidiary to 
drugstore chain Rite Aid Corp., a pretax charge of $150 million to 
fund the company's non-profit foundation, and a pretax charge of 
$61.4 million to close two manufacturing sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indianapolis-based pharmaceutical company also announced it  
formed a joint venture with French drugmaker Sanofi to develop a 
new colorectal cancer drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly said it would pay Sanofi an upfront fee and other payments  
for a share of U.S. sales of a new treatment for colorectal cancer. 
The companies plan to seek approval for the new drug, oxaliplatin, 
in September.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Targets Goats Over Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- After killing nearly one million  
pigs to contain a lethal viral outbreak, Malaysia is now targeting 
goats, a newspaper reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 people have been killed by the outbreak of  
Japanese encephalitis and a newly identified virus strain named 
Nipah, after the region where it claimed its first victims. Sungai 
Nipah is about 60 miles southeast of the capital, Kuala Lumpur. 
</P>
<P>
	Health Minister Chua Jui Meng said initial tests conducted by  
the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have 
shown the Nipah virus cannot be spread through human contact. 
</P>
<P>
	Of 400 blood samples taken from medical personnel handling  
victims, some 183 tested so far have shown no sign of the virus, 
Chua was quoted as saying by the national Bernama news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese encephalitis is transmitted to humans from pigs by the  
Culex mosquito. But the means of transmission for the Nipah virus 
is not yet known. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities initially believed pigs were the sole carriers of  
the disease but have begun testing race horses, stray dogs, fruit 
bats, goats and other farm animals. No official statement has been 
made on the results of those tests. 
</P>
<P>
	However, health officials informed farmers that many goats had  
tested positive for Nipah, The Star newspaper said. Some 1,200 
goats in the Port Dickson area, close to Sungai Nipah, were 
expected to be killed this week, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesperson at the Ministry of Health would not confirm the  
report and officials at the Ministry of Agriculture were not 
immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the dead were infected by the new virus alone, although  
some died after being infected by both Japanese encephalitis and 
Nipah.

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Recchi Cleared To Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mark Recchi was cleared to play in the  
Philadelphia Flyers' Stanley Cup playoff opener against the Toronto 
Maple Leafs on Thursday after tests showed that his dizziness and 
nausea were not caused by a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	The forward was evaluated Monday in Pittsburgh by a neurosurgeon  
and a neurologist, who determined that his symptoms were due to 
migraine-related vascular spasms, team doctor Jeff Hartzell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartzell and Recchi, who finished with 16 goals and 37 assists,  
were relieved by the diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great,'' Recchi said. ``It's finally nice to get some  
answers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The migraines are ``not directly damaging brain tissue as in the  
case of a concussion,'' Hartzell said. ``Rather, it's causing a 
reactive spasm of some of the vessels that feed the brain, which 
produces the symptoms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those symptoms can be controlled by anti-migraine medication,  
which Recchi will be prescribed, Hartzell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's recognized that this does happen. Often we don't know why  
these things happen,'' Hartzell said. He added that the migraines 
could be ``impact-related.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On March 22, Recchi missed a check and went headfirst into the  
glass at Toronto. He sat out for three games, came back and 
experienced concussion-like symptoms after an April 1 game against 
Nashville, the same game in which team captain and leading scorer 
Eric Lindros suffered a season-ending collapsed lung. 
</P>
<P>
	Recchi, who complained of nausea and dizziness, was hospitalized  
for one night in Nashville. He was sidelined for two more games 
before returning to the lineup April 8 against Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The following week, Recchi complained of headaches and neck  
soreness after he was checked into the glass April 13 against 
Buffalo, prompting the neurological tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Recchi, cleared to practice Tuesday, said he has no worries  
about being in shape for the start of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``My conditioning is fine. I've been skating for three days  
now,'' he said ``I've been working out off the ice as well. I've 
been doing everything to keep myself sharp.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Energy Dept. Ignored Risks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department and its contractors  
showed ``a lack of attention'' to grave security risks at nuclear 
weapons labs despite nearly two decades of warnings, congressional 
investigators report. 
</P>
<P>
	``Efforts to address security problems have languished for years  
without resolution or repercussions to those organizations 
responsible,'' the General Accounting Office concluded in testimony 
prepared for a House Commerce subcommittee hearing today and 
obtained Monday by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress' investigative agency said it has issued 32 reports  
since 1980 warning of lax security at the labs, and made nearly 50 
recommendations that the GAO said were mostly neglected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Managers and contractors have shown a lack of attention and/or  
priority to security matters,'' according to Victor S. Rezendes, 
director of the GAO division that studies energy and scientific 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems at the labs became a major issue earlier this year,  
when the Energy Department disclosed that it had evidence 
indicating China obtained information about the most advanced 
nuclear warhead in the U.S. arsenal -- and had used that information 
to develop its own smaller, more deliverable nuclear weapons. An 
employee of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico was 
fired, but no charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
	In just one example of how the same security problems persisted  
over two decades, and came full circle, Rezendes said FBI agents 
had been used in the early 1990s to conduct counterintelligence. 
The bureau ended the effort ``because of resistance within DOE to 
implementing the measures the FBI staff believed necessary to 
improve security,'' the GAO found. 
</P>
<P>
	``We note with interest that in response to the current concerns  
with foreign visitors and other espionage threats against DOE 
facilities, the FBI is again being brought in to direct DOE's 
counterintelligence program,'' the investigators reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Monday the department was  
taking ``very aggressive steps'' to fix the problems cited by the 
GAO, including: 
</P>
<P>
	--Increasing the counterintelligence budget from $2.6 million to  
$39.2 million since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	--Appointing a CIA and FBI veteran, Ed Curran, as director of  
counterintelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	--Placing seasoned counterintelligence professionals at nuclear  
weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Instituting a new lie detector program.  
</P>
<P>
	--Revamping the foreign visitors' program, including background  
checks for all visitors from countries considered ``sensitive.''. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since taking over as secretary of energy (in August 1998),  
nothing has been more important to me than ensuring that the 
security and counterintelligence capabilities of the department are 
topnotch,'' Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House Commerce  
Committee reviewing the labs practices, said he wanted to see 
``whether the administration's announced reforms will truly do the 
job, but if history is any guide, I have my doubts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rezendes said the most serious problems that were not addressed  
by the department over the past two decades were: 
</P>
<P>
	--Ineffective controls over foreign visitors to the most  
sensitive Energy Department facilities. In 1988 and again in 1997, 
the GAO found ``that foreign visitors are allowed into ... nuclear 
weapons design laboratories with few background checks'' and that 
counterintelligence programs ``received little priority and 
attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Weaknesses in efforts to control and protect classified and  
sensitive information. In one instance, a facility could not 
account for 10,000 classified documents. 
</P>
<P>
	--Lack of physical security such as fences, and security  
personnel who, through the years, have proved unable to demonstrate 
basic skills such as arresting intruders, shooting accurately or 
using handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Backlogs in security clearances. And at times when backlogs  
were reduced, contractors were failing to verify background 
information on prospective employees. 
</P>
<P>
	--A failure to track and control nuclear materials, including  
material sent overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	As an example of the past problems, the GAO report cited  
findings -- originally in 1988 -- that the required background checks 
were performed for fewer than 10 percent of the visitors from 
``sensitive'' countries. 
</P>
<P>
	When the agency reviewed the same problem in 1997, ``procedures  
for obtaining background checks had not been effectively 
implemented and at two facilities, background checks were being 
conducted on only 5 percent of visitors from all sensitive 
countries and on less than 2 percent of the visitors from China.''

<HEADLINE> How FCC Handles Radio Pirates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	How the Federal Communications Commission tracks down radio  
pirates: 
</P>
<P>
	It receives complaints from the public, licensed broadcasters or  
other pirates. Or FCC engineers and other experts may find a pirate 
by just listening to the radio. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's airwaves police, in offices across the country, can  
simply tune to the frequency to verify that a signal is there, then 
check the FCC's database to make sure no licensed station is 
permitted to operate on that frequency. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC also can use mobile, direction-finding vehicles to  
pinpoint the location, a process that can take 15 minutes to an 
hour depending on traffic. All 25 of the FCC's nationwide offices 
have such vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the easiest things to do,'' said the FCC's point  
man on the matter, Richard Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	How the FCC notifies the pirate:  
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's airwaves police go to the station and ask to do an  
inspection. In many instances, inspections are allowed. Then 
officials explain that the station is in violation of FCC rules 
because it lacks the required license. The agency also will send a 
written notice requesting that the station voluntarily shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	If the station refuses to close, the FCC can go to court to  
obtain an injunction to make the station stop broadcasting or to 
obtain a warrant to seize equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also can seek to impose penalties for operating  
unlicensed radio stations, including fines and prison terms of up 
to one year.

<HEADLINE> TV Networks Work On Satellite Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Customers who use big ``backyard'' satellite  
dishes and aren't entitled to receive CBS, NBC, ABC and Fox 
programs by satellite will keep getting them that way for a while, 
a top broadcast industry executive said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 1.3 million customers were supposed to be cut off  
from those network signals on April 30, but they now will be able 
to continue receiving them, National Association of Broadcasters 
lobbyist Jim May said at the organization's annual convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, some viewers -- those living closest to their local TV  
stations as determined by a technical test involving the stations' 
coverage areas -- will lose their current satellite signals for CBS, 
Fox, ABC and NBC programs on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers living on the edges of the stations' coverage areas  
will lose that network programming on Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law lets satellite companies provide customers with  
``distant'' network signals -- which come from other broadcast areas 
-- only if those customers cannot receive their local stations using 
rooftop antennas. 
</P>
<P>
	May said the four major networks worked out the agreement, which  
is subject to approval by a federal court in Miami, with several 
companies that provide network programming to satellite TV 
customers with big backyard dishes. He didn't have a list of the 
companies involved, but said the agreement covers all big dish 
customers who faced being cutoff from network signals on April 30.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo's Stock Index Falls / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's main stock index fell Monday as concerns  
about the earnings of high-technology companies weighed down the 
market. The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 177.37 points,  
or 1.05 percent, to close the day at 16,674.21. On Friday, the 
index gained 124.50 points, or 0.74 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.18 yen, down 0.04 yen from late Friday in  
Tokyo but above its late New York level of 118.02 yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the poor performance Friday in America's  
Nasdaq index, which includes many high-technology shares, triggered 
selling of Japanese hi-tech issues on Monday. The Nasdaq closed 
down 4.20 percent on the week Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese precision machinery and electronic share prices have  
languished since U.S.-based companies Compaq and Intel warned last 
week that their earnings may not be as strong as expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's dip from its levels late last week has exacerbated  
those worries, as a weak U.S. currency makes Japanese exporters' 
products more expensive overseas and reduces the value of 
repatriated earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sentiment is good, but the market can't advance as a whole  
because technology stocks figure prominently in the Nikkei 
average,'' said Masatoshi Sato, manager of the investment 
information department at Kankaku Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was down 10.34 points, or 0.77 percent, to 
1,332.69. The TOPIX rose 5.10 points, or 0.38 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average gained  
another 31.17 points to finish at 10,493.89, setting its fifth 
consecutive record close. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, dollar-supportive comments by Japanese  
monetary authorities pushed the dollar higher than its levels in 
New York on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's influential Vice Finance Minister for International  
Affairs Eisuke Sakakibara warned against excessive yen 
strengthening and said that Japanese monetary authorities would 
take action in such an event. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was sold against the yen mainly  
due to the Kosovo conflict, which shows no signs of ending, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was traded at 126.44 yen, up from 126.20 yen late  
Friday in Tokyo. Against the dollar, the euro rose to 1.0690 from 
an all-time low of dlrs 1.0627 late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond dropped to 1.585 percent from Friday's close of 1.605 percent, 
driving its price up to 101.88 yen from 101.70 yen.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal tests released today indicate  
Mercedes-Benz side air bags could seriously injure a young child 
leaning against a door pressing his face against the window or 
leaning out the window. 
</P>
<P>
	A safety engineer for DaimlerChrysler AG, Mercedes' parent  
company, said its testing showed the side air bags were safe, even 
for children found in such awkward positions. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and its  
Canadian counterpart, Transport Canada, recently conducted more 
than 40 tests on side air bags installed by eight automakers. In 
the tests, dummies representing young children were leaning against 
doors, leaning out car windows or kneeling backward in the seat. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the dummies were properly seated and restrained in child  
seats or booster seats, which automakers said would eliminate the 
problem of any serious side air bag injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	In one NHTSA test on a Mercedes E-class car, the force on the  
child's neck from the deploying side air bag was about four times 
the acceptable injury level recognized by government safety 
experts, indicating the potential for serious injury, government 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several test measurements indicated chest injuries ``up to six  
times (the recommended) injury levels,'' NHTSA's Randa Radwan 
Samaha said. 
</P>
<P>
	In that test, a dummy representing a 3-year-old was kneeling on  
the passenger seat and the child's head was leaning out the window. 
With the child's face against the window, the force on the child's 
neck was about two times the acceptable injury level, government 
tests show. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Susan Cischke, a top safety engineer for  
DaimlerChrysler, said the Mercedes' air bag systems ``are very safe 
and effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of nine vehicle models tested by Transport Canada had air  
bags that potentially could cause injury to children leaning or 
kneeling against a window or turned around backward on a seat, 
government officials said. It was unclear whether the tests showed 
those injuries could be serious, as indicated in some of the 
Mercedes tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight models were BMW 323i, Ford Explorer, Saab 9-3,  
Volkswagen Beetle, Audi A6 and A4, Volvo S80, all from 1999; and 
the 1998 model General Motors Pontiac Transport. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no reports of serious injuries or deaths from  
side air bags in crashes, and federal regulators believe the safety 
devices can offer substantial protection in side-impact crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	However, NHTSA officials have been acting to prevent problems  
with side air bags in light of the public outcry over deaths from 
air bags deploying from the front of autos. Those airbags have been 
blamed for killing 131 people, including 73 children, government 
statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
	NHTSA convened a public meeting Monday to encourage automakers  
voluntarily to develop common testing procedures for side air bags 
and share testing data to reduce injuries to children. Automakers 
said they support the concept. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ricardo Martinez, NHTSA's chief, said nine automakers have  
shared extensive side air bag testing data with the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``After reviewing the test data, we had some concern as to  
whether unintended side effects had been adequately addressed by 
all the manufacturers,'' Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we see safety risks materializing, especially to children,  
we will be quick to intervene,'' he said. ``On the other hand, we 
do not want to overreact and have a chilling effect on a technology 
that obviously has great lifesaving potential.''

<HEADLINE>  Bengals Release QB Neil O'Donnell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Cincinnati Bengals released quarterback  
Neil O'Donnell on Monday, two days after they decided to go in 
another direction by drafting Akili Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell, 32, was released nine months after the Bengals signed  
him to a four-year, $17 million deal hoping he would end their 
decade-long search for a dependable passer. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell led the Bengals to two of their three victories last  
season, but struggled to produce points and move the offense 
consistently. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the Bengals committed themselves to Smith, general manager  
Mike Brown granted O'Donnell's request to release him so he would 
have time to hook up with another team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what he wants,'' Brown said. ``He wants to be freed to  
sign elsewhere as soon as possible. Last year when he came here, he 
came so late that it was hard for him to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time, he'll get a quicker start with a new team. That  
should be to his advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown had promised O'Donnell before the draft that if the  
Bengals chose a quarterback, he'd be released. Cincinnati took 
Smith in the first round and Scott Covington -- a candidate for 
their developmental squad -- in the seventh round. 
</P>
<P>
	The two draft picks gave Cincinnati six quarterbacks for one  
day. They still have five: Smith, Covington, Jeff Blake, Eric 
Kresser and Paul Justin. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell led Pittsburgh to the Super Bowl in 1996 and played  
for the New York Jets. He signed with the Bengals as a free agent 
last July shortly before training camp began, and won the starting 
job from Blake during preseason even though he was still learning 
the play book. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell started the first 11 games but was benched because his  
high completion rate wasn't translating into enough points or wins. 
When the backups also failed, O'Donnell regained the starting job 
for one game before breaking his passing hand. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished with a passer rating of 90.2, the highest of his  
career. He completed a career-best 61.8 percent of his passes and 
had the best touchdown-to-interception ratio of his career -- 15 to 
4. 
</P>
<P>
	He produced two of the Bengals' three wins, throwing for 303  
yards against Detroit and 298 yards against the Steelers. More 
often, he chose short, safe throws that failed to sustain drives. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, he completed 212 of 343 for 2,216 yards, averaging 6.5  
yards per attempt. He was sacked 30 times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals currently plan to start Blake next season -- the last  
under his current contract -- while Smith develops. That means that 
either Justin or Kresser will be released as well.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Anti-Smut E-Mail Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal law aimed at limiting e-mail smut  
does not violate free-speech rights, the Supreme Court ruled today. 
That could be bad news for people who like to write dirty online 
and for the proprietors of ``annoy.com.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court's unanimous decision, issued without an opinion,  
rejected a computer technology company's argument that one part of 
the Communications Decency Act of 1996 threatens free-speech 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The law had been attacked by ApolloMedia Corp., a San  
Francisco-based firm that developed the ``annoy.com'' World Wide 
Web site to let people anonymously communicate their opinions to 
public officials by using language some might consider indecent. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenged provision of the law makes it a crime to transmit  
a ``communication which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy or 
indecent with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass another 
person.'' The provision applies to all e-mail, even messages sent 
from one friend or acquaintance to another. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge federal court upheld the law after interpreting it  
to ban only obscene material that gets no constitutional 
protection. The Supreme Court affirmed that ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all sexually explicit language and pictures are obscene.  
Free-speech protections are lost only if the material appeals to 
prurient interests and depicts sexual conduct in a patently 
offensive way, and that determination is left to a jury applying 
contemporary community standards. 
</P>
<P>
	William Bennett Turner, ApolloMedia's lawyer, said Monday's  
decision ``makes you nervous ... to be liable'' for some future 
e-mail content found by some other court elsewhere in the nation to 
have crossed the line between indecent and obscene. 
</P>
<P>
	But Turner said ``annoy.com'' will continue to do business, and  
described it as ``flourishing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While ApolloMedia's 1997 lawsuit was pending, the Supreme Court  
invalidated another provision of the Communications Decency Act. 
The justices in 1997 struck down Congress' effort to protect 
children from sexually explicit -- but not legally obscene -- 
material. 
</P>
<P>
	The invalidated provision had made it a crime to send any  
``obscene or indecent'' material on the Internet knowing that it 
could be seen by someone under 18. 
</P>
<P>
	In ApolloMedia's case, the three-judge court in California  
upheld the challenged provision by interpreting it to apply only to 
obscene material. When that court announced its decision last 
September, ApolloMedia President Clinton Fein told The Associated 
Press he was pleased that ``it is constitutionally protected to 
send indecent communications with an intent to annoy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Turner worried aloud at that time that the judges failed to  
make clear ``you can't outlaw indecent speech online'' and acted on 
that concern by appealing to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law requires that challenges to any of its provisions  
be heard by three-judge trial courts and that appeals be taken 
directly to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``At stake ... is the right of ... all Internet users not to  
have to live under the uncertain cloud of a statute that on its 
face makes an indecent communication a felony,'' the appeal argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration lawyers had urged the justices to reject  
the appeal. ``Whatever fear of prosecution (ApolloMedia) might have 
had at the outset of the case became entirely remote, speculative 
and conjectural after the district court's ruling,'' they said.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Off 138.43; Dow Off 53.36 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors dumped technology shares Monday,  
pummeling the Nasdaq Stock Market with its second-biggest point 
drop ever. The wave of selling on record volume more than wiped out 
a 270-point gain in the Dow industrials, snapping a five-day string 
of record highs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was the decimation of everything tech, everything  
Internet, everything healthcare,'' said Larry Wachtel, a market 
analyst at Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index plunged 138.43, or  
by 5.6 percent, to 2,345.61. The only time the index had a bigger 
one-day point drop was on Aug. 31, 1998, when it slid 140.43 
points, or 8.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average, at one point in the afternoon  
up 271.85 points, squandered those gains and closed down 53.36 at 
10,440.53. 
</P>
<P>
	For investors, it was a $292 billion hit to their portfolios.  
That was the drop Monday in Wilshire Associates Equity Index, which 
measures the market value of all the stocks on the New York Stock 
Exchange, American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow had easily cruised through the 10,500, 10,600 and 10,700  
levels by early afternoon Monday. But as investors saw the Nasdaq 
crumble under the weight of huge losses in technology shares, they 
began to sell blue chips as well, cashing in on a week of gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Nasdaq undermined everything else,'' said Wachtel.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you owned a big winner this year, you got whacked today,''  
Wachtel said. ``They just got around to (selling) the extraordinary 
winners of 1999. It had the ring of inevitability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite fell 29.52 to 1,289.48.  
</P>
<P>
	Consolidated volume of NYSE-listed stocks, which includes  
trading on regional exchanges, was a record 1.47 billion shares. 
The previous high of 1.42 billion was set Sept. 1, 1998. Volume on 
the Nasdaq Stock Market was 1.20 billion shares, ranking tenth. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the rout in blue-chips, advancing issues had a strong  
2-to-1 lead on decliners on the NYSE, helped by some strong 
earnings reports and merger news. 
</P>
<P>
	That was an encouraging sign to A.C. Moore, chief investment  
strategist for Dunvegan Associates in Santa Barbara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're probably not on an edge of a precipice just at this  
point,'' Moore said. ``Until overall breadth starts to turn down, I 
think the market probably will continue to flex around in here at 
these levels.'' He said that most such declines, especially when 
advances lead declines, are followed by a market rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	The selling Monday accelerated a trend from last week, when  
investors dropped more glamorous Internet and technology shares in 
favor of industrial issues that had been lagging. Dow member IBM 
fell 3 5/8 to 166 3/4 Monday, and AOL had plunged 23 7/8 to 115 7/8 in leading 
volume on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
	The industrial stocks that did so well last week can't play the  
role of long-term leaders because they represent a much smaller 
portion of the market than technology shares, said Barry Hyman, 
senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point in time, the tech stocks have to participate  
again if we're going to get a major rally here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq ended 7/8 lower at 22 3/4, after giving up early gains. The  
computer maker, which stunned Wall Street with dismal earnings 
projections earlier this month, disclosed on Sunday that chief 
executive Eckhard Pfeiffer had been ousted and its chief financial 
officer was leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	Some industrial shares held on. Dow components International  
Paper rose 3/4 to 55 3/4. Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing advanced 4 
5/16 to 84 1/4. United Technologies climbed 3 to 145. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 9.02 to 615.88, and the Amex  
composite index declined 10.30 to 735.11. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 9.14 to 412.44.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's main stock index fell 1.05 percent. In Europe,  
the leading market indexes dropped 0.71 percent in Britain but rose 
1.26 percent in Germany and 1.82 percent in France.

<HEADLINE> Import-Users Want off 'Hit List' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The owner of a trendy French bistro and the  
operator of a German delicatessen were upset. Ditto for the Swedish 
farmer, the owner of an Irish food delicacies mail-order firm and 
representatives for thousands of U.S. motorcycle enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
	All trouped to a government hearing room today to plead for  
removal from a $900 million ``hit list'' of products facing 
punitive tariffs threatened by the Clinton administration in a 
decade-long fight over Europe's ban on American beef containing 
growth hormones. 
</P>
<P>
	Importers of foie gras, truffles, Belgian chocolates, Perrier  
and other European mineral waters and a host of other European 
delicacies appeared to make the case that their products should not 
be on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Buben showed up in his chef's uniform to say he was  
worried that business at Bistro Bis, his new French restaurant in 
Washington, would be hurt if he could no longer get the Dijon 
mustard he uses in many of his dishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dijon mustard is a unique product, and nothing else in the  
United States comes close,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The punitive tariffs are designed to knock European products out  
of the U.S. market in retaliation for Europe's ban on American beef 
from cattle treated with growth hormones. The World Trade 
Organization has ruled in favor of the U.S. industry's arguments 
that the ban was not justified on scientific grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The beef fight is one of two trade wars the United States is  
currently engaged in with the European Union. The administration 
has imposed punitive 100 percent tariffs on $191.4 million of 
European products including high-fashion hand bags and bed linens 
in retaliation for the EU's refusal to abide by another WTO ruling 
that it drop import barriers on bananas grown by American 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The $900 million targeted in the beef battle primarily cover  
food products, although the preliminary sanction list also includes 
European motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
	Importers of these small-engine motorcycles made in Italy,  
Spain, France and Austria said thousands of mom-and-pop motorcycle 
shops in the United States could be forced to lay off workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where is the beef in motorcycles?'' Edward W. Moreland,  
Washington representative of the 234,000-member American Motorcyle 
Association, asked the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Some motorcyle officials warned that the government was putting  
at risk the safety of thousands of owners of European motorcyles 
who won't be able to get replacement parts for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hildi Fehr, owner of a German delicatessen and restaurant just a  
few blocks from the White House, said her business will suffer 
unless the government takes a number of items off the target list 
from Rittersport chocolate to Zweiback toast. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Schwartau raspberry jam is very important to me,'' she  
told the hearing panel, calling it a key ingredient in her 
Linzertortes. ``I have tried to use American substitutes ..., but 
the small jars don't have the same intense flavor or consistency as 
the German rasberry jam,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of American breakfast cereals could go up if the  
government keeps oats on the list, because the United States 
imports one-third of the oats it uses, mainly from Canada, Sweden 
and Finland, officials representing American cereal makers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Claes Nilsson, a farmer in Sweden who appeared on behalf of an  
association of Swedish grain farmers, said he is reducing his oat 
acreage by 50 percent because of the threat of U.S. sanctions. He 
predicted other farmers will do the same, which will drive up oat 
prices and lower prices of substitute crops such as barley. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Capalbo, owner of Capalbo Gift Baskets Inc. of Nutley,  
N.J., said his life has been a nightmare the past few months 
because of constantly changing government threats. He said he was 
relieved that at the last minute the government decided to remove 
sweet biscuits from the banana hit list only to find out that a 
number of other food items in his catalogue of Irish products were 
being targeted in the beef fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The continuing threat is terrible for our business,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But representatives of the U.S. beef industry also appeared at  
the hearing, arguing that the sanctions were the only thing left to 
try to force the EU to drop its ban on U.S. beef. They urged the 
panel to consider a rotating list of products that would change 
every six months in order to bring maximum pressure on EU countries 
to come into compliance with the WTO ruling.

<HEADLINE> Sauvage Wins Wheelchair Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- While Louise Sauvage barely won her third straight  
Boston Marathon wheelchair title, Franz Nietlispach took his third 
in a row with no other competitor in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	Sauvage held off rival Jean Driscoll in the final seconds to  
capture the women's crown on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sauvage, of Australia, and Driscoll, of Champaign, Ill., dueled  
to the finish line for the second straight year. Both finished with 
a time of 1 hour, 42 minutes, 23 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	In last year's race, Driscoll was beginning to raise her hands  
in victory when Sauvage sprinted past her in the final inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Driscoll had won seven straight Boston Marathons when her  
wheelchair overturned on trolley tracks in 1997 about three miles 
from the finish and Sauvage passed her. Driscoll recovered and 
rolled to second place on a flat tire. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, it has been all Sauvage.  
</P>
<P>
	In the 103rd Boston Marathon, the 25th year for wheelchair  
competitors, the two swapped the lead several times, but Sauvage 
held the advantage coming into the end of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was quite happy to be there,'' Sauvage said. ``If I'm in  
front, I'm in control and I like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Driscoll was drafting on her wheels and was waiting to make  
a jump and sprint to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping to do to her what she did to me last year,''  
Driscoll said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sauvage knew what was coming and began her own sprint before  
Driscoll made her move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kicked and I figured I had some more if she tried it,''  
Sauvage said. ``I was looking for her front wheel and I never saw 
it. So I kept pushing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crouched over and pumping in unison, one behind the other, the  
duo rolled toward the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is, obviously, frustrating,'' said Driscoll, who said  
she's not sure if she will return next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Edith Hunkeler of Switzerland, who stayed with Driscoll and  
Sauvage until the 17th mile, finished third in a time of 1:43:48. 
</P>
<P>
	In sharp contrast to the tight women's competition, the lead in  
the men's race never changed after the second mile. 
</P>
<P>
	As he's done for the past two years, Nietlispach used his weight  
-- 187 pounds -- on the downhill stretch to gain a substantial lead 
heading into Heartbreak Hill, a rolling climb between miles 16 and 
21. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy helped put 3 minutes, 42 seconds between him and  
second-place finisher Saul Mendoza, of Mexico, who led for the 
first two miles. Mendoza, who weighs 125 pounds, had a climbing 
advantage because he didn't have to haul as much weight up the long 
hill. 
</P>
<P>
	But he still couldn't make up the gap between Nietlispach.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was pushing very strong,'' Mendoza said. ``I was hoping I  
could catch him. I was trying to come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mendoza finished in 1:25:18. He was followed by Scot Hollonbeck,  
of Atlanta, who finished in 1:27:58 after recovering from a crash 
early in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Nietlispach's time of 1:21:36 was 13 seconds off the record set  
in 1994 by Heinz Frei, also of Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton To Visit Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, in New York  
for a trip largely designed to explore a potential Senate race, 
said today she plans to go to Albania and Macedonia to meet with 
refugees ``as soon as I'm given the green light to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is very important for me to go to Kosovo  
eventually, but I want to go when my going does not interfere with 
the work and in any way displace resources'' of the international 
community trying to help thousands of refugees fleeing from the 
fighting in Kosovo, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been asked to go. I've expressed my very strong interest  
in going and as soon as I'm given the green light to go, I intend 
to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She made the remarks after meeting with the heads of several  
private foundations raising money to help the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's meeting with the foundations was the first event  
in a crowded schedule that seems designed to stoke interest in a 
potential Senate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady is expected to decide in June or July whether to  
seek the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said she is seriously considering whether to run  
but insisted her schedule on this trip was a typical one for a 
first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm obviously still considering and exploring (the Senate  
race) and interested in doing so but right now I'm very focused on 
the situation in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a new poll, from Marist College's Institute for Public  
Opinion, 52 percent of New Yorkers polled said Mrs. Clinton should 
not run, up from 37 percent in a February survey. Forty-two percent 
of voters in the latest poll said she should run, down from 56 
percent in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 512 registered voters was conducted  
Tuesday and Wednesday and has a margin of error of plus or minus 
4.5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Because this was billed as an official White House trip, the  
taxpayers are paying for the first lady's travel. Her most recent 
foreign trip, a journey to North Africa that ended earlier this 
month, was also considered official business and paid with public 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said she might consider establishing an exploratory  
committee to defray the costs of her travel ``if it becomes 
appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also will be in New York Tuesday and Thursday, mostly for  
events unrelated, such as an education speech this afternoon at 
Columbia Teachers College.

<HEADLINE>  Spacecraft's Main Antenna Stuck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The main communications antenna on  
NASA's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft has become stuck and unable 
to automatically point toward Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	A hinge on the antenna stopped moving late last week and flight  
controllers were unable to solve the problem during the weekend, 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory spokeswoman Mary Hardin said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The antenna can still be used even if the hinge doesn't work.  
But that requires periodically halting the collection of science 
data and turning the entire spacecraft to point the antenna at 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft put itself into a so-called contingency mode when  
the problem occurred, shutting down all science instruments and 
shifting communication with flight controllers to its smaller 
antenna. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometime Monday engineers planned to command Mars Global  
Surveyor to transmit recorded data they hope would reveal what was 
happening on the spacecraft when the hinge stopped moving. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft was launched in November 1996 and has been  
orbiting Mars since September 1997 as part of a mapping mission of 
Earth's neighboring planet. 
</P>
<P>
	The hinge is one of two at the end of a boom on which the main  
antenna is mounted. One allows the antenna to move from side to 
side. The other one, which moves the antenna up and down, is the 
one that became stuck. 
</P>
<P>
	The hinges were designed to allow the antenna to keep pointing  
at Earth during communications sessions while the orbiting 
spacecraft keeps its instruments pointed at Mars to collect a 
continuous stream of images and data for mapping. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers do not believe the problem is related to the March 28  
deployment of the boom because the hinge had functioned properly 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Deployment of the boom from the folded position it had been in  
since the launch was a concern because of worries that a device to 
cushion the force would not work properly.

<HEADLINE> 'Finnish Flash' Is Big NHL Scorer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The ``Finnish Flash'' is the perfect  
nickname for Teemu Selanne, a blur on and off the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Selanne's life adventures include teaching kindergarten,  
serving as a patrol point man with Finland's army, collecting 
antique cars, driving race cars, being a devoted family man, and 
performing countless hours of charity work. 
</P>
<P>
	The right wing for the playoff-bound Anaheim Mighty Ducks also  
has been able squeeze in enough time to score more goals than any 
other player in the NHL over the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a guy who loves life and loves the game,'' Anaheim coach  
Craig Hartsburg said as the Ducks prepared for their first-round 
playoff series against Detroit Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
	Selanne's zest is obvious in his pleasant demeanor and seemingly  
ever-present smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teemu gets as mad as anyone else when we lose, but I think he  
forgets it quickly,'' said linemate Paul Kariya, who along with 
Selanne gives the Mighty Ducks one of the NHL's highest-scoring 
duos. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teemu keeps everybody on an even keel. When things are going  
poorly, he's upbeat and he keeps everybody loose. When things are 
going well, he's the same, so we always know what to expect from 
him. Guys get down, but he's there picking us up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Always a target for defenders, Selanne has some experience with  
facing challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finding a way to handle 20 kids was a challenge,'' he said,  
recalling his three years of teaching kindergarten in his homeland. 
``I just made sure everybody was happy and playing games. I had 
fun. It was only for four hours a day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selanne grinned and added, ``Eight would have been too much.''  
</P>
<P>
	He played hockey in the evenings while he was teaching, and also  
managed to play during his rigorous, 11-month tour of army duty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really stayed in good shape,'' he said. ``I woke up at 6,  
was with the army until 3, then played hockey at night. It was a 
long day, but I was OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selanne has 313 career goals, most in the league over the past  
seven years. He had his string of 50-goal seasons end at three this 
year, but his 47 goals still led the league. His 107 points also 
ranked him No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's probably the best pure goal scorer in the league,''  
Kariya said. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Hartsburg: ``Teemu's such a gifted player, has great speed,  
great hands, and a great demeanor. He also has great hockey sense, 
which is something you can't teach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis goaltender Grant Fuhr agreed Selanne is a threat at  
all times. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to respect where he is on the ice because he skates  
better than most people,'' Fuhr said. ``He gets loose, and once he 
gets loose, he can shoot the puck pretty well. He seems to create 
chances and as long as he's creating chances, they're going to get 
a lot of goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selanne said, ``I think I like to take advantage of the speed,  
and try to be in the right place at the right time. It's really a 
pleasure to play with Paul; he makes me much more effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although easygoing, Selanne can be tough on himself at times.  
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing it that I really want to play well all the  
time and sometimes that doesn't happen,'' he said. ``I respect the 
guys who play for a long time and stay just as hungry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selanne feels his life off-the-ice, including spending as much  
time as possible with his wife, Sirpa, and their two young sons, 
keeps him fresh for his sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never have been a guy who thinks about hockey all the time.  
I get my mind out of hockey, don't take my work home with me,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	His extremely active life provides him with many rewards, he  
said, including the summers when he's back home in Finland and sees 
the children he used to teach. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I go back, parents come up to me and tell me that I  
started their children liking sports, even the girls, too,'' he 
said. ``I like that.''

<HEADLINE> SLOC Deals With J&AMP;J Pullout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- No new sponsors have signed on with the  
Salt Lake Organizing Committee since the IOC bribery scandal broke. 
</P>
<P>
	And now that Johnson &AMP; Johnson has backed out of an estimated  
$30 million sponsorship deal, Olympics officials say they realize 
the gravity of their financial situation as they prepare to play 
host to the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsors that we talk to are assessing the environment in  
which we find ourselves every single day,'' said John Krimsky, U.S. 
Olympic Committee Deputy Secretary General and the games' chief 
fund-raising officer. ``And when they have to invest millions of 
dollars and the reputation of their products and services, they 
have to be very, very careful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky said Johnson &AMP; Johnson pulled out in January or  
February, before Olympic organizations finished their investigation 
and implementing reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the door is still open because company officials  
have since met with Salt Lake Organizing Committee head Mitt 
Romney, but company spokesman John McKeegan said the company will 
not be a sponsor for 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeegan blamed the decision on internal disagreements about how  
to link the company's many brands under a sponsorship umbrella in 
time for the Salt Lake games. 
</P>
<P>
	But Olympic corruption also played a role, he acknowledged.  
</P>
<P>
	``We can't say that it didn't have anything to do with it,''  
McKeegan said. ``It was certainly in the background.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Johnson &AMP; Johnson has never been a full sponsor for the  
games, it has provided its products to athletes through the U.S. 
Olympic Committee for about 20 years. McKeegan said that 
relationship would continue. 
</P>
<P>
	While he insisted the glitch is a normal part of the marketing  
process, Krimsky admitted other potential sponsors have asked him 
why Johnson &AMP; Johnson hesitated. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympics supporters are quick to point to the solid groundwork  
laid by officials before the scandal broke. Salt Lake already has 
commitments for more support than Atlanta had by the time it staged 
its more expensive 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky's marketing project, Olympic Properties of the United  
States, still needs to raise about $300 million in cash, goods and 
services to meet SLOC's $1.45 billion budget. Krimsky has said he 
has pitched $200 million in sponsorships to corporations waiting 
for the controversy to subside, and that at least one -- the 
carmaker BMW -- may be ready to sign on. 
</P>
<P>
	But most targets have remained elusive.  
</P>
<P>
	A SLOC memo dated Dec. 29, 1997, and reported by The Salt Lake  
Tribune reveals that OPUS tried to elicit some $198 million from 
six major U.S. firms: Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Delta Air Lines, CNA 
Insurance, General Mills, Unilever and Marriott Hotels. 
</P>
<P>
	But only Delta, which has an operations hub in Salt Lake City,  
has signed a contract, estimated at $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	CNA officials say they are not involved in negotiating for games  
sponsorship, and Krimsky said USOP decided to pursue a more 
diversified insurance company, but would not specify which firm. 
</P>
<P>
	General Mills' and Unilever's interest has not waned in the wake  
of the scandal, Krimsky said, but neither company would confirm it 
was talking with OPUS. 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky has complained that Salt Lake organizers have not nailed  
down any in-state sponsors since OPUS was formed. Though local 
sponsors often come in with pledges later than national companies, 
he said, now is the time to get them signed up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot expect the rest of the country to fund these Games  
unless we can get state companies on the scoreboard,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> `Freddi Fish 4' Praised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Movies gave birth to a new art form in animation. And multimedia  
computers have taken it further, creating characters that live 
beyond the current software and move on to an eagerly anticipated 
next ``episode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A good example is Humongous Entertainment, whose Putt Putt,  
Pajama Sam and other characters have entered childhood lore 
alongside Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Humongous' most popular characters, Freddi Fish, has a  
new adventure in ``Freddi Fish 4: The Case of the Hogfish Rustlers 
of Briny Gulch.'' This Western-themed action-learning game is aimed 
at 3- to 8-year-olds and is available for both Macintosh and 
Windows platforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Freddi looks like a goldfish and is twice the size of Luther,  
her sidekick. That's right, Freddi is a female fish, although she 
doesn't emphasize her gender. 
</P>
<P>
	In the story, Freddi and Luther go to Briny Gulch to visit the  
hogfish ranch of Freddi's cousin Calico. There, they discover that 
the hogfish have been rustled. It's up to Freddi and Luther to find 
the hogfish and bring them back. 
</P>
<P>
	They do so by interacting with 17 colorful and chatty  
characters, collecting clues and devising strategies to solve the 
puzzle. If you need educational justification for all this, 
Humongous says that kids will be ``learning strategic thinking 
skills, logical thinking and problem-solving skills, deductive and 
inductive reasoning, sequencing. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	A kid would probably just tell you that it's fun. Among the  
qualities that make it a standout: 
</P>
<P>
	--Movie-quality art and animation, with smooth movement and  
attention to artistic detail. 
</P>
<P>
	--A wacky, kid-level sense of humor, including a family of squid  
named Orchid, Apricot and Periwinkle who spit appropriately colored 
ink into a spittoon. 
</P>
<P>
	--Entertaining and suitable music in the background and  
occasionally as main music. You have to hear the Honly-Tonk 
TubeWorms singing ``Hop Along Little Cephalopod.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Funny click-on objects and three minigames.  
</P>
<P>
	--A simple point-and-click user interface.  
</P>
<P>
	Another nice touch in these days of crammed gigabyte hard drives  
is that ``Freddi Fish 4'' plays directly from the CD-ROM, so no 
disk-cluttering installation is required. This makes it easier for 
younger kids to start it up themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	A suggested retail price of $29.95 doesn't hurt, either.  
</P>
<P>
	System requirements:  
</P>
<P>
	--PC: At least a Pentium 90, Windows 98/95 and 16 megabytes of  
RAM. 
</P>
<P>
	--Mac: 80 megahertz Power PC, System 7.5.3 or later, 16 megabytes  
of RAM. 
</P>
<P>
	Humongous products are widely available at retail.

<HEADLINE> Starter Files for Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Sports clothing manufacturer Starter  
Corp., which made a splash in the 1980s and early 1990s with lines 
of team logo jackets, jerseys and other sportswear, sought 
bankruptcy court protection from its creditors on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Starter, which also makes uniforms for some major league teams,  
had struggled in recent years as competitors entered the market and 
demand for their product slipped. 
</P>
<P>
	The company listed assets of $118.1 million and liabilities of  
$120.5 million. Employees at the New Haven headquarters and at a 
manufacturing plant in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, were told to go home 
Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also has a distribution center in Memphis, Tenn.,  
and 19 outlet stores located in 10 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Starter has yet to file its 1998 10-K annual report with the  
Securities and Exchange Commission. In a statement Monday, Starter 
said the delay was due to ongoing negotiations with its investors 
and creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials in New Haven did not return repeated telephone  
calls seeking further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was founded in 1971 and became one of the largest  
manufacturers of team-licensed sportswear, with contracts to pro 
basketball, baseball, football and hickey and more than 100 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
	Its jackets and caps became essential elements of fashion for  
the young, especially among urban teens, who sometimes resorted to 
violence to obtain the popular items. 
</P>
<P>
	Starter was the first company to begin manufacturing satin team  
jackets. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the unsecured creditors listed in Monday's filing in U.S.  
Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., were NBA Properties, $15.6 
million; Major League Baseball Properties, $1.6 million; NFL 
Properties, $1.2 million; and NHL Enterprises, $903,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Starter has always been a very strong partner and supporter of  
Major League Baseball, and it's very unfortunate that we may not be 
able to continue this partnership,'' said Derrick Johnson, a 
spokesman for Major League Baseball Properties. 
</P>
<P>
	Also filing for Chapter 11 protection from creditors were the  
company's affiliates, Starter Outlet Stores Inc., Starter Galt 
Inc., and Starter Delaware Inc.

<HEADLINE> BellSouth To Invest $3.5B in Qwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- BellSouth, long-silent in the scramble of mergers  
and alliances reshaping the telephone industry, is speaking up with 
a $3.5 billion investment in a long-distance company that's 
building a national fiber-optic network. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Monday gives BellSouth a 10 percent stake in  
Qwest Communications International, a fast-growing, Denver-based 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Coordinated marketing efforts will begin now, but the real  
payoff for BellSouth depends on whether it finally wins state and 
federal clearance to enter long-distance market. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth and the other regional telephone monopolies can't  
offer long-distance to their customers until they convince 
regulators that they've opened their markets to competition for 
local calling service. 
</P>
<P>
	Until those conditions are satisfied, BellSouth and the other  
``Baby Bells'' are limited to 10 percent ownership in any 
long-distance company. 
</P>
<P>
	But once those hurdles are removed, BellSouth and Qwest would be  
free to package a comprehensive set of high-speed data, image and 
voice communications for business and residential customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest is completing an 18,500-mile fiber optic network serving  
more than 130 U.S. cities and has other high-capacity 
infrastructure projects under way.

<P>
	BellSouth's primary service area is in Alabama, Florida,  
Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South 
Carolina and Tennessee. As a first step, it has applied to offer 
long distance in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	The link-up with Qwest follows a series of much larger deals in  
the telecommunications industry, including SBC Communications' 
planned acquisition of Ameritech and Bell Atlantic's agreement to 
purchase GTE. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, industry analysts and investors were pleased with the  
partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may look like a smaller move, but it has a very distinctly  
different flavor,'' said Phil Asmundson, a telecommunications 
partner with Deloitte Consulting. He said Qwest has been a ``very 
aggressive long-distance network builder,'' and the deal ``sets a 
platform'' for future growth for the two companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In Monday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, BellSouth  
rose 68 3/4 cents per share, or 1.7 percent, to $41.87 1/2. But in Nasdaq 
trading, Qwest finished unchanged at $82 a share, surrendering an 
early $10 gain amid a sharp downturn on Wall Street.

	``Given the rapid change occurring in the communications  
industry today, there is no doubt that together we have the 
potential to be an even more significant driving force,'' said

<P>
	Ackerman expressed optimism Monday that his Atlanta-based  
company will gain permission sometime this year to offer 
long-distance service in Georgia.

<P>
	Under the agreement with Qwest, BellSouth will pay $1.93 million  
in cash for roughly 20.3 million Qwest shares. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Qwest's principal stockholder, Anschutz Co., will  
sell 16.65 million of its shares to BellSouth for about $1.57

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Andrew Baumgartner, a Georgia kindergarten  
teacher, will try just about anything to coax his kids to learn. 
</P>
<P>
	Baumgartner, who has held a wedding for Sleeping Beauty complete  
with limousine and cake, was honored by President Clinton today as 
the 1999 National Teacher of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The role of teachers, while hard to exaggerate, unfortunately  
is too often easy to overlook,'' Clinton said at the White House 
ceremony in Baumgartner's honor. ``The best way we can honor 
America's teachers is for the rest of us to give them the tools to 
succeed with our children in the 21st century,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``Classes should be an adventure every day,'' said Baumgartner,  
who was teaching at A. Brian Merry Elementary School, in Augusta, 
Ga., when he went on leave last year to tour for his honor of 1998 
Georgia Teacher of the Year. ``They (classes) should be places 
where children discover ... where failure is kept at bay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baumgartner, 46, the first Georgia winner of the national  
contest, believes in spreading the magic of learning at the 
530-student school, where 58 percent of students get a free lunch, 
educators' most common measure of student poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	A teacher for 23 years, Baumgartner has battled his share of  
educational demons, even in his own family. He went through the 
pain of watching his son, diagnosed with multiple learning 
disabilities, fail in class and eventually drop out of school in 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is one of the students who fell between the cracks,''  
Baumgartner said in a recent interview. ``When a school fails a 
child, it fails an entire family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His son, now 21, got his general equivalency certificate and is  
enrolled in an Augusta technical school. The experience forced 
Baumgartner to re-evaluate his own teaching style: ``It turned me 
into the teacher who became the teacher of the year. I had to dig 
down deep and figure out who I was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baumgartner, a former Marine who went on to earn a master's  
degree in early childhood education from North Georgia College, 
never thought the littlest kids would be too tough to handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a real thirst for learning,'' he said. ``They're  
still very eager to try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's also fought to overcome skepticism toward male teachers,  
especially ones in the early grades. More than three-fourths of the 
nation's teachers are women. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stereotype was they had to be motherly women, maternal,''  
he said. ``I had to show that I could be paternal, which is just as 
good or better since many of these kids don't have fathers at 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Little boys in school need to see men succeeding.''  
</P>
<P>
	Baumgartner, originally from Savannah, Ga., was inspired to  
teach by his minister father. ``We were taught that we'd been so 
blessed by God that it was our duty to give something back. I did 
that by having a career in service,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He will spend a year on promotional tours as teacher of the  
year. The award is sponsored by the Council of Chief State School 
Officers and Scholastic Inc., the educational publishers. 
</P>
<P>
	Baumgartner wants to use his tenure to emphasize that teachers  
and principals shouldn't be alone in setting high academic 
standards for schoolchildren 
</P>
<P>
	``Every one must be accountable for the public education  
system,'' he said. ``That's why it's called the public education 
system.''

<HEADLINE> Lilly Earns Rise, Prozac Sales Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Eli Lilly and Co.'s first quarter profit  
excluding one-time items rose 12 percent despite a 4 percent 
decline in sales of its best-selling drug, the antidepressant 
Prozac. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings were in line with expectations but Lilly shares  
tumbled on disappointment over the decline in Prozac sales. 
</P>
<P>
	By early afternoon Monday, shares of Lilly were down $6.75, or  
8.2 percent, to $75.56 1/4 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly earned $625.7 million, or 56 cents per share, during first  
quarter ended March 31, compared with $521.1 million, or 46 cents 
per share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time items, the profit was up a more modest 12  
percent to $588.8 million or 53 cents per share. That was in line 
with Wall Street forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall sales rose 8 percent to $2.26 billion from $2.09 billion  
in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Lilly's top drug, Prozac, the world's top-selling  
antidepressant, fell 4 percent worldwide to $589.9 million. Lilly 
said the drug's U.S. sales tumbled 6 percent because of competition 
and because of stocking by U.S. wholesalers at the end of 1998. 
Lilly expected that inventory problem to continue this quarter as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemant K. Shah, an independent analyst who covers the drug  
industry, said other drugs such as Zoloft, Paxil and Serzone are 
stealing market share from Prozac. During the first two months of 
the year, new prescriptions for Prozac fell 7 percent while the 
market overall rose 6 percent, he said. ``Other products are being 
perceived as better products,'' Shah said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly did report some good news on Prozac. The Food and Drug and  
Administration has granted the company an additional six months of 
sales exclusivity as a result of Lilly testing the drug in patients 
under 18. That means Lilly will not face generic competition for 
Prozac until mid-2004 unless pending court appeals result in one of 
Lilly's patents on the drug being thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Lilly drugs had rapid growth in the quarter. They  
include the antipsychotic agent Zyprexa, which rose 40 percent to 
$287 million, lung and pancreatic cancer drug Gemzar, which doubled 
to $114.4 million, and Evista, an osteoporosis drug, rose 63 
percent to $54.6 million. Lilly is also studying Evista for the 
prevention of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	One-time events were a gain of $174.3 million from the January  
sale of PCS Health Systems Inc. pharmacy benefits subsidiary to 
drugstore chain Rite Aid Corp., a pretax charge of $150 million to 
fund the company's non-profit foundation, and a pretax charge of 
$61.4 million to close two manufacturing sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indianapolis-based pharmaceutical company also announced it  
formed a joint venture with French drugmaker Sanofi to develop a 
new colorectal cancer drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly said it would pay Sanofi an upfront fee and other payments  
for a share of U.S. sales of a new treatment for colorectal cancer. 
The companies plan to seek approval for the new drug, oxaliplatin, 
in September.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Challenge Ban on Sludge / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMELIA, Va. (AP) -- A group of farmers want a court to overturn  
the Amelia County Board of Supervisors' ban on the use of treated 
human waste as fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11 farmers claim in a lawsuit that the ban illegally  
pre-empts state law. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel like our rights had been violated because the federal  
government, the state Health Department and everybody approves, and 
then the county says no,'' plaintiff Reuben L. Blanton said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amelia supervisors voted on March 17 to ban the use of  
so-called biosolids, treated human waste that has been used for a 
quarter of a century on farmland and deemed safe by federal and 
state environmental and health agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The sludge is applied on agricultural lands in about 30 Virginia  
counties, mostly on pastures and corn crops used for animal feed. 
It also is used on soybeans and small grains that are processed for 
human consumption with drying and heating techniques that kill any 
micro-organisms. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other Virginia counties have banned biosolids, but  
officials at the Virginia Association of Counties said they knew of 
no other lawsuits challenging the bans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amelia farmers argue in their lawsuit, filed last week in  
Circuit Court, that the ban goes against state law, which allows 
the use of biosolids if a farmer has a state Health Department 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
	Amelia Supervisor Betty Binford, who introduced the ban on the  
grounds biosolids could be unsafe to people, declined to comment on 
the farmers' claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Amelia farmers can save thousands of dollars in chemical  
fertilizer costs by using biosolids, which are provided free of 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- If you think the Colorado air is rare, rarer still  
are the state's air quality regulations for agriculture, until now. 
Amendment 14, passed by voters Nov. 3, has dramatically changed 
that for housed commercial swine feeding operations in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The new regulations went into effect in March, imposing stiff  
new air and water standards upon large swine feeders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Air Quality Control Commission and Water Quality  
Control Commission have issued the Amendment 14 implementing 
regulations, and covered swine feeders have until July 1 to gain 
the operating permit now required. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado has, in the past, had a permit system for confined  
animal feeding operations, but the Department of Health and 
Environment has issued no current permits. There has never been a 
fine for air or water pollution by these operators, and in the past 
a state inspector only got involved when a complaint came in to the 
health department. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Doug Lempke, administrator of the Colorado Air  
Quality Control Commission, the new swine regulations place 
Colorado ``in the middle of the pack,'' as far as swine regulations 
are concerned, compared with other states. Missouri regulators 
drove many large hog producers out of the state, and Minnesota has 
more stringent regulations, Lempke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Operations capable of housing 800,000 pounds of swine or more  
are covered by the new regulations. According to Paul Frohardt, 
administrator of the Water Quality Control Commission, that number 
equates to about 2,000 breeder sows or 3,020 feeder swine.

<HEADLINE> France's LVMH Targets Gucci </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- France's LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton indicated  
it will continue its quest to become one of the world's largest 
luxury goods companies, saying Monday it still wants full control 
of Italian fashion powerhouse Gucci Group. 
</P>
<P>
	LVMH repeated its commitment to a full takeover in a publication  
of its first-quarter revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	But a resolution to the bitter months-long struggle between the  
French and Italian companies doesn't appear to be coming soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Gucci has fought off repeated efforts to be acquired by Bernard  
Arnault, LVMH's hard-charging chairman. He has a 34 percent stake 
in Gucci and built LVMH by winning brutal American-style takeover 
battles. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to prevent the buyout and dilute LVMH's stake in  
Gucci, the Italian company earlier this year sold or issued 44.03 
percent of shares to employees and French retailer 
Pinault-Printemps-Redoute. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday, Gucci said in a statement its board had rejected all  
``conditional'' proposals from LVMH, saying the conditions attached 
were ``unacceptable.'' LVMH has offered a series of bid scenarios 
for Gucci, including one that would offer $85 per share but would 
impose some conditions over management control. 
</P>
<P>
	Gucci's board, however, said it is prepared to recommend to  
shareholders an unconditional offer for all shares at a minimum 
price of $88 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies will take their battle to a Dutch commercial  
court Thurday for a hearing on LVMH's request for an investigation 
into Gucci's management practices. 
</P>
<P>
	LVMH hopes such an investigation could result in the  
cancellation of shares Gucci issued to its employees and the French 
retailer. 
</P>
<P>
	LVMH said in its financial report that first-quarter revenues  
rose 13 percent to 1.76 billion euros ($1.58 billion), boosted by a 
higher champagne sales and a rebound in Asian demand for cosmetics 
and leather goods.

<HEADLINE> African Peace Pact Has Skeptics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Congolese rebels and their Rwandan allies  
voiced skepticism Monday about a peace pact for Congo's civil war 
reached without their participation. 
</P>
<P>
	Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi brokered the cease-fire deal  
between Congolese President Laurent Kabila and the presidents of 
Chad and Uganda, in two hours of talks on Sunday, according to 
Libya's state-run news agency JANA. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people sign a cease-fire, it affects those who have  
signed it, not those who have not signed it,'' Rwandan Vice 
President Paul Kagame told the Congolese rebel newspaper Le Soft on 
Monday in an interview to be published later this week. ``I think 
the agreement is, as far as I can see it, between Uganda and 
Kabila. It remains to be seen if it works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chadian President Idriss Deby, an ally of Kabila, and Uganda's  
Yoweri Museveni signed the deal with the Congolese leader. It was 
witnessed by Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, whose country is 
not directly involved in the conflict, JANA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan calls for the withdrawal of foreign troops fighting in  
Congo and the deployment of African peacekeepers. Uganda and Rwanda 
have troops backing the Congolese rebels, who took up arms in 
August, while Kabila has military support from Chad, Zimbabwe, 
Angola and Namibia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Congo, rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said he was  
unaware of the agreement and waited to be briefed by Museveni, who 
was expected to return to Uganda later Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Congo's rebels have swept through the eastern half of the  
country and threatened the southern diamond and mineral centers of 
Mbuji-Mayi and Lubumbashi, Kabila's main source of revenue. They 
accuse Kabila of mismanagement, corruption and warmongering. 
</P>
<P>
	Cease-fire talks sponsored by Zambian President Frederick  
Chiluba collapsed in Lusaka last week when the rebels walked out, 
saying the government was not talking seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels said they will attend talks in Rome on April 30  
sponsored by the lay Roman Catholic Sant' Egidio Community to 
discuss the future of Congo. But rebel leaders said they would 
attend only if both sides of the conflict are represented and if 
Kabila releases political prisoners.

<HEADLINE> Nissan Launches Xterra SUV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SMYRNA, Tenn. (AP) -- Nissan launched its new Xterra sport  
utility vehicle Monday, but it didn't simply roll off an assembly 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	Covered in mud, a silver Xterra drove out of a smoking 20-foot  
backpack to the throbbing beat of loud music as hundreds of Smyrna 
plant workers wearing ``Xterra looks good dirty'' T-shirts cheered. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's how a real SUV should look,'' said Jerry Benefield,  
Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp. president and chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials hope the Xterra (pronounced ehks-TEH'-ruh),  
Nissan's first totally new product since the Altima in 1992, will 
help the troubled carmaker boost sales by attracting active, young 
outdoor enthusiasts. The name is intended to link images of 
Generation X and rugged terrain. 
</P>
<P>
	This SUV will not have leather seats, but there is an option for  
neoprene covers, which could be useful to surfers or scuba divers 
who climb in while wet. The Xterra has room in the back for two 
mountain bikes to be placed in vertically, and mounts to hold them. 
</P>
<P>
	The optional roof rack can be fitted to hold snowboards, skis,  
canoes, kayaks and bikes. And the Xterra has a ``backpack'' on its 
rear, accessible with the tailgate lifted, to hold a first-aid kit 
or other gear. 
</P>
<P>
	The Xterra goes on sale in early June, priced between  
$17,500-$25,000. Most buyers are expected to take the two-wheel 
drive version with a V-6 engine, manual transmission and air -- 
costing about $18,500, Nissan spokesman Jason Vines said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan plans to make at least 60,000 Xterras the first year,  
with top production capability at the plant of about 75,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Xterra, Nissan is also counting on the  
redesigned Maxima and the Frontier Crew Cab truck to help turn the 
Japanese automaker around. Last week, Nissan executives said they 
expected a $296.6 million loss for the fiscal year ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which recently entered a partnership with Renault  
SA of France in order to get a $5.4 billion cash infusion, plans to 
drop production and slash 5,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nissan North American president Minoru Nakamura said sales  
on this continent are expected to increase from around 630,000 
Nissan and Infiniti vehicles to 700,000 for the 1999 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Xterra should bring ``good showroom traffic'' that  
helps boost the sale of other Nissan vehicles, similar to what 
happened when Volkswagen began selling its new Beetle.

	TOKYO (AP) -- Nissan Motor Co. is not planning layoffs or plant  
closings as part of its campaign to slash 5,000 jobs over the next 
two years, the company's president said today.

	``The chance of closing a whole plant are very slim,'' he told a  
news conference at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanawa also said the number of officials on Nissan's board of  
directors will probably also be cut. The staff cuts are scheduled 
to be finished by March 31, 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanawa lauded the company's recent ties with Renault, saying the  
new partnership would take advantage of Nissan's technical 
expertise and Renault's profit-oriented management style. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault SA of France agreed to pay $5.4 billion for a 36.8  
percent stake in Nissan last month. Nissan hopes to use the cash 
infusion from Renault to help pay off its massive debt load. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Nissan announced it expected to report a loss of  
$296.6 million for the fiscal year that ended March 31 because of a 
sharp drop in domestic sales -- tripling Nissan's previous estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	The troubled carmaker also plans to omit a dividend payment for  
the first time since the public listing of its shares in 1951. It 
had previously planned to pay a dividend of 4 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Annual production capacity will be slashed 25 percent to 1.5  
million vehicles by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan projected that sales for the parent company would total  
$28.1 billion for the fiscal year that ended on March 31, down from 
an earlier forecast of $28.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	It expects unit sales of 874,000 vehicles, compared to 974,000  
in the previous fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Skid Matches Longest of '99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A team used to pounding opponents into oblivion  
suddenly can't hit, pitch or field. What's the deal with the New 
York Yankees? 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever a club goes bad, it will look like one of two things:  
Somebody's not trying, or they're pressing,'' interim manager Don 
Zimmer said Sunday after the Yankees' losing streak hit four games 
with a 5-1 loss to the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's anybody that isn't trying right now,''  
Zimmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's just bad karma, then. The Yankees were 7-1 when  
Darryl Strawberry was arrested Wednesday night. They're 0-4 since. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all feel bad about Straw,'' Zimmer said. ``But the game  
goes on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A week earlier, New York outscored the Tigers 28-5 in three  
games at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	But Detroit bounced back to outscore the Yankees 16-3, sweeping  
them in a three-game series at Tiger Stadium for the first time 
since the end of the 1988 season. New York was not held to three 
runs in any three-game span last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year has nothing to do with this year,'' said Derek  
Jeter, whose .457 average defies the team's slump. ``I know that's 
the way fans are thinking. That's the way the reporters are, too. 
But, I'll say it over and over: Last year was last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, we expect to win. We expect to win every time out. But  
it's not going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sweep in Detroit was the Yankees' first since being swept in  
three straight at Philadelphia in September 1997. But the four-game 
skid matches the longest of the wondrous 1998 season when they won 
a record 114 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get good pitching and drive in some runs, you win  
games,'' said Paul O'Neill, hitless in his last 16 at-bats after 
going 0-for-11 at Tiger Stadium. ``We're going to get back into 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fewest runs the Yankees scored in any three-game span last  
year was six, which came when they lost their first three games of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, we expect to score more runs,'' Jeter said. ``We always  
do. But it's not going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees made five errors against Detroit, after committing  
just three in their first nine games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing, if you're a major league player, to miss a  
cutoff man or something,'' Zimmer said. ``I have never criticized 
an error. I've made them myself. Nobody wants to make them, but 
players are human.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Down the hall, the Tigers were almost as puzzled as the World  
Series champs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you would have asked who we would have swept -- Minnesota or  
the Yankees -- I would have said Minnesota,'' right-hander Doug 
Brocail said. ``It's not arguable by anybody. The Yankees are 10 
times the team. They have more talent. They have more pitching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees were off Monday and return to Yankee Stadium for a  
two-game series with Texas on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Roger Clemens summed it up best the other night,''  
Zimmer said. ``He said he'll have two or three lousy games every 
year. Hopefully, this is the worst we'll play.''

<HEADLINE> Transsexual Awarded $755,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A jury awarded $755,000 in damages Monday  
to a transsexual who was strip searched by sheriff's deputies to 
confirm her gender. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-member U.S. District Court panel awarded Victoria  
Schneider $750,000 for emotional pain and suffering on Friday for 
the June 1996 strip search. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury completed its verdict Monday by imposing $5,000 in  
punitive damages against Deputy Fred Lew for ordering the search. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schneider said the strip search was unnecessary because  
deputies at the same jail had searched her after a 1993 arrest and 
determined she was a woman. She said she implored them to look at 
their records but they refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schneider was brought to the jail after being arrested for  
investigation of prostitution, although she was never charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially booked as a male, she protested that she was a woman  
and said she feared for her safety if placed into a cell with men. 
City employees and other detainees laughed and jeered her, Ms. 
Schneider said.

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom To Buy CAI Wireless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- MCI Worldcom, the nation's No. 2 provider of  
long-distance calling service, is buying CAI Wireless Systems for 
about $414 million. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom has been the only major telephone company without a  
stake in the lucrative and rapidly growing market for wireless 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tentative agreement announced late Friday, MCI agreed to  
pay $24 per share in cash for more than 17.24 million CAI shares. 
</P>
<P>
	CAI Wireless has been seeking a partner since its emerged from  
bankruptcy protection in October 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	CAI stock value surged 59 percent to $20 per share earlier this  
month with reports that MCI Worldcom and Sprint were interested in 
acquiring it. MCI Worldcom acquired the debt of CAI and several 
other struggling wireless companies at the end of March. At that 
time, CAI's stock was valued at $6 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	When the agreement was announced Friday, MCI WorldCom had also  
contracted to buy more than half of CAI's common stock. 
</P>
<P>
	CAI operates six analog-based wireless subscription video  
systems in New York City, Rochester and Albany, Philadelphia, 
Washington, D.C., and Norfolk/Virginia Beach, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	CAI also owns wireless channel rights in Long Island, Buffalo  
and Syracuse, Providence, R.I., Hartford, Conn., Boston, Baltimore, 
Md., and Pittsburgh. In addition, CAI owns 94 percent of CS 
Wireless Systems Inc., a wireless operator based in Plano, Texas.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that moved substantially or traded  
heavily Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Stock Market, 
and American Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                               *NYSE    	

</P>
<P>
 *Citigroup fell 1 to 70 5/8.    	
</P>
<P>
 *BankAmerica fell 1 1/4 to 71 3/4.    	
</P>
<P>
	Both gave up early gains that came after the banking companies  
announced stronger-than-expected first-quarter earnings. Citigroup 
rose as high as 76 1/4 and BankAmerica rose as high as 76 1/8 before 
retreating. 

</P>
<P>
 *Deutsche Telekom fell 3/4 to 39 15/16.    	
</P>
<P>
 *Sprint Corp. fell 2 5/8 to 97 7/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom confirmed it is in merger talks with Telecom  
Italia. Separately, a German business weekly, Manager Magazin, says 
it will report Deutsche Telekom is negotiating a takeover of 
Sprint. Deutsche Telekom already owns 10 percent of Sprint, as does 
France Telecom. 

</P>
<P>
 *Compaq Computer fell 7/8 to 22 3/4.    	
</P>
<P>
	Compaq, which stunned Wall Street with an ominous earnings  
warning earlier this month, disclosed Sunday that its chief 
executive had been ousted and that its chief financial officer also 
was leaving. CEO Eckhard Pfeiffer, who built Houston-based Compaq 
into the world's largest personal computer maker, had struggled to 
maintain profits while PC prices are plunging. The company has also 
had difficulty integrating two acquisitions, Digital Equipment 
Corp. and Tandem Computers Inc. 

</P>
<P>
 *Theragenics Corp. fell 1 3/16 to 6 13/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter earnings were 10 cents a share, down a penny from  
last year. The earnings were in line with Wall Street analysts' 
estimates, but the Buford, Ga., company, which makes a radioactive 
prostate cancer treatment device, still reported a drop in profits 
despite an 11-percent rise in revenues. 

</P>
<P>
 *ZDNet fell 8 3/16 to 31 5/8.    	
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs began coverage at ``market outperform,'' but the  
stock still fell in sympathy with other technology shares. 

</P>
<P>
 *Consolidated Natural Gas rose 3 5/8 to 56.    	
</P>
<P>
 *Columbia Energy fell 1 1/2 to 46 3/4.    	
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Energy offered to buy Consolidated Natural Columbia for  
$70 a share in cash and stock. Consolidated Natural already has a 
definitive merger agreement with Dominion Resources, Inc., which 
was up 1 15/16 at 40. 

</P>
<P>
 *CompUSA Inc. unchanged at 5 15/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	The computer retailer's shares escaped a brutal selloff in  
technology stocks, after the company said it plans to streamline 
operations at its CompuUSA Net.com Internet-only operations, which 
it said will reduce fourth-quarter profits by $5 million to $8 
million. 

</P>
<P>
                              *NASDAQ   	

</P>
<P>
 *Intel Corp. fell 1 3/4 to 55 1/2.    	
</P>
<P>
	The stock gave up initial gains in a big selloff in technology  
shares. The computer chip maker said it will enter the network 
processor market with specific product offerings to be unveiled 
later this year. Intel said its plans include products that will 
support high-speed communication within local-area and wide-area 
networks. 

</P>
<P>
 *ACTV fell 5 1/8 to 15 5/8.    	
</P>
<P>
	The company bought a patent for a method to link video and audio  
programming to the Internet. The technology allows users to 
``pull'' content from the Internet to enhance television and radio 
programming. 

</P>
<P>
 *USABancShares rose 3 3/8 to 14 1/4.    	
</P>
<P>
	The company activated its new Internet banking system.  

</P>
<P>
 *Vantive Corp. fell 3 1/16 to 6 5/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	The company, which makes customer-interaction software, said it  
expects to break even this year, less than analysts' estimates of 
profit of 6 cents.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Marathon Winners Take On Boston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The winners of the last three New York City  
Marathons are ready for Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	But something else connects Italy's Franca Fiacconi, Romania's  
Anuta Catuna and Switzerland's Franziska Rochat-Moser. All three, 
without hesitation, insist Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia will be the 
toughest to beat for the women's title in today's Boston Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	With moderately dry air, mixed sunshine and cool temperatures,  
Roba was favored to win her third straight Boston Marathon. Her 
time of 2 hours, 23 minutes, 21 seconds last year was the third 
fastest on the course by a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Roba, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist, leads a strong field that  
also includes Lynn Jennings, the top American woman distance runner 
making her official marathon debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 'big woman' is Fatuma,'' Catuna said. ``I think we'll stay  
together (in the race). I think I can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The men's field features defending champion Moses Tanui who  
finished in 2:07:34 last year. He is part of a nine-member Kenyan 
team that includes Joseph Chebet, who placed second last year in 
2:07:37, and John Kagwe, who won his second straight NYC Marathon 
last year in 2:08:12. 
</P>
<P>
	Kagwe ran a personal best and second-fastest course time of  
2:08:12 at New York in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Catuna won the NYC Marathon in 1996, when she overtook Tegla  
Laroupe -- who set the women's world mark of 2:20:47 at Rotterdam 
last year -- and finished in 2:28:28. 
</P>
<P>
	Catuna trains in Boulder, Colo., where the air is clean and the  
hills abundant, to prepare for Boston's hilly course. 
</P>
<P>
	More than any other race, the 30-year-old Romanian said she  
enjoys running the Boston Marathon, citing its history and 
competitiveness -- particularly the women's field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone wants to run the Boston Marathon,'' Catuna said.  
</P>
<P>
	She said Boston is not as difficult as the New York City  
Marathon because New York has more hills. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boston is easy,'' said Catuna, who placed third in Boston last  
year in 2:27:34. ``It has only four hills. In New York, they have 
plenty. Every two kilometers, there is (another) hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rochat-Moser disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``New York and Boston are very hard,'' she said. ``I don't see a  
lot of differences, they are both very hilly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conditions were favorable with projected temperatures in the  
mid-50s at the start, according to the National Weather Service. 
Temperatures could climb to 60 along part of the course and then 
drop during the afternoon. There was also a chance of showers. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Catuna and Fiacconi, who focus much of their training for  
Boston on hill workouts, Rochat-Moser works on her quick pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to have speed, the hills will come on their own,''  
said the 32-year-old who has been running long distances since she 
was just 10. ``I think the race will go very fast. There are a lot 
of good women here, fast women,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rochat-Moser, who trains in Lausanne, Switzerland, incorporates  
cycling workouts into her marathon training. She runs about 100 
miles a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiacconi won New York last year in her personal best of 2:25:17  
and has not raced in any other marathons since. In 1997, she ran 
three marathons in 60 days. She placed third at New York, 13th at 
the world championships in Athens, Greece, and second in Italy's 
Capri Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	Since winning New York, Fiacconi, who at 5-foot-8 towers over  
most of her competitors, has spent much of her time on interviews, 
traveling and training. For the past two months, she has trained at 
her favorite spot, Rocca Canterano, a hilly area outside of Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, she thinks Roba will be wearing the laurel wreath  
at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's the Olympian,'' Rochat-Moser said. ``She runs very fast,  
and if she's in good shape, nobody can beat her.''

	CANASTOTA, N.Y. (AP) -- Actress Bo Derek will be the grand

<HEADLINE> Teacher of Year Makes Lessons Fun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Andrew Baumgartner, a Georgia kindergarten  
teacher, will try just about anything to coax his kids to learn. 
</P>
<P>
	Baumgartner, who has held a wedding for Sleeping Beauty complete  
with limousine and cake, was honored by President Clinton today as 
the 1999 National Teacher of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The role of teachers, while hard to exaggerate, unfortunately  
is too often easy to overlook,'' Clinton said at the White House 
ceremony in Baumgartner's honor. ``The best way we can honor 
America's teachers is for the rest of us to give them the tools to 
succeed with our children in the 21st century,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``Classes should be an adventure every day,'' said Baumgartner,  
who was teaching at A. Brian Merry Elementary School, in Augusta, 
Ga., when he went on leave last year to tour for his honor of 1998 
Georgia Teacher of the Year. ``They (classes) should be places 
where children discover ... where failure is kept at bay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baumgartner, 46, the first Georgia winner of the national  
contest, believes in spreading the magic of learning at the 
530-student school, where 58 percent of students get a free lunch, 
educators' most common measure of student poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	A teacher for 23 years, Baumgartner has battled his share of  
educational demons, even in his own family. He went through the 
pain of watching his son, diagnosed with multiple learning 
disabilities, fail in class and eventually drop out of school in 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is one of the students who fell between the cracks,''  
Baumgartner said in a recent interview. ``When a school fails a 
child, it fails an entire family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His son, now 21, got his general equivalency certificate and is  
enrolled in an Augusta technical school. The experience forced 
Baumgartner to re-evaluate his own teaching style: ``It turned me 
into the teacher who became the teacher of the year. I had to dig 
down deep and figure out who I was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baumgartner, a former Marine who went on to earn a master's  
degree in early childhood education from North Georgia College, 
never thought the littlest kids would be too tough to handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a real thirst for learning,'' he said. ``They're  
still very eager to try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's also fought to overcome skepticism toward male teachers,  
especially ones in the early grades. More than three-fourths of the 
nation's teachers are women. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stereotype was they had to be motherly women, maternal,''  
he said. ``I had to show that I could be paternal, which is just as 
good or better since many of these kids don't have fathers at 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Little boys in school need to see men succeeding.''  
</P>
<P>
	Baumgartner, originally from Savannah, Ga., was inspired to  
teach by his minister father. ``We were taught that we'd been so 
blessed by God that it was our duty to give something back. I did 
that by having a career in service,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He will spend a year on promotional tours as teacher of the  
year. The award is sponsored by the Council of Chief State School 
Officers and Scholastic Inc., the educational publishers. 
</P>
<P>
	Baumgartner wants to use his tenure to emphasize that teachers  
and principals shouldn't be alone in setting high academic 
standards for schoolchildren 
</P>
<P>
	``Every one must be accountable for the public education  
system,'' he said. ``That's why it's called the public education 
system.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Tours Ohio Tornado Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLUE ASH, Ohio (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore toured tornado-hit  
areas of suburban Cincinnati today, expressing sympathy for victims 
of the twister that killed four people and caused $27 million in 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was accompanied by Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, whose district  
includes heavily damaged Blue Ash and Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado that swept across Cincinnati's northern suburbs  
early April 9 destroyed hundreds of homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry for what you all have been through,'' Gore told  
Laurie Arshonsky, whose home in Montgomery was destroyed. ``You 
people have really suffered through a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Arshonsky showed Gore a handful of jewelry and trinkets  
that she had recovered from the rubble of her home. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I'd like to do with my garden, I'd like to make it a  
tornado victory garden,'' she told Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spent several minutes talking with disaster relief workers  
and with local law enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those of you who lost family members and loved ones will be in  
our hearts and in our prayers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said the Federal Emergency Management Agency should send  
word this week on whether Gov. Bob Taft's request for disaster 
relief for the area will be approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was spending about five hours in Cincinnati before going to  
Chicago. His Cincinnati trip included a luncheon fund-raiser for 
his presidential campaign and a discussion of long-term health care 
during a visit to a Jewish community center.

<HEADLINE> Court Debates Methane Gas Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A big-stakes Supreme Court dispute over  
ownership of methane gas found with the coal under federal land 
seemed to hinge on one question Monday: What is coal? 
</P>
<P>
	In a lively, hour-long argument session, the justices had  
trouble coming up with an answer -- one they'll need to decide the 
case from Colorado by late June. At issue is whether a pair of 
90-year federal laws that gave the government ownership of the coal 
applied as well to the methane gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Amoco Production Co., a subsidiary of Amoco Corp., has purchased  
the right to drill for natural gas on the Southern Ute Tribe's 
reservation. While coal on the reservation is owned by the 
government in trust for the tribe, Amoco says the methane found 
with the coal is a natural gas it is entitled to take. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could hardly find a word that was more commonly understood  
by the average person in 1909 and 1910,'' contended Amoco's 
Washington lawyer, Carter Phillips. ``If you take the coal bed 
methane out of the coal, what you have left is coal,'' he said. 
Methane is not part of the coal, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	For most of this century, methane gas was viewed only as a  
dangerous element of coal mining, but relatively recent technology 
has made coal bed methane commercially valuable. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips was joined in pressing that point by Wyoming Deputy  
Attorney General Thomas Davidson, who in behalf of five states 
noted that the court's decision will affect regulatory authority 
and ``tens of thousands of acres (owned by states) for the benefit 
of our public schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five states are Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota  
and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the Utes and the Clinton administration told the  
justices a federal appeals court got it right when it ruled last 
year that the 1909 and 1910 Coal Land acts reserved federal 
ownership of both coal and methane gas while allowing the land 
surface to be bought by homesteaders. 
</P>
<P>
	When Amoco's lawyers appealed to the nation's highest court,  
they said the appeals court ruling affected ``natural gas worth 
billions of dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The better view is (coal bed methane gas) is part of the coal  
... goes with the coal,'' Justice Department lawyer Jeffrey Minear 
contended. He said ``coal'' as used in the laws ``describes what 
nature deposited and miners mined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Shipps, a Durango, Colo., lawyer representing the tribe,  
said Congress had not intended to reserve rights to ``a degasified, 
dehydrated lump not found in nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was difficult to determine from questions and comments from  
the bench which arguments the court found most persuasive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough case, there's no doubt about it,'' Justice John  
Paul Stevens said at one point. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked Phillips, Amoco's lawyer,  
whether coal owners had ``dominion over'' methane gas back when it 
was not considered an asset. After all, the coal owner would be 
held responsible for any explosion if efforts to vent the gas 
failed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were permitted to waste the gas,'' Phillips said. ``What  
that doesn't give you is title to the (gas).'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Justice David H. Souter asked Davidson whether gas-rights  
owners should be able to claim all methane gas found with coal, the 
Wyoming lawyer answered, ``All that can be removed with drilling 
techniques.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Sandra Day O'Connor pointedly noted in comments to  
Minear, the administration's lawyer, that the federal government at 
one time renounced ownership of the methane gas but changed its 
stand after the gas became commercially valuable. 
</P>
<P>
	And Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist complained that the  
government ``has danced all around the maypole'' on the ownership 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Only eight of the nine justices heard arguments in the case.  
Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who last May reported owning between 
$15,000 and $50,000 worth of Amoco stock, disqualified himself when 
the case was granted review in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Amoco Production Co. vs. Southern Ute Indian Tribe,  
98-830.

<HEADLINE>  Yanks' Skid Matches Longest of '99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A team used to pounding opponents into oblivion  
suddenly can't hit, pitch or field. What's the deal with the New 
York Yankees? 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever a club goes bad, it will look like one of two things:  
Somebody's not trying, or they're pressing,'' interim manager Don 
Zimmer said Sunday after the Yankees' losing streak hit four games 
with a 5-1 loss to the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's anybody that isn't trying right now,''  
Zimmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's just bad karma, then. The Yankees were 7-1 when  
Darryl Strawberry was arrested Wednesday night. They're 0-4 since. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all feel bad about Straw,'' Zimmer said. ``But the game  
goes on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A week earlier, New York outscored the Tigers 28-5 in three  
games at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	But Detroit bounced back to outscore the Yankees 16-3, sweeping  
them in a three-game series at Tiger Stadium for the first time 
since the end of the 1988 season. New York was not held to three 
runs in any three-game span last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year has nothing to do with this year,'' said Derek  
Jeter, whose .457 average defies the team's slump. ``I know that's 
the way fans are thinking. That's the way the reporters are, too. 
But, I'll say it over and over: Last year was last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, we expect to win. We expect to win every time out. But  
it's not going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sweep in Detroit was the Yankees' first since being swept in  
three straight at Philadelphia in September 1997. But the four-game 
skid matches the longest of the wondrous 1998 season when they won 
a record 114 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get good pitching and drive in some runs, you win  
games,'' said Paul O'Neill, hitless in his last 16 at-bats after 
going 0-for-11 at Tiger Stadium. ``We're going to get back into 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fewest runs the Yankees scored in any three-game span last  
year was six, which came when they lost their first three games of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, we expect to score more runs,'' Jeter said. ``We always  
do. But it's not going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees made five errors against Detroit, after committing  
just three in their first nine games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing, if you're a major league player, to miss a  
cutoff man or something,'' Zimmer said. ``I have never criticized 
an error. I've made them myself. Nobody wants to make them, but 
players are human.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Down the hall, the Tigers were almost as puzzled as the World  
Series champs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you would have asked who we would have swept -- Minnesota or  
the Yankees -- I would have said Minnesota,'' right-hander Doug 
Brocail said. ``It's not arguable by anybody. The Yankees are 10 
times the team. They have more talent. They have more pitching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees were off Monday and return to Yankee Stadium for a  
two-game series with Texas on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Roger Clemens summed it up best the other night,''  
Zimmer said. ``He said he'll have two or three lousy games every 
year. Hopefully, this is the worst we'll play.''

<HEADLINE> Iowa Cubs' Owner Has Stroke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Iowa Cubs owner Ken Grandquist suffered  
a stroke over the weekend while watching his minor-league baseball 
team play, and he remains in critical condition today. 
</P>
<P>
	Grandquist, 75, collapsed in his skybox at Sec Taylor Stadium  
during Saturday night's game against Las Vegas, team officials said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Grandquist, a Des Moines businessman, was listed Sunday in  
critical condition at Iowa Methodist Medical Center, said Sam 
Bernabe, the club's general manager and family spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital said Grandquist remained in critical condition  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was sitting in his favorite chair in his favorite skybox  
watching his favorite team,'' Bernabe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grandquist has been talking about selling the Chicago Cubs'  
Triple-A team after this season, but Bernabe said he doesn't think 
that caused him any stress. 
</P>
<P>
	Grandquist has acknowledged talking with various businessmen,  
most recently Michael Gartner, the owner-editor of the Tribune, a 
daily newspaper in Ames. 
</P>
<P>
	Grandquist has said the club is worth from $10 million to $12  
million.

<HEADLINE> CDC Eases Mercury Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal health agency is easing its  
benchmark for mercury contamination in a move critics say could 
jeopardize future regulation of mercury in the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised health standard, or ``toxicity profile,'' for  
mercury, announced Monday by an agency of the Department of Health 
and Human Services, sets proposed limits that are three times 
higher than the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The relaxation of the standard and discrepancies between federal  
agencies ``will only cause more confusion,'' said Sen. Patrick 
Leahy, D-Vt., who for years has pushed for tighter regulation of 
mercury emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Leahy and several other senators as well as state environmental  
officials had urged the health agency to hold off on revising its 
toxicity profile for mercury until next year when an in-depth study 
of mercury's health effects is to be completed. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter last month to Health and Human Services Secretary  
Donna Shalala, state environmental officials from the Northeast 
expressed concern that easing the standard would ``adversely impact 
existing state-based public health programs'' for mercury. 
</P>
<P>
	The New England states have some of the highest concentration of  
mercury contamination in waterways in the country and have embarked 
on an aggressive program to try reduce mercury exposure through 
fish advisories and emission reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	But the health impact of low-levels of mercury contamination has  
been widely disputed. Congress last year barred further regulation 
of mercury until the National Academy of Sciences completes an 
18-month study of the health effects next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists as well as some state officials said the  
easing of the standard Monday by the Agency for Toxic Substance and 
Disease Registry at a time when the EPA is standing firm on its 
standards will only add to the uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
	``It simply sends the wrong message to the public and to the  
polluters that mercury is not a problem,'' Sen. Paul Wellstone, 
D-Minn., wrote Shalala last month when a draft of the revised 
standard began being circulated. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA said in a statement that the health agency's revised  
standard ``should not change any warning or advisory currently in 
place to protect public health from mercury contamination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In easing its mercury standard the health agency also urged  
states and other agencies ``not to change existing fish 
advisories'' based on the new toxicity profiles. ``The amounts 
we're talking about are extremely minute. The difference is very 
small,'' said Kathy Skipper, an ATSDR spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The health agency said that based on the latest studies, people  
can consume as much as 0.3 micrograms of mercury per kilogram of 
their body weight without health risks. Its previous standard -- and 
the standard still used by the EPA -- has been 0.1 microgram. 
</P>
<P>
	Skipper said the changes were based on examination of new  
studies of low-level mercury contamination from fish consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics said the agency largely based its revision on a  
controversial study in the Seychelles Islands in the Indian Ocean. 
That study found no developmental effects among children whose 
mothers were exposed to levels of mercury somewhat above the 0.1 
microgram threshold while pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Seychelles study has been cited by industry as  
evidence that the federal health standard of 0.1 micrograms is too 
stringent, it also has come under attack from some health experts 
and environmentalists as possibly an aberration. 
</P>
<P>
	The critics argue another study of children in the Faroe Islands  
off Scotland suggest the opposite. There, researchers found adverse 
developmental effects among children from their mothers' relatively 
low-level exposure to mercury in fish. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're ignoring the Faroes study. They have an agenda that  
they only want to push the Seychelles study,'' said Michael Bender, 
director of the Mercury Policy Project, an advocacy group based in 
Montpelier, Vt., that has been active in lobbying for tighter 
controls on mercury emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Bender said electric utilities already has been using the  
anticipated easing of the standard based on the Seychelles study to 
argue in Congress and with state officials against tougher mercury 
emission regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Utilities in Wisconsin recently questioned that state's mercury  
reduction programs, including its many fish advisories, in light of 
expected government acceptance of a less stringent mercury 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
	And a manufacturer of light bulbs recently asked the federal  
government consider the expected revised standard when the EPA 
issues its regulations for disposal of mercury-containing lamps, 
according to state officials in Minnesota.

<HEADLINE> Italian, German Telecoms Near Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Telecom Italia SpA and Germany's Deutsche Telekom  
AG are nearing a mega-deal that would create a new global 
competitor to U.S. giants such as AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	The move, which would pair two former state monopolies, would be  
subject to intense regulatory scrutiny and would undoubtedly 
present the companies with political and cultural obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
	A Telecom Italia-Deutsche Telekom combination would dwarf its  
competitors in Europe and would most likely become the largest 
merger in history, topping the pending $74 billion deal between 
Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	A Telecom Italia official who spoke on condition of anonymity  
said earlier Monday the two firms' chief executives -- Franco 
Bernabe and Ron Sommer -- would outline the merger agreement at a 
Tuesday news conference in London. 
</P>
<P>
	However, after separate board meetings Monday, both companies  
said the press conference had been postponed, Dow Jones News 
Service and other news organizations reported. Talks are expected 
to resume Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Times reported in its Tuesday edition that the  
main problem appeared to be over the structure of the merged 
company, with the German group demanding a 56 percent stake. The 
London-based newspaper said Telecom Italia officials blamed the 
delay in board approval on the complexity of the merger talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom spokesman Stephan Althoff on Monday declined to  
comment on earlier published reports that the two companies planned 
to fold their stock into a new telecommunications holding company 
on a 60-40 percent basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian prime minister's office has said that any accord  
must be on an equal footing, underlining fears in Italy of foreign 
ownership of the strategic telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia may not be the only partner Deutsche Telecom is  
eyeing. The German business weekly Manager Magazin issued a news 
release Monday saying that Deutsche Telekom is also negotiating a 
takeover of U.S. telecommunications company Sprint Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a report to be published Friday in the magazine,  
Telekom boss Sommer has been negotiating a deal with Sprint Corp.'s 
Chief Executive William Esrey for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Althoff dismissed the story as ``just speculation.'' Officials  
at Sprint did not respond to requests for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia confirmed late Sunday that it was examining the  
possibility of an industrial alliance with Deutsche Telekom. 
Telecom Italia is known to be seeking a white knight to save it 
from a hostile takeover bid by its smaller Italian rival, Olivetti 
SpA. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia have refused to say how they  
might share ownership in a combined company and have declined to 
say how they might calculate their respective values in any merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom has a market capitalization of about $117  
billion while Telecom Italia is at about $77 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema said today that any merger  
between Telecom Italia and Deutsche Telekom would require a 
privatization of the German company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot imagine that a privatized Telecom Italia may merge  
with a company whose main shareholder is the German state,'' 
D'Alema told reporters. Deutsche Telecom is 72 percent-owned by the 
German government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian government owns 3.4 percent of Telecom Italia, but  
it has veto power over the acquisition of more than 3 percent of 
the shares of the telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti has offered $12.31 a share for Telecom Italia. Olivetti  
plans to proceed with its tender offer despite the German-Italian 
merger talks, company spokesman Ugo Panerai said today. Olivetti 
has already filed a prospectus with the Italian regulatory body 
Consob. 
</P>
<P>
	A merger also would raise a rash of regulatory issues. Deutsche  
Telekom has close financial and operational ties with another major 
telecommunications company, France Telecom. In addition, Deutsche 
Telekom is still majority owned by the German government, which 
would have to divest it in order to gain approval of the deal from 
Italian regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	France Telecom said Deutsche Telekom can't withdraw unilaterally  
from its strategic agreements with the French telecommunications 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our agreements with Deutsche Telekom are clear and  
incompatible with a unilateral strategic turnaround,'' France 
Telecom said. The companies own 2 percent of one another's stock.

<HEADLINE> Ousted Compaq CEO Couldn't Deliver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Compaq's chief executive, Eckhard Pfeiffer, told  
the world he would outdo himself. 
</P>
<P>
	After building his company into the world's largest maker of  
personal computers, Pfeiffer aimed to stretch Compaq well beyond 
its roots, creating a technology conglomerate that would sell a 
spectrum of machines and high-tech services to rival the likes of 
IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pfeiffer fell short of this goal and was ousted this weekend  
by Compaq's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	While Compaq Computer Corp. remains a formidable competitor, it  
choked on other manufacturers it acquired, didn't foresee the 
importance of Internet sales and stumbled while trying to emulate 
the more efficient sales model of arch rival Dell Computer Corp. 
First-quarter revenue is expected to total $9.4 billion, well short 
of expectations, raising doubts that Compaq will achieve Pfeiffer's 
annual sales goal of $50 billion by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfeiffer, some say, left his company too spread out to  
effectively defend the cheap-PC strategy he pioneered in the early 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all the classic signs of a Greek tragedy,'' said Roger  
Kay, an industry analyst with the International Data Corp. research 
and consulting company. ``They were the creators of their own 
demise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq chairman Ben Rosen, who is acting as chief executive  
until a replacement is found, defended Pfeiffer's vision, but said 
the company will try to improve its execution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compaq's strategy is fundamentally sound,'' Rosen told  
analysts in a conference call Monday. But, he added, ``we plan to 
speed up decision-making. We plan to anticipate and get ahead of 
industry changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pfeiffer, who took over as CEO in October 1991, beat by two  
years his initial goal of building the No. 1 PC maker by 1996. He 
passed IBM and Apple by peddling affordable machines using popular 
Microsoft Windows software and Intel chips, establishing the 
dominance of so-called ``Wintel'' computers. 
</P>
<P>
	But competing mainly on price made it tougher for Compaq to earn  
money. A crop of upstart competitors such as eMachines is pushing 
prices down so low that it has forced the personal computer 
industry to rewrite its business model. As of January, sub-$600 
computers accounted for nearly one-in-five desktop PCs sold in U.S. 
retail channels, according to high-tech publisher Ziff Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Tumbling prices of PCs haven't been Compaq's only problem. While  
prices of PCs sold to businesses dropped by 16 percent in the three 
months ended February, prices of more profitable business computers 
known as servers, which help run networks of desktops, plunged by 
31 percent, according to Ziff Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	While other companies such as IBM and Hewlett-Packard also  
suffered, they sell a wider range of products than Compaq, which 
helped mitigate the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfeiffer began stretching in new directions. He introduced new  
machines that combined the functions of PCs and TVs, hoping to 
create a new entertainment category. 
</P>
<P>
	His success in pushing Compaq to the head of the PC pack gave  
him the clout to pull off two major acquisitions these past two 
years. The idea behind buying Digital Equipment Corp. and Tandem 
Computers Inc., makers of powerful business systems, was to help 
Compaq offer customers a range of computers. Compaq's sales 
channels, went the thinking, could peddle Digital computers, and 
vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
	But PC-TVs never took off. And analysts said Pfeiffer never  
fully exploited the acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Unit sales of Digital's Alpha computers, which are targeted to  
large corporations, dropped 12 percent in the six months since 
Compaq completed the Digital acquisition last summer, according to 
the researcher International Data Corp. Revenues from Alpha 
machines slipped 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	One problem has been a lack of new Alpha models, though Compaq  
recently introduced new products, said International Data analyst 
Jim Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people hoped Compaq would bring something of volume  
strategy to Digitals' Alpha line and other products,'' he said. ``A 
lot of that hasn't happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq was forced to backtrack from a recent attempt to compete  
more effectively against Dell, the world's largest seller of 
computers directly to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Dell, Compaq sells most of its computers through  
distributors, who get a cut of the profits. By cutting out these 
middlemen, Dell bolsters its profits and nurtures long-lasting 
relationships with customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Compaq began selling a new line of computers on its  
Web site directly to small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Jump-starting Internet sales could have helped Compaq catch up  
to Dell, which sold $14 million worth of computers online each day 
by the end of the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	But Compaq's Web sales fell short, and the company was forced to  
retreat from its direct-only strategy. This year, it began offering 
the same machines through distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq isn't the only company having difficulty trying to sell  
both ways. IBM and Hewlett-Packard also have had mixed success.

<HEADLINE> Court Debates Methane Gas Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A big-stakes Supreme Court dispute over  
ownership of methane gas found with the coal under federal land 
seemed to hinge on one question Monday: What is coal? 
</P>
<P>
	In a lively, hour-long argument session, the justices had  
trouble coming up with an answer -- one they'll need to decide the 
case from Colorado by late June. At issue is whether a pair of 
90-year federal laws that gave the government ownership of the coal 
applied as well to the methane gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Amoco Production Co., a subsidiary of Amoco Corp., has purchased  
the right to drill for natural gas on the Southern Ute Tribe's 
reservation. While coal on the reservation is owned by the 
government in trust for the tribe, Amoco says the methane found 
with the coal is a natural gas it is entitled to take. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could hardly find a word that was more commonly understood  
by the average person in 1909 and 1910,'' contended Amoco's 
Washington lawyer, Carter Phillips. ``If you take the coal bed 
methane out of the coal, what you have left is coal,'' he said. 
Methane is not part of the coal, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	For most of this century, methane gas was viewed only as a  
dangerous element of coal mining, but relatively recent technology 
has made coal bed methane commercially valuable. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips was joined in pressing that point by Wyoming Deputy  
Attorney General Thomas Davidson, who in behalf of five states 
noted that the court's decision will affect regulatory authority 
and ``tens of thousands of acres (owned by states) for the benefit 
of our public schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five states are Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota  
and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the Utes and the Clinton administration told the  
justices a federal appeals court got it right when it ruled last 
year that the 1909 and 1910 Coal Land acts reserved federal 
ownership of both coal and methane gas while allowing the land 
surface to be bought by homesteaders. 
</P>
<P>
	When Amoco's lawyers appealed to the nation's highest court,  
they said the appeals court ruling affected ``natural gas worth 
billions of dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The better view is (coal bed methane gas) is part of the coal  
... goes with the coal,'' Justice Department lawyer Jeffrey Minear 
contended. He said ``coal'' as used in the laws ``describes what 
nature deposited and miners mined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Shipps, a Durango, Colo., lawyer representing the tribe,  
said Congress had not intended to reserve rights to ``a degasified, 
dehydrated lump not found in nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was difficult to determine from questions and comments from  
the bench which arguments the court found most persuasive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough case, there's no doubt about it,'' Justice John  
Paul Stevens said at one point. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked Phillips, Amoco's lawyer,  
whether coal owners had ``dominion over'' methane gas back when it 
was not considered an asset. After all, the coal owner would be 
held responsible for any explosion if efforts to vent the gas 
failed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were permitted to waste the gas,'' Phillips said. ``What  
that doesn't give you is title to the (gas).'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Justice David H. Souter asked Davidson whether gas-rights  
owners should be able to claim all methane gas found with coal, the 
Wyoming lawyer answered, ``All that can be removed with drilling 
techniques.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Sandra Day O'Connor pointedly noted in comments to  
Minear, the administration's lawyer, that the federal government at 
one time renounced ownership of the methane gas but changed its 
stand after the gas became commercially valuable. 
</P>
<P>
	And Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist complained that the  
government ``has danced all around the maypole'' on the ownership 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Only eight of the nine justices heard arguments in the case.  
Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who last May reported owning between 
$15,000 and $50,000 worth of Amoco stock, disqualified himself when 
the case was granted review in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Amoco Production Co. vs. Southern Ute Indian Tribe,  
98-830.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Faces Future Off World Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Photo Planned    	
</P>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Sneered at for decades as one of the  
world's least exciting capitals, Bonn is getting even sleepier as 
the government packs up and leaves for Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	A dreaded moment came today when parliament inaugurated its new  
home in the imposing, renovated Reichstag: A cause for celebration 
in Berlin, it marked the beginning of the end for Bonn as a 
political center. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonn residents are doing their best to cope, fighting for  
businesses and international organizations to set up shop. But a 
United Nations center for bat research really can't compete with 
the thousands of politicians, foreign diplomats and lobbyists who 
kept the town of 300,000 on the map for the past 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	By fall, they will be gone, when the government takes up regular  
business in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Symbolizing the void in Bonn is the legislature's old quarters,  
a low, boxy structure whose glassy, 1990s remodeling makes it look 
more like an insurance headquarters. Plans to turn it into a 
conference center are on hold because of financing wrangles, so the 
building may wind up empty for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	What hurts more than any economic loss, though, is the lost  
prestige for a place otherwise best known as Ludwig van Beethoven's 
birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``Filling the real estate is about the least of our problems,''  
city spokesman Werner D'Hein said. For instance, the 1970s-vintage 
chancellery -- Germany's version of the White House -- will be taken 
over by development aid bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Bonn is getting a golden handshake from the government.  
More than half the 22,000 federal jobs are staying in the city 
under a complex arrangement that splits many ministries between 
Bonn and Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	A hefty $1.5 billion in aid for projects such as a new postal  
service high-rise has further sweetened the farewell. German 
telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom also has set up 
headquarters here. 
</P>
<P>
	In its new role, a more modern Bonn also hopes to shake an  
unflattering Cold War image famously summed up by spy novelist John 
LeCarre. Once a young diplomat at the British Embassy in Bonn in 
the 1960s, LeCarre later immortalized the city in ``A Small Town in 
Germany'' as dank and dreary -- ``an unnatural capital village.''

<HEADLINE> 103rd Boston Marathon Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The second largest field in Boston Marathon  
history began the race under sunny skies today as defending 
champion Moses Tanui tried to extend Kenya's streak to nine 
consecutive men's victories. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's division, two-time defending champion Fatuma Roba  
of Ethiopia tried to become the second three-time winner, a feat 
accomplished from 1994 through 1996 by Uta Pippig of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	As the race began at noon in Hopkinton, 26.2 miles west of the  
finish line in downtown Boston, the sky was bright, the air was dry 
and the temperature was 60 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	And the field of 12,797 official runners was exceeded only by  
the 38,708 entered in the Boston Marathon's centennial race in 
1996. Last year's field of 11,499 is now the third biggest. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of $525,000 in prize money, not counting bonuses for  
record performances, included $80,000 each for the men's and 
women's winners. 
</P>
<P>
	While Kenyans were expected to dominate the men's race, Bill  
Rodgers shared the spotlight. The 51-year-old Rodgers, four-time 
winner of both the Boston and New York City marathons, was shooting 
for the over-50 course record by an American of 2 hours, 31 
minutes, 34 seconds set in 1983 by Norm Green. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodgers, who lives in Sherborn, Mass., wasn't the only area  
runner attracting attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Jennings of Newmarket, N.H., made her official marathon  
debut at the age of 38. She ran in Boston when she was 17 but 
didn't meet the minimum age requirement. Since then, she developed 
into one of the world's top distance runners and won three straight 
world cross-country champions from 1990 through 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Former world-record holder Ingrid Kristiansen of Norway, who won  
the Boston race in 1986 and 1989, also was in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wheelchair division, which began 15 minutes before the  
men's and women's races, another sprint to the finish was possible. 
Last year, Louise Sauvage of Australia edged seven-time winner Jean 
Driscoll of Champaign, Ill., although both were timed in 1:41:19. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanui, who won in 1996 and 1998, was seeking to become the  
seventh three-time men's winner despite a strong field dominated by 
Kenyans. His main competition could come from countryman Joseph 
Chebet, last year's runner-up who finished three seconds behind, 
the fourth closest finish in the race's history. Chebet also was 
the runner-up in the last two New York City marathons. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 race was the first in which three men finished the  
course in less than 2:08. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the top women's contenders besides Roba, the 1996 Olympic  
champion, were the last three New York winners -- Italy's Franca 
Fiacconi, Romania's Anuta Catuna and Switzerland's Franziska 
Rochat-Moser.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets surged Monday, with  
the key index in Hong Kong closing at its highest level in almost 
18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucking the trend was the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where prices  
slipped on jitters about earnings prospects of high-technology 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 276.14 points,  
or 2.2 percent, to 12,766.44, it highest close since Oct. 21, 1997. 
On Friday, the index had soared 528.07 points, or 4.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said foreign investors were continuing to buy blue chips  
on mounting optimism about the economic outlook for Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The index broke through the psychological important 13,000-point  
barrier before retreating in the afternoon session on selective 
profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Foreign funds were flooding into Asia,'' said Kingsway SW  
Securities Ltd.'s analyst Patrick Yiu. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian shares also soared on a continued flow of foreign  
funds into the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index rose 6 percent, or  
28.615 points, to close at 508.147. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Philippines, a series of measures implemented by the  
central bank to encourage bank lending propelled the main index 
Monday to its highest level in 20 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-company Philippine Stocks Exchange Index surged 122.34  
points, or 5.5 percent, to 2355.98, The index's latest close is its 
highest level since it reached 2,300.82 points on Aug. 26, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippine central bank's cut in its key overnight rates  
Monday and the 1 percentage-point cut in the minimum liquidity 
reserve requirement of commercial banks Friday freed up billions of 
pesos in the financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean shares also closed sharply higher as investors  
bought blue-chip stocks on news of the restructuring of the 
country's biggest conglomerates. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said Daewoo Group's plans to announce its restructuring  
program, including the sale of some of its operations, boosted the 
market. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 41.45 points, or 
5.7 percent, to 766.59. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 177.37  
points, or 1.05 percent, to close the day at 16,674.21. On Friday, 
the index gained 124.50 points, or 0.74 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The poor performance Friday in America's Nasdaq index, which  
includes many high-technology shares, triggered selling of Japanese 
hi-tech issues on Monday. The Nasdaq closed down 4.20 percent on 
the week Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese precision machinery and electronic share prices have  
languished since U.S.-based companies Compaq and Intel warned last 
week that their earnings may not be as strong as expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar bought 118.16 yen, down 0.06 from  
late Friday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 118.02 
yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed sharply higher on huge liquidity  
inflows, traders said. The Straits Times Index rose 4.1 percent, or 
72.39 points, to close at 1,842.31. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed higher as investors'  
sentiment on the region's financial markets turned positive. The 
benchmark Composite Index closed at 615.42 points, up 16.01 points, 
or 2.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares closed higher, with the key index  
rising to another all-time high following strong gains in the 
resources and media sectors. The All Ordinaries Index rose 13.3 
points, or 0.4 percent, to 3113.1, eclipsing the previous all-time

<P>
	That's because Hauter is following his dream of driving across  
America -- alone. At 10 mph. On a Yard-Man Tractor lawnmower 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bank Reporting Law Comes Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Flush with their success in forcing regulators  
to drop proposed rules on tracking bank customers' habits, civil 
libertarians and other groups are organizing a big e-mail campaign 
to end reporting requirements for cash transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement authorities, in response, are warning against  
any weakening of the Bank Secrecy Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Justice and Treasury departments and the U.S.  
Customs Service are expected to tell Congress Tuesday that the 1974 
law is an essential tool for detecting and prosecuting money 
launderers and drug traffickers. They are scheduled to testify at a 
hearing of the House Banking subcommittees on oversight and 
financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the Customs Service says it used about 80  
suspicious activity reports filed by banks under the law to 
identify bank accounts of money launderers targeted in Operation 
Casablanca. That enabled Customs agents to locate suspects' assets 
that were seized and forfeited in the 1998 operation, which was the 
biggest drug money-laundering case in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	Far-reaching legislation pushed by Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, would  
repeal the Bank Secrecy Act, which requires banks to report 
customers' cash transactions of $10,000 or more, as well as 
suspicious activities, to law enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The law is designed to combat money laundering techniques used  
by drug traffickers and other criminals to hide illegal profits. 
</P>
<P>
	But Paul maintains it violates the Fourth Amendment prohibition  
against unreasonable search and seizure and that at any rate, it 
has failed to help catch drug dealers, who he says ``are smarter 
than most bankers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Libertarian Party, the American Civil Liberties Union,  
privacy advocacy associations and other groups are mobilizing to 
generate support for Paul's bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will try to inundate Congress with another torrent of  
e-mails,'' Libertarian Party spokesman George Getz said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Getz was referring to the earlier blitz of some 225,000 e-mail  
messages and letters, nearly all in opposition, received by the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. on proposed anti-money laundering 
rules that would have tracked the transaction patterns of bank 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowing to the public outcry over privacy, the FDIC and three  
other federal banking agencies scrapped the proposal last month. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Getz said, the Libertarians want people to contact  
their member of Congress, since the Bank Secrecy Act already is law 
and there is no request for public comment from the banking 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a bigger gun this time,'' he said, explaining that  
the group can draw on the people who earlier protested the 
so-called ``Know Your Customer'' rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory Nojeim, legislative counsel for the ACLU, said the group  
recently started a ``Know Your Banker'' campaign on its Web site to 
help consumers understand banks' current monitoring practices and 
encourage competition among banks based on their privacy policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislative prospects for Paul's bill appear dim, as they do for  
a companion measure he proposed that would let people see the files 
on them created by the federal Financial Crimes Enforcement 
Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., chairwoman of the financial  
institutions subcommittee, said Monday she does not want the Bank 
Secrecy Act repealed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to deal with the real world of money laundering, and  
the Bank Secrecy Act has helped (law enforcement) do an excellent 
job,'' Roukema said in a telephone interview. She said she may seek 
changes in the law to improve law enforcement's ability to fight 
money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Monday, Paul had found only two co-sponsors for his bill,  
Reps. John Thune, R-S.D., and Bob Schaffer, R-Colo. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Fatuma, Ndereba Take Maraton Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Two-time defending champion Fatuma Roba of  
Ethiopia and first-time marathoner Catherine Ndereba of Kenya took 
the lead today just past the midpoint of the Boston Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	They passed China's Sun Yingjie, a 20-yer-old who barely moves  
her arms when she runs and set a blistering early pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the men, 14 lead runners were packed halfway through the  
race, with Kenya's Kenneth Cheruiyot and Mexico's Isaac Garcia 
timed in 1 hour, 5 minutes, 27 seconds. Six other runners were a 
second behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Franz Nietlispach of Switzerland won his third straight men's  
wheelchair race in an unofficial time of 1:21:36. The only faster 
time in the race's history was 1:21:23 in 1994 by Heinz Frei. It 
was Nietlispach's fourth Boston title, one fewer than Jim Knaub's 
record of five. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's wheelchair race, another sprint to the finish was  
possible between Louise Sauvage of Australia and seven-time winner 
Jean Driscoll of Champaign, Ill. Sauvage won last year, although 
both were timed in 1:41:19. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid sunshine and temperatures around 60 degrees, Sun ran away  
from the other women early on. Her time after eight miles was 
42:06, nearly a minute faster than the course record for that 
distance. That pace, though, proved too much. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lead at the midpoint dropped to seven seconds over Roba and  
Ndereba and she continued to fade as a two-woman race developed. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's race, Kenyans were shooting for their ninth  
straight Boston Marathon win, with Moses Tanui was going for his 
second straight and third in four years. He was near the back of 
the lead pack. 
</P>
<P>
	As the race began at noon in Hopkinton, west of the finish line  
in downtown Boston, the sky was bright and the air was dry. 
</P>
<P>
	And the field of 12,797 official runners was exceeded only by  
the 38,708 entered in the Boston Marathon's centennial race in 
1996. Last year's field of 11,499 is now the third biggest. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of $525,000 in prize money, not counting bonuses for  
record performances, included $80,000 each for the men's and 
women's winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Rodgers shared the spotlight with the dominant Kenyan men.  
Rodgers, four-time winner of both the Boston and New York City 
marathons, is 51 and was shooting for the over-50 course record by 
an American of 2 hours, 31 minutes, 34 seconds set in 1983 by Norm 
Green. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodgers, who lives in Sherborn, wasn't the only area runner  
attracting attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Jennings of Newmarket, N.H., made her official marathon  
debut at 38. She ran in Boston when she was 17 but didn't meet the 
minimum-age requirement. Since then, she developed into one of the 
world's top distance runners and won three straight world 
cross-country champions from 1990-92. 
</P>
<P>
	Former world-record holder Ingrid Kristiansen of Norway, who won  
the Boston race in 1986 and 1989, also was in the field.

<HEADLINE> Bank Says Asian Economies on Mend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Southeast Asia's embattled economies  
are expected to start mending this year, although the recovery will 
depend on the impact of reforms and the mood of world financial 
markets, the Asian Development Bank said today in its annual 
forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the region's more developed countries, the Philippines and  
Malaysia are the most likely to grow in 1999, although at modest 
rates, the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia will continue to have the group's most uncertain  
prospects as its economy attempts to fight back from the ``verge of 
total collapse,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	For all developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region, the  
bank's forecast growth will rise to 4.4 percent this year, compared 
with 2.6 percent in 1998. For 2000, the region's gross domestic 
product is predicted to grow by 5.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the slump in Asian growth that began with the 1997  
currency crisis turned into one of the worst economic performances 
in recent history, particularly for the richer developing countries 
in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank said the outlook for China was positive in 1999, with  
continued growth of about 7 percent likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``The combination of large reserves and stringent restrictions  
on foreign capital movements means that China is unlikely to face a 
financial panic of the kind that struck so many of its neighbors,'' 
it said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 10 countries in Southeast Asia, growth of 0.8 percent is  
forecast in 1999 after the region's GDP contracted 6.9 percent last 
year, ``under-performing even the most pessimistic expectations,'' 
the bank noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia and Thailand are expected to perform the worst among  
Southeast Asia's more developed economies, with zero growth 
forecast for both countries after their GDPs contracted by 13.7 
percent and 8 percent respectively in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Restructuring East Asia's banking systems, whose weakness  
contributed heavily to the region's vulnerability, will be a top 
priority in 1999, the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	It expressed concern about the region's banking system, marked  
by a sharp increase in bad loans and bank failures, even though 
many countries have instituted ``significant'' financial reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	In many countries, it said, monetary officials have faced a  
dilemma resulting from Asia's currency crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Defending the currency required maintaining relatively high  
interest rates, but that worsened the financial condition of banks 
and firms,'' the report said.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Contractors Case Re-Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today told a federal appeals  
court to restudy a dispute over California's procedures for 
withholding payment from public-project contractors who do not pay 
their employees the required wage rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, in a brief order, set aside a ruling by the 9th  
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that had been appealed by state 
officials who say they need not provide a hearing to contractors 
from whom money is withheld. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court was told to reconsider the case in light of  
the justices' decision last month that said insurers of states' 
worker compensation systems cannot be sued for withholding 
health-care benefits while deciding if treatment for work-related 
injuries is reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
	California law requires contractors and subcontractors to pay  
the local prevailing wage to all employees involved in public works 
projects. If the contractor does not, the state can withhold the 
amount the workers were underpaid and impose a fine. 
</P>
<P>
	No hearing is provided, but a contractor can try to recover  
withheld funds by filing a breach-of-contract lawsuit against the 
state. Subcontractors cannot file such lawsuits unless the main 
contractor assigns them the right to sue. 
</P>
<P>
	G&AMP;G Fire Sprinklers sued state officials in 1995 after the state  
withheld more than $120,000 for its alleged failure to pay 
prevailing wages on three projects in which G&AMP;G was a 
subcontractor. 
</P>
<P>
	G&AMP;G did not file a breach-of-contract lawsuit in state court.  
Instead, it went to federal court and argued that the state 
violated its due-process rights by withholding the money without 
providing a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge agreed and struck down the state procedure as  
unconstitutional. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals narrowed 
the judge's order and required the state to provide a hearing 
either before or after withholding the funds. 
</P>
<P>
	After that decision, the state established rules to allow a  
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, the state's lawyers said the 9th  
Circuit court's ruling improperly would let contractors file a 
variety of claims alleging state procedures violated their property 
rights. A state breach-of-contract claim is sufficient to protect a 
contractor's rights, the appeal contended. 
</P>
<P>
	G&AMP;G's lawyers said the case was not a contract dispute but a  
challenge to the state's regulatory power. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Bradshaw vs. G&AMP;G Fire Sprinklers, 98-1204.

<HEADLINE>  Gretzky Calls Hockey 'a Hard Game' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky left hockey the way he came in:  
head held high and the right side of his jersey still tucked into 
the corner of his pants. 
</P>
<P>
	That bit of tailoring was a habit born of necessity, the only  
way a scrawny kid routinely playing in leagues against kids four 
and five years older could keep the too-big jerseys he always wore 
from getting in his way. 
</P>
<P>
	What changed between then and now is that when Gretzky stepped  
off the rink Sunday, Gretzky was four and five years older than 
anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only am I mentally ready to retire, I'm physically ready  
to retire, too. This is a great game,'' he said, ``but it's a hard 
game, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody said goodbye in their own way.  
</P>
<P>
	Six-year-old Trevor Gretzky skipped his Little League game to  
see the old man off after all. Michael Jordan called during 
breakfast. People rushing to Madison Square Garden in Rangers 
jerseys with ``99'' stitched on the back crossed against the light 
in Times Square without getting run down. 
</P>
<P>
	For one afternoon at least, the game with a tough reputation and  
the town with an even tougher one were awash in sentimentality. 
</P>
<P>
	National Hockey League commissioner Gary Bettman retired his  
number. Teammates gave him a large-screen TV. The Rangers gave him 
a Mercedes-Benz. The P.A. system played every mushy song ever 
recorded. The crowd of 18,200 stood as one nearly every time the 
puck turned up on the blade of his stick. 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody came bearing gifts for The Great One it seemed, except  
the Pittsburgh Penguins. And even the villains in the 1,487th and 
final game of Gretzky's career were helpless to stop him from 
picking up assist No. 1,963 on a nifty forehand pass that led to 
the Rangers' only goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins did win a measure of revenge -- and a place in the  
trivia trove of hockey -- with a 2-1 victory on a goal by Jaromir 
Jagr in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jagr said to me he didn't mean to do it,'' Gretzky said  
afterward. ``That's what I used to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even that couldn't take the luster off his day.  
</P>
<P>
	The puck had barely rippled the chords of the Rangers' net when  
Jagr, heir apparent to Gretzky's crown as the best in the game, led 
his teammates in forming a receiving line to shake The Great One's 
hand. Countless hugs, three curtain calls and several tearful laps 
of the arena later, Gretzky was gone, though a final set of 
fingerprints lingered. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game the Rangers painted ``99'' on the ice between  
the nets and the backboards on both ends to recognize the space 
Gretzky called his ``office'' -- the place where he dished out 
literally hundreds of assists. Earlier, on his third shift of the 
opening period, he set up shop there and two Penguins, defenseman 
Kevin Hatcher and right wing Alexei Kovalev, materialized on either 
side of the net, hoping to hem Gretzky in. 
</P>
<P>
	He began stickhandling, shifting the puck from backhand to  
forehand, keeping it tantalizingly out of the reach of both 
players. Neither dared lunge at him, maybe because they had seen 
the same replays everyone else had hundreds of times: Gretzky 
threading a lethal pass through the narrowest of openings; Gretzky 
delicately flipping the puck over the net, off the back of the 
goalkeeper, and into the net; Gretzky spotting an onrushing 
teammate and caroming the puck off the corner boards, the way a 
pool hustler might. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins, as it turned out, dodged the bullet that time and  
on another dozen opportunities like it. Gretzky kept setting up 
teammates; they kept failing to finish. But every time he did so 
was one more reminder that the game really does slow down for the 
great ones, that they know not just where everything would happen, 
but where it would happen next. 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing that surprised Gretzky all afternoon happened  
with 30 seconds left in the game. John Muckler, the Ranger coach 
who had been an assistant when Gretzky broke in with the Edmonton 
Oilers some 15 years ago, called a timeout with the score tied 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``John's got a daughter that's about to give birth in Edmonton  
... and he said, `I've got to tell you something. I just had a 
grandson today. And now you got to get the winner,''' Gretzky 
recalled. ``And maybe when I was younger, I might have got it for 
him. I didn't today, so maybe that's why it's the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the right time, but not because of that.  
</P>
<P>
	It was right because Gretzky walked into the Garden this morning  
accompanied by the father who taught him the responsibility that 
came with having a gift, and he walked out hours later with his 
wife, his daughter and two sons of his own, old enough now to 
understand that their father had been equal to the task.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy To Sell Bottled Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- As a pitchman for bottled water,  
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. makes a pretty good environmental lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, a defender of New York City's reservoirs, is launching  
a bottled water called Keeper Springs Mountain Spring Water. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea, Kennedy says, is to capture some of the $4 billion now  
spent annually on bottled water and channel the money into 
preserving public water supplies. Keeper Springs goes on sale today 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy is taking no salary and all profits are to go to  
clean-water campaigns. He said he's so adamant about his campaign 
that he won't drink Keeper Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing that could happen to our company is to put us  
out of business,'' Kennedy said. ``That's what our aim is, to put 
ourselves out of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy said that people who drink bottled water are turning  
their back on a public water supply. ``I drink tap water,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Oldest Business Magazine To Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nation's Business, the country's oldest  
business magazine, will cease publication after the June issue, the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The chamber, which has put out the magazine since 1912, said in  
recent years the publication has been losing $3 million annually. 
The shutdown will result in elimination of 29 jobs in the 
Washington area and a number of sales positions around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Donohue, president of the Chamber of Commerce, said  
closing the publication will allow the chamber to devote more 
resources to its Wide World Web site to enable quicker 
communication with members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Expanding our online communications will enable us to more  
effectively serve, inform and rally the 3 million businesses that 
make up the chamber federation,'' Donohue said. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Secular Tensions Looming in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Divisions between religious and secular Jews  
are looming large in Israel's election campaign, with each side 
proclaiming nightmare visions of the life sought by the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultra-Orthodox Jews fear the secular majority will turn Israel  
into a spiritual wasteland of Western decadence. Their secular foes 
predict they'll soon be ruled by the ultra-Orthodox. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides are trying to galvanize voters before the May 17  
election with warnings that the other is trying to impose its 
beliefs on the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (the Orthodox) must be stopped,'' is the succinct slogan  
of a secular rights party. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are providing the nation with its soul,'' promises the  
bouncy jingle of an Orthodox party. 
</P>
<P>
	Why the tensions -- a back-burner issue in earlier elections --  
have moved to the forefront depends on who's asked. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orthodox are angry over court rulings rolling back their  
religious monopoly in some areas of civil law. Secular activists 
fear the Orthodox are using their political clout as swing votes in 
governing coalitions to undermine Israel's democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The confrontation is most intense in holy Jerusalem.  
</P>
<P>
	``My capital marches step by step toward Teheran,'' said Ornan  
Yekutieli, a Jerusalem city council member and secular rights 
activist who once ran a notorious campaign depicting the 
ultra-Orthodox as black dots overwhelming the city map. 
</P>
<P>
	Years ago, street brawls over mixed-sex swimming pools,  
miniskirts and moviegoing were seen as belonging uniquely to 
Israel's capital. Now, the fight has spread across the land. 
</P>
<P>
	Yekutieli campaigns nationwide against ultra-Orthodox schools  
that offer longer hours and free meals to tempt secular parents -- 
and, he charges, hook kids with anti-Western indoctrination. 
</P>
<P>
	``In five years, ultra-Orthodox concepts will rule Jerusalem and  
Israel will follow -- if we don't act now,'' Yekutieli said in the 
cramped city hall offices he shares with ultra-Orthodox council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Rosenblum, an ultra-Orthodox legal activist, said  
Western liberalism is driving secular parents to schools run by 
``Haredim'' -- a word suggesting ``tremblers before God'' that the 
ultra-Orthodox use to describe themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited a litany of vices he identifies with secular Israel:  
drugs, prostitution, juvenile delinquency. ``When I walked through 
Jerusalem on the Sabbath 20 years ago, it was empty, quiet,'' he 
lamented. ``Now it's hopping'' with discos and bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Each side's argument contains a kernel of truth.  
</P>
<P>
	With about 17 percent of Israel's 5 million Jews describing  
themselves as religious, religious parties won an unprecedented 23 
seats in the 120-member parliament, the Knesset, in the 1996 
election. Orthodox lawmakers provide the votes that keep the 
governing coalition in power and were given control of powerful 
parliamentary committees and government ministries. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side, a series of Supreme Court rulings rolled back  
political arrangements that guaranteed draft exemptions for 
rabbinical students and an Orthodox monopoly in matters of 
conversion, burial and funds for synagogues. 
</P>
<P>
	Another reason for the emergence of secular-religious tensions  
is vacuum in political ideas created by broad acceptance of the 
principle of ceding territory for peace with the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inevitably, what you now see is a move ... back to the  
internal debates'' over Jewish and Israeli identity, said David 
Rosen, the Israel representative of the U.S.-based Anti-Defamation 
League. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists on either side dismiss talk of natural political  
processes and instead look for conspiracies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Haredim accuse the secular elites of trying to keep them in  
their place. ``We don't trust the state,'' said Itzik Luben, a 
Jerusalem seminary student. ``The state is insane. It's too 
strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Arieh Deri, the leader of the religious-oriented Shas Party  
and the country's most prominent Haredi lawmaker, was convicted 
March 17 of taking bribes and peddling influence, his defenders 
charged the court was interfering in the election. 
</P>
<P>
	A Haredi demonstration against Supreme Court decisions drew  
200,000; a secular counter-demonstration attracted 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Some secular activists go on blitzkrieg operations, tossing  
piles of pamphlets questioning God's existence into rabbinical 
seminaries -- then racing back to their cars, motors running. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Party, always secular but once careful not to alienate  
possible coalition partners among the religious, now sees such 
alliances as hopeless. The party's leader, Ehud Barak, calls the 
Haredim ``extremist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone has given up on dialogue. There has been a  
flourishing of secular-religious discussion groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, the first missile from Saddam and everyone will  
love everyone else,'' said Rachel Levy, a religious kindergarten 
teacher who attends weekly discussions at a Tel Aviv pub. 
</P>
<P>
	A few tables down, secular businessman Moshe Elron was not so  
sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``My problem is not with the people here, who want to talk,'' he  
said after an evening of amiable chat with a religious youth. 
``It's with the people who don't.''

<HEADLINE> WTO OKs Sanctions in Banana Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The European Union promised to change its banana  
import policies after the World Trade Organization approved tough 
U.S. sanctions against European products on Monday, a victory for 
Washington in the long-running trade dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States claims the EU discriminates unfairly against  
bananas imported from U.S. multinational companies in Latin America 
and favors those from former European colonies in the Caribbean and 
Africa. The WTO had already ruled the EU policies illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Washington has announced a package of sanctions  
worth $191.4 million a year imposing tariffs of up to 100 percent 
on a list of products, effectively doubling the price of some 
items. 
</P>
<P>
	Products affected include French handbags, German coffee-makers,  
bed linens, cardboard packing material and felt paper. 
</P>
<P>
	After a WTO expert panel approved the sanctions, EU trade  
ambassador Roderick Abbott said the EU would change its licenses 
and quotas to comply with WTO rules. It may take until next year to 
put the changes through. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have expressed our intention to comply fully,'' Abbott  
said. ``That is not to say it is going to be easy, because we are 
consulting with people whose interests are diametrically opposed to 
each other, but at any rate we will try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Changes in the EU regulations have to be approved by all 15  
member states. Abbott said any changes would probably not come 
before January and could even be delayed till autumn by upcoming 
European elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very much in hopes that the retaliation can end and  
will end very quickly,'' U.S. trade ambassador Rita Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States said Monday that it would make the sanctions  
retroactive to March 3, the date on which it started forcing 
importers to post a bond for the proposed tariffs. The arbitration 
panel was supposed to report back on that date, but missed its 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	EU members and many other WTO countries argue that sanctions can  
only start from the day of WTO approval, Abbott said. The EU will 
seek consultations with the United States over the issue, he said.

</P>
<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- Donna Cottier, a former reporter for several  
Ohio newspapers, died Friday. She was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cottier wrote about events in Maumee, Perrysburg and other  
southern Lucas County communities for 35 years. She joined the 
staff of the Maumee Valley News, a weekly newspaper, in 1951, and

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Mary Lutyens, a prolific novelist, biographer,  
magazine writer and editor whose career spanned more than six 
decades, died April 9. She was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she wrote 13 novels and excelled as an editor, she was  
most acclaimed for her biographies, including writings about her 
father -- the well-known architect Sir Edwin Lutyens -- her parents' 
unhappy marriage and her grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
	She also wrote a biographical series on the Indian religious  
teacher Krishnamurti, who was a spiritual adviser to her mother, 
and about art critic and social theorist John Ruskin and his wife, 
Effie.

</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Don McGuire, a screenwriter, actor and  
director who penned ``Bad Day at Black Rock'' and co-created the 
story of ``Tootsie,'' died Tuesday. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Working in the movie industry since the mid-1940s, McGuire won  
Screenwriters Guild awards for ``Bad Day,'' which starred Spencer 
Tracy as a mysterious stranger in a desert town, and the 
cross-dressing comedy, ``Tootsie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGuire also directed Frank Sinatra to a breakthrough role in  
the western ``Johnny Concho,'' which portrayed the cool crooner as 
a coward struggling to build courage for a gun fight. 
</P>
<P>
	As an actor, McGuire was Red Skelton's straight man in ``The  
Fuller-Brush Man'' and appeared in several other movies in the

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Character actor Albert ``Poppy'' Popwell, who  
played various thugs in Clint Eastwood's ``Dirty Harry'' films, 
died April 9 of complications from open-heart surgery. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Popwell appeared as heavies in ``Dirty Harry'' and its sequels  
``Magnum Force'' and ``The Enforcer'' before graduating to a police 
detective in the series' fourth installment ``Sudden Impact.'' 
</P>

character and challenged him to ``Go ahead, make my day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Popwell's career in entertainment spanned six decades on the  
stage and in film. The New York City native grew up during the 
Harlem Renaissance and danced in Broadway shows as a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	Popwell also had roles in the films ``Cleopatra Jones,''  
``Coogan's Bluff'' and ``The Buddy Holly Story.'' He made 
appearances on such TV series as ``The A-Team,'' ``Wonder Woman,''

                            *Rege Cordic    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rege Cordic, a popular Pittsburgh radio show  
host, died Friday of brain cancer and related complications. He was 
72. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, his ``Cordic &AMP; Co.'' show commanded 85 percent of  
Pittsburgh's radio audience. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1943 while still a high school student, Cordic  
persuaded radio host Davy Tyson to let him go on the air at WWSW. 
Cordic became the show's junior announcer and took over for Tyson 
when he went to another station. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordic moved to KDKA in 1954, bringing a cast of characters such  
as the wealthy Baldwin McMoney, punster Carmen Monoxide and Louie 
the Garbage Man. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordic's popularity never caught on in Los Angeles, where his  
show lasted just two years. He became a prolific network TV 
announcer and appeared in such movies as Woody Allen's ``Sleeper'' 
and Brian De Palma's ``Obsession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, a sister, and four children.

<P>
                           *Alan T. Sagal    	
</P>
<P>
	COLLINSVILLE, Conn. (AP) -- Alan T. Sagal, a former reporter for  
radio station WTIC and a spokesman for the AAA, Automobile Club of 
Hartford, died Friday of pancreatic cancer. He was 57. 
</P>
<P>
	Sagal began his career in Connecticut radio at WSTC in Stamford.  
</P>
<P>
	He worked at WICC in Bridgeport and as public information  
officer for the state Department of Health Services before joining 
WTIC in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, Sagal became manager of public and government affairs  
for the Automobile Club of Greater Hartford. He continued his radio 
presence by reporting state weekend events on AM radio station 
WDRC. 
</P>
<P>
	His series ``Traveling in Connecticut,'' which aired Saturdays  
on WTIC, and his AAA feature articles, ``Touring Connecticut,'' won 
numerous awards and led to his appointment to the Connecticut 
Tourism Council by Gov. Lowell Weicker Jr. in 1991.

                          *Eddie Saunders    	
</P>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Eddie Saunders, a onetime hotel bellboy  
and street performer who broke the color barrier in Columbus radio 
and television, died Saturday on his 90th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders was best known for his radio program ``Sermons and  
Songs'', which began its Sunday run on WVKO-AM in 1948. The show 
was on the air until 1995, when failing health forced Saunders to 
end the program's long run. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders also became a TV pioneer through a weekly show on  
WTVN-TV, now WSYX, beginning in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	James ``Eddie'' Saunders was born April 17, 1909, in Virginia.  
During the Depression years he searched for work, singing and 
dancing on street corners for tips. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon his arrival in Columbus during the World War II years, the  
city ``was one of the most segregated'' in the United States, 
Saunders recalled in a 1994 interview. 
</P>
<P>
	During the weekly ``Sermons and Songs,'' Saunders would chat  
with callers, take song requests and relate words of wisdom. 

</P>
<P>
                            *Skip Spence    	
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Skip Spence, an original member of the rock  
band Jefferson Airplane, died Friday of lung cancer. He was 52. 
</P>
<P>
	Spence's death came weeks before the release of ``More Oar,'' a  
CD tribute to Spence including songs by Beck, Robert Plant, Tom 
Waits and members of R.E.M. The recording was inspired by ``Oar,'' 
Spence's unique, folk-psychedelic solo album from 1969, which will 
soon be reissued. 
</P>
<P>
	Spence had long battled schizophrenia and alcoholism. He had  
been on a ventilator since entering the hospital April 5.

                           *Bill Wendell    	
</P>
<P>
	BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- Bill Wendell, the veteran radio and  
television announcer perhaps best known for his ``Late Night'' 
introduction of ``Da-a-avid Letterman!'' died Wednesday of 
complications from cancer. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	The native New Yorker and World War II Army veteran began his  
radio career in the late 1940s and played sidekick to stars such as 
Jack Benny, Bob Hope and Ernie Kovacs. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendell joined the DuMont television network in the early 1950s.  
His television career included a 1969-1978 stint with Garry Moore 
on a syndicated version of ``To Tell the Truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wendell was perhaps best known for his role on ``Late Night With  
David Letterman,'' where he announced the lineup of guests and the 
opening joke that was part of the distinctive introduction of 
Letterman's name. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendell stayed with Letterman when the comedian moved to CBS in  
1993, but retired from the program in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Criticize Government Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Farmers fearing that big business  
was squeezing out small producers criticized government policies 
during a rare meeting with two federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of farmers who came from as far away as Texas joined a  
rally Sunday billed as the ``Midwest Farm Price Crisis Forum.'' The 
event was organized by Democratic Sens. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota 
and Tom Harkin of Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Klein, an assistant attorney general who directs the U.S.  
Justice Department's antitrust division, and Mike Dunn, who 
oversees the U.S. Agriculture Department's Grain Inspection, 
Packers and Stockyards, flew in from Washington for the rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein and Dunn heard from farmers who are concerned about low  
commodity prices and a lack of control in swiftly consolidating 
agricultural industries such as meatpacking, grain-processing and 
farm supply. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going out of business because livestock markets aren't  
functioning anymore and you're not doing anything about it,'' said 
farmer Linus Solberg of Cylinder, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The farmers handed Klein and Dunn a seven-point action list.  
Topping the list was a requirement that meatpackers report to the 
USDA what they pay farmers, and to share that information with the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	According to USDA figures, as of 1997 the four largest packing  
companies accounted for 80 percent of cattle slaughter, 54 percent 
of hog slaughter and 70 percent of sheep slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Market shares of the four largest grain exporting companies  
ranged from 47 percent for wheat to almost 70 percent for corn in 
1997, according to the USDA. 
</P>
<P>
	Both federal officials asked the crowd for patience. ``I want to  
be straight with you, and I want to listen,'' Klein said. ``I know 
you want action ... but I've got to know the facts. And when we 
have the facts, we are not afraid to act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and Dunn spent much of the afternoon taking notes as farmers  
took turns speaking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, USDA, I don't want to pick on you too much, but it  
wouldn't even be fair to say you stood by as an agency and let this 
happen,'' said Rhonda Perry, a farmer from Howard County, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Millions of taxpayer dollars were used to help finance this  
concentration in the form of corporate welfare, in the form of 
guaranteed loans to hog factories,'' Perry said. ``It's no surprise 
to the people in this audience. It's only a surprise, apparently, 
to the people in this administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unease about market concentration has intensified since Cargill  
Inc. of Minneapolis, the nation's largest grain company, announced 
plans to buy the worldwide operations of second-ranked Continental 
Grain Co. The Justice Department is reviewing the proposed merger.

<HEADLINE> Court Battle Looms in Lottery Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- Tonda Dickerson gave her Waffle House  
customers plenty of coffee refills, and one of them rewarded her 
with a Florida lottery ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	Not a bad tip. It turned out to be worth $10 million.  
</P>
<P>
	But then she turned in her apron without sharing the jackpot  
with four co-workers who also got lottery tickets as tips. The four 
sued her and claimed she had ignored their agreement to divide any 
winnings equally -- meaning $2 million for each. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dickerson, 28, said there had been no such deal. She then  
turned down a settlement offer that would have given her $3 million 
and let the other four split the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	So instead of moving from her mobile home on Monday, the former  
waitress was in court. Her Waffle House co-workers testified there 
was a share-the-wealth plan and that in conversations around the 
hot grill they often discussed how they would spend the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was always stated that if we hit, we split,'' one of the  
four co-workers, Matthew Adams, told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobile County Circuit Judge Robert Kendall said the jury's  
verdict, expected Tuesday, will be an advisory one. The judge will 
make the final decision on whether the money must be divided. 
Florida officials are holding the money in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters in Alabama will decide this year whether the state should  
have a lottery. In the meantime, lottery dealers in Florida do a 
brisk business with Alabama customers like Edward Seward Jr., the 
Waffle House customer from Bayou La Batre who gave away the lottery 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Seward ate breakfast daily with family members at the Waffle  
House in Grand Bay, on the Alabama coast. On March 7, he handed out 
tickets to five servers -- Mrs. Dickerson, Adams, Sandra Deno, 
Angela Tisdale and Jackie Fairley. 
</P>
<P>
	Seward, 41, is a former restaurant manager who is partially  
paralyzed on his right side from a stroke. He has said he only 
wanted a new truck out of the lottery winnings and expected the 
restaurant employees to share any winnings. He declined requests 
for interviews and sat huddled with relatives in court on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The co-workers' attorney, Steve Clements, said the case was  
about telling the truth and the ``corrupting influence of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dickerson's lawyer, Dwight Reid, accused the co-workers of  
cooking up a ``nefarious scheme'' to claim part of the money. 
Besides, he said, there was no written contract to divide the 
money, and he said Alabama law requires such a document. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dickerson said she wants to use the lottery money to build  
a new home on her father's six acres of property near the 
Alabama-Mississippi border, where she now lives in a mobile home 
with her husband and 9-year-old son.

<HEADLINE>  Hockey Is a Big Hit in Music City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Charlie Tidwell promised he ``wouldn't  
be caught dead'' at a Nashville Predators game. 
</P>
<P>
	Tidwell's game was golf.  
</P>
<P>
	He didn't know anything about hockey and didn't want to learn.  
The NHL's newest franchise couldn't entice him with a splashy ad 
campaign featuring country music's biggest stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, Tidwell had two season tickets, but those were business  
purchases and he planned to give them all away. Then his son-in-law 
convinced him to go to a game. Tidwell was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
	He bought two more season tickets in December -- for himself and  
his wife. They also purchased matching Predators sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just full of action,'' Tidwell said. ``It's just  
completely fun. ... We're upgrading our seats for next year if we 
can. That's after me saying I wouldn't be caught dead down here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Move over NASCAR. Watch out college basketball and football.  
Music City is becoming a hockey town. 
</P>
<P>
	The Predators concluded their inaugural season as the NHL's  
attendance leader in markets under 2 million people, despite a 
28-47-7 record. They averaged 16,145 a game, and 10 of their 17 
sellouts came after January, when their playoff hopes had dimmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fan support in the stands and Nashville in general has  
been fantastic,'' general manager David Poile said. ``The Nashville 
Arena sort of become the place to be in Nashville. It's been really 
a rewarding experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the NHL granted Nashville a franchise in 1997, the worry  
was the city was ``too Southern'' to embrace such a Northern game. 
The team quickly changed that sentiment with a flashy ad campaign 
and sabre-tooth tiger logo that became popular with fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Once they got people in the door, Predators officials promised  
them they would like what they saw. Each game was a party where 
fans could rub elbows with country stars like Vince Gill and Reba 
McEntire, participate in contests and a listen to a live band. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans who didn't know a two-line pass from a two-step got help  
from the Predators, who held ``Hockey 101'' and ``Predators 
University'' clinics to teach the fans the game. The public address 
announcer explained calls during the games, sometimes in 
excruciatingly basic terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The explanations were so simple some of the Predators players  
thought fans might be offended. Instead, fans appreciated the 
helping hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Captain Tom Fitzgerald has been amazed at how knowledgeable the  
fans have become in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are their team. It's been very overwhelming,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Predators got their foot in the door with fans by using  
country music stars in its ``Got Tickets?'' campaign, which 
featured celebrities like Garth Brooks sporting a blacked-out tooth 
and asking fans, ``Got tickets?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tradeoff has been that many country music stars are hooked  
on hockey, giving the Predators a celebrity cachet usually found in 
Los Angeles or New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Gill has season tickets near the ice. McEntire has her own  
suite. Barbara Mandrell is a regular on the arena's Celebrity Cam 
shots on the Jumbotron along with singers like Mindy McCready and 
Deana Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	McEntire, whose son plays in a children's hockey league, hadn't  
seen an NHL game before the Predators' debut. Now she hates to miss 
a game. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Hockey Is a Big Hit in Music City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Charlie Tidwell promised he ``wouldn't  
be caught dead'' at a Nashville Predators game. 
</P>
<P>
	Tidwell's game was golf.  
</P>
<P>
	He didn't know anything about hockey and didn't want to learn.  
The NHL's newest franchise couldn't entice him with a splashy ad 
campaign featuring country music's biggest stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, Tidwell had two season tickets, but those were business  
purchases and he planned to give them all away. Then his son-in-law 
convinced him to go to a game. Tidwell was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
	He bought two more season tickets in December -- for himself and  
his wife. They also purchased matching Predators sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just full of action,'' Tidwell said. ``It's just  
completely fun. ... We're upgrading our seats for next year if we 
can. That's after me saying I wouldn't be caught dead down here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Move over NASCAR. Watch out college basketball and football.  
Music City is becoming a hockey town. 
</P>
<P>
	The Predators concluded their inaugural season as the NHL's  
attendance leader in markets under 2 million people, despite a 
28-47-7 record. They averaged 16,145 a game, and 10 of their 17 
sellouts came after January, when their playoff hopes had dimmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fan support in the stands and Nashville in general has  
been fantastic,'' general manager David Poile said. ``The Nashville 
Arena sort of become the place to be in Nashville. It's been really 
a rewarding experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the NHL granted Nashville a franchise in 1997, the worry  
was the city was ``too Southern'' to embrace such a Northern game. 
The team quickly changed that sentiment with a flashy ad campaign 
and sabre-tooth tiger logo that became popular with fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Once they got people in the door, Predators officials promised  
them they would like what they saw. Each game was a party where 
fans could rub elbows with country stars like Vince Gill and Reba 
McEntire, participate in contests and a listen to a live band. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans who didn't know a two-line pass from a two-step got help  
from the Predators, who held ``Hockey 101'' and ``Predators 
University'' clinics to teach the fans the game. The public address 
announcer explained calls during the games, sometimes in 
excruciatingly basic terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The explanations were so simple some of the Predators players  
thought fans might be offended. Instead, fans appreciated the 
helping hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Captain Tom Fitzgerald has been amazed at how knowledgeable the  
fans have become in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are their team. It's been very overwhelming,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Predators got their foot in the door with fans by using  
country music stars in its ``Got Tickets?'' campaign, which 
featured celebrities like Garth Brooks sporting a blacked-out tooth 
and asking fans, ``Got tickets?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tradeoff has been that many country music stars are hooked  
on hockey, giving the Predators a celebrity cachet usually found in 
Los Angeles or New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Gill has season tickets near the ice. McEntire has her own  
suite. Barbara Mandrell is a regular on the arena's Celebrity Cam 
shots on the Jumbotron along with singers like Mindy McCready and 
Deana Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	McEntire, whose son plays in a children's hockey league, hadn't  
seen an NHL game before the Predators' debut. Now she hates to miss 
a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I go to as many games as my schedule will allow, which about  
half the games this year. I will attend as many game as possible 
next year and can't wait for the new season,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>

slump as the franchise builds toward the playoffs through draft 
picks rather than aging veterans.

through its growing pains. 
</P>
<P>

and it's been great. I hope I'm around a lot of years to see it 
keep growing.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise on Wall Street Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose Monday as a sharp downturn by  
stocks sent money flowing into the Treasury market. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 7/8 point,  
or $8.75 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, fell to 5.51 percent from late Friday's 5.57 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The gains came amid a sudden reversal in the stock market, where  
a powerful blue-chip rally unraveled, wiping out a 270-point gain 
by the Dow Jones industrial average that would have set a sixth 
straight record high. The Nasdaq composite index slid 5.6 percent 
in the selloff. 
</P>
<P>
	In other bond trading, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
rose between 1/8 point and 11/32 point, while intermediate maturities 
rose 15/32 point to 9/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 4.33 percent as the  
discount rose 0.01 percentage point compared with late Friday to 
4.22 percent. Six-month yields fell to 4.51 percent, while the 
discount fell 0.02 percentage point to 4.35 percent. One-year 
yields fell to 4.63 percent as the discount fell 0.04 percentage 
point from late Friday to 4.42 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.63 percent from late Friday's 4.69 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds held steady at 124 11/32. The average yield 
to maturity was unchanged from late Friday's 5.23 percent.

	Errant Bombs Kill 1 in Puerto Rico  
</P>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A civilian was killed and four  
people were injured Monday when two U.S. Marine jets dropped bombs 
on a lookout post at a remote training ground in Puerto Rico. The 
two F-18 jets based on the USS John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier 
were on a night training run over Vieques, said Roberto Nelson, 
spokesman for Roosevelt Roads Naval Station. The base operates the 
training ground in the U.S. territory. Residents oppose the use of 
live munitions on Vieques, saying the frequent explosions disturb 
fishing grounds and have thwarted the island's efforts to attract 
tourism.

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The fate of tens of thousands was  
uncertain Monday as Yugoslavia closed the main crossing point for 
ethnic Albanian refugees fleeing Kosovo. Refugee traffic from 
Kosovo into Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro slowed to a trickle, 
but it was not immediately clear why the refugee flow was halted. 
The Yugoslav government made no statement on the matter.

<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO showed dramatic aerial footage  
narrated by a U.S. Air Force general to explain how allied planes 
may have hit civilians during an airstrike in southwestern Kosovo. 
Despite Brig. Gen. Dan Leaf's analysis and videotape of exploding 
vehicles, NATO said it may never know exactly what happened in 
raids on convoys last week. The attack has dogged NATO's air 
campaign for five days, but allied warplanes have continued 
airstrikes, striking today a government building in Serbia's 
second-largest city and a television transmitter in Kosovo.

	MIAMI (AP) -- Daylight was transformed to darkness Monday near  
the Everglades as smoke from a fire consumed about 130,000 acres. 
The smoke blanketed south Florida's main east-west highway, 
Interstate 75, and forced authorities to keep about 60 miles of it 
closed. The road, known as Alligator Alley, could be closed for 
days. Meanwhile, in communities east of the fire, about 25 miles 
northwest of Miami, people with asthma, bronchitis and emphysema 
were urged to stay indoors if possible.

	TOKYO (AP) -- A U.S. Marine helicopter crashed into the Pacific  
Ocean during training in southern Japan, killing at least two of 
the four servicemen aboard, the Marine Corps said Tuesday. Japan's 
Marine Safety Agency said a third serviceman was also killed, but 
the Marines said they could not confirm that. No survivors had been 
found by Tuesday morning. The CH-53E helicopter went down in 
northeastern Okinawa on Monday during routine night flight

The court's unanimous decision rejected ApolloMedia Corp.'s 
argument that a portion of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 
threatens free-speech rights. ApolloMedia developed the

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Telecom Italia SpA and Germany's Deutsche Telekom  
AG are nearing a mega-deal that would create a new global 
competitor to U.S. giants such as AT&AMP;T. A Telecom Italia-Deutsche 
Telekom combination would dwarf its competitors in Europe and would 
most likely become the largest merger in history, topping the 
pending $74 billion deal between Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. 
Telecom Italia confirmed late Sunday that it was examining the 
possibility of an industrial alliance with Deutsche Telekom. 
Telecom Italia is known to be seeking a white knight to save it 
from a hostile takeover bid by its smaller Italian rival, Olivetti 
SpA.

Mack was 7-for-11 from 3-point range and finished with 21 points, 
Charles Barkley scored 25 points, Hakeem Olajuwon had 24 and 
Scottie Pippen 22. Houston shot 13-on-27 on 3-pointers. The 
Rockets, who blew a 23-point lead Sunday at San Antonio, built an 
early 16-point advantage before Seattle closed to 105-100 with 3:07 
left. This time, the Rockets didn't fold.

<HEADLINE>  Spacecraft's Main Antenna Stuck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The main communications antenna on  
NASA's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft has become stuck and unable 
to automatically point toward Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	A hinge on the antenna stopped moving late last week and flight  
controllers were unable to solve the problem during the weekend, 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory spokeswoman Mary Hardin said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The antenna can still be used even if the hinge doesn't work.  
But that requires periodically halting the collection of science 
data and turning the entire spacecraft to point the antenna at 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft put itself into a so-called contingency mode when  
the problem occurred, shutting down all science instruments and 
shifting communication with flight controllers to its smaller 
antenna. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometime Monday engineers planned to command Mars Global  
Surveyor to transmit recorded data they hope would reveal what was 
happening on the spacecraft when the hinge stopped moving. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft was launched in November 1996 and has been  
orbiting Mars since September 1997 as part of a mapping mission of 
Earth's neighboring planet. 
</P>
<P>
	The hinge is one of two at the end of a boom on which the main  
antenna is mounted. One allows the antenna to move from side to 
side. The other one, which moves the antenna up and down, is the 
one that became stuck. 
</P>
<P>
	The hinges were designed to allow the antenna to keep pointing  
at Earth during communications sessions while the orbiting 
spacecraft keeps its instruments pointed at Mars to collect a 
continuous stream of images and data for mapping. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers do not believe the problem is related to the March 28  
deployment of the boom because the hinge had functioned properly 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Deployment of the boom from the folded position it had been in  
since the launch was a concern because of worries that a device to 
cushion the force would not work properly.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Quizzes Darryl Strawberry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Major league baseball interrogated troubled New  
York Yankees outfielder Darryl Strawberry for several hours on 
Sunday about his latest arrest, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the questioning by baseball and players union  
officials, Strawberry was also given another drug test, the New 
York Daily News reported today, citing multiple sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Yankees general manager Brian Cashman told the newspaper  
he had no knowledge of Strawberry's meeting with baseball 
officials, the Daily News also reported that the results of a drug 
test taken by Strawberry on Tuesday in Tampa, Fla., was to be made 
available to the team today. 
</P>
<P>
	If Strawberry's drug tests were to come back clean, baseball is  
unlikely to take any action against the outfielder until the 
criminal charges of his arrest are resolved, a source familiar with 
Sunday's hearing told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry intends to plead not guilty to the charges of cocaine  
possession and solicitation for prostitution leveled against him as 
a result of Wednesday night's arrest, according to his Tampa 
attorney, Joseph Ficarrotta. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Strawberry has not been permitted to work out  
at the Yankees' complex in Tampa, where he has been while 
completing his chemotherapy treatments after colon cancer surgery. 
Also, the team has stopped payments of his $2.5 million salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry reportedly returned to Tampa after the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma City Bombing Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The Rev. James J. Blassengill was driving  
by the Alfred P. Murrah federal building when it exploded four 
years ago. The blast destroyed his car, wrecked his body and 
scarred his psyche. 
</P>
<P>
	His problems persist -- he recently underwent surgery to remove  
gangrene that had developed around his stomach and intestines when 
glass bruised him inside and out. 
</P>
<P>
	But Blassengill insists he's one of the lucky ones.  
</P>
<P>
	He stood Monday among fellow survivors and the families of  
bombing victims gathered for the fourth anniversary of the April 
19, 1995, blast that killed 168 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Blassengill's wife said her husband, who is still kept awake by  
nightmares, is not as well as he makes out. 
</P>
<P>
	``He tries to say he's fine, but he's not,'' said Willie Mae  
Blassengill. ``He'll do pretty good for a while and then he has 
those flashbacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's ceremony, quieter and more informal than in previous  
years, is expected to be the last before a permanent memorial park 
is completed next year. 
</P>
<P>
	As the names of the 168 dead were read, family and friends  
dropped flowers over a glass wall onto the building's former site -- 
where workers took a morning break from building the memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	In addressing the 300 people gathered at the site, Paul Dunn,  
pastor of Calvary Baptist Church, told the survivors they may never 
understand why they were spared. But he challenged them to a goal 
even harder to reach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may never forget, but we must forgive!'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gloria Graves, who wore a T-shirt with the picture of her only  
daughter, bombing victim Cassandra Booker, tried to quiet several 
children fidgeting from a mixture of curiosity and fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Booker was killed while she was picking up Social Security  
cards for her children. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I could talk to Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, I would  
tell them that I forgive them and love them, and I'm praying for 
them and their families,'' said Ms. Graves, who listened and nodded 
during Dunn's presentation. ``We can't hold grudges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh was sentenced to death on murder and weapons charges.  
Nichols was convicted of conspiracy and involuntary manslaughter 
and sentenced to life. 
</P>
<P>
	In Indianapolis, about 100 federal workers gathered outside the  
Minton-Capehart Federal Building for a ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Mackey, who was a prosecutor in the trials of McVeigh and  
Nichols and is now in private practice, told the Indianapolis crowd 
the bombing didn't damage the life's work of those killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know the bombing did not bring this country to a halt,'' he  
said, ``as was the intent.''

<HEADLINE> Work of Breast Implant Panel Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- A judge has rejected bias claims against  
a scientific panel that found no link between breast implants and 
disease, clearing the way for attorneys to question the experts. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Sam Pointer ruled Monday the findings of the  
four-person panel were not tainted by the fact one member took a 
$750 honorarium from a company that used to make implants. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for women had claimed the payment meant the entire  
panel should be dismissed, and they asked Pointer to throw out its 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Pointer said he should have been more explicit in explaining  
what was expected of committee members, whom he appointed to be 
completely impartial and free of any conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take some responsibility for that,'' said Pointer, who  
presides over thousands of federal lawsuits filed by women who 
claim breast implants harmed their health. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision cleared the way for attorneys to begin taking sworn  
testimony from committee members this week. Videotapes of the 
sessions will be available for use in implant cases nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's attorneys last week asked Pointer to block the testimony  
and disband the committee since one member, rheumatologist Peter 
Tugwell, accepted $750 from former implant maker Bristol-Myers 
Squibb Co. to attend a three-hour meeting dealing with issues other 
than implants. 
</P>
<P>
	Tugwell, chairman of medicine at the University of Ottawa, also  
solicited $5,500 in donations from Bristol-Myers Squibb and 3M, 
another defendant in implant cases, to sponsor conferences he 
helped organize. And a close colleague accepted at least $200,000 
to do work for a Bristol-Myers Squibb subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Knowles, representing women with implants, said Tugwell's  
1996 appointment to the panel would have been ``dead on arrival'' 
had Pointer known of all his dealings with implant companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But attorneys for Bristol-Myers Squibb and the science panel  
argued that Tugwell followed all the court's rules and had no 
dealings involving breast implants with any company. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no conflict of interest, certainly as defined by this  
court,'' said John Kobayashi, representing the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	While refusing to overturn the work of the committee, Pointer  
said women's lawyers could question Tugwell about his ties to 
implant companies during his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of women have sued claiming implants are to blame for  
illnesses including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, aches, fatigue, 
memory loss and hardening of the breasts. They contend science 
backs up the claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Implant makers deny their products are a threat, and they say  
the work of the science panel and researchers proves it. They 
contend women's attorneys built their cases on bogus science. 
</P>
<P>
	Pointer, who has been in charge of all federal implant cases for  
more than six years, appointed the panel to sort out the 
conflicting scientific opinions.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Prosecutors have dropped charges that rapper  
ODB of the Wu-Tang Clan made threats against the mother of his 
child. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had conflicting testimony from witnesses and from  
the police reports, said Deputy District Attorney Nicole Perry on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rapper, whose birth name is Russell Tyrone Jones, was  
accused of threatening his former girlfriend after she refused to 
return child support money that he paid her. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' legal troubles are not over, however. He still faces  
court hearings in Los Angeles, Santa Monica and New York on 
unrelated incidents.

<HEADLINE> Court Will Hear Medicare Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide  
whether nursing homes can challenge Medicare regulations in federal 
court without first seeking an administrative decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices said they will hear the federal government's  
argument that federal Medicare law allows the rules to be 
challenged only during specific enforcement proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the Illinois Council on Long Term Care, which  
represents about 200 nursing facilities, filed a federal lawsuit in 
Chicago challenging new Medicare rules for nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois group said the rules provided stricter guidelines  
and more severe penalties for facilities that did not meet them. 
Before the guidelines took effect in July 1995, only 6 percent of 
Illinois nursing homes were found out of compliance, but the 
Illinois nursing home group said that number went up to nearly 70 
percent under the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said the rules were vague and were not properly  
adopted by federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, saying the federal  
Medicare law required the Illinois council to present its arguments 
first to the Department of Health and Human Services during 
enforcement proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed and reinstated  
part of the lawsuit. The appeals court said federal Medicare law 
allows such challenges to new regulations to be filed directly in 
federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal granted review today, Justice Department lawyers  
said the Medicare law requires nursing facilities to go through the 
administrative enforcement process before filing a challenge in 
federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois council disagreed, but urged the Supreme Court to  
grant review and resolve conflicting appeals court decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Shalala vs. Illinois Council on Long Term Care,  
98-1109.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Lower at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was lower against the yen Tuesday  
morning, while Japanese stocks slipped following losses on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.04 yen at midday, down 0.12 yen from late  
Monday in Tokyo but above its level of 117.58 yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average fell 18.48 points, or 0.11 percent, to  
close the morning session at 16,655.73. On Monday, the index lost 
177.37 points, or 1.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar weakened as U.S. investors  
placed large orders for yen to buy Japanese stocks, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other major currencies, the euro was traded at 125.69 yen,  
down from 125.87 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices were lower following the weakness  
earlier in U.S. stocks, traders said. Many high technology issues 
such as Sony Corp. and NEC were lower Tuesday morning, mirroring a 
selloff in technology shares in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Tokyo market rebounded slightly from early lows as  
investors bought shares of blue-chips such as Fujitsu, Matsushita 
and Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell Monday  
after five straight sessions of record highs, slipping 53.36 
points, or 0.5 percent to 10,440.53. The Nasdaq Composite Index 
lost 138.43 points to 2,345.61 for its second steepest drop ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was down 4.68 points, or 0.35 percent, to 
1,328.01. The TOPIX lost 10.34 points, or 0.77 percent, the 
previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond dropped to  
1.505 percent from Monday's close of 1.575 percent, driving its 
price up to 102.60 yen from 101.97 yen.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive Lawyer Surrenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Six weeks after he vanished, a prominent  
lawyer surrendered today and pleaded innocent to charges of 
misusing hundreds of thousands of dollars in clients' funds. 
</P>
<P>
	F. Mac Buckley, 57, a former federal prosecutor, was released on  
$200,000 bail and the condition that he immediately enter a 
psychiatric hospital and be kept in a locked ward. Court officials 
would not explain why that condition was added. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckley's lawyer, former partner Hubert Santos, would not say  
where Buckley had been. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckley, who dabbled as a boxing coach and handled many  
high-profile cases, became the subject of a nationwide search after 
he failed to show up for a client's sentencing on March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities initially thought Buckley might have had an accident  
or been the victim of foul play, but he was seen March 5 at his 
father's grave near Albany, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	And on the day he vanished, Buckley was the target of an  
intensifying investigation by the State Bar Association's Statewide 
Grievance Committee. The panel has since suspended his law license.

<HEADLINE> Antenna Stuck on NASA Mars Surveyor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Scientists were mystified Monday about why  
the main antenna to NASA's Mars Global Surveyor became stuck. 
</P>
<P>
	The antenna is designed to swivel at the end of a boom to stay  
pointed at Earth during communication sessions. The problem, if not 
fixed, would greatly reduce the amount of mapping data the 
spacecraft could send home. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft, which arrived at Mars in 1997 but only began its  
primary mission last month, was otherwise in good health, said 
Joseph Beerer, Mars Global Surveyor flight operations manager at 
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	The mapping instruments remained off, however, while engineers  
at JPL and Lockheed Martin Astronautics in Denver tried to 
determine what caused the antenna's gimbal to get stuck Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Communicating through a smaller antenna, controllers aimed the  
big antenna at Earth by turning the entire spacecraft about noon 
PDT Monday. About 50 minutes of data recorded Thursday night was 
played back. 
</P>
<P>
	Possible causes of the stuck gimbal include debris in the gears  
or lack of lubrication. 
</P>
<P>
	Mars Global Surveyor has sent numerous detailed images of  
martian features back to Earth since arriving in 1997, but the main 
mapping mission was delayed a year because a weakened joint in one 
of its solar panels.

<HEADLINE> Roba Wins Third Boston Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Fatuma Roba won her third Boston Marathon with a  
little help from a handful of friends who ran behind her Monday 
carrying billowing flags from her native Ethiopia just as she began 
to tire. 
</P>
<P>
	After running even with Catherine Ndereba for a good part of the  
race, Roba, 27, had pulled ahead three-fourths of the way. While 
becoming just the second woman to win the event three times in a 
row she posted the fourth-best time ever -- 2 hours, 23 minutes, 25 
seconds -- for her gender. 
</P>
<P>
	Her countrymen, who she said live in Boston, had handed her a  
red, yellow and green sweatband -- the color of the Ethiopian flag -- 
as she headed up a hill toward the end of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``The flag they gave me in the hilly area gave me a boost, and I  
started running at a faster pace,'' said Roba, the 1996 Olympic 
marathon champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Roba now holds the third- and fourth-fastest times for the  
Boston Marathon. She was bested only by Joan Benoit Samuelson, who 
finished 2:21:43 in 1983, and by Uta Pippig, who ran it in 2:21:45 
in 1994. Pippig is the only other woman to win three times in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Jennings, the 38-year-old runner with 10 USA Outdoor  
Championships and an Olympic bronze medal under her belt, outpaced 
all of her American competitors, coming in 12th overall with a time 
of 2:38:37. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only her second marathon. In 1978, when she was just a  
high school senior at the Bromfield School in Harvard, Jennings 
came in third as an unofficial entrant in the Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Jennings beat the time of 2:47 she set 21 years ago,  
perhaps starting a new phase of her 23-year running career as a 
marathoner. 
</P>
<P>
	She said after the race that she was happy she had qualified for  
the Olympic trials by coming in under 2:42 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Her coach, John Babington, said she ran too fast early on.  
</P>
<P>
	``She was suffering, but she didn't break down completely,''  
Babington said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennings said she didn't expect to tire quite so early in the  
contest. She had run even with the leaders for the first half of 
the 26.2-mile race and then faded over the next few miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The race was a blur, she said, except for the cheering of the  
fans who lined the entire route from Hopkinton to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was absolutely carried along by the fans,'' said the  
Newmarket, N.H., resident. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of the race, 20-year-old Sun Yingje of China  
ran well ahead of the pack at a very fast, nearly a minute ahead of 
her closest pursuer. 
</P>
<P>
	Roba and Ndereba, 20, of Kenya, ran neck and neck behind her  
until they caught up to Sun at about 12 1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Roba later said she didn't even notice Sun until the middle of  
the race. 
</P>
<P>
	For the next four miles, the two African women were locked in a  
stride-for-stride battle until Roba began to open up against 
Ndereba. 
</P>
<P>
	Ndereba, making her marathon debut, fell behind 32-year-old  
Franziska Rochat-Moser at the three-quarter mark and finished 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Rochat-Moser also is a lawyer who owns a gourmet restaurant in  
her hometown of Crissier, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Yukio Arimori, 32, finished third. She is a heroine in her  
native Japan for her second-place finish in the 1992 Olympic 
marathon and third at the 1996 Atlanta Games.

<HEADLINE> 'Life' Tops 'Matrix' at Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Life'' trounced virtual reality as Eddie  
Murphy's prison comedy knocked ``The Matrix'' from the top box 
office spot, according to industry figures released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life'' had $20.4 million in weekend ticket sales.  
</P>
<P>
	The only other new film in wide release, ``Goodbye Lover,''  
opened on 865 theaters and took in only $1.01 million. The dark 
comedy stars Patricia Arquette as a platinum-blond femme fatale. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Matrix'' earned $17.9 million and dropped into second  
place in its third week. The science fiction action-thriller is now 
just $1 million shy of becoming the first 1999 movie to top the 
$100 million mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Third place went to the Drew Barrymore teen comedy ``Never Been  
Kissed.'' It grossed $8.4 million even though, with the end of 
spring break, its take fell 29 percent from the previous weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cookie's Fortune,'' Robert Altman's quirky Southern tale of a  
bogus murder investigation after the suicide of a lonely old woman, 
gained theaters and had a 78 percent higher gross than the previous 
weekend, taking in $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Several films seemed to be tanking, including ``The  
Out-of-Towners,'' ``Go,'' ``EDtv,'' `Twin Dragons,'' ``Doug's 1st 
Movie,'' ``Baby Geniuses,'' ``Foolish'' and ``True Crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Go'' saw its ticket sales dip 36 percent from the previous  
weekend while ``Foolish'' recorded a 75 percent plunge. 
</P>
<P>
	Several films did well in limited release. ``Hideous Kinky,''  
with ``Titanic'' star Kate Winslet as a free spirit who moves to 
Morocco in the 1970s, opened with $82,431 at just 10 theaters.

<HEADLINE> Best Buy Won't Sell iMac Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- The discount retailer Best Buy Co.  
and Apple Computer are locked in a dispute over colors that has 
kept Apple's hot-selling iMac computer off Best Buy's shelves for 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Best Buy hasn't stocked the iMac since early this year when  
Apple started selling the computer in five colors. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple demands that retailers offer all five. But carrying the  
iMac in blueberry, grape, lime, strawberry and tangerine -- when the 
retailer doesn't think its customers want all those colors -- would 
have created inventory problems, Best Buy spokeswoman Joy Harris 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Best Buy doesn't want to stock inventory that might not sell, so  
the company held off from ordering the egg-shaped machines while it 
tries to reach an agreement with Apple. Negotiations are ongoing, 
said Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute leaves CompUSA as the only national retail chain  
offering the iMac. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple retired its old teal-colored iMacs earlier this year. Best  
Buy sold off its supply of teal machines and hasn't carried the 
iMac since. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Apple is not the only supplier of iMacs to retailers,  
the machines cost slightly more if purchased through a distributor 
that provides the computers in any color or quantity.

<HEADLINE> Porpoise Escapes From NYC Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A small harbor porpoise is back swimming with  
the big fishes after it became trapped in a New York City tidal 
pond. 
</P>
<P>
	When the 4-foot-long mammal turned up in Flushing Creek, near  
Shea Stadium, on Saturday, the city's Parks Department mobilized a 
rescue effort. 
</P>
<P>
	While the porpoise swam in circles for several hours,  
marine-life specialists stood by, ready to haul it back to deep 
water in a plastic net. 
</P>
<P>
	But the porpoise figured things out for itself, using high tide  
to swim back the way it had come -- through a pipe under a railroad 
viaduct -- into Long Island Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Animal experts said the porpoise probably got lost after playing  
hooky from its school and following some small fry into the creek. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't appear to be in any kind of distress,'' said Kim  
Durham, director of the Riverhead Marine Research and Preservation 
Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Protesters Clash in N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- With a promise to attack the ills of  
America, abortion protesters set their sights on local bookstores 
and schools in an effort to end teen sex and the sale of child 
pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters said they would promote abstinence and display  
pictures of aborted fetuses at high schools here today as part of a 
``truth campaign'' intended to prevent unwanted pregnancy and 
potential abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders bookstores, meanwhile, would be  
targeted for selling books by photographers Jock Sturges and David 
Hamilton, which contain nude photos of children, organizers said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're using our children as sexual toys,'' said the Rev. Flip  
Benham, national director of Operation Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	The weeklong Operation Save America campaign began Sunday with a  
noisy clash with abortion rights supporters on the steps of a 
federal courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Local and national organizers sent out 60,000 invitations to the  
activities, but only a fraction of that number -- 200 to 600 people 
-- were expected to participate. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether followers will obey a court order to remain 15 feet to  
60 feet from specified doctors' offices, clinics and hospitals 
remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel we need to honor God's law first. No man's law can be  
worthy unless it first honors God's law,'' Eileen Schopf, 
spokeswoman for Operation Save America and Last Call Ministries, 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters who invade the established buffer zones may face  
contempt and trespassing charges carrying penalties of up to two 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Although organizers have said Operation Save America would be  
more prayerful and peaceful than the similar Spring of Life 
protests here in 1992, there were isolated incidents of pushing and 
shoving as demonstrators jockeyed for space on the courthouse 
steps. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimated 150 people appeared evenly divided in numbers  
between anti-abortion, abortion rights supporters and reporters and 
photographers. 
</P>
<P>
	Abortion rights activists have condemned the timing and choice  
of location for Operation Save America. The demonstrations were 
announced a week after last October's sniper killing of abortion 
provider Dr. Barnett Slepian inside his home in the Buffalo suburb 
of Amherst. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schopf said the event was planned long in advance of the  
doctor's death, which remains unsolved, and was made public shortly 
after in response to media inquiries about the future of the 
anti-abortion movement. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday evening, about 200 abortion foes attended a church  
service during which a five-minute videotape was shown that 
juxtaposed images of aborted fetuses with footage of demonstrators 
being arrested at previous protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking fondly at the crowd, Benham acknowledged familiar faces.  
``We haven't seen each other since we were jailed the last time.''

Gretzky who couldn't keep from crying. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tough game for me today,'' Gretzky said of his  
farewell from the game he dominated for two decades. ``I wanted it 
to be a celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, this is not a passing on,'' he added, his eyes  
watery for perhaps the 100th time Sunday. ``This is a moving on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a moving scene as the sport's greatest player said  
goodbye. The NHL also said goodbye to No. 99, which commissioner 
Gary Bettman announced would never be worn in the league again. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a gentlemen told me in 1977 to wear this sweater, I  
didn't imagine one day nobody else would be allowed to wear it,'' 
Gretzky said, referring to Murray (Muzz) MacPherson, his coach with 
the Soo Greyhounds of the Ontario Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
	He wore it with as much class as any superstar in any sport.  
Gretzky was universally acknowledged throughout his 21-year career 
as the best; never was that respect more apparent than in his final 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always too soon when you see a great player retire,''  
said Mario Lemieux, the only man ever to perform anywhere near 
Gretzky's level. ``It's going to be very difficult for the National 
Hockey League to lose the best hockey player that ever played, and 
he's been such a great ambassador for the game for 20 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In front of Lemieux -- who retired for health reasons in 1997 --  
Mark Messier, Glen Sather, Paul Coffey and many more former 
teammates and opponents who revered The Great One, Gretzky set up 
the New York Rangers' only goal in a 2-1 defeat. The game ended 
abruptly in overtime when Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr scored, which 
somehow seemed appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's only fitting that the best young player in the game  
scored the winning goal,'' Gretzky said. ``Everyone always talks 
about passing torches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When it was over, Gretzky smiled through tears during four final  
laps of Madison Square Garden. The greatest player ever made it 
easy for everyone to say goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	He skated slowly enough for plenty of souvenir photos to be  
taken. Whenever he noticed a youngster's extended hand from the 
crowd, he touched it. He even played to the fans, donning a blue 
Yankees hat, then a red Rangers beret. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, almost as suddenly as word had come last week that he was  
retiring, No. 99 was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm devastated I will no longer be a hockey player,'' Gretzky,  
his eyes still red, said more than an hour after his final skate. 
``I will miss every part of the game, because I loved every part of 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I've made the right decision.''  
</P>
<P>
	That decision led to a Garden party almost as energized as the  
night in 1994 when the Rangers broke a 54-year Stanley Cup drought. 
Gretzky wasn't on hand for that, but Messier -- still the most 
popular of all Rangers -- was. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned Sunday to pay tribute to his buddy.  
</P>
<P>
	``His whole career has been handled with complete class and  
dignity,'' said Messier, who left the Rangers as a free agent two 
years ago. ``We've established a friendship and a bond that's next 
to brotherhood and will be there forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just as Gretzky always seemed to be there, at the top of the  
scoring charts and in the spotlight as the game's unofficial 
ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, the player who shattered hockey's most revered  
records skated one lap around the rink with his teammates in tow, 
followed by an encore as a lone spotlight caressed him and Carly 
Simon's ``Nobody Does It Better'' blared throughout. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most excruciating moment for him came as Gretzky  
fought the tears, occasionally looking down at the ice, while 
posing for one last photo with teammates, who all wore No. 99 caps. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to miss this game,'' he said. ``It's going to kill  
me not to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a timeout called by Rangers coach John Muckler with 40.4  
seconds to go in the third period, his wife, Janet, started to cry 
as the fans began a long salute to her husband. Gretzky, 38, 
acknowledged it with a nod, then a wave, then by raising his stick 
in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``When John called timeout, it hit me that I was done,'' he  
said, his eyes watering once more. ``Then is when it hit me that I 
had only 30 seconds left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after the timeout, he nearly had a breakaway, but  
Pittsburgh goalie Tom Barrasso, who had a sensational game, beat 
Gretzky to the puck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah,'' Gretzky said, this time with a twinkle in his eye. ``I  
thought I might have one there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proceedings began with Bettman's announcement, the first of  
several times Gretzky became teary. It happened again when his 
father, Walter, was driven to center ice in a new black Mercedes 
presented to Gretzky as a parting gift. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel so lucky to be able to play in the NHL,'' said Gretzky,  
owner of 61 NHL scoring marks. ``I've been so fortunate to play 
with some of the greatest players, against guys I admired so much, 
like the best player I ever played against, Mario Lemieux ... my 
teammates and, of course, the best player I ever played with, Mark 
Messier. 
</P>
<P>
	``And it would be nothing without family and the great  
friendships I have developed over the years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky wore a huge grin as friend Bryan Adams sang ``O,  
Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to miss you, Wayne,'' Adams ad-libbed late in the  
song. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Star-Spangled Banner,'' as sung by John Amirante, was  
altered to include the words ``in the land of Wayne Gretzky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the first television timeout, Gordie Howe, whose records  
Gretzky regularly broke, appeared in a video, saluting his prodigy. 
</P>
<P>
	Another sports icon, Michael Jordan, appeared in a second-period  
video, telling Gretzky, ``Your golf game is not going to get 
better, so don't think that will help. Relax and enjoy being a 
dad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, Canada's greatest sports hero, left Edmonton in 1988  
when he was traded to Los Angeles. He cried the day the trade was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	He said goodbye to Hollywood in 1996, dealt to St. Louis. But he  
soon signed with the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has always been a special place to play,'' he said. ``I  
was so proud and happy I was able to come here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, performing as if he was in his prime, set up a  
half-dozen scoring chances in the first 39 minutes, but his 
teammates botched the ones Barrasso didn't stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the Rangers were able to convert his magic late in the  
second period. On a power play while trailing 1-0, Gretzky passed 
from the right wing boards to Mathieu Schneider in the slot. He 
faked a shot and passed to Leetch for a tap-in open-net goal. 
</P>
<P>
	That led to a mob scene at the sideboards as his teammates  
hugged, although Gretzky didn't seem very emotional. Of course, 
he'd done this 2,856 times before in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	But he will never do it again.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's time,'' he said, once again teary-eyed. ``I know it's the  
right time.''

<HEADLINE> Rep. To Protest Orioles-Cuba Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNION CITY, N.J. (AP) -- A New Jersey congressman and several  
Cuban groups plan to bring 1,000 protesters to a May 3 exhibition 
game in Baltimore between the Orioles and the Cuban national team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to send the message that the world should be more  
concerned about supporting human rights in Cuba than about playing 
ball with a dictator,'' U.S. Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Menendez and members of United Cuban Organizations said the  
protesters would be coming in 10 buses from New Jersey and three 
planes from Florida. Other people are traveling from New York, 
Connecticut and Maryland, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles played an exhibition game against the Cubans on  
March 28 in Havana. Menendez, a Cuban-American and the 
fourth-ranking Democrat in the House leadership, has criticized the 
baseball series since President Clinton proposed it in his State of 
the Union address in January. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked the U.N. Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva to  
condemn the Cuban regime's human rights record and its recent 
crackdown on Cuban dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman from the Orioles wasn't immediately available for  
comment Monday.

<HEADLINE>  Mrs. Clinton Edges Closer to Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, edging closer to running  
for Senate, opened a campaign-style swing Monday by declaring, ``I 
love New York,'' as her fledgling political operation combed the 
state for potential campaign workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm obviously still considering and exploring and am very  
interested,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet she tried to minimize the political implications of the  
trip, which included talks about the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo 
and other traditional first lady fare. The White House called the 
trip an official function, thus U.S. taxpayers picked up the tab. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an exploratory trip. This is a trip filled with  
events and occasions, some of which I agreed to do months ago,'' 
Mrs. Clinton told reporters after urging private foundations to 
help ease the Kosovo refugee crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Her aides, however, conceded the trip had political  
implications. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess anytime we're up here, it's part of the (exploratory)  
process,'' said press secretary Marsha Berry. ``She's thinking 
about this. I don't know when you turn it off and turn it on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and associates say Mrs. Clinton appears to be leaning  
toward a Senate bid, though some believe she will forgo the race at 
the last minute. Their assessments are based on clues from private 
conversations with her and the full-speed-ahead groundwork being 
laid by top political aide Harold Ickes. 
</P>
<P>
	The former deputy White House chief of staff has begun compiling  
lists of campaign operatives in the event she takes the plunge. He 
has secured commitments from some potential staff, said a source 
close to Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	One longtime associate said Mrs. Clinton told him two weeks ago  
that she intended to run, but would not finalize her decision until 
June or July. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton scheduled scores of New York stops Monday, Tuesday  
and -- after returning to Washington on Wednesday -- again Thursday, 
from Long Island to Niagara Falls. Monday's unusually crowded 
schedule contained seven stops, including the Columbia University's 
Teachers College, the Ukrainian Institute, the Jewish Child Care 
Association and a fund-raiser for Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers, Ukrainians and the Jewish community are important  
Democratic constituencies. Nadler, a House Judiciary Committee 
member, staunchly defended President Clinton during the impeachment 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	In her most political remarks of the day, Mrs. Clinton praised  
Nadler, saying, ``He ... defended with great vigor, intelligence 
and energy the Constitution when it was, in the view of many 
Americans, being misused during the battles in the Congress, the 
last Congress, that took place in the Judiciary (Committee) and on 
the floor of the House.''	   The trip brought Mrs. Clinton fresh evidence that a Senate race 
against probable Republican nominee Rudolph Giuliani would be 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest poll from Marist College's Institute for Public  
Opinion showed the pair in a dead heat, with half saying Mrs. 
Clinton should not run. The New York mayor has gained ground since 
a February Marist poll, which had Mrs. Clinton leading Giuliani, 49 
percent to 38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one said it was going to be a cakewalk,'' said Sen. Charles  
Schumer, D-N.Y., who ousted Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato last 
November and has urged the first lady to run. ``This is going to be 
a tough, tough race, but I think as people get to know her, she'll 
do better and better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers inside and outside the White House are studying whether  
Mrs. Clinton should form an exploratory committee to raise money 
that would defray the costs of future trips. She said she would 
consider the move ``if it becomes appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief news conference, Mrs. Clinton explained for the first  
time why a Senate race interests her: ``I love New York, to start 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With gushing reverence, Mrs. Clinton called New York ``a  
microcosm of America,'' with a ``dynamic, diverse city'' that would 
enable her to deal with issues such as education and health care 
that are as important in New York as they are across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the collective ``we'' in a way that could include the  
first lady herself, Mrs. Clinton said, ``We have everything in New 
York that we have in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also announced plans to travel to Albania and Macedonia ``as  
soon as I'm given the green light'' by humanitarian workers, whose 
efforts she does not want to disrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	As for her career, Mrs. Clinton told several associates in  
recent days that she has concluded that serving in the Senate would 
be a good next step for her. When word first surfaced of her 
interest, Mrs. Clinton had told these same people she wasn't sure 
if she wanted to be in a Republican-controlled Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The new question: Is she willing to risk losing? Though a senior  
adviser said Mrs. Clinton is not afraid of defeat, other associates 
say she tends to avoid taking great risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Most friends and associates spoke on condition of anonymity.  
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of Teachers  
and a Mrs. Clinton supporter in New York, suggested the first lady 
is inclined to run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get a feeling that a final decision has been made yet,  
but I think she's very interested,'' Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was urged to run at every stop, including a Central  
Park event concerning hiking trails. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to wish her all the best as she hits a different kind  
of trail right here in New York state,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, 
D-N.Y., as Mrs. Clinton, from the front row, shook her head from 
side to side. At another event, NBC ``Today Show'' host Katie 
Couric joked that Mrs. Clinton was ``taking time out from apartment 
hunting'' in New York to appear.

<HEADLINE> Women's World Cup Draws Closer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two months before the Women's World Cup, ticket  
sales have exceeded projections and some predict a sellout for the 
opener at Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day when FIFA's tournament trophy was unveiled and English  
pop singer Billie performed the official song, ``Because We Want 
To,'' organizers said the soccer championship has sold more than 
325,000 tickets. Initial estimates in 1997 of potential sales were 
312,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Those estimates have been upgraded to 475,000. And Marla  
Messing, president of the organizing committee, said Monday she 
thinks more than 500,000 tickets will be sold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the 1994 men's World Cup opened the eyes of the U.S.  
public to what World Cup soccer is all about,'' she said at a news 
conference. ``The Atlanta Olympics opened eyes to the power and 
excitement of women's team sports. We are bringing both of those to 
bear to show the importance and attraction of this event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-team tournament begins June 19 with two games at East  
Rutherford, N.J. More than 44,000 tickets have been sold for the 
doubleheader: United States vs. Denmark followed by Mexico vs. 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great place to open the World Cup and it should be an  
exciting atmosphere,'' U.S. veteran Kristine Lilly said. ``This is 
what it's all about for us. We play attractively and with passion 
and we think people will want to come and be a part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other World Cup teams are North Korea, Nigeria, Germany,  
Italy, Norway, Russia, Canada, Japan, China, Australia, Sweden and 
Ghana. 
</P>
<P>
	The American players understand the significance of their role  
in the tournament, which ends July 10 at the Rose Bowl. If the U.S. 
team flops as the men did in France last year, any hope for huge 
walk-up sales disappears. If the women repeat their performance at 
the 1996 Olympics or 1991 World Cup, both of which they won, the 
tournament could be an enormous success. 
</P>
<P>
	Single-game tickets went on sale Monday for all venues: Giants  
Stadium, Rose Bowl, Foxboro Stadium, Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, 
Soldier Field, Spartan Stadium (San Jose, Calif.), Stanford 
(Calif.) Stadium and Portland (Ore.) Civic Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have said all along that we will have full or near-full  
stadiums for major games like the opening and final,'' Messing 
said. ``And we will have very respectable numbers for the other 
matches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Average ticket sales for first-round doubleheaders not involving  
the U.S. team are at 14,257. 
</P>
<P>
	The trophy, designed by William Sawaya, a native of Lebanon now  
working in Italy, was crafted by hand. It features a spiraling band 
tapering upward to embrace a soccer ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's startling, with a single gesture from the ground, aiming  
high, dancing and rising in a crescendo of movement -- just like the 
growing interest that the world is showing in women's football,'' 
Sawaya said. 
</P>
<P>
	The theme song was performed live by 16-year-old Billie, who  
debuted a song on the British pop chart at No. 1 and has a double 
platinum record. She also will sing the theme at the opener.

<HEADLINE> Italian, German Telecoms To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Telecom Italia SpA and Germany's Deutsche Telekom  
AG are expected to announce Tuesday that they are merging in a 
mega-deal that would create a new global competitor to U.S. giants 
such as AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	The move, which would pair two former state monopolies, would be  
subject to intense regulatory scrutiny and would undoubtedly 
present the companies with political and cultural obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
	A Telecom Italia-Deutsche Telekom combination would dwarf its  
competitors in Europe and would most likely become the largest 
merger in history, topping the pending deal between Exxon Corp. and 
Mobil Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	A Telecom Italia official who spoke on condition of anonymity  
said the two firms' chief executives -- Franco Bernabe and Ron 
Sommer -- will outline the merger agreement at a Tuesday morning 
news conference in London. The planned announcement ends days of 
frenzied speculation about such a move. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia may not be the only partner Deutsche Telecom is  
eyeing. The German business weekly Manager Magazin issued a news 
release Monday saying that Deutsche Telekom is also negotiating a 
takeover of U.S. telecommunications company Sprint Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a report to be published Friday in the magazine,  
Telekom boss Sommer has been negotiating a deal with Sprint Corp.'s 
Chief Executive William Esrey for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom spokesman Stephan Althoff dismissed the story  
as ``just speculation.'' Officials at Sprint did not respond to 
requests for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia confirmed late Sunday that it was examining the  
possibility of an industrial alliance with Deutsche Telekom. 
Telecom Italia is known to be seeking a white knight to save it 
from a hostile takeover bid by its smaller Italian rival, Olivetti 
SpA. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia have refused to say how they  
might share ownership in a combined company and have declined to 
say how they might calculate their respective values in any merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom has a market capitalization of about $117  
billion while Telecom Italia is at about $77 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema said today that any merger  
between Telecom Italia and Deutsche Telekom would require a 
privatization of the German company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot imagine that a privatized Telecom Italia may merge  
with a company whose main shareholder is the German state,'' 
D'Alema told reporters. Deutsche Telecom is 72 percent-owned by the 
German government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian government owns 3.4 percent of Telecom Italia, but  
it has veto power over the acquisition of more than 3 percent of 
the shares of the telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti has offered $12.31 a share for Telecom Italia. Olivetti  
plans to proceed with its tender offer despite the German-Italian 
merger talks, company spokesman Ugo Panerai said today. Olivetti 
has already filed a prospectus with the Italian regulatory body 
Consob. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia's board met Monday to address issues related to  
such a merger, the company official said from Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	Althoff, the Deutsche Telekom spokesman in Bonn, refused to say  
whether the German company's directors were planning a meeting of 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deutsche Telekom is examining Telecom Italia's potential in an  
industry alliance, but the elements of such an alliance are still 
under evaluation,'' Althoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Althoff declined to comment on newspaper reports that the two  
companies planned to fold their stock into a new telecommunications 
holding company on a 60-40 percent basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian prime minister's office has said that any accord  
must be on an equal footing, underlining fears in Italy of foreign 
ownership of the strategic telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
	A merger also would raise a rash of regulatory issues. Deutsche  
Telekom has close financial and operational ties with another major 
telecommunications company, France Telecom. In addition, Deutsche 
Telekom is still majority owned by the German government, which 
would have to divest it in order to gain approval of the deal from 
Italian regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	France Telecom said Deutsche Telekom can't withdraw unilaterally  
from its strategic agreements with the French telecommunications 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our agreements with Deutsche Telekom are clear and  
incompatible with a unilateral strategic turnaround,'' France 
Telecom said. The companies own 2 percent of one another's stock.

<HEADLINE> Linux Guru Shines at Comdex Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Margaret Hadam came to the Comdex computer show  
Monday on a mission. But it wasn't Bill Gates -- or the Microsoft 
chairman's glitzy 90-minute debut of Windows 2000 -- she was after. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pleeeeeeeease, Linus, will you sign this?'' the 20-year-old  
university computer tech asked, jamming a program guide in the face 
of Linus Torvalds, the developer of the lesser-known Linux computer 
operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hadam was among the more effusive of the scores of techies  
who jammed an overflowing conference room at Chicago's McCormick 
Place to meet the man who created the operating system she uses at 
Loyola University. But she was far from the only one who asked for 
an autograph or a handshake from the somewhat bewildered Torvalds, 
whom some say is David to Gates' Goliath in the high-tech world. 
</P>
<P>
	Linux is a version of the Unix operating system used by  
businesses to run computer networks and Internet sites. Linux can 
be downloaded for free off the Web; commercial versions with 
additional features can be bought at retail stores for as little as 
$30. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hadam and others praise Linux because its source code -- the  
programming language that makes Linux run -- is also freely 
available, allowing programmers to personalize it to suit their 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Torvalds said his system is gaining popularity because it gives  
people what they want. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't get to this point because of the hype,'' Torvalds  
said. ``It got here because it does what people want it to do. 
Let's not forget that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he also wants to provide computer users with an option  
to Windows, used to run roughly 90 percent of the world's personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Linux's use in business computers is a tiny fraction of  
more established Unix systems and Windows NT, and the software 
rarely appears on desktop computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Gates unveiled Windows 2000, the latest generation of  
the Windows NT business-oriented operating system, in a 
presentation that included techno music and tongue-in-cheek videos. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates also showed his sense of humor by showing a clip of last  
year's embarrassing computer crash during the debut of Windows 98. 
In it, his assistant Chris Cappesello looked unpleasantly surprised 
when a blue ``error'' screen popped up for all the world to see. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people have asked me in the last year, 'What happened  
to that guy?' '' Gates told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Cappesello then walked onto the stage Monday to the tune of ``I  
Will Survive'' and successfully orchestrated a demonstration of 
Windows 2000 as well as other new Microsoft products, including a 
new computer mouse that has no dust-prone moving parts underneath 
and can operated on most surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials say the latest test version of Windows 2000  
will be distributed to companies nationwide by next month and be on 
the market by the end of the year. Improvements include easier ways 
for company employees to transfer computer documents into laptops 
to take on the road, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
	His employees also demonstrated Windows-based computers' ability  
to receive images and data by infrared light, rather than a 
hardwire connection -- an option that brought ``oohs'' from the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone was impressed, however. ``Microsoft does a really,  
really good job of selling,'' said Mike Ho, a student at 
Northwestern University who attended Gates' speech. ``But a lot of 
the things from today I've already seen from other companies, like 
Apple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For her part, Hadam called Gates a ``genius'' and said the  
Windows system -- which, in contrast to Linux, is fiercely protected 
by Microsoft -- may give Gates the competitive edge in the computer 
wars. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're both ruthless,'' Hadam said of Torvalds and Gates.  
``One is just a little more ruthless than the other.''

<HEADLINE>  Mrs. Clinton Edges Closer to Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, edging closer to running  
for Senate, opened a campaign-style swing Monday by declaring, ``I 
love New York,'' as her fledgling political operation combed the 
state for potential campaign workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm obviously still considering and exploring and am very  
interested,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet she tried to minimize the political implications of the  
trip, which included talks about the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo 
and other traditional first lady fare. The White House called the 
trip an official function, thus U.S. taxpayers picked up the tab. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an exploratory trip. This is a trip filled with  
events and occasions, some of which I agreed to do months ago,'' 
Mrs. Clinton told reporters after urging private foundations to 
help ease the Kosovo refugee crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Her aides, however, conceded the trip had political  
implications. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess anytime we're up here, it's part of the (exploratory)  
process,'' said press secretary Marsha Berry. ``She's thinking 
about this. I don't know when you turn it off and turn it on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and associates say Mrs. Clinton appears to be leaning  
toward a Senate bid, though some believe she will forgo the race at 
the last minute. Their assessments are based on clues from private 
conversations with her and the full-speed-ahead groundwork being 
laid by top political aide Harold Ickes. 
</P>
<P>
	The former deputy White House chief of staff has begun compiling  
lists of campaign operatives in the event she takes the plunge. He 
has secured commitments from some potential staff, said a source 
close to Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	One longtime associate said Mrs. Clinton told him two weeks ago  
that she intended to run, but would not finalize her decision until 
June or July. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton scheduled scores of New York stops Monday, Tuesday  
and -- after returning to Washington on Wednesday -- again Thursday, 
from Long Island to Niagara Falls. Monday's unusually crowded 
schedule contained seven stops, including the Columbia University's 
Teachers College, the Ukrainian Institute, the Jewish Child Care 
Association and a fund-raiser for Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers, Ukrainians and the Jewish community are important  
Democratic constituencies. Nadler, a House Judiciary Committee 
member, staunchly defended President Clinton during the impeachment 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	In her most political remarks of the day, Mrs. Clinton praised  
Nadler, saying, ``He ... defended with great vigor, intelligence 
and energy the Constitution when it was, in the view of many 
Americans, being misused during the battles in the Congress, the 
last Congress, that took place in the Judiciary (Committee) and on 
the floor of the House.''	   The trip brought Mrs. Clinton fresh evidence that a Senate race 
against probable Republican nominee Rudolph Giuliani would be 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest poll from Marist College's Institute for Public  
Opinion showed the pair in a dead heat, with half saying Mrs. 
Clinton should not run. The New York mayor has gained ground since 
a February Marist poll, which had Mrs. Clinton leading Giuliani, 49 
percent to 38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one said it was going to be a cakewalk,'' said Sen. Charles  
Schumer, D-N.Y., who ousted Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato last 
November and has urged the first lady to run. ``This is going to be 
a tough, tough race, but I think as people get to know her, she'll 
do better and better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers inside and outside the White House are studying whether  
Mrs. Clinton should form an exploratory committee to raise money 
that would defray the costs of future trips. She said she would 
consider the move ``if it becomes appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief news conference, Mrs. Clinton explained for the first  
time why a Senate race interests her: ``I love New York, to start 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With gushing reverence, Mrs. Clinton called New York ``a  
microcosm of America,'' with a ``dynamic, diverse city'' that would 
enable her to deal with issues such as education and health care 
that are as important in New York as they are across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the collective ``we'' in a way that could include the  
first lady herself, Mrs. Clinton said, ``We have everything in New 
York that we have in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also announced plans to travel to Albania and Macedonia ``as  
soon as I'm given the green light'' by humanitarian workers, whose 
efforts she does not want to disrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	As for her career, Mrs. Clinton told several associates in  
recent days that she has concluded that serving in the Senate would 
be a good next step for her. When word first surfaced of her 
interest, Mrs. Clinton had told these same people she wasn't sure 
if she wanted to be in a Republican-controlled Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The new question: Is she willing to risk losing? Though a senior  
adviser said Mrs. Clinton is not afraid of defeat, other associates 
say she tends to avoid taking great risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Most friends and associates spoke on condition of anonymity.  
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of Teachers  
and a Mrs. Clinton supporter in New York, suggested the first lady 
is inclined to run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get a feeling that a final decision has been made yet,  
but I think she's very interested,'' Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was urged to run at every stop, including a Central  
Park event concerning hiking trails. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to wish her all the best as she hits a different kind  
of trail right here in New York state,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, 
D-N.Y., as Mrs. Clinton, from the front row, shook her head from 
side to side. At another event, NBC ``Today Show'' host Katie 
Couric joked that Mrs. Clinton was ``taking time out from apartment 
hunting'' in New York to appear.

<HEADLINE> Bill Rodgers Fades in Record Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- This has been his race. ``Boston Billy'' and the  
Boston Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Rodgers is one of only three four-time winners of the  
world's most prestigious 26-mile, 385-yard test. So what was he 
doing, six miles from the finish line, stretched out on his back, a 
blank look on his gaunt face? 
</P>
<P>
	At age 51, the hometown legend was trying to recover and facing  
the reality that records and victories are for younger men. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed I couldn't finish,'' he said Monday. ``But I  
didn't want to keel over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From 1975 through 1980, he won four Boston Marathons, the last  
three in succession. His last win came at age 32, and he also won 
four New York City marathons from 1976 through 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	His last serious run in Boston came in 1990, and his last  
attempt to win a marathon -- something he has done 21 times -- was 
the first Vietnam International Marathon in 1992. There, he 
staggered across the finish line in oppressive heat, finishing 19th 
in 3 hours, 19 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	He did return for the centennial Boston Marathon in 1996, but  
ran casually with friends and finished in 2:53. 
</P>
<P>
	He's still very active, having run 29 races at various distances  
last year, and if he runs in Boston again next year, he said, he 
might do it for fun with his brother, Charlie. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll cruise it. I can run the marathon but I can't seem to  
duke it out any more,'' Rodgers said. ``I don't want to end my 
marathoning career with a DNF (did not finish) at the Boston 
Marathon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he had hoped to break the over-50 course record for  
an American of 2:31:34, set by Norm Green in 1983. Eight days 
earlier, he had set his sights on Green's American record for a 
10-mile race of 52:53. But he missed it by 1:11 at the Cherry 
Blossom Run in Washington. Still, Rodgers was 33rd in a field of 
about 6,200. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been training diligently since December for his 58th  
serious marathon and 16th in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe next time I won't run for any record,'' Rodgers said.  
``I'll just run to finish the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was doing well for the first half of the race, covering it in  
about 1:14. That gave him a chance to break Green's record. Soon 
after, though, trouble began. 
</P>
<P>
	``My legs started to get tight. By the time I hit the hills, I  
was starting to do the marathon shuffle'' as he began to tire, 
Rodgers said. ``Then I started seeing a lot of flashing lights, 
which is a sign of dehydration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And a message that the unseasonably warm day would not be  
remembered for being one of his best Boston Marathons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a day to try for a record, no matter what your  
age,'' he said. ``Boston is one of the toughest races to compete 
in, but I did my best. I felt I made a smart decision. I'm 
disappointed I couldn't finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not absolutely on, the marathon will really get you,  
especially if you're pushing hard. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodgers said he was felt tired during the week preceding the  
race. 
</P>
<P>
	He failed to finish only twice before in Boston, in his debut in  
1973 and again in 1977 before he won three in a row. In his last 
two serious attempts at the race, he competed in the master's 
division for runners 40 and older, where he finished second in 1988 
and fifth in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he stayed away for five years before returning as part of  
the 1996 celebration. If he runs in Boston again next year, he'll 
have more realistic expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could run the race, but I can't push hard for records and  
stuff,'' he said. ``Next time I run Boston, I think I'm going to be 
a back-of-the-pack runner. I'm going to have fun out there.''

<HEADLINE> Groups Against Bank Reporting Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When it went after suspected money launderers  
in Operation Casablanca last year, the U.S. Customs Service used 
about 80 suspicious activity reports filed by banks under a 1974 
law to identify their bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	That enabled Customs agents to locate suspects' assets that were  
seized and forfeited in the operation, which was the biggest drug 
money-laundering case in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Customs Service is pointing to it as an example of the Bank  
Secrecy Act's value, as civil libertarians and other groups 
organize a big campaign to end the law's reporting requirements for 
cash transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Far-reaching legislation pushed by Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, would  
repeal the Bank Secrecy Act, which requires banks to report 
customers' cash transactions of $10,000 or more, as well as 
suspicious activities, to law enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Justice and Treasury departments and the  
Customs Service are telling Congress that the Bank Secrecy Act is 
an essential tool for detecting and prosecuting money launderers 
and drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Paul maintains it violates the Fourth Amendment prohibition  
against unreasonable search and seizure and that at any rate, it 
has failed to help catch drug dealers, who he says ``are smarter 
than most bankers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Libertarian Party, the American Civil Liberties Union,  
privacy advocacy associations and other groups are mobilizing to 
generate support for Paul's bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will try to inundate Congress with another torrent of  
e-mails,'' Libertarian Party spokesman George Getz said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Getz was referring to the earlier blitz of some 225,000 e-mail  
messages and letters, nearly all in opposition, received by the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. on proposed anti-money laundering 
rules that would have tracked the transaction patterns of bank 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowing to the public outcry over privacy, the FDIC and three  
other federal banking agencies scrapped the proposal last month. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Getz said, the Libertarians want people to contact  
their member of Congress, since the Bank Secrecy Act already is law 
and there is no request for public comment from the banking 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a bigger gun this time,'' he said, explaining that  
the group can draw on the people who earlier protested the 
so-called ``Know Your Customer'' rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory Nojeim, legislative counsel for the ACLU, said the group  
recently started a ``Know Your Banker'' campaign on its Web site to 
help consumers understand banks' current monitoring practices and 
encourage competition among banks based on their privacy policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislative prospects for Paul's bill appear dim, as they do for  
a companion measure he proposed that would let people see the files 
on them created by the federal Financial Crimes Enforcement 
Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., chairwoman of the financial  
institutions subcommittee, said Monday she does not want the Bank 
Secrecy Act repealed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to deal with the real world of money laundering, and  
the Bank Secrecy Act has helped (law enforcement) do an excellent 
job,'' Roukema said in a telephone interview. She said she may seek 
changes in the law to improve law enforcement's ability to fight 
money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Monday, Paul had found only two co-sponsors for his bill,  
Reps. John Thune, R-S.D., and Bob Schaffer, R-Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Money laundering, which is a major concern of law enforcement  
officials, reached an estimated $30 billion in this country last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Laundering includes the use of wire transfers and bank drafts as  
well as ``smurfing,'' the practice of breaking down transactions 
into smaller amounts that do not have to be reported under the Bank 
Secrecy Act.

<HEADLINE> Fires Keep Florida's I-75 Closed </HEADLINE>

<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- South Florida's main east-west  
highway was closed for a second day today as the area burned by a 
fire feeding on dry sawgrass in the Everglades grew to 90,000 
acres. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no indication when smoke might lift off Interstate 75,  
the highway known as Alligator Alley, and let authorities reopen 
about 60 miles of the route across the Everglades, said Florida 
Highway Patrol Lt. Greg Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fires are worse now than they were two days ago,'' he  
said. ``But as soon as it's safe, it will be reopened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials expected erratic wind and dry, warm weather to  
continue for the next day or two, said Gene Madden, spokesman for 
the state Division of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect more fires,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters set controlled fires to help contain the Everglades  
blaze. The fire produced so much dense smoke that the sky was 
darkened in the Fort Lauderdale and Miami area on Saturday, forcing 
motorists to turn on their headlights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, it'll burn itself out,'' said Terence McElroy, a  
spokesman for the state Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire began on the Everglades' western edge Saturday,  
possibly ignited by a vehicle's catalytic converter. Fanned by 
erratic, swirling wind, it quickly became the largest of more than 
2,450 blazes that have burned 130,000 acres in the state this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire raced across 35,000 acres Saturday and had burned a  
total of about 90,000 acres by today, said Bernadine Thomas, a duty 
officer with the state Division of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to remember the fuel there. Not only is it very  
thick, it's very dry and fine,'' Madden said. ``They tend to burn 
furiously and very rapidly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters from Texas and Arizona were called in to help.  
</P>
<P>
	With rainfall 90 percent below normal during Florida's dry  
season from December through April, officials fear a repeat of last 
summer, when fires blackened 500,000 acres and forced 100,000 
people from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Light showers late Saturday were more of a hindrance than help,  
making grass just damp enough to prevent crews from setting 
backfires. Dry weather, with temperatures in the 70s and low 80s 
and gusty wind, is forecast through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Everglades blaze was dubbed the ``Deceiving Fire'' because  
of its frequently shifting wind. At one point Saturday, flames 
jumped over a fire crew, setting the vehicle near them ablaze. No 
one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a fright for us and stark reminder of how dangerous  
this is,'' Madden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fires during the weekend also moved close to power lines in the  
Everglades and to lines carrying electricity out of the Turkey 
Point nuclear power plant south of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Power &AMP; Light Co. had plans to activate backup power  
sources if flames reach any lines and cut off power, spokeswoman 
Janice Brady said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't look like our lines are in any immediate danger,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	There also were smaller wildfires elsewhere in Florida.  
</P>
<P>
	Blazes in St. Lucie County, midway between Miami and Orlando,  
destroyed 43 homes and damaged 33 others. 
</P>
<P>
	In the northern part of the state, a 200-acre fire destroyed one  
house Saturday near Panama City in the Panhandle.

<HEADLINE> Nets' Williams Vows To Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Despite concern that his career  
might be in jeopardy because of a badly broken right leg and knee 
injury, New Jersey Nets center Jayson Williams pledged Monday that 
he would play next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't feel sorry for me, I'll definitely be back to playing  
basketball,'' Williams said, sitting in a wheelchair with his 
broken right leg extended. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury, which happened April 1 against Atlanta when Williams  
collided with teammate Stephon Marbury, wasn't a simple break. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard it snap,'' Williams said in his first news conference  
since being hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only did Williams sustain a plateau fracture, a break in the  
kneecap area, Dr. Russell Warren also discovered an 8-to-10 inch 
vertical crack in the tibia and a torn meniscus in the knee. 
Williams said the meniscus might have been hurt before he broke his 
leg but wasn't discovered until the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned one-hour surgery dragged on for five hours, during  
which Warren had to put a plate and five screws in the leg and 
repair the meniscus. A bone graft from Williams' hip was needed to 
repair the plateau fracture. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have told Williams not to put any weight on the leg for  
eight weeks, and he won't be able to get back onto a basketball 
court for another six to eight weeks after that. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Warren) has faith that I'll have a full recovery,'' said  
Williams, whose 12 rebounds per game was the NBA's second best at 
the time of his injury. ``He fixed everything and said I'll be back 
40 percent stronger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If this was anyone else other than Jayson I would be  
worried,'' said Nets president Michael Rowe, who signed Williams to 
a seven-year, $100 million contract before the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said doctors have already told him he is already ahead  
of schedule as far as how he can position his leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm rushing back to get everything done,'' he said. ``I want  
to be back in training camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the funniest men in the NBA, the injury hasn't caused  
Williams to lose his sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that he once said the only way he would ever leave a  
game was by ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the one prediction I predicted right in eight years  
here,'' Williams said. ``I've been predicting championships, 
playoffs wins, wins over the Knicks. I say an ambulance will take 
me out of here before I give up, and sure enough here come the 
sirens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toward the end of Williams news conference, former teammate  
Derrick Coleman came in and gave him a hug. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll see you tonight,'' Williams said as Coleman turned and  
walked away. ``You're driving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Gov. Christie Whitman, who recently broke her leg in a  
skiing accident, wasn't immune from Williams' humor. 
</P>
<P>
	``She told me she was bearing weight after this accident she  
had, and it was similar, after 7 1/2 weeks,'' Williams said, ``and I 
know I'm in better shape than the governor. I'm not taking nothing 
away from the governor. She's a beautiful woman but I'm a little 
stronger than the governor, a little more popular now, too. We're 
both Republicans. ... I might be a Democrat now.''

<HEADLINE> Nisshin Steel To Cut 21 Pct of Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Major Japanese steelmaker Nisshin Steel Co. has  
decided to slash 1,200 jobs, about 21 percent of its work force, 
over two years, a company spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The steelmaker expects to save $51 million (6 billion yen) a  
year in labor costs by reducing personnel to 4,400, from 5,600, 
said the spokesman, who declined to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	Nisshin Steel plans to accomplish the job cuts mainly through  
attrition, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company calculates a pretax loss of $17 million for the  
fiscal year ended March. It aims to post a pretax profit of $9.3 
million in fiscal 2001 through the restructuring.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Buying Golf Software Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. will buy Access Software, the  
leading maker of golf games for personal computers and the company 
that helped develop Microsoft's own golf software. 
</P>
<P>
	Access, a privately held Salt Lake City company, makes Links LS  
and related golf games, the best-selling PC golf line in both units 
and dollars since 1992. The purchase price was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're the undisputed kings of computer golf,'' said Ed  
Fries, general manager of the Microsoft Games Group. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Links LS, other Access titles include Links  
Extreme, the Phoenix of Japan Add-On Course, the U.S. Open at 
Pinehurst and the 5-Course Libraries Volumes 1-4. It also makes the 
Tex Murphy series of adventure software. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft hired Access in 1992 to develop its own golf game,  
Microsoft Golf. 
</P>
<P>
	For several years, Access' products were aimed at computers  
running the DOS operating system, while Microsoft's golf game was 
made for Windows computers. The companies parted ways in 1996 when 
Access began developing a Windows golf game that made it a direct 
competitor.

<HEADLINE> Push On for Watercraft Speed Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government and the world's leading  
manufacturer of personal watercraft asked the industry Monday to 
limit the speed of water scooters to 65 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Bombardier Recreational Products, maker of Sea Doo models, took  
the lead by announcing voluntary compliance with the limit on 2000 
year models, going on sale early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We challenge the rest of the industry to join us in capping  
top speeds,'' said Henry Lonski, vice president and general manager 
of Sea Doo watercraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Hall, a Sea Doo spokeswoman, said: ``There's been this speed  
war going on for years within the watercraft industry. At some 
point it makes sense to address the issue. There's a real fine line 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard welcomed the initiative. According to its  
records, 4,070 personal watercraft were involved in accidents in 
1997. Of those, 84 involved drownings. 
</P>
<P>
	While no direct correlation has been made to speed, the National  
Transportation Safety Board said last year that most accidents 
involve operators who have little experience riding the powerful 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to provide a balance between fun and safety.  
Speeds in excess of 65 mph upset this delicate balance,'' said a 
statement issued by Capt. Michael Holmes, chief of the Coast 
Guard's Office of Boating Safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack O'Dell, a Coast Guard spokesman, acknowledged that 65 mph  
is fast on either land or water, but he said the limit should help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think people understand: If you fall off a personal  
watercraft at a high rate of speed, it's just like falling off a 
motorcycle,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal watercraft look much like a motorcycle on water, with  
handlebars and a seat that riders straddle. The standard piston 
engine is replaced with a jet that sucks in water, spits it out the 
tail and propels the craft through the ocean, up rivers or across 
lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past decade, the machines have boomed in popularity.  
Sales peaked at 205,000 units in 1995, but 130,000 were sold last 
year. About 1.2 million now are in use nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	While sales have fallen recently, top speeds have increased from  
quick to hair-straightening. Kawasaki, which makes the Jet Ski 
model line, sells the Ultra 150, which has a top speed of 68 mph. 
Sea Doo's fastest, the XP, goes 63.5 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall estimated that every 1 mph gain in speed costs a  
manufacturer $1 million in development costs. She said Bombardier 
could make a model to compete with Kawasaki's Ultra 150, but the 
money should be spent on making personal watercraft quieter and 
less polluting. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for Kawasaki and other leading manufacturers did not  
immediately return calls seeking comment on the Bombardier 
proposal.

<HEADLINE> CBOT Directors Side With Donovan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The directors of the Chicago Board of Trade gave  
President Thomas R. Donovan a vote of confidence Monday in his 
battle with Chairman David P. Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
	The directors rallied around Donovan, 61, a week after Brennan,  
41, tried to enlist their help in a failed attempt to oust the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-member board of directors enacted several motions  
designed to renew confidence in Donovan's leadership and 
policy-making structure. The board also called for ``unity and 
communication among the chairman, president and full board of 
directors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Brennan issued a statement supporting Donovan and the  
board's action. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sincerely regret and accept responsibility for the events of  
the past week. I intend to demonstrate that Tom and I can work 
together,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether Brennan -- who was elected by CBOT members  
last December in a narrow upset victory over longtime Chairman 
Patrick H. Arbor -- could be ousted by the directors. Others 
questioned the wisdom of such a move at a time when the CBOT and 
the whole pit-based futures industry is under heavy competition 
from lower-cost electronic rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Brennan who scrapped a Donovan-supported alliance with  
the electronic German-Swiss Eurex exchange earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Blacks Criticize Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Harry Dunbar has worked for the Social  
Security Administration for almost two decades without ever getting 
a promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had hoped that at some point the agency would use my  
skills,'' said Dunbar, who said he has a college degree but 
described his job as ``paper pushing and, every once in a while, 
furniture moving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a waste of the government's money and my ability,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now in his 50s, Dunbar, who is black, is part of a class-action  
complaint alleging that black male employees get fewer promotions 
and more unsatisfactory job evaluations than warranted by their 
numbers at Social Security's headquarters near Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	He was among scores of the men who traveled by bus to a news  
conference on Monday outside the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission's offices here. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunbar and two others first filed their complaint with the EEOC  
in 1995. After a four-year delay caused by the Social Security 
Administration's challenges to the men's right to pursue the 
complaint jointly, the EEOC ruled this year that the case could 
move forward. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission has made no ruling yet on the merits of the  
complaints. A preliminary hearing before an EEOC judge is scheduled 
for May 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security officials denied that the agency treats black  
male employees unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Social Security is one of the most diverse, if not the most  
diverse agency in all of government,'' said Paul Barnes, the 
agency's deputy commissioner of human resources. ``We really do 
look like the America we serve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes said that at Social Security headquarters, where the bias  
complaints are being made, 6.7 percent of workers are black men, 
compared with 5.2 percent in the civilian work force nationally. Of 
the most senior executives, 10 percent are black men. And last 
year, 6.1 percent of headquarters employees who received promotions 
were black men. 
</P>
<P>
	As required by law, Social Security has notified 612 current and  
former black male employees of the agency's headquarters who are 
potential members of the class-action complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the three men who originated the complaint --  
Dunbar, Gilbert A. Jefferson and Kenneth A. Burden -- said they have 
heard from more than 100 others who claim to have had similar 
experiences. They are seeking monetary compensation for the men and 
changes in Social Security's personnel system to ensure fairness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Systematic discrimination has been going on against African  
Americans at the Social Security Administration for decades,'' said 
Michael Kator of the Washington labor-law firm Kator, Scott &AMP; 
Parks. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Kator said statistics on black women's experiences at  
Social Security ``didn't bear out as great a disparity,'' as for 
black men. 
</P>
<P>
	According to 1994 figures reported by Social Security, Kator  
said, black men comprised 9 percent of the workforce in one 
department employing 3,000 people, the agency's Office of the 
Deputy Commissioner for Finance, Assessment and Management. But 
black men in that department received 51.9 percent of the 
disciplinary actions, 75 percent of the discharges and only 6.3 of 
the promotions to the top three federal pay grades.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Threats Disrupt Educators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUNSWICK, Maine (AP) -- When threatening phone calls used to  
ring at Maine's schools, posing the potential to disrupt classes, 
the temptation used to be to call it a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
	No longer. Mindful of recent on-campus violence, school  
authorities don't consider bomb threats on campus as mere crank 
calls made to avoid tests or dodge assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine schools have recorded a half-dozen bomb threats over the  
past month -- reflecting a problem across the country. In Brunswick 
recently, all it took was a single phone call just after midnight 
to turn the town upside down for a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone called police to say there was a bomb in the local high  
school. Within an hour, officer Mark Lafountain could hear his 
heart pounding as he and several bomb-sniffing dogs were inching 
through every corner of the school. 
</P>
<P>
	No bomb was found. But the threat shut down the town's six  
schools for the day, forcing parents to scramble for day care and 
tacking an extra school day onto the summer holiday for 3,322 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials should be wary and have ready a crisis  
management plan to handle explosives or bomb threats, said Ronald 
Stephens at the National School Safety Center near Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``In light of the significant levels of violence that our public  
schools have experienced for the past year and a half, it has 
dramatically changed the way threats are being handled,'' Stephens 
said. ``Threats can no longer be taken lightly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1997, school-related violence has erupted on several  
occasions, most notoriously in Jonesboro, Ark.; in Pearl, Miss.; 
West Paducah, Ky.; Edinboro, Pa.; Fayetteville, Tenn.; Springfield, 
Ore.; and Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no precise figures on the number of bomb threats at  
schools because educators are not required to report such 
incidents, said Michael Higgins, special programs coordinator for 
the Maine Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
	In East Montpelier, Vt., educators got so fed up after seven  
bomb threats at a high school that they decided to rethink the 
policy of canceling school. Instead, classes were moved outside. 
Lunch was served from trucks and portable toilets lined the 
athletic field. 
</P>
<P>
	After five threats in two weeks last fall, Fort Dodge Senior  
High School in Iowa began requiring that materials be delivered in 
clear containers. Students are greeted by two guards posted at the 
building's only entrance. 
</P>
<P>
	In Maryland's Anne Arundel County, hundreds of students phoned  
in or posted bogus bomb threats, forcing nearly daily evacuations. 
Now callers to at least one Annapolis high school are greeted by a 
warning that calls may be recorded or traced. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Jersey, the Lower Camden County Regional School District  
adopted a tough expulsion policy last year after it had 50 hoaxes 
at its four schools. Criminal charges have been filed against 27 
people, including 24 students. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if no bomb accompanies the threat, it's still a headache  
for authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge disruption in the normal course of business,''  
said Brunswick Police Chief Jerry Hinton. ``This just isn't kids 
out of school for a day. You can't put a dollar figure on it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In Brunswick, Lafountain and the dogs had to check out the  
entire school, including lockers, ceiling tiles and the noisy 
boiler room. 
</P>
<P>
	He could not turn on the lights, nor could he use radio  
communications, because of fears that electricity or radio waves 
could set off an explosive device. And opening classroom doors was 
terrifying. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always wonder if it's booby-trapped,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Four Plead Guilty to Cross Burning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, La. (AP) -- Four men pleaded guilty today to burning  
a cross in front of the house of a white woman who took in an 
interracial couple and their family seeking refuge from a 
hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Delane Norman, 25, James Norris Friday, 23, Matthew Ryan  
Morgan, 19, and Huey Kenneth Martin, 18, admitted to a federal 
civil rights conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Each faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine at a  
sentencing scheduled for July 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman was the sister of a woman who along with her husband  
and children were fleeing the approach of Hurricane Georges. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said crosses were burned in front of the house in  
Goldonna on two nights in September 1998. Prosecutors said one the 
men said: ``No blacks sleep in Goldonna.''

<HEADLINE> Meatpackers' Prices May Be Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two lawmakers predicted today that legislation  
requiring meatpackers to reveal the prices they pay will win 
passage in Congress this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and House  
Agriculture Chairman Larry Combest, R-Texas, made the prediction 
about what is called mandatory price reporting during separate 
comments with reporters. 
</P>

	Pressure has been building for mandatory price reporting in the  
last year. All areas of livestock are experiencing low prices, 
particularly the hog industry, where prices have dipped to their 
lowest levels in four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers have accused big companies of pushing them out by  
keeping prices secret.

	``I believe without question by the end of the year there will  
be mandatory price reporting,'' Combest said.

<HEADLINE> Court To Decide Self-Representation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to use a  
California case to decide whether people convicted of a crime have 
a constitutional right to refuse a lawyer's help and represent 
themselves on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said it will hear a California man's argument that he  
should be allowed to file and argue his own appeal from his 
embezzlement conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Salvador Martinez acted as his own lawyer during his trial last  
year in Orange County state court. The jury that convicted him also 
found that he had three prior convictions under California's 
``three-strikes'' law. Therefore, he was sentenced to 25 years to 
life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Last September, Martinez filed notice that he planned to appeal  
and was waiving his right to a lawyer. A state appeals court barred 
him from representing himself, relying on a California appeals 
court decision in 1976 that said ``a criminal defendant has no 
right under the U.S. Constitution of self-representation on 
appeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California's highest court denied review last October.  
</P>
<P>
	In his self-written brief asking the Supreme Court to hear his  
appeal, Martinez said state and federal appeals courts had split on 
whether the Constitution's Sixth Amendment -- which has been 
interpreted as giving defendants the right to represent themselves 
at trial -- also provides that right on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, California's lawyers said states are free to devise  
their own systems of review in criminal cases. California rules 
provide for appointment of lawyers to represent indigent 
defendants, they added. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing in the text of the Constitution which  
guarantees to a criminal defendant the right to elect 
self-representation on appeal,'' the state's lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Martinez vs. Court of Appeal of California, 98-7809.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Allows Turtle Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to kill a  
lawsuit seeking to force a Florida county to do more to protect 
endangered and threatened sea turtles. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, turned away arguments that local  
governments cannot be sued under the federal Endangered Species Act 
for allegedly doing a bad job of regulating private citizens' 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The county's appeal had raised an intriguing question of  
environmental law and the constitutional balance between federal 
authority and states' rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Female adult sea turtles come ashore in the spring, deposit eggs  
in the sand and return to the ocean. Months later, when sea turtle 
hatchlings break out of their shells at night, they instinctively 
crawl toward the brightest light on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	On an undeveloped beach, the brightest light is the moon's  
reflection off the surf. But in a developed area, the brightest 
light can be beachfront lighting -- street lamps, car headlights or 
someone's porch light. Hatchlings attracted to such lights can die 
without reaching the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Volusia County, Fla., has more than 40 miles of Atlantic Ocean  
beaches, including the communities of Daytona Beach, Daytona Beach 
Shores, Ormond Beach and New Smyrna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The county, not the individual municipalities, has regulatory  
control of all beaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Two women sued the county in 1995, contending that the  
Endangered Species Act required its officials to do more to protect 
three turtle species from the effects of beachfront lights. The 
species are the loggerhead, green and leatherback turtle. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal trial judge dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that the  
women could not sue the county because its regulation of lighting 
did not in itself illegally ``take'' a protected species. Under the 
federal law, ``take'' means to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, 
kill, trap, capture or collect a protected creature. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the lawsuit  
last August, ruling by a 2-1 vote that the women had the proper 
legal standing to sue the county of its allegedly inadequate 
regulation of ``light users'' in developed beach areas. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, Volusia County's lawyers argued  
that the appeals court wrongly had expanded the reach of the 
federal law. No other court previously had ruled that the absence 
of private-conduct regulation can violate the Endangered Species 
Act, the appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Interpreting the law in that way, the appeal said, intrudes on  
state sovereignty in violation of the Constitution's 10th 
Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Two conservative legal advocacy groups filed friend-of-the-court  
briefs urging the justices to grant the county's appeal. One of 
them, the Pacific Legal Foundation, said the county was being held 
accountable because it ``has not made it illegal to turn on a porch 
light in Daytona Beach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Volusia County vs. Loggerhead Turtle, 98-1137.

<HEADLINE> CBOT Directors Side With Donovan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The directors of the Chicago Board of Trade gave  
President Thomas R. Donovan a vote of confidence in his battle with 
Chairman David P. Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
	The directors rallied around Donovan, 61, on Monday a week after  
Brennan, 41, tried to enlist their help in a failed attempt to oust 
the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-member board of directors enacted several motions  
designed to renew confidence in Donovan's leadership and 
policy-making structure. The board also called for ``unity and 
communication among the chairman, president and full board of 
directors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Brennan issued a statement supporting Donovan and the  
board's action. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sincerely regret and accept responsibility for the events of  
the past week. I intend to demonstrate that Tom and I can work 
together,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether Brennan -- who was elected by CBOT members  
last December in a narrow upset victory over longtime Chairman 
Patrick H. Arbor -- could be ousted by the directors. Others 
questioned the wisdom of such a move at a time when the CBOT and 
the whole pit-based futures industry is under heavy competition 
from lower-cost electronic rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Brennan who scrapped a Donovan-supported alliance with  
the electronic German-Swiss Eurex exchange earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Chebet Wins Boston Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Kenya's men added yet another victory to their  
decade of dominance at the Boston Marathon, and Ethiopia's Fatuma 
Roba kept her own formidable streak alive, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Chebet, a runner-up in his previous three marathons,  
ended his string of second-place finishes by winning Monday's race 
in 2 hours, 9 minutes, 52 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Chebet became the ninth straight Kenyan champion, equaling the  
race record set by U.S. runners between 1916-25 at a time when few 
foreigners entered the race. There was no individual competition in 
1918, only a team race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody in the world is trying to catch the Kenyans, but  
they can't,'' Chebet said. 
</P>
<P>
	The smooth-gliding Roba, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist, eased  
to victory at 2:23:25, matching the three consecutive titles won by 
Germany's Uta Pippig from 1994-96. They are the only two to win 
three in a row since women officially became part of the race in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	While Chebet and Roba overwhelmed their opposition, two crowd  
favorites -- defending champion Moses Tanui of Kenya and four-time 
champion Bill Rodgers -- did not finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanui, also the champion in the race's centennial year in 1996,  
apparently was bothered by leg cramps and dropped out near the 
23-mile mark. Rodgers, seeking to break the course record for 
over-50 by an American, dropped out shortly before the 21-mile mark 
because of dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can run the race,'' the 51-year-old Rodgers said, ``but I  
can't push hard for records. I have to run more carefully, then 
I'll finish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another popular New Englander, Lynn Jennings, was 12th among the  
women in her first official marathon at 2:38:37. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennings, 38, had run the marathon as an unofficial competitor  
in 1978 when she was a 17-year-old high school senior and ran about 
2:46, a time that would have placed her third. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a rough go,'' Jennings said. ``It's slower than I  
thought, but I'm glad I qualified for the Olympic trials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Chebet, whose previous two losses were by three seconds  
each, this was his third victory. He won the first two marathons he 
entered, at Amsterdam in 1996 and at Turin, Italy, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	After his heartbreaking losses last year, Chebet said he had to  
train harder to win again, and this time, he began preparing about 
two months ahead of his previous schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The dogged Chebet took the lead for good just past 22 miles from  
Ecuador's Silvio Guerra. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerra, seeking to become the first South American winner since  
Colombia's Elviro Mejia in 1971, built his lead between miles 17 
and 22 to as much as a quarter-mile before he began laboring. 
</P>
<P>
	``To win a race, you have to take a risk, so I took the lead,''  
Guerra said. ``I started to push hard, but after 29 miles, I 
started to get blisters on my feet and slowed down. I didn't know 
how hard it would be in the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was ready for this race. I had been training in Boulder  
(Colo.) for six months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guerra held on to finish second at 2:10:18 and was followed by  
two South Africans -- Frank Pooe at 2:11:37 and Abner Chipu at 
2:12:45. Kenya's John Kagwe, who beat Chebet at New York in 1997 
and 1998, wound up fifth for the second straight year at 2:13:57. 
</P>
<P>
	As often happens in a marathon, the early pacesetters eventually  
dropped from the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Cheruiyot of Kenya, a first-time marathoner, led most of  
the way through mile 17 before dropping out. For the women, 
20-year-old Sun Yingjie of China -- with her unusual running style -- 
was in front until just after the halfway mark, when Roba and 
Kenya's Catherine Ndereba, making her marathon debut, swept past 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	Yingjie, running with her hands mostly at her sides, reeled off  
some sensational early splits before her relative inexperience 
showed, and she began faltering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that the pace was very fast, so I had to run fast,  
too,'' Roba said, after running the fourth-fastest women's time at 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Roba ran the final miles with a headband given to her by fans  
along the course. The large Ethiopian community in the Boston area 
have given Roba great support. 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave me a big boost,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Roba was followed by 1997 New York City champion Franziska  
Rochat-Moser of Switzerland at 2:25:51, two-time Olympic medalist 
Yuko Arimori of Japan at 2:26:39 and South African Colleen de Reuck 
at 2:27:53. 
</P>
<P>
	The wheelchair champions each won for the third consecutive  
year, with Franz Nietlispach of Switzerland taking the men's title 
at 1:21:36 and Louise Savage of Australia edging seven-time winner 
Jean Driscoll of Champaign, Ill., for the women's crown, with both 
timed at 1:42:23. 
</P>
<P>
	The 103rd running of the race, held annually on Patriot's Day,  
drew a field of 12,797, the second-largest in history, behind only 
the 38,708 who started in 1996. This was the 75th year the race 
began in the sleepy little town of Hopkinton. Before that, the 
distance was only 24 miles and started in Ashland, and was run on 
dirt roads. This also was the 25th year for the wheelchair 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Chebet and Roba completed two days of marathon prowess by  
Africans. On Sunday, Abdelkader El Mouaziz of Morocco and Joyce 
Chepchumba of Kenya won in London, and Kenyans Japhet Kosgei and 
Tegla Loroupe won in Rotterdam.

<HEADLINE> Heat Looking for Late-Season Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami Heat have had fast starts and  
disappointing finishes under Pat Riley. Now, with the fourth 
quarter of the regular season under way, they're trying to come up 
with a new ending. 
</P>
<P>
	Until mid-March, the Heat looked like the team to beat in the  
Eastern Conference, but their 92-88 victory over the Pacers on 
Sunday left them just 8-8 over the past month. Despite weariness 
from the lockout-condensed schedule, Miami is looking for a 
late-season surge. 
</P>
<P>
	``For everybody in this league, there's a big drain mentally,''  
Riley said. ``Games are coming so quick, it's really difficult. 
It's hard to keep the guys excited, even though they know what's at 
stake. You have to find a way to dig down and conjure it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final 10 games of the regular season will determine the  
Heat's fate. They began the week with the second-best record in the 
East, two games behind Orlando and one game ahead of Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	If that's where the Heat finish, they would be a No. 2 seed in  
the playoffs and would probably have to face Indiana and Orlando to 
reach the NBA Finals -- a daunting prospect. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the Heat overtake Orlando to earn the No. 1 seed, they  
could avoid facing the Pacers or Magic until the conference finals, 
a much more inviting path. 
</P>
<P>
	``The three teams at the top right now are fighting for their  
lives,'' Miami center Alonzo Mourning said. ``It's up for grabs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana game was the Heat's 18th in a row below 100 points,  
and there have been uncharacteristic defensive lapses, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to play the way we've been playing, or you'll  
end up with another first-round disappointment in the playoffs,'' 
forward P.J. Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, the Heat lost six of their final nine games,  
stumbled into the playoffs and were eliminated in the opening round 
by the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's encouraging win over the Pacers was the first of six  
consecutive games against probable playoff teams. That includes a 
showdown Thursday at Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers, who finished 2-2 against the Heat, expect to see  
Miami again in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure we will,'' Indiana guard Reggie Miller said. ``You're  
going to have to go through Miami as well as Orlando to come out of 
the East.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Heat are clicking, they still can look like the best  
team in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning, a dominant defensive force and an improved player  
offensively, is being touted by teammates for consideration as the 
NBA MVP. Tim Hardaway remains one of the league's best clutch 
scorers, Brown has developed a reliable outside shot, and Jamal 
Mashburn and Terry Porter offer other offensive options. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing about the Heat is they play hard for 48 minutes,''  
Pacers swingman Antonio Davis said. ``That's one of the reasons 
they're so tough. If you have just a small lull, they're right 
there ready to jump on you.''

<HEADLINE> Man Wants Money in Library Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- An Alaska man wants the city to pay for  
damage to his truck, which was briefly connected to last week's 
deadly shooting at the Mormon church's genealogical library. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Keith Coben Jr., 54, is seeking $5,000 in damages caused  
when the bomb squad blew a hole through his moving van and inserted 
a camera to look at the cargo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I gave them my keys, they didn't need to blow up my truck,''  
Coben told The Salt Lake Tribune in Sunday's editions. ``If the 
police would have either listened or bothered to listen to me they 
would have known in a few minutes that I was not involved in 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City police Lt. Phil Kirk said officers were only  
acting with prudence during the chaotic hours after Thursday's 
shooting. Coben's yellow moving van was parked three blocks from 
the Family History Library when 71-year-old Sergei Babarin walked 
into the center and allegedly opened fire with a .22-caliber 
handgun, killing two and wounding four. He was killed by police. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers said there was a note pinned to the van reading, ``This  
is a dangerous vehicle because it has gas in it. Any questions and 
I will be up at the library.'' The van contained two 55-gallon 
drums of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	Coben -- whom police say argued with an employee at the library  
earlier that day -- was handcuffed and held at the police station 
for nearly seven hours while investigators verified that his truck 
was not connected with the shooting and not wired for explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under the circumstances, which were extraordinary, we needed  
to question him because of a series of eerie coincidences,'' Kirk 
said. ``In order to rule him out, it required extensive 
interviewing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coben said he had the gas in the back of his truck because he  
needed the weight to drive on icy roads from his home in Wasilla, 
Alaska, and fuel is expensive and difficult to find in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he stopped in to pick up a book at the library, but was  
not involved in a dispute. And he is upset that after the large 
hole was blown in the side of his vehicle, bomb squad members still 
cut the lock to the back door when they entered the van. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk said officers acted appropriately during the potentially  
volatile situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If, in fact, it was an explosive device in the vehicle, we  
were faced with the possibility of a booby trap. We had to take all 
the precautions we could,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk apologized for causing the damage.  
</P>
<P>
	``We want to do our best to make it right,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Coben said his truck sustained about $2,700 in damage, and there  
was damage to $2,500 worth of equipment in the truck. His lawyers 
are scheduled to meet with city attorneys today to determine if he 
will be compensated.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Take Chimp Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today let a New York man  
pursue a lawsuit that accuses the federal government of letting 
zoos and research facilities keep chimpanzees and other primates in 
inhumane conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, turned down a medical research  
group's argument that the man who filed the lawsuit lacks the 
proper legal standing. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Animal Welfare Act requires the Agriculture  
Department to set minimum standards for ensuring that zoos, 
research facilities and animal dealers house primates in ways that 
promote their psychological well-being. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Jurnove of Plainview, N.Y., sued the government in 1996,  
saying it unlawfully let zoos and research facilities set their own 
standards. The Agriculture Department has determined that primates 
need to be housed in groups, but its rules allow facilities to 
house them alone, Jurnove said. 
</P>
<P>
	He based his claim of legal standing on the fact that he visited  
the Long Island Game Farm in Manorville, N.Y., and found a 
chimpanzee and a Japanese Snow Macaque each housed alone, and 
squirrel monkeys housed next to bears that frightened them. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawsuit said seeing the animals in those conditions caused  
him ``extreme aesthetic harm and emotional and physical distress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a federal judge in the District of Columbia ruled for  
Jurnove, the National Association for Biomedical Research joined 
the case as a defendant so it could file an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the  
District of Columbia ruled that Jurnove lacked standing to sue, but 
the full appeals court reversed that decision and reinstated his 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, the research group's lawyers said  
people cannot sue over their ``emotional response'' to the way 
animals are housed unless the conditions might reduce the number of 
animals for future viewing. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers agreed that the appeals court erred, but  
added the appeal was premature because there had been no ruling on 
the merits of Jurnove's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is National Association for Biomedical Research vs.  
Animal Legal Defense Fund, 98-1059.

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma City Bombing Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Relatives of bombing victims clutched  
flowers, photos and buttons, wiped away tears and hugged children 
as they gathered today on a plaza where four years before, victims 
of the federal building bombing had been brought. 
</P>
<P>
	In a low-key ceremony marking the fourth anniversary of the  
April 19, 1995, bombing, a crowd of about 300 looked out over a 
site under construction as workers took a morning break from their 
tasks in building a memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	A worker in a hard hat stood in a blown-out window of the  
Journal Record Building and others stood on the red dirt of the 
memorial grounds. Nearby, workers perched on the roof of a damaged 
church to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not want another city to experience what we have endured  
here,'' said Bob Johnson, chairman of the Oklahoma City National 
Memorial Foundation trust. ``Let what you see around you, this 
construction, be a symbol for renewal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence of the destructive bomb remained four years later.  
Tiles were loose on the plaza. Plywood boards covered some areas 
where small trees and bushes once grew. The boarded-up YMCA 
building stood to the east of the damaged Journal Record building 
and renovations continued on a nearby church. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an honor to be back in Oklahoma today to pay respect to  
the people who died in the bombing,'' said Don Forsyth, battalion 
chief of the Orange County (Calif.) Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
	As the names of the 168 dead were read, family and friends  
dropped flowers over a glass wall onto the site where the 
nine-story Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building once stood. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of tough but I am glad to be here,'' said Rudy  
Guzman, whose brother was killed in the blast. ``I was restless 
last night but this is very nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Denny and his wife took their two young children, who were  
severely injured in the explosion, to the site for the memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we need to keep remembering the people who gave their  
lives in the bombing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony is the last such observance before the permanent  
memorial park is completed next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors ``can begin to see what it's going to become and how  
powerful it's going to become,'' says Kari Ferguson, spokeswoman 
for the Oklahoma City National Memorial Foundation. ``I think it 
will forever draw people from around the world who want to learn 
more about that moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today also marks a key anniversary in far right circles. On  
April 19 the opening shots were fired in Lexington and Concord, 
Mass., to begin the Revolutionary War. It was also the date of the 
fiery federal raid at Waco, Texas, and the Oklahoma City bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, extremist Richard Wayne Snell was executed in  
Arkansas the day of the bombing for the 1983 murder of a Texarkana 
pawnbroker whom Snell thought was Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Aryan Circle prison gang had called for a  
gathering today in Jasper, Texas, but nothing specific was 
scheduled and no problems had been reported as of midday. A court 
hearing had been moved from today to Tuesday because of concerns 
there might be problems. The city, where a black man was dragged to 
his death behind a pickup last June, had authorities on alert. 
</P>
<P>
	John George, co-author of ``American Extremists,'' and  
``Marxists, Communists, Klansmen and Others On The Fringe,'' hopes 
there won't be any violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing happened on the past three 19ths. Why should it be the  
19th four years later?'' he said. ``Of course, you should keep your 
eyes open all the time but it's unlikely anything will occur.''

<HEADLINE> Peter Arnett Leaves CNN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CNN has parted ways with Peter Arnett, the  
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who dropped out of sight after a 
report charging the U.S. military used nerve gas on American 
defectors during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN and Arnett issued a terse statement today saying Arnett was  
leaving after 18 years effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are grateful for Peter's contributions to CNN and we wish  
him the very best in the future,'' said CNN chairman Tom Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN officials wouldn't comment further.  
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued Monday, Arnett said that ``I've had a long  
and wonderful relationship with CNN and have been proud to be part 
of this great news organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arnett was the correspondent for the June 1998 ``Tailwind''  
report that charged the U.S. military used the deadly nerve gas 
sarin in a 1970 mission to hunt down American defectors. 
</P>
<P>
	The story was retracted after an internal investigation found  
the charges unsubstantiated. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN fired two producers of the report, and others resigned or  
offered to quit. Arnett was reprimanded but kept his job after 
telling management that he had little to do with the reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Arnett made only one appearance on the air at CNN,  
reporting about Algeria on Dec. 3, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnett, who covered conflicts in Bosnia in 1994 and Yugoslavia  
in 1996 and 1997, told The New York Times he asked CNN to send him 
to Yugoslavia to cover the current NATO bombings, ``but CNN has not 
seen fit to send me there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave me a beeper, and they said, `Sit by the beeper.' But  
it hasn't beeped,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnett, who did not return repeated phone calls from The  
Associated Press on Monday, told USA Today that he felt ``my legs 
have been cut out from under me'' by CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an organization I love,'' he said. ``But this is  
pretty shabby treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arnett won a Pulitzer Prize in 1966 for reporting from Vietnam  
for The Associated Press. He left to join CNN during the cable 
network's infancy, in 1981.

<HEADLINE> Toyota, GM To Make Fuel-Cell Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Toyota Motor Corp. and General Motors Corp. have  
reached a five-year agreement to jointly develop cars and trucks 
that can run off fuel cells and other environmentally friendly 
alternative-fuel technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pooling our efforts should result in commercially viable  
advanced technologies faster and at a lower cost to our customers, 
and as breakthroughs are reached, suppliers will be able to count 
on the volume of production from two of the world's largest 
automakers,'' GM vice chairman Harry Pearce said in remarks 
prepared for delivery today at a Detroit news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	GM, the world's largest automaker, and No. 3 Toyota have worked  
on several joint ventures, including a California-based venture to 
produce small cars and to market of GM's Cavalier cars through 
Toyota's sales network in Japan. They had been in talks on the 
advanced technology venture since last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The new venture will involve research and development of  
electric, hybrid electric and fuel-cell technology. Hybrid electric 
vehicles typically combine an electric motor with other power 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is to last through 2004, the year that GM, Ford Motor  
Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG have said they plan to be ready to 
produce fuel-cell vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's announcement also comes a day before Ford,  
DaimlerChrysler and Ballard Power Systems Inc., a fuel-cell 
developer, plan to announce a deal with oil companies to develop a 
demonstration fleet of fuel-cell powered vehicles in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuel cells produce electricity using a chemical reaction between  
hydrogen and oxygen and produce little or no emissions. The 
technology was developed for use in spacecraft, but problems in 
supplying and storing hydrogen have hampered plans to use it for 
cars. So far, fuel cells remain prohibitively expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler has been working on technology to convert  
gasoline to hydrogen on board the car, eliminating the need for a 
heavy, expensive hydrogen storage tank. 
</P>
<P>
	GM and Toyota have been working on alternative-fuel vehicles for  
years. GM was the first to mass-market an electric car, the EV1, 
which has failed to catch on in the markets where it is being 
leased. Toyota brought the first hybrid electric car to market, the 
Prius, in Japan two years ago. The Prius uses gasoline and 
electricity and is scheduled to go on sale in the United States and 
Europe next year.

<HEADLINE>  Williams Hears Saints' Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- After facing the fans and media on draft day,  
next weekend's New Orleans Saints minicamp should be a breeze for 
Ricky Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the first thing I need to do is go in there and show  
the veterans that I'm going to go out there and work as hard as 
they do,'' Williams said. ``Show them that I'm not going to be just 
an overpaid rookie, but I'm going to be a football player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing Williams doesn't have to do is convince his coach.  
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Ditka donned shoulder-length dreadlocks to welcome  
Williams to the Saints on Sunday. And he told about 4,000 fans -- 
most of whom wore ``We got Ricky'' T-shirts, chanted, screamed for 
autographs and snapped pictures -- that Williams was the key to 
getting to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was more modest.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say I'm a savior,'' he said. ``Life's a puzzle, and  
hopefully I can be the missing piece to that puzzle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans, which hasn't had a winning record in six years or a  
1,000-yard rusher in a decade, traded away every pick after the 
first one this year, and its first- and third-round picks next year 
to get the Heisman Trophy winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``We drafted him because he is a great football player. I don't  
think the Saints have had an identity football player, really, 
since Archie (Manning),'' Ditka said. ``He's the first marquee 
player this organization has had in a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka, who joked he'd had his hair restyled Sunday morning to  
celebrate getting the big back with the distinctive hairstyle, 
compared Williams to Walter Payton, the Hall of Fame back who 
carried the Chicago Bears and Ditka to glory in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said that was an exaggeration, insisting he just plays  
hard and loves doing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just run the ball and try to get to the end zone, and  
whatever happens in-between is just pretty much all instinct,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans has back-to-back 6-10 records under Ditka. Last  
year, the offense was ranked 28th in the NFL -- dead last in yards 
rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting Williams will change that, Saints officials believe.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is one player who's going to make our football team a lot  
better on offense,'' said general manager Bill Kuharich. ``He's 
going to help our tight ends, our wide receivers, our quarterback 
and our offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an awful lot of pressure to say that one player can get  
us to the Super Bowl. But if he can carry us on his back, God bless 
him. But I'm not putting undue pressure on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, the pick puts enormous pressure on everyone in the  
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka promised when he took the job that he would only stay  
three years if he could not turn the team into a winner. Now, with 
the sacrifice of eight potential players over two years, he's 
betting everything on Williams sparking a turnaround in the worst 
offense in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, he's going to be huge if he can get into the season  
healthy,'' said quarterback Billy Joe Hobert. ``It's going to be 
good for the fans, and it's going to be good for us. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, we're just going to move it on. No excuses now. We better  
go on to the playoffs or every one of us is going to be finding a 
new job next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' association with rapper Master P and No Limit Sports,  
which represents him, was reportedly one reason the Indianapolis 
Colts passed on him with the fourth pick. But the Saints and 
William's agent, Leland Hardy, said they expect no problem working 
out a contract. Hardy added he knows what he's looking for. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Mr. Williams should have a contract commensurate with  
his station as the greatest player in the history of the sport in 
the college game,'' Hardy said. ``Talk about his signability is of 
non-interest to me because all parties here are going into 
negotiations with a common interest. And that is to get Ricky 
Williams signed and in camp on time and try to get this football 
team to the playoffs and the Super Bowl as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Based on what Chicago Bears rookie running back Curtis Enis  
received in the No. 5 slot last year, Williams would get a five- or 
six-year contract worth about $2 million per season. The deal will 
include a signing bonus in the range of $7.5 million.

<HEADLINE> BellSouth Is Buying Into Qwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- BellSouth Corp. plans to invest about $3.5  
billion for a 10 percent equity stake in long-distance company 
Qwest Communications International. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal announced today, Denver-based Qwest will issue  
about 20.3 million new shares to BellSouth in exchange for 
approximately $1.93 billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Qwest's principal stockholder, Anschutz Company,  
will sell another 16.65 million shares to BellSouth for 
approximately $1.57 billion. This will reduce Anschutz Company's 
ownership interest in Qwest to approximately 39 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth and Qwest will jointly market Qwest's Internet and  
voice communications services along with BellSouth's local 
networking services. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a significant step in our objective of becoming the  
premier data communications provider to our customers,'' said Duane 
Ackerman, BellSouth chairman and chief executive. ``This 
relationship allows our customers to enjoy the range of benefits 
from a comprehensive set of Internet and broadband digital 
solutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If BellSouth gets approval to offer its own long-distance  
service, the companies plan to jointly off an array of services 
such as ATM and electronic commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is expected to close by the end of May.  
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based BellSouth is a $23 billion company that provides  
telecommunications, wireless communications, cable and digital TV, 
and Internet and data services to about 34 million customers in 19 
countries. Its primary service area is in Alabama, Florida, 
Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South 
Carolina and Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest delivers data, voice and image communications for  
businesses and consumers. It has more than 8,000 employees and 80 
sales offices in North America, Europe and Mexico.

<HEADLINE> No Relief in Sight for Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	You know it's dry when Sunbelt retirees start watering the  
cactus. 
</P>
<P>
	When mountain lions and other skittish wildlife emerge from the  
pinion scrub of the Sonora Desert to lap greedily from chlorinated 
swimming pools and fountains. 
</P>
<P>
	When a wall of wildfire 10 miles wide blackens a swath of  
Nebraska prairie the size of Rhode Island, stampeding cattle and 
forcing the midnight evacuation of a ranching town. 
</P>
<P>
	When priests and preachers hold prayer vigils in withered cotton  
fields and cracked, sage-choked reservoir basins, raising their 
arms to beseech the same clear blue heavens for a drop of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	And this was supposed to be an easy year.  
</P>
<P>
	After all, the record El Nino of 1998 is long gone. However,  
scientists say 1999 is shaping up to be another year of 
unpredictable, destructive weather. 
</P>
<P>
	A spotty but tenacious drought has been gripping parts of the  
nation for several months. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, Gov. George W. Bush has declared a state of emergency  
in 170 of the state's 254 counties. His order came nine months 
after a 1998 drought cost his state $10.4 billion in agriculture 
losses alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to be outdone, his brother Jeb, Florida's governor, declared  
his own drought emergency on April 13 and ordered the National 
Guard to help combat red-alert wildfire conditions for the second 
consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, wind-fanned flames forced nearly 1,000 residents  
across Florida to evacuate. In Port St. Lucie, more than 70 houses 
were damaged or destroyed Friday; fire reduced one neighborhood to 
ashes and a few charred refrigerators. And on Monday, the Alligator 
Alley highway was closed by a huge fire in the Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all or nothing,'' said Mark Svoboda, a forecaster with  
the National Drought Mitigation Center in Lincoln, Neb. ``For some 
places, the dryness has become an intense event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one is certain how much worse the drought will get.  
</P>
<P>
	Recent blizzards and thunderstorms have not been enough to slake  
the drought in many areas. Long-range forecasts by several federal 
agencies agree that dry conditions could persist with a vengeance 
throughout the Sunbelt and portions of the Midwest until July. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we get into a drought, we don't know how long it will  
last,'' said climatologist Kelly Redmond of the Desert Research 
Institute of Reno, Nev. ``That's because we don't have a good 
handle on why drought occurs. You can't predict something well if 
you don't know why it happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the problem lies in forecasters' difficulty in analyzing  
what isn't happening in the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Meteorologists can spot thunderstorms, blizzards and tornadoes  
snarling on the electronic horizon of their Double Doppler radars. 
And these storms behave according to a logic that is becoming more 
apparent every year. 
</P>
<P>
	But drought is the consequence of an accumulation of nonevents --  
the absence of storms, a lack of rainfall. A standard definition is 
a 30 percent drop in precipitation for three consecutive weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the dog not barking in the night,'' Redmond said. ``It's  
too many nice days in a row. By and by, you notice that something 
hasn't happened in a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like rain.  
</P>
<P>
	Once established, drought is likely to persist for months or  
years. Increasingly, scientists are looking into the past for clues 
as to when droughts start and stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies of climate trends spanning the past 10 centuries  
indicate that immediately following El Nino episodes, North America 
has periodically suffered cataclysmic droughts and wildfires that 
would make the Dust Bowl look lush. 
</P>
<P>
	We're overdue, scientists warn. And the effects of drought could  
be exaggerated by record high temperatures in the 1990s that some 
believe are the result of global warming caused by human 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're heading into a very, very dangerous situation,'' said  
University of Arizona tree ring expert Tom Swetnam. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really off the scale.''  
</P>
<P>
	This year, climate experts blame conditions on the opposite of  
El Nino -- La Nina. 
</P>
<P>
	Like its surly weather twin, it is generated by a  
continent-sized pool of water in the equatorial Pacific that 
conspires with the atmosphere to disrupt storm patterns around the 
globe. 
</P>
<P>
	But La Nina's characteristics are opposite of El Nino's. It  
water is cold rather than warm, and it occurs less frequently and 
predictably. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997-98, El Nino's water simmered at a record 9 degrees above  
normal. It left southeast Asia and Australia parched and decimated 
fisheries along the Pacific coastline from British Columbia to 
Chile. At the same time, it nearly submerged California in rain and 
mudslides while delivering copious rain to Arizona that nourished 
the best wildflower bloom in a generation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Texas and Florida sizzled with disastrous results all summer  
long. 
</P>
<P>
	When the record El Nino finally collapsed, the climate pendulum  
swung into a cold-water La Nina in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	It has reversed conditions in Asia, bringing chest-high  
floodwaters to India. Forecasters expect a vigorous hurricane 
season in the Caribbean this fall, too. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, La Nina has pushed the jet stream north.  
Weather patterns cleave the nation roughly in half, tracing the 
Interstate 80 corridor between New York City and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The southern half of the country generally is drier than normal,  
especially Arizona and New Mexico -- no wildflowers this year. And 
Texas and Florida remain dangerously dry again despite the switch 
to La Nina. 
</P>
<P>
	Circumstances north of I-80 couldn't be more different.  
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Mount Baker is poised to break the all-time North  
American snowfall record of 1,122 inches, or 93.5 feet of 
cumulative snow, that fell at Mount Rainier during the winter of 
1971-72. 
</P>
<P>
	Reservoirs are brimming, and downstream communities and farms  
face late-spring flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're fat with water,'' Redmond said, gazing out his window at  
the Sierra Nevada swaddled in a deep, white, icy blanket. ``But the 
further south you go, the worse it gets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	You don't have to remind George Davies.  
</P>
<P>
	Brown slopes on Mount Lemmon near Tucson forced the manager of  
Ski Valley to close the two chairlifts serving the nation's 
southernmost ski area for the first season in its 40-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	A foot of snow on April Fools' Day only aggravated matters; too  
skimpy for skiing, but it closed the only road to the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``I plan on one bad year in every five years,'' Davies said.  
``But I never thought that I would have a zero year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty miles and 6,000 feet downhill in Tucson, conditions have  
been remarkably dry even for the desert oasis. 
</P>
<P>
	The April Fools' storm sprayed more than an inch of cold rain on  
the city and surrounding rangeland. Until then, the area had 
received 0.01 inch of moisture since autumn. Precipitation is 80 
percent below normal. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures as high as 90 degrees have driven early season  
water consumption to midsummer levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar conditions grip cities across the nation's southern  
tier, including Albuquerque, El Paso and San Antonio. Even humid 
Houston has been relatively dry. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Diego, entrepreneurs have suggested bringing supertankers  
full of fresh water from the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Naples and other Florida cities are debating water restrictions.  
Birds and other wildlife in the Everglades National Park are 
suffering in a parched ecosystem that already is the subject of an 
intensive restoration following decades of water diversion by Big 
Sugar and other farm interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucson is especially vulnerable.  
</P>
<P>
	Its water utility started in the 19th century by delivering bags  
of spring water by burro to the barrios and mining camps. The city 
continues to suck water from its desert aquifer to irrigate thirsty 
golf resorts and subdivisions much faster than sporadic storms can 
replenish it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no place to go for more water,'' utility director  
David Modeer said. ``La Nina complicates everything we're doing. If 
the summer monsoon is late, we'll have a real problem meeting 
demand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Circumstances are no better for farmers.  
</P>
<P>
	In Texas alone, last year's El Nino drought cost farmers and  
their suppliers $10.4 billion, and 10 percent of growers went 
bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	Many regions across the state -- including areas near Abilene,  
Big Spring, San Angelo, Lubbock and Midland -- received below 
average rain this winter, and spring rains have been spotty. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers are planting seed in case the rains return, but it's a  
make-or-break year for many. The same is true for crop processors 
and farm suppliers. A Littlefield, Texas, cotton mill laid off 500 
workers in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all bleak,'' said Texas A&AMP;M economist Carl G. Anderson.  
``Farmers aren't very mobile. For them, it's a very slow process, 
but it becomes overwhelming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drought is raising immediate dangers, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of forest and range fires have been sparked since  
February, prompting federal officials to redeploy crews, tanker 
planes and funding from the wet North to the dry South. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, where 500,000 acres were roasted last summer, more  
than 2,450 wildfires have burned 130,000 acres and several homes so 
far this year. The biggest, in the Everglades, has charred more 
than 70,000 acres of grass. 
</P>
<P>
	With humidity levels dipping to a desert-dry 20 percent, the  
state's index of fire potential has soared above 600 -- 400 denotes 
significant danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in very dangerous, high-burn conditions,'' said state  
Fire Services deputy chief Frank Pocica. 
</P>
<P>
	And the danger is spreading. Last week, fires forced Georgia to  
evacuate campers from Stephen Foster State Park and briefly close a 
major highway north of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of residents of eastern Tennessee and western North  
Carolina were evacuated as fires burned 4,000 acres and a pair of 
vacation homes. 
</P>
<P>
	In central Nebraska's sandhills, the second-largest wildfire in  
state history consumed 78,000 acres of prairie grass on March 
19-20, killing one firefighter and hundreds of cattle. The town of 
Thedford was evacuated as the fire licked residents' doorsteps. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 9, a rare midwinter grass fire northeast of North  
Platte, Neb., burned 15,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	The most ominous fire zone is the Four Corners states -- Arizona,  
New Mexico, Colorado and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's mountain snowpack is 97 percent below normal in some  
ranges. Residents of isolated cabin communities are jittery after 
receiving unprecedented midwinter fire warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Should a conflagration occur, it would be impossible to  
evacuate people except by helicopter,'' said Mount Lemmon real 
estate broker Dick Bloomfield. ``There are many places that you 
can't get in with a fire truck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The losses would run deeper than just cabins. Forests are choked  
with so much dry fuel that a windswept inferno would incinerate all 
plant life. When rains return, soil that took 100,000 years to 
accumulate would be flushed into streams, carving gullies 40 feet 
deep in moments. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire experts have documented that over the past 1,000 years,  
huge wildfires burned during dry La Nina episodes that immediately 
followed wet El Ninos. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the worst years: 1575, 1748, 1851 and 1879.  
</P>
<P>
	It's a natural cycle, but the added risks of 100 years of  
fire-prevention efforts and population growth means the ecological 
and economic costs of wildfire this year could be among the highest 
in the past millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thousands of firefighters could slow it down here and there,''  
said Swetnam, the tree ring expert. ``But some of these forests 
that burn may not come back.''

<HEADLINE>  Germany Reclaims 'New' Reichstag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- With brass bands, waving flags and beaming  
politicians, parliament inaugurated its new home in the stately, 
restored Reichstag today, a landmark occasion in the government's 
return to its prewar capital Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	A solemn tone tempered the celebration. Chancellor Gerhard  
Schroeder noted that the move back to the capital -- scene of 
Prussian militarism and Third Reich totalitarianism -- came just as 
German troops were participating in NATO airstrikes against 
Yugoslavia, their first attack on a sovereign nation since World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our democracy and our parliament are strong and stable,''  
Schroeder said. ``The move to Berlin is not a break in the 
continuity of German postwar history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chancellor, speaking inside the building's new glass-walled  
parliament chamber, defended Germany's role in NATO airstrikes as 
its ``historic responsibility ... as a land that had two 
dictatorships in this century, as a land that brought genocide and 
aggression over our continent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder also reflected on the importance of Berlin, once  
divided into communist East and Allied-controlled, capitalist West, 
as the ``hinge of European unity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moving to Berlin means shifting Germany's seat of power  
eastward, which politicians also hope will bridge the gap between 
the nation's former communist eastern states and its more 
prosperous west. 
</P>
<P>
	Parliament's meeting in the Reichstag is the first big step in  
the move from Bonn, the provincial western city where West 
Germany's capital was relegated after World War II. Next come the 
election of a new German president in May and the new parliament 
session in September, the first to open in the new building. 
</P>
<P>
	To thunderous applause, parliament President Wolfgang Thierse  
promised lawmakers that the change in location did not mean a 
change in politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want another kind of policy, but as tranquil a move  
as possible from Bonn to Berlin,'' he declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Berlin's grim past had raised concern about the government's  
return there. But the new Reichstag, transformed by architect Sir 
Norman Foster's $330 million renovation, is as light as the 
capital's legacy is dark. 
</P>
<P>
	The glass walls around the central parliament chamber, plus a  
viewing ledge from the second floor, mean visitors can see and hear 
what lawmakers are doing inside. An immense, new glass dome atop 
the old building channels natural light to the lawmakers below. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want this glass dome to become a symbol for the openness and  
transparency of our democratic politics,'' Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to modern changes, the architect preserved the  
building's original 19th-century exterior, as well as wartime scars 
inside --damage from bombs and fires, and graffiti left behind by 
Soviet soldiers who seized the building in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	More than any other building in Berlin, the Reichstag has  
represented the different phases of Germany's turbulent, terrible 
history over the passing century. 
</P>
<P>
	It was burned during the Nazi era and bombed by Allied forces.  
East Germany built the Berlin Wall just a few steps from the 
Reichstag's back entrance. After the Wall came down, the artist 
Christo celebrated the end of communism by wrapping the Reichstag 
in a million square feet of silvery fabric. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1995 wrapping was the last big event held at the building  
until today's ceremony, kicked off by architect Foster's presenting 
a 20-inch-long key of his own design to the parliamentary 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Thierse grinned and held it over his head in celebration.  
Afterward, Lutheran and Roman Catholic bishops blessed the 
building.

<HEADLINE> Bengals Release QB Neil O'Donnell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Cincinnati Bengals released quarterback  
Neil O'Donnell on Monday, two days after they decided to go in 
another direction by drafting Akili Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell, 32, was released nine months after the Bengals signed  
him to a four-year, $17 million deal hoping he would end their 
decade-long search for a dependable passer. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell led the Bengals to two of their three victories last  
season, but struggled to produce points and move the offense 
consistently. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the Bengals committed themselves to Smith, general manager  
Mike Brown granted O'Donnell's request to release him so he would 
have time to hook up with another team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what he wants,'' Brown said. ``He wants to be freed to  
sign elsewhere as soon as possible. Last year when he came here, he 
came so late that it was hard for him to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time, he'll get a quicker start with a new team. That  
should be to his advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown had promised O'Donnell before the draft that if the  
Bengals chose a quarterback, he'd be released. Cincinnati took 
Smith in the first round and Scott Covington -- a candidate for 
their developmental squad -- in the seventh round. 
</P>
<P>
	The two draft picks gave Cincinnati six quarterbacks for one  
day. They still have five: Smith, Covington, Jeff Blake, Eric 
Kresser and Paul Justin. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell led Pittsburgh to the Super Bowl in 1996 and played  
for the New York Jets. He signed with the Bengals as a free agent 
last July shortly before training camp began, and won the starting 
job from Blake during preseason even though he was still learning 
the play book. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell started the first 11 games but was benched because his  
high completion rate wasn't translating into enough points or wins. 
When the backups also failed, O'Donnell regained the starting job 
for one game before breaking his passing hand. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished with a passer rating of 90.2, the highest of his  
career. He completed a career-best 61.8 percent of his passes and 
had the best touchdown-to-interception ratio of his career -- 15 to 
4. 
</P>
<P>
	He produced two of the Bengals' three wins, throwing for 303  
yards against Detroit and 298 yards against the Steelers. More 
often, he chose short, safe throws that failed to sustain drives. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, he completed 212 of 343 for 2,216 yards, averaging 6.5  
yards per attempt. He was sacked 30 times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals currently plan to start Blake next season -- the last  
under his current contract -- while Smith develops. That means that 
either Justin or Kresser will be released as well.

<HEADLINE> Spacecraft's Main Antenna Stuck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The main communications antenna on  
NASA's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft has become stuck and unable 
to automatically point toward Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	A hinge on the antenna stopped moving late last week and flight  
controllers were unable to solve the problem during the weekend, 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory spokeswoman Mary Hardin said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The antenna can still be used even if the hinge doesn't work.  
But that requires periodically halting the collection of science 
data and turning the entire spacecraft to point the antenna at 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft put itself into a so-called contingency mode when  
the problem occurred, shutting down all science instruments and 
shifting communication with flight controllers to its smaller 
antenna. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometime Monday engineers planned to command Mars Global  
Surveyor to transmit recorded data they hope would reveal what was 
happening on the spacecraft when the hinge stopped moving. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft was launched in November 1996 and has been  
orbiting Mars since September 1997 as part of a mapping mission of 
Earth's neighboring planet. 
</P>
<P>
	The hinge is one of two at the end of a boom on which the main  
antenna is mounted. One allows the antenna to move from side to 
side. The other one, which moves the antenna up and down, is the 
one that became stuck. 
</P>
<P>
	The hinges were designed to allow the antenna to keep pointing  
at Earth during communications sessions while the orbiting 
spacecraft keeps its instruments pointed at Mars to collect a 
continuous stream of images and data for mapping. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers do not believe the problem is related to the March 28  
deployment of the boom because the hinge had functioned properly 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Deployment of the boom from the folded position it had been in  
since the launch was a concern because of worries that a device to 
cushion the force would not work properly.

<HEADLINE> Celtic Battie Charged With Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Tony Battie of the Boston Celtics was arrested at  
gunpoint last weekend for allegedly assaulting a police officer who 
asked him to move his car outside a nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	Battie was arrested around 2:20 a.m. Saturday in front of the  
Cosmopolitan Club, Boston police spokeswoman Sgt. Detective Margot 
Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill said Battie refused to move his car, refused a request for  
proper identification and tried to drive off when the officer 
attempted to arrest him. The officer's arm was caught in the 
driver's window, Hill said, and the officer was forced to pull out 
his service revolver before Battie stopped the car. 
</P>
<P>
	Battie faces a charge of assault and battery with a dangerous  
weapon (the car) and a charge of refusing to identify himself to an 
officer 
</P>
<P>
	Celtics general manager Chris Wallace would not comment on the  
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Battie was in uniform Monday night for Boston's game against  
Indiana.

<HEADLINE> Bank Chief Urges EU Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The head of the European Bank for Reconstruction  
and Development urged European Union members on Monday to reform 
their economies to help boost growth both at home and in the former 
Soviet bloc. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank will increase lending to countries in Eastern Europe  
and the former Soviet Union despite losing an estimated $261 
million as a result of the financial crisis in Russia, Horst 
Koehler told the bank's shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank, which aims to promote the transition to market  
economies, is the largest investor in the private sectors of 
formerly communist countries. Its shareholders are governments and 
international organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now is the time to strengthen economic growth in the EU  
through a new boost for structural reforms in its member states,'' 
Koehler said at the bank's annual meeting. ``It is also the time 
for pursuing enlargement of the European Union to the East still 
more energetically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koehler said the union also should strengthen its ties with the  
Commonwealth of Independent States -- the former members of the 
Soviet Union -- and urged the Russian government to improve 
conditions for investment in that country. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank has made a $550 million provision for a loss that  
Koehler blamed on Russia's devaluation of the ruble and the 
collapse of Russia's banking system last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Koehler said the bank had reviewed its business strategy in  
Eastern Europe and will focus on more limited objectives, including 
support for small- and medium-sized companies there.

	TORONTO (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky -- still the focus of considerable  
attention in his first day of retirement -- might skate quickly into 
the Hockey Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, whose glittering 20-year NHL career ended Sunday in New  
York, was nominated Monday for membership in the Hall. Its 
selection committee plans to meet April 29 to vote on waiving for 
Gretzky the customary three-year waiting period for induction. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in Ottawa, the House of Commons unanimously approved  
a motion to create a Wayne Gretzky stamp. Parliament member Sarkis 
Assadourian asked Canada Post to issue a commemorative stamp 
recognizing The Great One's contributions to hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a singular star,'' said Daniel Kennedy, Assadourian's  
assistant. ``He's a homegrown boy who's had an unblemished 
career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To cap it off, Gretzky was named the NHL's player-of-the-week  
for the final week of the regular season -- the 44th time he's won 
the award. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, 38, retired from the NHL holding 61 records from a  
career that included 1,487 games, 894 goals and 1,963 assists. 
Gretzky played on four Stanley Cup-winning teams and league 
commissioner Gary Bettman announced before Sunday's game that the 
NHL will retire Gretzky's No. 99 league-wide. 
</P>
<P>
	With that resume, Gretzky is expected to become the 10th player  
in NHL history to have the Hall of Fame waive its waiting period. 
That last was Mario Lemieux in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wayne Gretzky's achievements, both on and off the ice, are  
unparalleled in the sport of hockey,'' said Jim Gregory, who heads 
the Hall's selection committee. ``Wayne definitively exemplifies 
all aspects of the election criteria, which include playing 
ability, sportsmanship, character and contributions to his teams 
and to the game of hockey in general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three-quarters of the committee's members must approve the  
resolution for it to go to the Hall's board of directors for 
consideration. The board meets June 14. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's induction ceremony will be held Nov. 22 in Toronto.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Fame is also awaiting word on what Gretzky  
memorabilia it will get from the Great One's final game Sunday at 
New York's Madison Square Garden.

<HEADLINE> Daewoo Plans Draw Skepticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Plans by the heavily indebted Daewoo  
Group to sell off its shipbuilding and other key businesses drew 
applause from the government but skepticism from economists and 
analysts Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under mounting pressure from the government, Daewoo, the  
nation's second largest conglomerate, announced plans Monday to 
sell off at least 26 businesses by October to improve its financial 
position and focus on key industries. 
</P>
<P>
	That will reduce the number of Daewoo's subsidiaries to eight in  
the automobile, trading and finance sectors and help to 
substantially lessen its debt, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided to take drastic measures to strengthen key sectors  
and contribute to the nation's economic recovery,'' Daewoo chairman 
Kim Woo-joong said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the plan calls for the sale of the  
shipbuilding division at Daewoo Heavy Industries Ltd., two 
Hilton-affiliated hotels and four electronics-related subsidiaries 
worth a total of $5.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daewoo chairman said the money to be raised will be  
reinvested in the automobile sector and used to pay off bank debts. 
Daewoo Motors Co., the nation's second largest car producer, is 
pushing to take over the industry's newcomer, Samsung Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Daewoo told its creditor banks it will pay back $24  
billion in debts this year by selling off assets. At the end of 
1998, Daewoo had $63 billion in total assets and $50 billion in 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've made a really huge decision,'' Lee Hun-jae, head of  
the government's Financial Supervisory Commission, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said Daewoo set an example for other conglomerates which  
have been slow to slim their overextended business portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
	But many analysts expressed skepticism about the feasibility of  
Daewoo's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are talking about selling a huge amount of assets. It is  
uncertain how they will find buyers for all that in such limited 
time,'' said Chun Joo-sung, an economics professor at Ewha Women's 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Chun and many other analysts noted that past promises by the  
nation's top conglomerates to slim down by selling their 
subsidiaries mostly went unfulfilled.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin To Meet Chechnya's President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin announced today he will  
meet the embattled leader of breakaway Chechnya and called for the 
republic to abandon its claim to independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting with Chechnya's President Aslan Maskhadov will be  
held in the Kremlin but no date has been set yet, Yeltsin was 
quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will talk about how to live on. What is important is that  
we gave (Chechnya) time to realize that the republic cannot live 
inside Russia without Russia,'' Yeltsin said. 
</P>
<P>
	No country has recognized Chechnya's independence claims. But  
the republic has been running its own affairs -- often openly 
defying Moscow -- since the end of the 1994-96 independence war. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Maskhadov said the Chechen president welcomed  
the opportunity to meet with Yeltsin, but would not give up the 
region's independence, Interfax reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chechnya is prepared for reasonable compromises that do not  
curb its independence,'' said the spokesman, Mairbek Vachagayev. 
</P>
<P>
	Maskhadov has been under pressure from Chechnya's warlords to  
adopt a tougher stance in dealing with Moscow and assert the 
republic's independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Several leading warlords are trying to oust Maskhadov, and there  
have been several attempts on his life in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin insisted Monday that Maskhadov was ``tuned to the  
wavelength'' of negotiating a compromise with Moscow, but hadn't 
yet done so because of strong opposition inside Chechnya, Interfax 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Maskhadov has been calling for a meeting with Yeltsin, but has  
given no indication publicly that he may be considering dropping 
independence claims.

<HEADLINE> Sheiks Enter Kentucky Derby Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Champion horses Aljabr and  
Worldly Manner boarded a flight Monday for the United States, where 
their Arab sheik owners are eyeing America's greatest racing title: 
the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	The chartered flight left Dubai and was to refuel in Shannon,  
Ireland, before heading to Kentucky, said Michael Osborne, chairman 
of the Emirates Racing Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The Al Maktoums, the rulers of the Gulf emirate and probably the  
richest and biggest horse racing owners in the world, have won just 
about every top race in Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Their bid for the May 1 Kentucky Derby is a shot at racing  
history: The Derby has never been won by an Arab owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hope is to win the Kentucky Derby and show how the  
Emirates is training horses,'' said Sheik Hamdan bin Rashid Al 
Maktoum, deputy ruler of Dubai. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Aljabr, a 3-year-old colt with impeccable bloodlines, and  
Worldly Manner, a bay brown colt, race under the Godolphin banner 
that represents the Al Maktoums. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldly Manner was one of the most successful 2-year-olds in  
America last year before the sheiks bought him from his American 
owners for $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kentucky Derby will be Worldly Manner's first start this  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The main force behind the Godolphin operations is Sheik Mohammed  
bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai's feisty crown prince with a passion 
for race horses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether or not we succeed (in Kentucky) we will go back,  
because Godolphin is an international stable and we want go 
wherever we can,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheik Mohammed drew a few snickers when he first started buying  
horse races to train in Dubai's sweltering desert climate. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we started Godolphin, my friends and advisers asked me,  
'What are you going to feed them, sand?''' Sheik Muhammed said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the five years since the Godolphin operations were set  
up, with stables in several countries, the Al Maktoum thoroughbreds 
have become a force in every major race in Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, in a bid to put Dubai firmly on the racing map, the Al  
Maktoums set up the Dubai World Cup, which attracts some of the 
world's best race horses. 
</P>
<P>
	They now plan to spend $15 million over three years for an  
annual ``World Series'' of nine thoroughbred competitions in eight 
countries, from Ascot to Hong Kong, finishing with the Dubai World 
Cup in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The great Cigar ran the inaugural World Cup. Last month, Silver  
Charm ran sixth in Dubai when Godolphin's own Almutawakel captured 
the $3 million first prize. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Derby, Godolphin will be trying to regroup after a recent  
setback. Prado's Landing, another Derby prospect who came over 
earlier, finished last in the Blue Grass Stakes in Lexington, Ky.

<HEADLINE> Chebet, Roba Win Boston Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Joseph Chebet found the secret of going from  
perennial runnerup to champion: train harder. 
</P>
<P>
	It might take a lot more than that for someone other than a  
Kenyan to win the Boston Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	Chebet became the ninth straight runner from Kenya to win the  
race Monday, and three of his countrymen also finished in the top 
10. At one point, though, Ecuador's Silvio Guerra held a huge lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerra said he wasn't intimidated by the threat that loomed  
behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get used to being around just Kenyans,'' he said. ``I  
prepare to run with Kenyans and African guys because they're the 
best in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Chebet, who picked up the $80,000 first prize in the race's  
103rd running, may be the best of them all at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	In his six career marathons, he won his first two and finished  
second in the next three -- two in New York City and one in Boston 
last year -- before beating Guerra by 27 seconds in a time of 2 
hours, 9 minutes, 52 seconds. Two of his second-place finishes were 
by three seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, it was my first time in Boston,'' Chebet said.  
``This year I tried to change my training from last year. I tried 
to train harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, he's not completely ready,'' said his coach, Dr.  
Gabriele Rosa. ``He decided to train longer now and he was more 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While five different Kenyans have won the last nine races,  
Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia has dominated the women's division by 
herself. On Monday, she became the second woman to win three 
straight Boston Marathons, matching the accomplishment of Uta 
Pippig of Germany from 1994 through 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	And she did it easily, with a margin of 2 minutes, 26 seconds  
over Franziska Rochat-Moser of Switzerland. The winning time was 
2:23:25. Last year's victory margin was 3:56. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only difference is last year I had a knee problem, but  
this year I was physically good,'' Roba said. ``I was expecting a 
better time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few runners could have run a much better time than Sun Yingjie  
of China did early in the women's race as she set a blistering 
pace. But she lost the lead just past the midpoint, leaving Roba 
and Catherine Ndereba of Kenya running together. 
</P>
<P>
	Roba began to pull away about 17 miles into the 26-mile,  
385-yard race. At one point, two spectators carrying green, yellow 
and red Ethiopian flags ran behind her. 
</P>
<P>
	``That gave me a boost and I started running with a new pace,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The spotlight in the women's race also fell on Lynn Jennings,  
the three-time world cross-country champion from Newmarket, N.H., 
who was making her official marathon debut at age 38. 
</P>
<P>
	She hoped to run faster than her 12th-place time of 2:38:37,  
``but I'm glad I qualified for the Olympic trials,'' Jennings said. 
</P>
<P>
	She did better than another outstanding runner from New England.  
Bill Rodgers, who has won the Boston and New York City marathons 
four times each, failed to finish in his first competitive marathon 
since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 51, he was hoping to break the American course record for a  
runner older than 50, 2:31:34, held by Norm Green. But he dropped 
out because of dehydration with about six miles to go on an 
unseasonably warm day. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not absolutely on, the marathon will really get you,  
especially if you're pushing hard`'' said Rodgers, who felt tired 
during the week preceding the race. ``Next time I run Boston I 
think I'm going to be a back-of-the-pack runner. I'm going to have 
fun out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's field of 12,797 was the second largest ever in Boston,  
exceeded only by the 38,708 official entrants in the centennial 
race in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wheelchair competitions, it was more of the same as Franz  
Nietlispach of Switzerland, in a time of 1:21:36, and Louise 
Sauvage of Australia, in 1:42:23, each won for the third 
consecutive year. For the second straight year, the women's race 
was so close between Sauvage and seven-time champion Jean Driscoll 
of Champaign, Ill., that both had the same official time. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no such drama in the men's and women's divisions as  
neither winner was threatened over the last four miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Roba, the 1996 Olympic champion, was followed by 1997 New York  
City champion Rochat-Moser at 2:25:51, two-time Olympic medalist 
Yuko Arimori of Japan at 2:26:39 and South African Colleen de Reuck 
at 2:27:53. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerra led by as much as a quarter-mile before Chebet took the  
lead with about four miles left. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started to push hard, but after 20 miles, I started to get  
blisters on my feet and slowed down,'' said Guerra, who was seeking 
to become the first South American winner since Colombia's Elviro 
Mejia in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	That just wasn't going to happen.  
</P>
<P>
	Not with Kenyans running, even though one of them, defending  
champion Moses Tanui, dropped out near the 23-mile mark, apparently 
with leg cramps. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerra finished second at 2:10:18 and was followed by two South  
Africans -- Frank Pooe at 2:11:37 and Abner Chipu at 2:12:45. 
Kenya's John Kagwe, who beat Chebet at New York in 1997 and 1998, 
wound up fifth for the second straight year at 2:13:57. The top 
American finisher, Joe LeMay of Danbury, Conn., was 13th in 
2:16:11. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other streak of nine winners from one country came when  
Americans won from 1916 through 1925 with few foreigners in the 
field. There was no individual competition in 1918, only a team 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Kenyans are dominant.  
</P>
<P>
	``They have the best professional distance runners in the  
world,'' Rodgers said before the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Chebet is one of them.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody in the world is trying to catch the Kenyans,''  
Chebet said, ``but they can't.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise on Wall Street Downturn / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose Monday as a sharp downturn by  
stocks sent money flowing into the Treasury market. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 7/8 point,  
or $8.75 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, fell to 5.51 percent from late Friday's 5.57 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The gains came amid a sudden reversal in the stock market, where  
a powerful blue-chip rally unraveled, wiping out a 270-point gain 
by the Dow Jones industrial average that would have set a sixth 
straight record high. The Nasdaq composite index slid 5.6 percent 
in the selloff. 
</P>
<P>
	In other bond trading, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
rose between 1/8 point and 11/32 point, while intermediate maturities 
rose 15/32 point to 9/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 4.33 percent as the  
discount rose 0.01 percentage point compared with late Friday to 
4.22 percent. Six-month yields fell to 4.51 percent, while the 
discount fell 0.02 percentage point to 4.35 percent. One-year 
yields fell to 4.63 percent as the discount fell 0.04 percentage 
point from late Friday to 4.42 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.63 percent from late Friday's 4.69 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds held steady at 124 11/32. The average yield 
to maturity was unchanged from late Friday's 5.23 percent.

	Clinton Seeks Money for Conflict  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today asked Congress for $6  
billion in emergency money for the Kosovo conflict -- with $5.1 
billion for the air campaign and the rest largely for refugee aid. 
The request touched off an immediate scramble as Republicans 
pledged to expand it to meet long-range Pentagon needs as well. 
Some even want to use the legislation to cover a 4.8 percent 
across-the-board pay increase for the military. Also today, 
administration officials proposed boarding and searching ships 
suspected of assisting Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's war 
effort against ethnic Albanians. And the United States sought NATO 
support to block oil from reaching Yugoslavia by sea. 

</P>
<P>
	NATO: We May Have Killed Civilians  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO showed dramatic aerial footage  
narrated by a U.S. Air Force general to explain how allied planes 
may have hit civilians during an airstrike in southwestern Kosovo. 
Despite Brig. Gen. Dan Leaf's detailed analysis and videotape of 
exploding vehicles, NATO said it may never know exactly what 
happened in raids on convoys last week. The attack has dogged 
NATO's air campaign for five days, but allied warplanes have 
continued airstrikes, striking today a government building in 
Serbia's second-largest city and a television transmitter in 
Kosovo. 

</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole Supports Ground Troops  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole, a Republican presidential  
hopeful fresh from her trip to Macedonia, said today that U.S.-led 
NATO ground troops should be ``pre-positioned in the theater'' and 
prepared to attack if necessary to end the purge of Kosovo. The 
former American Red Cross president said she was moved by her visit 
to refugee camps and by the harrowing stories of Serbian attacks in 
Kosovo. Mrs. Dole and a crowded field of GOP presidential 
candidates are eager to find a voice in the debate over the 
Yugoslavia conflict.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, edging closer to running  
for the Senate, opened a campaign-style swing today declaring, ``I 
love New York.'' She also announced plans to travel to Albania and 
Macedonia ``as soon as I'm given the green light'' by humanitarian 
workers. This week, she scheduled scores of stops from Long Island 
to Niagara Falls. The latest Marist College poll shows Mrs. Clinton 
in a dead heat with probable Republican Senate nominee Rudolph 
Guiliani.

	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- South Florida's main east-west  
highway was closed for a second day today as the area burned by a 
fire feeding on dry sawgrass in the Everglades grew to 90,000 
acres. There was no indication when smoke might lift off Interstate 
75. Officials expected erratic wind and dry, warm weather to 
continue for the next day or two, said Gene Madden, spokesman for 
the state Division of Forestry.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors dumped technology shares today,

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal law aimed at limiting e-mail smut  
does not violate free-speech rights, the Supreme Court ruled today. 
The court's unanimous decision rejected ApolloMedia Corp.'s 
argument that a portion of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 
threatens free-speech rights. ApolloMedia developed the 
``annoy.com'' World Wide Web site to let people anonymously 
communicate their opinions to public officials by using language 
some might consider indecent.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government and the world's leading  
manufacturer of personal watercraft asked the industry today to 
limit the speed of so-called ``Jet Skis'' to a 65 mph. Bombardier 
Recreational Products, maker of Sea Doo models, announced voluntary 
compliance with the limit on 2000 year models, going on sale early 
next year. The Coast Guard welcomed the initiative. According to 
its records, 4,070 personal watercraft were involved in accidents 
in 1997. Of those, 84 involved drownings.

<HEADLINE> Larry Robinson Out As Kings Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- For two months, Larry Robinson had  
sensed his days as coach of the Los Angeles Kings were numbered. 
The team made it official Monday when his contract was not renewed. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it really hit me was the day Tim (team president Leiweke)  
came to practice and said if you guys don't make the playoffs, 
there's going to be changes,'' Robinson told reporters at the 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings had a 32-45-5 record this season and failed to reach  
the playoffs for the third time in Robinson's four years. They were 
swept by St. Louis in the first round last season, when Robinson 
was runner-up for NHL coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kiss of death,'' he joked.  
</P>
<P>
	General manager Dave Taylor said he told Robinson before  
Sunday's 3-2 loss to St. Louis that he would not be returning as 
coach. Also out of jobs are assistants Don Edwards, Rick Green and 
Jay Leach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wished I hadn't asked because it was a long game,'' Robinson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, 47, was in the final year of a four-year contract. He  
declined to sign a three-year extension that was offered last 
September when the team was struggling. He said at that time he 
wasn't sure he wanted to continue coaching, which Taylor 
interpreted negatively. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was difficult to understand why he didn't accept the  
extension,'' Taylor said during a separate news conference at the 
Forum. ``He was not sure of himself and that has given the wrong 
image. 
</P>
<P>
	``The players look to the coach for leadership. For him to have  
any hesitation is the wrong message back to the players. There was 
a lot of speculation to Larry's future all year and that was a 
distraction to the club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who won six Stanley Cups during a Hall of Fame playing  
career with Montreal, had a 122-161-45 record in four seasons as 
coach. He retired as a player with the Kings in 1992, having never 
missed the postseason in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I let myself down,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The team's fortunes appeared to be on the upswing a year ago  
when it made a 20-point improvement from the previous season and 
posted its best record since 1992-93 to finish second in the 
Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
	But things unraveled this season. The Kings lost 25 games by one  
goal, had one of the league's worst power plays and lost 335 
man-games to injuries or illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lacked consistency, and at times we lacked the work  
ethic,'' Taylor said. ``That's not acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was known for exhibiting patience during trying times --  
including the loss of goaltenders Stephane Fiset and Jamie Storr to 
groin injuries in the early weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're as talented as we were made out to be,''  
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players who had career years last season failed to  
repeat those performances, including Jozef Stumpel, who led the 
team in points last season with 79, but had just 34 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you instill heart, drive and intestinal fortitude in  
people who don't have it or don't want to have it?'' Robinson 
asked. ``We had more talkers than leaders and not enough doers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen a place where the players aren't held  
accountable for their lackluster play. With the way some of these 
guys played, they would've been run out of Montreal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was well-liked by his players, and left wing Luc  
Robitaille suggested that niceness might have been his undoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a guy's not producing, he always gave them an extra  
chance and unfortunately, guys didn't realize how lucky they 
were,'' Robitaille said. ``I don't know that we need a new coach, 
but we need a new attitude from everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson acknowledged he probably should have been tougher on  
the players, but he said that's not his nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this day and age, I guess you've got to do a lot of  
screaming and yelling, and that in itself is a lot of wear and 
tear,'' he said. ``I don't feel my demeanor works well with problem 
super-athletes. I'm a good teacher and I work well with young 
kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson came to the Kings after being an assistant with New  
Jersey when the Devils won the Stanley Cup in 1995. He said he 
would like to be an assistant or head coach again. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said the Kings have not yet begun a search for Robinson's  
replacement, and said there is no timetable for hiring someone. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson and his staff might not be the only ones without jobs.  
</P>
<P>
	Taylor will meet Tuesday with individual players to discuss  
their performances. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be some players that will not be back next year,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Md. Day Care Provider Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CENTREVILLE, Md. (AP) -- A former day care provider was sentenced  
Monday to two years and four months in jail for the deaths of two 
babies who suffocated after a quilt accidentally fell over their 
faces. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't mean them any harm,'' said a sobbing Stacey W.  
Russum, 33. 
</P>
<P>
	The children, 6-month-old Ian Denny and 5-month-old Matthew  
Harrison, suffocated in an upstairs bedroom in her home in May 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Russum said she used the quilt to prevent the boys from  
rolling off the adult bed while they were napping. She then 
returned downstairs where she baked cupcakes and oversaw a birthday 
party for other children in her care. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge John W. Sause Jr. sentenced her to five years for  
each of two counts of reckless endangerment. The judge suspended 
all but 14 months of each sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said he imposed a jail sentence in hopes that it would  
deter other child care providers from taking their responsibilities 
lightly.

<HEADLINE> Aunt Discusses Drag Death Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The second defendant in a black man's dragging  
death did not hate minorities and had an unremarkable upbringing in 
northeast Texas, relatives say. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Russell Brewer heads to trial on May 17 for last year's  
slaying of Jasper resident James Byrd Jr., who was chained to a 
pickup truck and dragged nearly three miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russell didn't hate blacks,'' his maternal aunt, Carol  
Gillham, told the Houston Chronicle on Sunday. ``We've never had 
any KKK in this family. We had blacks in this family. Russell's 
cousin married a black man. They had two kids. Russell married a 
Hispanic. They had a son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Jasper jury in February convicted 24-year-old John William  
King and sentenced him to death for his role in Byrd's death. A 
third defendant, 24-year-old Shawn Allen Berry, is expected to be 
tried after Brewer. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's defense lawyer, Doug Barlow, contends that his client's  
trial shouldn't be held in Jasper because the east Texas town has 
too much of a vested interest in the case and the potential jury 
pool is too small. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing is scheduled Tuesday on Barlow's request to move the  
trial out of Jasper. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer, a high school dropout, was described by officials as an  
inept burglar who sometimes targeted the homes of his own 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought his chance of becoming a productive citizen  
was too bright,'' former sheriff's investigator Gary Thompson said. 
``But I was surprised that he got into trouble of such magnitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said that Brewer's DNA was detected on a cigarette  
and a beer bottle found at the crime scene, and that Byrd's blood 
was found on his shoe. Brewer has pleaded innocent to King's 
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer, 32, was regarded by many as the bad seed of a  
hardworking Christian family in the hardscrabble country between 
the North Sulphur River and South Sulphur River. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Benny Fisher, who grew up with Brewer's father,  
described the accused killer as ``just a country boy.'' Fisher 
recalled nothing in Brewer's background that could engender violent 
racial hatred. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Lawrence Brewers were a good family,'' said Fisher. ``They  
went to church. They weren't mean to the kids. ... When the boy 
went off to prison, he fell in with the wrong gang. It destroyed 
his life as well as his parents' lives.''
