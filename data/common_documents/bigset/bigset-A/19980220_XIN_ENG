<HEADLINE> Pakistani PM Holds Talks With Nepalese Crown Prince </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif Thursday held talks with visiting Nepalese Crown
Prince Dipendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev on bilateral relations and
regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Sharif told the Nepalese crown prince, who arrived here
Thursday from Karachi on the second leg of a week-long visit to
Pakistan, that his country was looking forward to "a very strong
relationship with Nepal."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and Nepal are linked together by cultural and
historical affinities, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)
quoted Sharif as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sharif expressed the belief that the crown prince's visit would
further strengthen the bonds of friendship existing between
Pakistan and Nepal.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that economic and trade relations between Pakistan
and Nepal were not commensurate with the excellent political
relationship between the two countries, the APP said.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed the need to involve the private sectors in
further promoting the mutually beneficial economic cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed regional issues, including the situation in
South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Sharif underscored Pakistan's commitment to peace and stability
in the region, which he said was an essential pre-requisite for
the socio-economic well-being of its people.
</P>
<P>
The key to peace, progress and prosperity in the region was the
resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir issue, which has bedeviled
relations between Pakistan and India for the past 50 years, Sharif
said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif reaffirmed Pakistan's commitment to regional economic
cooperation as embodied in the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC), and expressed the hope that the two
countries would cooperate on this forum.
</P>
<P>
The Nepalese crown prince expressed satisfaction over the
existing bilateral relations and said it reflected the aspirations
of the governments and the peoples of the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States saw a revival of a phantom from the
Vietnam War when a small number of demonstrators hostile to an
attack upon Iraq disturbed a meeting organized on the University
of Ohio campus by CNN cable television. The three top officials in
charge of security for the Clinton administration, Madeleine
Albright, William Cohen and Sandy Berger, were on the defensive
during a better part of the meeting and were frequently
interrupted by the shouting of slogans reminiscent of protests
during the Vietnam conflict.
</P>
<P>
-- Backed by the full support of the United Nations Security
Council, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan began a last
chance mission Thursday that will take him to Baghdad for
discussions aimed at avoiding a military strike by the United
States against Iraq. The United States said that it is the only
one to judge whether the mission is a success or not.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- France still hopes that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein will
change his mind as United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan
goes to Baghdad on Friday in a final diplomatic attempt to solve
the crisis. The United States has announced that it will strike
Iraq if Annan's mission fails.
</P>
<P>
-- In an interview with Le Figaro, given on the eve of his
visit to France, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel warned Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein that "the storm is coming," and urged him
to conform with the decisions of the United Nations. He also
criticized the European Union for refusing to admit Turkey in the
first wave of its expansion.

<HEADLINE> Annan Leaves for Paris on his Way to Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan left here Thursday morning for Paris
on his way to Baghdad to seek a diplomatic and peaceful solution
to the weapons inspection crisis in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief is accompanied by Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi,
the U.N. Secretary-General's Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Johan
Molander, Ambassador of the Swedish Foreign Ministry, Hans Corell,
U.N. Undersecretary General for the Office of Legal Affairs and
four other U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
Annan was due in Paris later in the day for talks with French
President Jacques Chirac before heading to the Iraqi capital on
Friday for the most difficult mission in his 13 months in office.
</P>
<P>
Annan is due back in New York to brief the U.N. Security
Council on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
His trip is widely believed to be the "last hope" mission to
avert American-led military strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Washington said that it doubted Annan would produce a
breakthrough in his talks with Iraqi leaders.
</P>
<P>
But Annan said before his leaving that he was encouraged by the
unanimous backing of his mission to Baghdad by all 15 members of
the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Although the Clinton administration has been strengthening U.S.
military build-up in the Gulf region, most of the nations
throughout the world have been calling for a peaceful and
diplomatic solution to the Iraqi crisis.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Leader Arrives in Egypt for Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, founder and
spiritual leader of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement
Hamas, arrived here Thursday for a private visit, the Middle East
News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Upon his departure from the Gaza Strip, Yassin expressed his
admiration for the Egyptian people for "their consistent support
to the Palestinian people and the Arab cause," the MENA said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Egypt, Yassin is expected to meet with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Yassin said last month that he looked forward to meeting with
Mubarak to acquaint him with the positions of Hamas on a series of
issues.
</P>
<P>
Yassin, a 61-year-old quadriplegic with ear, eye and lung
problems, is to spend two months in Egypt for medical treatment,
according to an official at the Palestinian Liaison Committee in
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Following his visit here, the Hamas leader will fly to Saudi
Arabia for pilgrimage, the source said.
</P>
<P>
This is Yassin's first trip out of the Palestinian self-rule
areas since Israel released him from jail last October, in
exchange for two secret agents arrested in Jordan in a failed
assassination of a Hamas leader.
</P>
<P>
Yassin, who founded Hamas in 1987 in a Palestinian uprising
against Israeli rule, was arrested in 1989 and sentenced to life
imprisonment in October, 1991 for urging followers to kill
Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hamas is opposed to the peace talks between the Palestinians
and Israel, and advocates armed struggle end Israeli occupation of
Arab lands.

<HEADLINE> Blair, Annan Exchange Views on U.N-Iraq Standoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair held a telephone conversation early Thursday with
U.N.Secretary General Kofi Annan on the worsening U.N-Iraq crisis,
stressing "the threat of force is real" if Iraq fails to comply
with U.N. resolutions concerned.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief is planning to visit Baghdad later on Friday to
make a last-ditch effort to defuse the U.N.-Iraq standoff over
arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street spokesman said that Blair had told Annan that
Britain was pleased he was going to Iraq with the full support of
the five permanent members of the U.N.Security Council.
</P>
<P>
However, Blair, whose country is in favor of military action
against Iraq, made it clear that "the threat of force is real" and
there should be "no fudging" when the Annan meets Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein in Baghdad on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It is vital that Saddam Hussein gets a very clear message,"
the spokesman quoted Blair as telling the U.N. chief, adding that
the Iraqi government is supposed to commit himself in writing not
to prevent the U.N. arms inspectors from inspecting any suspected
weapons sites.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls Annan's Mission "Critical Opportunity" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Thursday called U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's mission to
Baghdad "a critical opportunity" to defuse the crisis over weapons
inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's mission to Baghdad is a
critical opportunity to achieve the outcome that all of us would
prefer: a peaceful and principled end to this crisis," Clinton
told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House before
departing for Baltimore on board a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
He said he had just talks through telephone with French
President Jacques Chirac and said Chirac agreed with him on
Annan's mission.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, to achieve the peaceful settlement of the weapons
inspection crisis, "(Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein must give the
weapons inspectors full, unfettered access to all suspected sites
anywhere in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"That is the clear standard... He simply must adhere to that
standard," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He again threated with military action to solve the crisis if
Saddam refuses to comply. "Let me be clear: if diplomacy fails, we
must be -- and we are -- prepared to act."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he had asked Vice President Al Gore to postpone
his planned trip to South Africa as he wanted his "full national
security team on hand to take part in our deliberations and
decisions on this vitally important issue."
</P>
<P>
"I believe strongly that most Americans support our policy," he
said.

<HEADLINE> China's People's Daily Hails Premier's Successful Visits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, will carry an editorial Friday, hailing the
successful visits by Chinese Premier Li Peng to Luxembourg, the
Netherlands and Russia from February 12 to 18.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, entitled "Strengthen Equal-Footing Dialogue,
Expand Mutually-Beneficial Cooperation," says Li Peng's tour has
achieved the goals of strengthening dialogue, enhancing mutual
understanding, expanding common ground and developing cooperation
between China and the three European countries.
</P>
<P>
Li's visit to Luxembourg is the first by a Chinese premier
since the two nations established diplomatic relations 25 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of diplomatic ties, China and
Luxembourg have seen sound development of bilateral relations and
great achievements in their economic and technological
cooperation, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
During Li's visit, leaders of the two countries exchanged views
and reached consensus on the development of bilateral relations
and international issues of common concern, it says. The two
countries also signed a document on enhancing cooperation on cargo
transportation services.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is one of the earliest western European
countries establishing diplomatic ties with China, the editorial
notes. In recent years, the two countries have made remarkable
progress in developing their relations, especially in economic and
trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li's visit to the Netherlands is the first by a Chinese premier
since 1985. The leaders of the two countries agreed to solve the
differences through equal-footing dialogues and consultations,
expanding economic, trade and technological cooperation, and
seeking common development, the editorial points out.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, China and the Netherlands also signed a
framework agreement on a joint venture petrochemicals complex,
which is one of the largest joint venture projects in China.
</P>
<P>
The editorial notes that both China and the European Union (EU)
are key forces in the world arena for safeguarding peace and
promoting development.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China and the EU members saw rapid improvement
of their relations and the expansion and deepening of their
political, economic, trade, scientific and technological
cooperation, it adds.
</P>
<P>
China and Europe have no fundermental conflict of interests and
share more and more common ground, it says. Both sides have their
own strong points and their economies are complementary to each
other.
</P>
<P>
China and Europe share the same or similar views on many
international or regional issues, the editorial adds.
</P>
<P>
Further strengthening the Sino-European friendly and
mutual-beneficial cooperation is not only in their long-term
interests, but conducive to cooperation between Asia and Europe,
it notes.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Li met with Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and held a third regular meeting with Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin. The two sides laid out steps to deepen bilateral
relations and made preparations for the meeting between President
Jiang Zemin and President Yeltsin scheduled for autumn this year.
</P>
<P>
Since December 1996 when the mechanism of regular meetings
between premiers of the two countries started, China and Russia
have carried out effective work in building ties and achieved many
fruitful results, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
Li's visit has resulted in five agreements and a joint
communique between China and Russia. These new achievements have
enlarged the scale of economic and trade cooperation between the
two countries, it notes.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Russian relations have a solid foundation, and their
further development holds great potential. The content of the
strategic partnership between the two countries is constantly
enlarging. The partnership, based on mutual respect and trust, is
not directed at any third party, the editorial stresses.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, China has adhered to an independent and
peaceful foreign policy. and it is willing to develop friendly
ties with all countries based on the five principles of peaceful
coexistence, it says.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, leaders of the three countries shared the
view that China not only plays a major role in keeping the world's
peace and stability, but also makes great contributions to
maintaining the stability of its economy, the editorial
concludes.

<HEADLINE> Violent Attacks on UK Retail Staff Rise Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Britain's retail outlets staff
are increasingly becoming the victims of physical attacks and
robbery, with at least one member attacked or threatened every
minute of the working day, according to a survey Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The crime survey by the British Retail Consortium showed that
violent attacks on shop workers rose 44 percent last year to
13,000 while threats of violence increased 13 percent to 53,000.
Robbery rose by 42 percent to 17,000 separate incidents.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicated that young offenders made up a
substantial proportion of the crimes, with 21 percent of offenders
being estimated as children in supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
The retail consortium said that it was very disturbing as
retail crime is often a major gateway through which many young
people pass on their way to violent crime.

<HEADLINE> CBI Finance Ministers' Meeting Opened in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 80 delegates from 14
member countries of the Voluntary Cross Border Initiative (CBI)
are attending the third finance ministers' meeting which started
here in Harare Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting is expected to discuss experiences of
these countries in their reforms in the areas of trade, currency
exchanges and payments as well as investment deregulation.
</P>
<P>
G. E. Gondwe, deputy director of International Monetary Fund
(IMF) African department, told the meeting that countries in
eastern and southern Africa, and in the Indian Ocean need to
further review their tariff structures and remove non-tariff
barriers in order to benefit more from regional integration.
</P>
<P>
He said while tariff structures in member countries had been
rationalised and simplified, efforts were needed towards reducing
tariff exemptions and incorporating other duties and charges into
the tariff structure.
</P>
<P>
"More progress is also called for in the area of trade
facilitation and the removal of non-tariff barriers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The CBI is co-sponsored by the IMF, the World Bank, the
African Development Bank and the European Union which assist
member countries to implement CBI-supported reforms.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Greece Welcomes UN Chief's Visit to Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Greece supported on Thursday
the efforts for peaceful solution to the current Iraqi crisis and
hoped the planned visit to Baghdad by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan would help settle the crisis peacefully.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement released Thursday, the Greek government said
that it actively backed the efforts undertaken by Russia, France,
the Arab League and the U.N. chief, and wished Annan's trip to
Badhdad on Friday would open the way for a diplomatic solution to
the crisis caused by Baghdad's blocking of U.N. arms inspections
"even at the last minute."
</P>
<P>
The Greek government was watching closely the developments of
the crisis and urged the Iraqi authorities to comply with the
relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions and cooperate with
UNSCOM for their implementation, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief is planning to visit Baghdad later on Friday to
make a last-ditch effort to defuse the U.N.-Iraq standoff over
arms inspection.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Joint Lao-American technical
teams conducted surveys in Laos between January 12 and February 12
in a search for remains or evidence of Americans missing since the
Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
The teams investigated 15 MIA (missing in action) cases in
Saravane Province and two in Sekon Province, Lao's official news
agency, Khaosan Pathet Lao (KPL), reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The operation was the second in the country's action plan for
the 1997-1998 fiscal year. It is the 58th joint operation of this
kind so far.
</P>
<P>
According to the press department of the Lao Foreign Ministry,
the joint teams have found debris of aircraft, bones, teeth, and
some ID cards of pilots. They will be taken to the United States
for further analysis and identification.
</P>
<P>
KPL said the joint operation, as part of the cooperation plan
for the fiscal 1997-1998, was initiated in the light of the
humanitarian policy of the Lao government.
</P>
<P>
The operation was taken in response to the request of the U.S.
government and the families of the Americans who were reported
missing in Laos during the Vietnam War.

<HEADLINE> Severe Famine Threatens S. Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Intensified fighting and
widespread drought are threatening to displace hundreds of
thousands of more Sudanese and put the region at risk of severe
hunger and killing diseases, said U.N. agencies Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Surveys conducted by the U.N. in late 1997 shown that hundreds
of thousands of Sudanese will be unable to survive without food
aid, especially during the food deficit period from April to
August this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. World Food Program, Children Fund, High Commissioner
for Refugees and other U.N. bodies Thursday officially launched
an appeal for a total of 109.4 million U.S. Dollars of donation
to meet urgent humanitarian needs of southern Sudanese people.
</P>
<P>
The money is to be used on 22 U.N. emergency and
rehabilitation projects in the south of the largest African
country.
</P>
<P>
As Sudan enters its 15th year of civil war, more than four
million people living in the south will require outside help just
for keeping alive, said the agencies at a joint press conference.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese have also been suffering widespread malnutrition, as
well as a severe shortage of adequate health care, clean drinking
water and shelter. The nation's estimated infant mortality and
under-five mortality rates, at 128 and 292 respectively, are
among the highest rates in the world.
</P>
<P>
Already this year, increased insecurity and crop failure in
parts of war-torn southern Sudan are forcing residents to flee
traditional grazing and fishing grounds and raising the price of
staple foods to levels beyond the reach of the poor.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. received only 40 percent of the 120.8
million Dollars required last year for emergency activities in
Sudan, seriously weakening its ability to respond to the growing
humanitarian crisis there.
</P>
<P>
Most emergency assistance to Sudan is channeled through
Operation Lifeline Sudan, which brings together U.N. agencies and
non-governmental organizations in a unique consortium arrangement
since it was set up in April 1989.
</P>
<P>
An agreement reached by the U.N., the Sudanese government and
southern rebels in May 1994 has increased air access for taking
international humanitarian aid into southern Sudan to currently
more than 100 locations from only seven in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agencies have also succeeded in opening new road
routes and reaffirmed existing road, river and rail routes for
relief deliveries in the war-torn area.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Plane Crashes in Somalia, Killing No One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A small passenger plane
crashed Thursday afternoon while landing at Issaley Airstrip, 15
km north of the Somali capital, fortunately with no one on board
died.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Ali Hagaf, a local worker for the air company that
hired the plane, said all 24 Somali passengers on board the DC-3
plane that flew from Nairobi are safe and sound.
</P>
<P>
However, the plane owned by a Kenyan company, Sky Way Air
Services Company, has lost its wings and punctured its tires.
Some of the local workers at Issaley Airstrip told Xinhua that
the shafts holding the tires of the plane were broken first,
making the plane loose its balance and went off the only narrow
run way of the airstrip.
</P>
<P>
A group of militiamen at the airstrip controlled by Ali Mahdi
Mohamed had rushed to the plane to help the passengers, some of
whom suffered minor injuries. The passengers who were shocked by
the incident were later on transported to their houses.
</P>
<P>
Deqa Air Services, the Somali company which hired the plane
from Kenya, attributed the incident to the lack of knowledge by
the pilot for this particular airstrip.
</P>
<P>
"This is only the third time that this pilot lands at this
airstrip," said Hagaf, adding that large repairs will be needed
before this plane can fly again.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that a plane crashes at Issaley
Airstrip. A small Russian made plane crashed here in 1992,
killing no one.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan company, Sky Way Air Services Company, is one of a
dozen airline companies which fly from Nairobi to Mogadishu and
elsewhere in Somalia everyday to transport passengers or the
narcotic green leaves known as khat which is widely chewed in
Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Calls for Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Finance Minister
Ronald Penza Thursday appealed to foreign investors to invest in
Zambia, according to Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
When meeting in the capital a delagation of institutional
investors from Britain, Penza said that Zambia has enormous
potentials in agriculture, mining, tourism and other business
opportunities which are not yet exploited.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government is committed to the creation of a free
and sustainable capital market, said the finance minister, adding
that the country's existing liberalisation policies are adequate
to guarantee investors higher returns on their businesses.
</P>
<P>
Penza was optimistic that Zambia's economy is heading for a
boom as more and more investors have shown willingness and
confidence to invest in the country.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to the donor community to continue assisting
Zambia through aid and thanked them for the assistance so far
rendered, saying that the path to economic recovery would have
been impossible without their help.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Penza pointed out that the current stance
of some co-operating partners to freeze aid over "governance
issues" is unfair because Zambia has sacrified much in meeting
benchmarks both economically and politically.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Zambia's entire economic reform programe,
including the privatisation process, in which the international
community has invested so much would cramble if they withhold aid
to the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the British delegation which are on a tour to
discover investment opportunities in Africa expressed their
interest in Zambia, said ZANA.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Give Priority to Food Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The 20th United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) regional conference for
Africa opened here Thursday with African countries being urged to
give priority to food security.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian President Negasso Gidada said in his opening address
that there is no greater priority for Africa than achieving food
security through sustainable agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Africa is a region of immense potentials, including in the
agricultural area, Negasso noted. However, he said, despite some
encouraging developments in recent years, Africa still remains a
region of "incalculable human misery" which is the key
explanation for the conflicts that marked the continent's recent
history.
</P>
<P>
According to him, hunger and food insecurity in Africa are
likely to persist and even increase dramatically, unless urgent,
determined and concerted actions are taken.
</P>
<P>
"Today, 175 million Africans are suffering from chronic
hunger, 50 percent more than 25 years ago and in many African
countries, up to half of the population suffers from absolute
poverty," said Ahmed Haggag, assistant secretary general of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
He believed that agricultural progress is the key not only to
food security but to rural and national prosperity.
</P>
<P>
On Africa's agricultural performance in 1997, FAO Director
General Jacques Diouf said after the good results of 1996, there
was a sharp downturn in agricultural production in north Africa
in 1997 and only a modest rise of 0.4 percent in the sub-Saharan
region.
</P>
<P>
He blamed this on natural disasters, such as floods, drought
and disease, and armed conflicts that have prompted the massive
displacement of rural population who, in extreme cases, become
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Africa's annual population growth of almost 3 percent remains
one of the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
"With population growth of this magnitude, food security will
continue as an imperative and a challenge," he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the FAO official, after the World Food Summit
held in November 1996, 150 national strategies for agriculture
and food security towards the year 2010 have been drafted,
including all African countries. The special program for food
security is now operational in 29 countries, including 17 in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 and 1996, FAO prepared 31 investment projects in
Africa for a total value of 1.25 billion US Dollars. Last year,
18 projects were approved for a total of 478 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
About 51 ministers and vice-ministers from FAO African member
states attended the conference which will discuss the follow-up
of the World Food Summit and agricultural policy for sustainable
use and management of natural resources in Africa.

LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The National Health Service
(NHS) will have to meet the cost of treating people found to be
fitted with faulty hip replacements, Health Secretary Frank Dobson
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The estimated cost has been put at 10,000 pound per patient and
there may be as many as 4,500 needing the treatment.
</P>
<P>
Doctors have warned that some people will need to have
prosthesis removed and another one inserted while other patients
will need to be X-rayed and carefully monitored by doctors.
</P>
<P>
The faulty product, the Capital 3M Model made by 3M Health
Care, was fitted between August 1, 1991 and March 31 1997. The
Medical Devices Agency said it had "poor short term performance of
the femoral component."
</P>
<P>
Dobson said he was now looking at tightening up quality control
procedures to ensure products are safe before being bought by the
NHS.
</P>
<P>
"We have asked all the orthopaedic surgeons to check through
their records and get in touch with everybody who has had this
particular hip installed," he said.

<HEADLINE> Freedom Movement of Iran Announced Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Interior Minister
Abdollah Nouri has announced that the Freedom Movement of Iran
(FMI) is illegal, the local daily Kayhan reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
FMI's application for a status of informal political party has
been rejected by the commission of party supervision, Nouri told
students of Tabriz University in Eastern Azerbaijan Province.
</P>
<P>
The FMI has no legal position in Iran, he said, without giving
the reasons, according to the daily.
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Movement, the only political party in Iran, was
founded in 1961 by former Iranian Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan
and fought against the then Shah regime.
</P>
<P>
It joined the interim government after the 1979 Islamic
Revolution which toppled the Shah regime. But it quitted due to
disagreements with Iran's late Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Ever since then, the FMI has been criticizing domestic and
foreign policies of the Islamic government, particularly over
issues related to freedom and democracy.
</P>
<P>
After the death of Bazargan in January, 1995, the party was
barred from carrying out activities following a decision of the
authorities to register political parties and organizations in the
year.
</P>
<P>
Nouri announced that the radical group "Ansar Hezbollah,"
notorious for its resort to violence against other political
groups, is also illegal.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the group wants to gain formal recognition, it
should present application for permission to carry out
activities.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Most Greeks Back Government's Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The majority of Greeks support
the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) government's
reform plan to partly privatize the ailing state-run firms,
according to a survey released on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by Greece's ICAP last October in five
major cities of Athens, Thessaloniki, Iraklion, Patras and Larissa
with samples from 600 households and 280 businesses.
</P>
<P>
It showed that more than 62 percent of Greek households
supported the Simitis-led government's policy of
part-privatization of the loss-making or bankrupt public utilities
and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Public Power Corporation was the first choice for
privatization with a support of 59 percent, Hellenic
Telecommunications Organization with 57.6 percent and Olympic
Airways with 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that respondents supported the government's
reform policy on public utilities for two reasons, namely, part-
privatization made it an easier way to fund the government's
restructuring programs and by entering the stock market state-own
enterprises would be better monitored and more efficient.

<P>
BAGHDAD, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Some foreign embassies here
have begun sending their diplomats, women and children out of Iraq
as a precaution against a possible military strike by the United
States and Britain, according to diplomatic sources Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sources told Xinhua that Bulgaria, Poland and Hungarian
and Czech embassies are among those which have started partial
evacuation.
</P>
<P>
The move came ahead of the upcoming Baghdad trip by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan Friday on a "last-ditch" effort to
defuse the crisis between Iraq and the U.S. over weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
A Russian diplomat who asked anonymity said that Russian
embassy "is making preparation to evacuate women and children" if
Annan fails in his mediation mission.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations pulled out 29 relief workers out of Iraq
Wednesday. They traversed the desert in a 10-hour drive and
crossed into neighboring Jordan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Despite widespread opposition, Washington pitched its fanfare
on the use of force against Iraq to wrestle Baghdad's opening up
of all suspected weapon sites to U.N. inspection.
</P>
<P>
As part of the U.S. military build-up in the Gulf region, 250
infantry soldiers from Fort Stewart, Georgia arrived at Kuwait
Airport on Thursday. Another 2,750 infantry soldiers will arrive
in Kuwait in the next few days to join the U.S. force of 25,000
already there.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency reported Thursday that President Saddam
Hussein said he remained committed to a diplomatic solution to the
current standoff while meeting with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's special envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk.
</P>
<P>
The Russian envoy delivered a letter from Yeltsin to Saddam,
which deals with Annan's Baghdad trip. No details were available.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Vice-President Taha Yassin Ramadan also said on
Thursday that Iraq would try to make Annan's mediation mission a
success.
</P>

Also on Thursday, a U.N. advance team of about 20 people
arrived in Baghdad to prepare for Annan's visit.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Records Worst Trade Deficit in Nine Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States underwent
a steep deterioration in it's trade performance in December,
boosting its deficit for all of 1997 to 113.7 billion U.S.
dollars, the worst showing in nine years.
</P>
<P>
According to the Commerce Department here Thursday, for all of
1997, U.S. exports of goods and services climbed 9.9 percent to a
record 932.3 billion dollars while its imports were a record as
well, rising 9 percent to 1.05 trillion dollars, also the first
time imports have topped the 1 trillion dollar mark.
</P>
<P>
The overall deficit was up 2.4 percent from the 1996 imbalance
of 111 billion dollars and was the worst showing since a 115.9
billion dollars in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The country's deficit in goods reached an all-time high of
198.9 billion dollars, up 4.1 percent from the previous year's
191.2 billion dollar deficit. This shortfall was offset slightly
by an increase in its surplus in services trade, such as airline
fares and royalty payments, which climbed 6.3 percent to an
all-time high of 85.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
It was reported the U.S. trade deficit in December jumped 24.3
percent to 10.8 billion dollars, the worst showing since
September. The widening gap was led by a 6.7 percent increase in
the deficit with Pacific Rim countries, which in goods climbed to
10.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
For 1997, the trade deficit with Japan rose 17 percent to 55.7
billion dollars as U.S. exports to that country declined for the
first time since 1992. It was the largest trade gap since a 59.1
billion dollar deficit in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The country's deficit with China jumped a sharp 25.9 percent
last year to a record 49.7 billion dollars, the department
reported.

NICOSIA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus supports a peaceful
solution to the Iraq-U.N. crisis over weapons inspection, a

</P>
<P>
Asked what the Cypriot government's position would be if the

nothing reprehensible if the British bases are used for
U.N. purposes."

<HEADLINE> Russia Explains Position on Missile Deal with Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A Russian diplomat has said
that the deployment of the Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft
missile system in Cyprus is an important element in efforts to
push for the demilitarization of the island.
</P>
<P>
Russian Ambassador to Cyprus Georgi Mouradov made the statement
Thursday after a meeting with President Glafcos Clerides, during
which he conveyed a congratulatory message from Russian President
Boris Yeltsin to Clerides on his re-election last Sunday for a
second term in office.
</P>
<P>
The message expresses Russia's readiness for further
cooperation with the government of Cyprus for the benefit of the
people of both countries, the solution of the Cyprus question for
regional peace and stability, Mouradov said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the missile issue, the Russian diplomat told
reporters that the missiles, which the Cypriot government had
purchased from Russia early 1997, will be deployed in Cyprus
unless the island is demilitarized and foreign troops withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that Russia's special envoy for Cyprus
Vladimir Tchizhov is planning to visit Cyprus in March and that
there are "certain ideas" under discussion which could relate
specifically to the demilitarization of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"Russia always places great attention on this issue," he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on statements a top U.S. official is reportedly to
have made about preventing at all costs the deployment of the
Russian missiles, Mouradov said "the terms of the contract are
already being implemented and is proceeding, but I cannot refer
to the technical details of the deal as these would affect the
defense and security of the Republic of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his country's position that the missiles, which
are due in Cyprus in mid 1998, will not arrive if demilitarization
is agreed on the island.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government's decision to purchase Russian missiles
was criticized by the U.S. and Turkey has also threatened to
strike the missiles if they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> Hospital Waiting List in UK Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- New hospital waiting list
figures in Britain increased by 50,000 on the last quarter and
more than 100,000 since the general election in last May, British
Health Secretary Frank Dobson admitted on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Besides dealing with a record number of emergency cases the
NHS has treated a record number of people from waiting lists,"
said Dobson.
</P>
<P>
"The only trouble is the number of people going onto waiting
lists outpaces the number coming off them," he added.
</P>
<P>
The total number of patients waiting for National Health
Service(NHS) beds at the end of last year was 1.26 million, up
54,000 on the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
And the number waiting more than a year has gone up by 10,700
to 68,000, according to new figures released by the NHS on

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The New Primera Estate, the
fifth new model investment to be won by the Sunderland workforce,
produced 271,500 cars last year.
</P>
<P>
The new car goes on sale in May, three months ahead of
schedule, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders Limited
(SMMT) announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Production plans were brought forward to meet fast growing
demand for estate cars. Across Europe demand for family-sized
estate cars increased by 25 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The new Primera Estate is designed to appeal to a new breed of
estate car buyer. Much of the growth in volume has come from less
utilitarian, more fashion-driven models in which load capacity is
less important than style.
</P>
<P>
However, the new Primera Estate delivers both. It combines load
carrying capacity with dynamic styling and sporty driving
performance.
</P>
<P>
Production output for the new car is expected to exceed 20,000
units a year, almost double the European sales of the previous
Primera estate.
</P>
<P>
John Cushnagham, Deputy Managing Director at Nissan said: "We
are delighted with our first estate car; I am very confident it
will perform well in what is becoming Europe's most rapidly
expanding sector."

<HEADLINE> US Interested in Solution to Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The government of the United
States has reiterated its readiness to work for a solution to the
protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
This position was reflected in a reply letter of U.S. President
Bill Clinton to his Cypriot counterpart Glafcos Clerides,
according to government spokesman Manolis Christofides Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government is fully satisfied with U.S. President
Bill Clinton's reply to a letter sent by President Glafcos
Clerides earlier this year, Manolis Christofides said at his
daily press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. President's reply was conveyed Wednesday to President
Clerides by U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus, Kenneth Brill.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides had sent a letter to his U.S. counterpart,
asking him to intervene to ensure a resolution of the protracted
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Similar letters were also sent to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
Christofides described Cyprus-U.S. relations as "excellent" and
said "we look forward to a decisive U.S. intervention in
forthcoming negotiations for a solution the Cyprus problem"
between the two rival communities on the island.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides was re-elected on Sunday for a second
five-year term in office as eighth president of the Cyprus
Republic since its independence in 1960.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has said it expected the U.S. to launch

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General
Thursday Annan Thursday denied a press report that U.S. President Bill
Clinton put pressure on his trip to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported Thursday that Clinton called the
U.N. chief on Tuesday, asking Annan not to "jam" him, but to "jam
the Iraqis."
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised to see that quote in the New York Times,"
Annan told reporters before leaving for Paris early Thursday on
his way to Baghdad to seek a peaceful and diplomatic solution to
the weapons inspection crisis.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that he had "a very constructive and useful
discussion" with Clinton, and "This is a serious business and we
did have a serious conversation."
</P>
<P>
"That phrase never came up in the conversation," the Secretary
General said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said when he is going to meet Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein later this week, "I will have to explain the situation very
clearly and get him to understand that it is in his best interest
and in the interest of the Iraqi people to agree to implement
Security Council resolutions."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Reaffirms Positive Cooperation With UN Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 19 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of the arrival of
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to Baghdad, Iraq reiterated that
it will positively cooperate with him for the success of his
mission to avert the hovering phantom of war.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi news agency Thursday quoted Iraqi Vice President Taha
Yassin Ramadan as saying that the Iraqi leadership will positively
deal and fully cooperate with Annan in the implementation of the
U.N. Security Council resolutions, which stipulate the
preservation of Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan pointed out that his country is actually implementing
the Security Council resolutions and cooperating diplomatically
with the U.N. committees.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, he added, is also cooperating with all Arab and foreign
initiatives for a political settlement of the current crisis, to
avoid the premeditated military aggression posed by the United
States. But the U.S., he said, is refusing dialogue as a means to
resolve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a U.N. advance team of about 20 members who arrived
in Baghdad Thursday have embarked on a series of consultations
with Iraqi authorities to prepare the grounds for Annan's
visit. Scheduled for Friday, Annan's visit is considered the last
attempt for a peaceful solution of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua learned from well-informed diplomatic sources here
Thursday that the embassies of Poland, the Czech republic,
Bulgaria and Hungary have started to evacuate families of their
diplomatic staff and a sector of their employees out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The evacuations are in anticipation of a U.S. military attack
against Iraq, despite the prevailing optimism that Annan's visit
will bring about a diplomatic end to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-nine U.N. relief workers were evacuated Thursday from
Baghdad in precaution of a U.S. military strike against
Iraq. Another 30 or so humanitarian workers are expected to leave
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign embassies in Baghdad, however, are awaiting the
outcome of Annan's visit to decide whether to evacuate their
officials from Iraq.

Asked about his negotiating skills with Iraqi President Saddam

him the situation very clearly and get him to understand it is in
his best interest and in the interest of the Iraqi people to agree
to implement Security Council resolutions.
</P>

Annan said this was not an easy mission because the
relationship between the United Nations and the Government of Iraq
was very difficult, and there were a great deal of suspicions on
both sides.
The UN chief said he had all the elements he needs for the trip.

MOSCOW, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Georgian kidnappers keeping
four U.N. military observers and a local family hostage in the
western Georgian are demanding a dialogue with the authorities,
the release of all political prisoners and the withdrawal of
Russian troops from Georgia, the Interfax news agency reported
from Tbilisi on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
These abductors demanded earlier that the 11 detained suspects
who were accused of complicity in the attempt on the life of
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze February 9, be released.
</P>
<P>
According to a TV journalist, the terrorists are armed with
assault rifles, machine guns and rocket launchers and in a
fighting mood and will resist if the house where they stay is
stormed. Their commander is Gocha Esebua, who is wanted in
connection with the attempt on Shevardnadze's life.
</P>
<P>
Georgian National Security Minister Dzhemal Gakhokidze has left
for the village of Dzhikhaskari, where the hostages and terrorists
are, to oversee an operation for the release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The report said that all National Security Ministry units in
Georgia have been put on alert, while all roads leading into and
out of the Tsalendzhi district have been sealed off by police.
</P>
<P>
The Georgian Foreign Ministry regarded the hostage-taking as a
continuation of the attempt on the president's life and
undermining independence, stability and democratic development of
Georgia and all countries in the Caucasus.

<P>
"Pharmacies have to meet the conditions set in the guidelines
to have their licences renewed," said Director of the board Mecy
Kimaro.
</P>
<P>
Mecy Kimaro told the press Thursday that the board has banned
the use of furazolidone drug in the country because it has been
proved to cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
The drug, which is usually used to treat typhoid for livestock
and sometimes for human beings, has already been banned by World
Health Organization (WHO) and other countries.
</P>
<P>
She advised people to destroy the drug in a way recommended by
the board.
</P>
<P>
The official has recommended people to use safer, cheaper, and
more efficient drugs such as norfloxacin to replace furazolidone.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the official said from now on, practitioners
wishing to advertise drugs and medical services in the mass media
must obtain written permit from her board.
</P>
<P>
The board will also screen all the advertisements to get rid
of phrases exaggerating the function of a certain medicine,
whether for human beings or for animals, She said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Wishes Diplomatic End to Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus would like to see a
diplomatic solution to the Iraqi crisis as soon as possible and
welcomes the visit of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to the
area, a government statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued Thursday by the Foreign Ministry said the
Cyprus government is following with special interest and concern
the dangerous dimensions which the continued Iraqi crisis has
taken.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' firm position is and remains that every member state
of the international community has a fundamental obligation, as
specified by the U.N. Charter and international law, to implement
and fully abide by the decisions of the U.N., especially those of
the Security Council, which has the main responsibility to
maintain international peace and security, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out, "Our whish and desire is to see the Iraqi
crisis settled the soonest possible through peaceful means to
avert the use of force and disturbance of peace and stability in
the region."
</P>
<P>
For this reason, "we welcome the forthcoming visit of the
U.N. secretary-general to the region, with the consent of the
Security Council permanent members, in an effort to find a
diplomatic solution to the problem," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, government spokesman Manolis Christofides
described Annan's visit to Baghdad as "a golden opportunity to
defuse the crisis through diplomatic means."
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on if the British military bases in Cyprus
would be used in a way similar to that during the Gulf War in
1991, Christofides said "we see nothing reprehensible if the
British bases are used for U.N. purposes."
</P>
<P>
The former colonial power, Britain, retained two military
bases in Cyprus, one on the southeastern coast and the other the
southwestern coast, after the island's independence in 1960.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania-Zambia Highway Closed after Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian-Zambia highway
has been temporarily closed to motor vehicles following the collapse of
the Great Ruaha Bridge on the border between the Iringa and Morogoro
regions.
</P>
<P>
The Iringa Regional Police Commander, Ramadhani Gwebe, said
Thursday that the dilapidated bridge collapsed when a heavy duty
lorry was crossing recently.
</P>
<P>
The lorry, belonging to the Iringa Regional Transport Company, was
heading for Dar es Salaam. But no one was killed or injured
when the bridge collapsed, Gwebe said.
</P>
<P>
Until Thursday morning, the lorry was still waiting for salvage.
</P>
<P>
A number of motor vehicles have been stranded on either side of
the collapsed bridge.
</P>
<P>
The bridge is believed to have collapsed after its pillars were
partly washed away as a result of the on-going rains linked to the
El-Nino weather phenomenon.

WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter on Thursday urged the White House to reconsider its
military action against Iraq, saying such an action would weaken
the United States in the international community.

<P>
"I really disapprove the launching of bomb attacks against

Carter made the remarks after his address to international

<HEADLINE> Somali Factions Working for Peace Conference, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Somali factions are taking steps
toward convening a national peace conference to end six years of
civil war in the Horn of Africa country, according to a Egyptian
diplomat on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"There are positive measures taken by the Somali factions to put
into force the agreement and to hold the conference on March 31,"
Deputy Assistant Foreign Minister for African Affairs Fayza
Abul-Naga quoted a report by Egyptian Ambassador to Somalia
Mahmoud Mostafa as saying.
</P>
<P>
She said the meetings held among various tribes to settle the
issue of Mogadishu, the fragmented Somali capital, was a basic
process for implementation of the Cairo Agreement for national
reconciliation in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
She voiced hope that such meetings would be conducive to
holding the conference, the central component of a peace
initiative brokered by Egypt and backed by the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo Declaration signed by warring Somali factions on
December 22 called for the formation of a federal government in
Somalia for the first time in more than six years of clan war as
well as holding a National Reconciliation Conference in Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
However, the two main faction leaders in the Somali capital
said on February 14 they had postponed the meeting a day before
its scheduled convocation in the central town of Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Hussein Aideed, both self-declared
presidents, said in Mogadishu that the conference had been
postponed until March 31, citing "technical problems," chiefly
lack of cash.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian diplomat said an international coordination
committee, comprising the Organization of Islamic Conference, the
Organization of African Unity and the Arab states, has been formed
to urge the world community to extend a helping hand to ensure the
conference opens in time.
</P>
<P>
Some Arab states have reportedly offered assistance via the
league to meet the Somali demand estimated at 4.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 465-member conference, the biggest gathering of warring
factions in years, is supposed to set up a 13-member Presidential
Council to select a president and a prime minister to lead its
first real government since the 1991 ouster of the late president
Mohamed Siad Barre.
</P>
<P>
Since then Somalia has been fragmented into fiefdoms protected
by faction leaders to fight to expand their turfs. The fighting,
combined with a 1992 famine, has claimed about 300,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Iraqi Crisis Overshadows Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Osama el-Baz, political advisor
of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, said here Thursday the
standoff between Iraq and the United Nations has overshadowed the
deadlocked Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Iraqi crisis now in the limelight, has in a way restricted the
drive of the Middle East peace process," el-Baz said after a
meeting with Ahmed Qurei, head of the Palestinian Legislative
Council who is visiting here, and Mohamed Bassiuny, Egyptian
ambassador to Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for the U.S. administration's proposals for
forwarding the peace process, but Iraq's crisis has been given
priority," he added, quoted by the Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been stranded since
last March over Israel's settlement building and dragged into
deeper recession following two suicide bombing attacks in
Jerusalem in last July and September.
</P>
<P>
El-Baz hoped the mission of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
in Iraq will succeed, citing Baghdad's proclaimed readiness to
cooperate with him.
</P>
<P>
El-Baz denied the U.S. intends to mount a strike against Iraq
at any rate. "Nobody can say that the U.S. will ignore this
mission (of Annan)," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also rejected the idea that Annan's mission is only confined
to "carrying the last warning." Annan has complete mandate from
the Security Council permanent members to resolve the crisis so
long as Iraq opens up all suspected sites to U.N. arms inspectors
in the presence of diplomats, he said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said here Thursday that he did not believe that Annan was carrying
"impossible terms" to Baghdad when regional and world public
opinion is against the military option.
</P>
<P>
He added that Cairo is assiduously working to keep alive the
momentum to find a political solution to the current crisis and
avert the dire consequences facing the Iraqi people and the entire
region.
</P>
<P>
Annan, backed by the five permanent Security Council members,
will arrive in Baghdad on Friday in a "last-ditch" effort to
settle the crisis through political and diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been reinforcing an extensive naval, air and
troops buildup in the Gulf in preparation for a strike if Baghdad
continues barring U.N. arms inspectors from entering presidential
sites.

<HEADLINE> UN Inspectors Continue Mission in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. arms inspectors carried
out their missions on Thursday despite the standoff with Iraq over
monitoring presidential sites, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Nine inspection teams of the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM) visited nine sites, an official charged with guiding the
inspectors said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the teams did their work in helicopter, he was quoted
by the news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM is to certify that Iraq has destroyed all the
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles
to launch them.
</P>
<P>
Only then will the U.N. Security Council lift economic
sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official added that a technical team dispatched by
the International Atomic Energy Agency held talks with the Iraqi
side during the day. But he declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The standoff between Iraq and the UNSCOM is still in place
after the United States and Britain rejected Iraq's proposal to
search eight presidential sites by inspectors appointed by
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have said they will attack Iraq if it does
not grant full and unfettered access to the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
In the last-ditch effort to mediate a peaceful settlement for
the Iraq crisis, the U.N. chief is scheduled to visit Baghdad
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Find Link Between Height, Month of Birth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- People's eventual height may
depend on the month in which they are born, Austrian researchers
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A survey of more than half a million soldiers over a period of
10 years in Austria has found that men born in the spring tend to
be taller when grow up than those born in the autumn.
</P>
<P>
Though the variation is about 0.6 centimeters with the average
occurring for babies born from spring to autumn, experts from the
University of Vienna were confident that the link exists.
</P>
<P>
They found that the clear link between height and the month of
birth followed a pattern that peaked at the beginning of April and
fell to its lowest point at the beginning of October.
</P>
<P>
Publishing their finding in the scientific journal Nature,
researchers suggested that this could be caused by the pineal
gland, located in the brain, which produces the growth hormone
melatonin.
</P>
<P>
The amount of sunshine that babies born in the spring
experience in the three months after birth, which is the period of
fastest growth, may keep the pineal gland active, researchers
said.

<HEADLINE> European Shares down on Weak Dow, Profit-taking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
failed to sustain their recent rally and ended slightly lower
Thursday, undermined by Wall Street's decline and market
consolidation.
</P>
<P>
British shares in London closed slightly down after a four-day
rally in a row, with the FTSE 100 index at 5,718.5, down 4.9
points.
</P>
<P>
The market had earlier surged ahead to record levels, but fell
back in the early afternoon after heavy losses in early trading on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The early rise was fuelled by official figures indicating
interest rate rises might have peaked.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt paused for breath and drifted in
thin trade as a period of consolidation set in, said dealers. A
drop below 4,600 was on the cards.
</P>
<P>
The DAX-30 index closed 48.39 points lower at 4,580.44.
</P>
<P>
But dealers said that they were confident that the market will
stage rallies over the next few days, supported by steady Asian
markets, the Dow's recent gains and some good corporate news.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French stocks finished with moderate losses as
investors began a bout of profit-taking following two consecutive
record closing highs and a downturn in New York, with the CAC-40
index ending at 3,250.63, down 31.08 points or 0.95 percent.

<HEADLINE> White House Tries to Invoke Executive Privilege </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The White House is
reportedly making efforts to protect the confidentiality of deputy
counsel Bruce Lindsey's discussions with President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Lindsey, one of Clinton's closest aides and confidantes,
appeared at the federal courthouse for a second day of testimony
Thursday before Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury. He
was accompanied by a group of attorneys, including White House
counsel Charles Ruff.
</P>
<P>
An outside attorney, W. Neil Eggleston, also was retained to
spearhead the effort to protect Lindsey, by means of executive
privilege if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Such privilege, if invoked by the president, would protect his
conversations, usually those regarding the conduct of foreign
policy or affairs of state.
</P>
<P>
It remains controversial, though, whether the privilege could
be invoked to protect Clinton in such personal matters as the case
of former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, who claims to have
had an affair with him, and that he urged her to lie about it.
Starr's grand jury is investigating the charges, which Clinton has
repeatedly denied.
</P>
<P>
Executive privilege is intended to create a so-called zone of
privacy for the president within which a prosecutor cannot
inquire. But while meant to ensure the president receives candid
advice from subordinates, it also is a qualified privilege that
can be overridden by law enforcement priorities.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said the lawyers still were
trying to resolve the dispute with Starr over the "confidentiality
of communications" between Lindsey and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Lindsey apparently objected to several questions put to him
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Although Kennedy said he was prohibited from discussing the
secret proceedings, he indicated the situation was unresolved.
</P>
<P>
Lindsey, meanwhile, remained in the courthouse after the closed
hearing.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, heading out of town on a fund-raising trip, said, "The
White House counsel is trying to resolve that issue today and
while he's working on it I don't think I should comment on it."

<HEADLINE> Rubin: G-7 London Meeting Focuses on Asian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Asian financial crisis
is likely on the top of the agenda for Saturday's meeting of G-7,
the world's most industrialized nations' finance ministers in
London.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin told a press
briefing here Thursday that economic crisis in Asia will dominate
discussions at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
This meeting "occurs at a critical time in the global economy",
he noted. In recent months, financial instability in Asia has
"shaken the region and affected economies around the world,
including our own, and the economic and national security
interests of the United States has been brought sharply into
focus."
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers and central bank governors of the G-7
major industrial nations which include Britain, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, will hold their
meeting in London this weekend to discuss the global economy.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The situation in Asia will dominate the meetings this
weekend, first in our discussions of steps the G-7 can take to
improve the prospects of resolving the situation; and more
generally as the backdrop for our ongoing efforts to improve the
international financial architecture to prevent future crises or
manage them if they occur."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said strong growth in the G7 is important to help foster
recovery in Asia.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. Treasury Secretary, the upcoming meeting
will focus their discussions on major four fields: to review the
overall state of the world economy, to discuss the progress the
Asian economies have made in recent months, then to discuss a
proposal for the Trade Finance Initiative, a multilateral effort
to provide necessary short term trade credits for Asian nations
and finally to discuss the U.S. efforts to receive the new funding
for the International Monetary Fund.

Madeleine Albright said Thursday that the United States would not

inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
She said she backed the last-ditch effort of diplomacy by U.N.

access for weapons inspectors to check suspected weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
Albright was at Tennessee State University to tell an audience
why the United States must seek military action against Iraq once
diplomacy fails.
</P>
<P>
Having experienced embarrassment at a college campus in Ohio
State University where anti-war slogans and banners greeted
Albright and her colleagues Defense Secretary William Cohen and
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, the secretary of state
this time held a classroom-style discussion with a small group to
hear her make a case for a looming military action against Iraq.

<P>
LUANDA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Portugal and the five
Portuguese-speaking nations in Africa are to work out the final
plan for the formation of a joint peace-keeping force at the
coming July defense ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan News Agency said Thursday that the joint forces
are to carry out the peace-keeping missions according to the
decision by the United Nations and the Organization of the
African Unity.
</P>
<P>
Another purpose of the joint forces was to strengthen the
cooperation among the Portuguese-speaking nations. Portugal has
been helping the five Portuguese-speaking nations in Africa in
military training.
</P>
<P>
The five African Portuguese-speaking nations are Angola,
Mozambique, Guinea Bissau, Cape Verde, and Sao Tome &AMP; Principe.
</P>
<P>
The idea to form such forces was initiated by Antonio
Vitorino, former Defense Minister of Portugal in 1997 when he
visited Angola and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The African Portuguese-speaking nations have been showing
great concerns over the UN peace-keeping missions on the
continent. Military troops from Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde have
arrived at predestined point for the joint military manoeuvre to
be held along the borders of Mali, Mauritania and Senegal between
20 and 31 this month.

<HEADLINE> Chubais Says Russia's GDP Can Rise 4 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Russian First Deputy Prime
Minister Anatoly Chubais said that current conditions in Russia
promise a four percent increase in GDP in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the collegium of the Russian Finance Ministry
Friday, Chubais noted this goal could not be set a year ago, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
To realize the GDP growth, Russia must change the basic
economic parameters for better and dump the financial garbage that
has been accumulating for years, Chubais said.
</P>
<P>
He continued that on this road the first steps are the
repayments of pensions and wages, discontinuation of Finance
Ministry guarantees for commercial bank loans, and a total ban on
tax offsets as of January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Chubais emphasized that economic growth will be impossible
without a realistic 1998 budget or taxation and budget codes, that
are waiting for the adoption of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the State Tax Service's board Friday Chubais
also said the Russian board this year should raise tax revenues by
20-25 percent against 1997 levels.
</P>
<P>
Chubais stressed that a new version of the government
resolution on the restructuring of company debts should be signed

<HEADLINE> Chinese Journalists Mark Centennial of Zhou Enlai's Birth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of Chinese journalists
from the major press organizations of the Chinese capital gathered
here today to mark the centennial of the late Chinese premier Zhou
Enlai's birth.
</P>
<P>
Veteran journalists recalled Zhou's guidance and support to the
Chinese press in more than half a century from the war years to
the years following the founding of People's Republic in 1949,
particularly his guidance and support to the country's international
publicity.
</P>
<P>
They said that reviewing his teachings to journalists is of
immediate significance in improving their news reporting under the
guidance of Marxism, Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng
Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Enlai (March 5, 1898 -- January 8, 1976) served as China's
premier in 1949-1976.

<HEADLINE> EU Official Praises Greece for Structural Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting European Union (EU)
Internal Market Commissioner Mario Monti praised Greece on Friday
for the government's determination in making the necessary
structural changes to help the country's integration in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his talks with Greek Economy and Finance
Minister Yiannos Papantoniou and Bank of Greece Governor Lucas
Papademos, Monti said that the speed at which the Greek economy
was adapting to the EU convergence criteria was remarkable.
</P>
<P>
Greece had made "substantial progress in adapting Greek
legislation to EU internal market directives, he added.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Greece does not meet any of the criteria for the
EU's Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) but hopes to qualify by
January 2001 at the latest.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal, the Greek government has quickened its
pace to restructure the economy by partly privatizing the
loss-making or bankrupt state-run enterprises.

<HEADLINE> EU Suggests a U.S.-EU Partnership on Labor Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior European Union (EU)
official Friday appealed to the EU and the United States to seek a
partnership on Labor Standards.
</P>
<P>
"Our best chance of achieving good working conditions for
people around the world is through a partnership," said European
Employment Commissioner Padraig Flynn at a symposium attended by
EU and American representatives.
</P>
<P>
The one-day symposium, jointly organized by the European
Commission and the U.S. Department of Labor, discussed sectoral
codes of conduct and their role in promoting core labor standards.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission has pressed for the respect by third
world countries of certain internationally-accepted social
standards, and it has proposed a range of attractive incentives
under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSPs) for third world
countries that respect certain social and environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Flynn said that both the EU and the United States
are entering a new stage where the partnership approach to codes
of conduct plays a bigger role.
</P>
<P>
In the EU, the footwear, commerce, textile and clothing sectors
have joined forces to develop agreements covering all companies in
their sector, Flynn told symposium participants.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said the EU-U.S. symposium on codes of conduct
will be a natural complement to the commission's ongoing efforts
to promote improved respect of social standards through its other
policies.
</P>
<P>
"The symposium will enable both the EU and the U.S. to learn
from their respective experiences in promoting higher social
standards in a business-friendly manner," Flynn said.

<HEADLINE> Athens Fears More Bomb Attacks Against U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Greek authorities are preparing
for the possibilities of more attacks against American or British
targets following Thursday's bomb blast, the Athens News newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bomb, which occurred at the U.S. General Motors car
dealership in the northern Athens suburb of Maroussi shortly after
midnight Thursday morning, badly damaged offices in the rear part
of the dealership, but caused no injuries.
</P>
<P>
This is the third American target to be hit in Greece
recently. Two weeks ago, two American McDonalds fast-food
restaurants in the northern Athens suburbs of Halandri and
Vrilissia were also attacked in separate bomb explosions.
</P>
<P>
Greek police believe the three incidents are related and may be
connected to the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
They suspect that Greece's terrorist organization "November 17"
is responsible for the bomb attacks.
</P>
<P>
During the Gulf War in 1991, November 17 guerrillas declared
that it had chosen four targets as a show of solidarity with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Greece, along with Russia, France and other
countries, have expressed their opposition to the use of force in
dealing with the Iraqi crisis, while the U.S. and Britain are in
favor of a military strike.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Airdrops Relief for Afghan Quake Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan air-dropped 10 tons
of relief goods Friday over the earthquake-hit region in north
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The dilapidated condition of the runway and snow-clad roads
forced us to airdrop tents and blankets," Babar Malik, a senior
official from the Foreign Ministry said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
This was the second air-drop since February 9, when an equal
amount of goods were sent to the area, where more than 4,000
people were killed and at least 15,000 houses collapsed in a
strong quake on February 4 and aftershocks.
</P>
<P>
The goods were dropped over Khawaja Ghar and Rustak in the
northern Afghan Province of Takhar.
</P>
<P>
"We have scheduled two more air-drops of 10 tons each on
Thursday," Malik said, adding: "The relief operation is expected
to be completed over the next five to six days, depending on the
weather conditions."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was the first country to send relief goods to the
earthquake victims. A C-130 aircraft carrying relief goods landed
near Amu River on February 9.

<HEADLINE> India Should be Self-Reliant in Technology: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- India's answers to
persistent technology denial by advanced nations lie in growth of
indigenous technology and self-reliance, Minister of State for
Science Y. Alagh said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a lecture on technology policy and national
security, Alagh said that India should continue to signal to the
West that technology controls would only firm up its resolve to
attain self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
Developed nations have used technology denial through a
combination of international and political pressures to maintain
their dominance in the international market, which has been
detrimental to India, he said.
</P>
<P>
Leap-frogging the development process through appropriate and
judicious use of high technologies such as space, biotechnology
and information technology should become an essential element of
the technology policy, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Area in North China To Start Rebuilding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- People in rural parts of the
city of Zhangjiakou are to rebuild their homes in the midst of the
destruction left by the earthquake early this year.
</P>
<P>
An official from Zhangjiakou said here today that the work will
start in May since cold weather makes construction work hard now.
</P>
<P>
Su Zhensan, vice mayor of Zhangjiakou, said construction of
homes, hospitals and schools will be given priority and work will
begin soon.
</P>
<P>
The 6.2l-degree quake on January 10 claimed about 50 lives,
injured thousands, and destroyed more than 100,000 rooms in
seconds. Snowstorms and freezing weather made relief work
difficult in the following days.
</P>
<P>
Su said local governments are making every effort to ensure all
schools in the area can begin the new term before March 10.
</P>
<P>
He is in Beijing to talk to the Red Cross Society of China
about rebuilding work funded by donations. The society has raised
more than 70 million yuan in relief funds and materials for the
quake-hit area so far.

<HEADLINE> EU to Investigate Dispute Against Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission will
investigate a dispute against Ukraine over its discriminatory
practices related to its car market.
</P>
<P>
The commission will start formal consultations with Ukraine on
the dispute. If the talks fail, the commission is set to start
dispute settlement procedures, commission officials said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The officials claimed that last September Ukraine adopted a law
granting discriminatory fiscal advantages to South Korea's Daewoo,
following its major investment in the Ukrainian car manufacturer
AvtoZAZ.
</P>
<P>
The law will make it virtually impossible for anyone else to
sell cars in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive agency of the 15-nation European
Union, said this law violates the most-favored nation rules of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) and several clauses in the Interim
Trade Agreement between the EU and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The law also runs counter to Ukraine's stated objective of
integration into the world economy, the officials argued.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal advantages the law grants Daewoo include exemptions
from all import duties on imports used by AvtoZAZ, from all
value-added taxes on imports and sales, from land tax and from the
state innovation fund tax. The law also reduces the profit tax
base for the company.
</P>
<P>
The law compounds another special law writing off various
fiscal debts and officially-guaranteed credits of the joint stock
company AvtoZAZ.

<HEADLINE> Reform of Police Stations Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- China's police stations have
made new progress in reforming their routine work, a senior
Public Security Ministry official said today.
</P>
<P>
In a number of cities, especially in "safe communities", the
term for communities managed by a specially designated group of
people, the number of burglaries, robberies, bicycle thefts has
dropped considerably.
</P>
<P>
After a national conference in April of last year, police
stations across China have shifted their focus from only criminal
cases to precautions against possible criminal activities and
maintaining order in communities.
</P>
<P>
To increase ties with ordinary citizens, most police stations
have adopted various measures to serve the people and have a
closer relationship with residents, allowing them to get more
helpful clues in crime solving.
</P>
<P>
Part of their work is helping establish safe
communities. Heilongjiang Province, for example, has 6,490 safe
communities.

WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton warned Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein Thursday not to mistake the skeptical questions that
confronted the administration at a televised forum in Ohio as a
sign that Americans lack the resolve for military action.
</P>
<P>
-- North Korea made a surprising offer of political dialogue to
South Korea Thursday, sending letters across the fortified border
offering talks between political parties and civic groups on each
side.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- To the Pentagon, the term "collateral damage" has long been
a euphemism for the loss of civilian life and property. But the
phrase has taken on a broader meaning in the Arab world. Iraq
neighbors fear a burden if U.S. strikes.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton, saying Kofi Annan's mission could
avert a U.S.-led attack only if Baghdad agrees to comply with all
arms-inspection demands, ordered top national security aides to
postpone overseas travel.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lawyers Now Looking At World Market (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Lawyers are now being
seen in a number of cities worldwide, as the integration of
China's economy with the world economy continues.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Yang, China's Minister of Justice, who attended a ceremony
today for 17 foreign law firms who have gotten approval to open
offices in China, said that, in the past two years, 13 Chinese law
firms have opened offices in the U.S., Canada, Russia, and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
This is a result of China's successful reforms and opening up,
and the increasing demand of overseas Chinese enterprises for
international legal services, he added.
</P>
<P>
As the number of qualified Chinese lawyers grows, and market
consciousness grows, going abroad has become a necessary fact of
life for Chinese lawyers, Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
China revived its lawyer system in 1979, just after the
nightmare of the Cultural Revolution, and since that time,
according to Ren Jisheng, president of the All-China Lawyers
Association, lawyers' business has been expanding at the world's
highest speed.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, China begin to reform its lawyer system by improving
the quality of lawyers and improving management. At the same
time, a large number of lawyers returning from abroad have done
much to narrow the gap between China and the rest of the world in
terms of legal services.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Welcomes U.N. Chief's Visit to Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos Friday welcomed United Nations Security Council's decision
to send U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to Baghdad in a
last-ditch diplomatic effort to resolve the U.S.-Iraq impasse over
weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said in a statement that as a member of the U.N., the
Philippines supports the full implementation of all Security
Council resolutions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the Philippines also subscribes "faithfully"
to the U.N. Charter which provides for the settlement of disputes
through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
"It is in this context that the government of the Philippines
joins the international community in strongly urging the
contending parties in this impasse to give U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's diplomatic initiative the chance to succeed," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Annan is scheduled to arrive in Baghdad on Friday in an attempt
to find a peaceful settlement of the U.S.-Iraq stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also urged the Iraqi leadership to fully cooperate with
Annan "in order to avert any military action that may be taken to
enforce the U.N. Security Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
He said Annan's visit to Baghdad signifies international
support for a peaceful and diplomatic solution that would allow
U.N. weapons inspectors "to have unfettered access to all sites in
the country as mandated by the U.N."
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials have declared that they would exert all efforts
to make Annan's mission a success, although they have expressed
the hope that Annan would keep an open mind to Iraqi proposals.
</P>
<P>
"We commend the efforts of the U.N. secretary general in
finding a diplomatic solution to the current crisis, and we wish
him success in his noble endeavor," Ramos said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lawyers Look At World Market (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are at least 110,000 lawyers in China, nearly two times
the number four years ago, and 8,300 law firms, nearly twice the
1994 figure.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that stability, smooth economic growth, and a
significant improvement in legal work have created the right
conditions for the going abroad trend.
</P>
<P>
According to Ren, Chinese lawyers have been involved in
businesses in more than 180 countries and regions. But, he says,
the number of foreign offices Chinese lawyers have set up abroad
is far from enough when one considers the large demand when China
began expanding social, economic, and cultural ties with the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar today in Beijing on exchanges and cooperation
between Chinese and foreign lawyers, Vice Minister of Justice
Zhang Geng said that more Chinese lawyers abroad will help to
bridge the gap in legal systems of different countries, and
safeguard and promote international economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Encouraging Chinese lawyers to step outside the country's door
is a way of helping China's economic development and improving the
country's legal system, he said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Top Official Raps U.S. Policy Toward Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian Vice-Prime Minister
Boris Nemtsov Friday attacked the United States policy toward Iraq
and warned of contamination from Iraqi chemical and
bacteriological weapons if the U.S. bombed that country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French daily Le Figaro, Nemtsov said
that Russia expects United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to
obtain some results from Baghdad to prevent the United States from
using force.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that this situation cannot continue without
results. And if there are results, it is not likely that the
United States will act openly against the U.N.," said Nemtsov.
</P>
<P>
He said that although no country can counter the United States
alone, groups of countries can raise a different point of view.
</P>
<P>
"The case of Iraq is significant. If it had not been for the
voices of France, Russia, Italy, China and Japan, the American
pilots could have dropped their bombs on Iraq long ago," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov said that if the United States bombs Iraq's chemical
and bacteriological weapons, it will have disastrous consequences
on the whole region.
</P>
<P>
"The position defended by the Americans is not very
intelligent: Bombing Iraq does not make sense if it is not to bomb
bacteriological weapons. And if it is to bomb these weapons, there
will be a risk to the whole region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov also said the U.S. government is in a very awkward
position because it has already spent one billion U.S. dollars in
preparing for this war and it has also sent tens of thousands of
American troops to the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
"But Saddam is always there, always alive. How can you explain
that to the American people? It would be better to think it over
before sending aircraft carriers and marine infantry there," he
added.

<HEADLINE> China Military Contact with Other Nations (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The military agreement was an example of the efforts that the
two countries are making to maintain peace and stability in the
region and the world and showed that bilateral relations are on a
track of continuous improvement and progress.
</P>
<P>
Military exchanges play a crucial role in China's effort to
preserve a peaceful and stable environment for economic
development. It has stepped up efforts to promote relations with
neighboring countries in the past year and continues to expand
military contacts this year.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Japan earlier this month, Chi reached an
accord with Japanese officials on defense departments of the two
countries and the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) and the
Self-Defense Forces of Japan. The two sides agreed to exchange
visits of senior military officials this year. Chi is the first
senior Chinese military chief to visit land and maritime bases and
a training school of the Self-Defense Forces of Japan.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Japanese Defense Agency Director-General
Fumio Kyumato in Tokyo on February 4, Chi pointed out that China
expects Japan to take a definite stance in dealing with Taiwan
under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between Japan
and the US to ease China's doubts over US-Japanese security
cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
Kyumato said that the treaty is a bilateral arrangement between
Japan and the US and is not directed against any third country and
will not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. He
said it will not exceed the scope of bilateral arrangement in the
future and that Japan will stick to the basic joint statement of
the Chinese and Japanese governments by maintaining merely
unofficial relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The defense and security dialogues help form a new concept of
security in the international community. In talks with Cohen in
Beijing, Chi pointed out that at present, relations between major
powers are undergoing a strategic readjustment. In the new
situation, neither expanding military alliances nor strengthening
military alliances is conducive to maintenance of peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
Military leaders of China and the United States, Japan, New
Zealand and Australia said that countries should
enhance mutual trust and understanding through dialogue and
cooperation and promise to solve disputes and conflicts by
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
They said that developing and strengthening defense exchanges
and security dialogues with China are beneficial to maintaining
peace and stability in the region and in the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
China has also used military contacts to counter the "China
Threat Theory." In speeches at Japan's National Institute for
Defense Studies and the Australian College of Defense and
Strategic Studies, Chi explained China's defense policy and its
views on regional security and stance on bilateral relations. He
pointed out that China will not expand even when it becomes strong
in the future and that when China is developed and becomes strong,
it will not pose a threat to any country, but rather will make a
greater contribution to mankind as an important force of
safeguarding world peace and stability.

PARIS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- France said Friday that it
supports an increase in aid to Asia by European Union (EU)
countries before the second European-Asian summit is held in
London in April.
</P>
<P>
"It appears timely to us that the EU show more directly its
support to the countries hit by the financial crisis and its
intention to continue its engagement with Asia," said French
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine will make some proposals
on increasing EU aid to Asia to France's European partners, she
said.
</P>
<P>
So far, EU countries have provided financial aid to

<HEADLINE> New Rule Guards Smooth Implementation of Criminal Procedural Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- China's judiciary and law
enforcement offices released a new set of regulations safeguarding
the criminal procedure, setting up uniform standards for criminal
cases, according to Yang Runshi, a senior judge with the Supreme
People's Court.
</P>
<P>
The regulations have the same legal effect as the revised
criminal procedure law, legal experts say.
</P>
<P>
It has 48 specific articles on file for investigation,
testimony and evidence, custody, procedure of investigation, death
sentence review, and other items.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, China revised the 16-year-old criminal procedure
law, getting rid of detention without arrest.
</P>
<P>
However, the lack of necessary judicial explanation in the new
regulations led to different law enforcement, resulting from
different understanding of the law, said senior officials.
</P>
<P>
A few of judicial workers stopped lawyers from meeting with
clients, which contradicts the spirit of the new regulation, Yang
said, and now many articles cover early intervention by lawyers.
</P>
<P>
If the case does not concern national secrets, lawyers can meet
with criminal suspects without needing approval, and this should
be done within 48 hours, or at most five days.
</P>
<P>
It also says that no judicial office can stop a meeting between
lawyers and suspects simply for the sake of investigation or trial
procedure.

<HEADLINE> PLA, Armed Police Remember Deng Xiaoping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's
Liberation Army and armed police held commemorative
activities today for Deng Xiaoping for the first anniversary of
his death on February 19.
</P>
<P>
They recently watched two documentaries on Deng's life, and
attended lectures and forums commemorating his illustrious deeds.
</P>
<P>
The best way to cherish Deng's memory is to carry out his great
conception of "one country, two systems" and contribute to Hong
Kong's long-term stability, according to officers and soldiers of
the Hong Kong Garrison of the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
To study the guidelines of the 15th Party National Congress and
Deng Xiaoping Theory, PLA and armed police units have held 1,360
training courses for 54,000 officers above the regiment level in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
After studying Deng Xiaoping's theory on building the military
in the new period and Jiang Zemin's expositions, military
personnel expressed their determination to accomplish all the
tasks assigned by the CPC Central Committee and the Central
Military Commission, and provide a strong security guarantee for
the reforms, opening-up and modernization.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Ruling Party Announces Economic Stimulus Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Japan's ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) on Friday unveiled a new economic
pump-priming package that calls for the use of public funds to
stimulate the property market.
</P>
<P>
The LDP package consists of economic measures that require no
massive fiscal spending by the government and is aimed at helping
Japanese companies close the fiscal 1997 books smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The package calls for enactment of a law that would let
companies change the assessed value of their landholdings and
incorporate part of the unrealized profit on them into their
capital.
</P>
<P>
Land-value revaluation is primarily intended to help banks with
large landholdings shore up their capital base and loosen their
grip on credit. Japanese banks have been reluctant to lend so as
not to deteriorate their capital-to-asset ratios.
</P>
<P>
The package also urges revising the Commercial Code to allow
companies to use their capital reserves to buy back their issued
shares for disposal. Buybacks are expected to cut the number of
outstanding shares and prop up the sagging stock market.
</P>
<P>
A key proposal in the package is the use of public funds to
stimulate the property by purchasing land held by financial
institutions as collateral for bad loans.
</P>
<P>
The LDP package also calls for easing regulations on how
welfare pension fund managers can apply the money entrusted to
them so that they can invest the funds in areas currently
forbidden.
</P>
<P>
Citing that it includes effective measures to stimulate
economic activity, some Japanese business leaders welcomed the
package.
</P>
<P>
But others doubt the effectiveness of the package, saying that
income and corporate tax cuts of 10 trillion yen (about 79.4
billion U.S. dollars) are needed to realize a steady economic
recovery.

WELLINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian pole vaulter Dmitry
Markov surpassed the six meter mark to steal the highlight from
Olympic 100m champion Donovan Bailey and discus world champion
Beatrice Faumuina Friday night at the Robin Tait Classic athletics
meeting in Auckland.
</P>
<P>
Bailey clocked 10.32 seconds to win the 100-meter sprint from
his training partner Vince Henderson of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Faumuina set a new New Zealand residents record of 67.58
meters, eclipsing her own previous record of 66.41m.
</P>
<P>
But it was the Russian who achieved a new personal best in the
pole vault and became the fourth man to vault over 6m (the world
record is 6.14m).
</P>
<P>
Markov arrived in New Zealand after clearing 5.85m in
Adelaide. The Russian sailed over 5.70m for his first jump and
asked for the bar to be moved up to 6m and surprised himself with
his second jump.
</P>
<P>
It beat his own previous best of 5.95m and immediately after he
went in search of Sergei Bubka's record but didn't have the
experience to seriously challenge the mark.

the initiative to resume dialogue with India.
</P>
<P>
Resolution of the outstanding issues between the two countries
including the core issue of Kashmir is an essential prerequisite
for peace and stability in the region and will impart a tremendous
fillip to regional economic cooperation, Ayub Khan noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the foreign minister said Pakistan has a vital
interest in bringing an end to the turmoil in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Toward this end, Pakistan has launched a peace initiative which

<HEADLINE> Zhou Enlai in the Memory of Foreign Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- "When I asked Zhou Enlai in
1944 whether China would have a coalition government, he
replied,`yes, with or without him (Chiang Kai-shek).' He was so
confident in the people's will to unite."
</P>
<P>
Although half a century has elapsed, Israel Epstein still
clearly remembers every word the late Chinese statesman said, with
iron in his voice.
</P>
<P>
Today, visiting an exhibition on the late premier at the
Museum of Chinese Revolution here, 82-year-old Epstein bowed his
head before a smiling bust of Zhou as he recalled again the wise
advice Zhou had given him when he was a special correspondent for
the New York Times and the Time magazine in China back in the
1940s.
</P>
<P>
It took Epstein, a naturalized Chinese citizen and a leading
figure in the Chinese media nowadays, one and a half hours to
watch every picture and object on display.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 foreign experts working in China also visited the
exhibition today.
</P>
<P>
Saw Lwin, an advisor for the Myanmese language programs of
China Radio International, got quite exited when he spotted a
photo with Zhou meeting the then Burmese president and prime
minister in 1953.
</P>
<P>
"A primary school pupil then, I went with classmates to welcome
Premier Zhou on the streets of Rangoon," said Saw Lwin.
</P>
<P>
"Although I can't read the Chinese illustration below the
photo, I do know that it was during this visit that Zhou Enlai put
forth the five principles of peaceful co-existence on behalf of
the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
"He was really a great statesman." said the Myanmese expert.
</P>
<P>
An Australian expert expressed the hope that captions in
English should be added to the photos so that the exhibition can
reach more foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Enlai, born on March 5, 1898, had served as the Chinese
premier from 1949 when the People's Republic of China was founded
until his death on January 8, 1976.
</P>
<P>
With the 100th anniversary of his birth approaching, activities
about the late premier that is revered by the whole world have
swept the nation since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The current exhibition at the Museum of Chinese Revolution
started on February 10, and has been visited by nearly 100,000
people. Upon requests, the museum has had to extend the
exhibition time one hour longer than originally planned.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will run through March 20.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The fierce Olympic rivalry
between Kwan and Lipinski came to an end Friday evening when Tara
Lipinski of the United States defeated her teammate Michelle Kwan to
win the women's single figure skating at the 18th Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Lipinski, current world champion, gave a flawless performance in
free skating Friday evening and won six first place from a panel of
nine judges.
</P>
<P>
Michelle, who was first after short program on Wednesday, was
second and China's Chen Lu, bronze medal winner in Lillehammer four
years ago, came in third.
</P>
<P>
Lipinski, standing in second place after the short program, was the
penultimate skater entering the ice at the free skating. The skater,
at the age of 15, showed a surprising maturity in skating and
displayed a more difficult combination than Kwan, who appeared in
front of the crowds first in the last group.
</P>
<P>
Lipinski, who was second to Kwan in Skate America this year, did
seven triple jumps led by triple loop triple loop combination in free
skating while Kwan cleanly landed a triple lutz double toe and a
triple toe.
</P>
<P>
After Lipinski landed the triple-triple combination, her face lit
up and mouth agape, knowing that the most difficult part in her
skating had been a success.
</P>
<P>
She was given three 5.8s and six 5.9s for technical merits, five
5.8s and four 5.9s for artistry.
</P>
<P>
After finishing her routine, Lipinski screamed and cried, obviously
in excitement.
</P>
<P>
Kwan gave the most beautiful performance Friday evening. The
American Chinese prodigy in light blue had the highest score for
presentation but had lower scores in technical merits. She had nine
5.9s for artistry, five 5.7s and four 5.8s for athleticism.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so happy. It was so great to stand on the podium," said
Lipinski. "it was so amazing."
</P>
<P>
"I skated well (in long program) and I think everyone had a great
time tonight.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I'm in shock and I can't realize everything. That's
gonna happen to me and how proud of myself I am," she added.
</P>
<P>
For China's Chen, it was a hard-fought bronze medal in her career.
In long program, she jumped triple lutz double toe and triple toe
which earned her seven 5.5s and two 5.6s for technical merits. Skating
to the music of the Butterfly Lovers, got eight 5.8s and one 5.7s for
presentation.
</P>
<P>
"The bronze medal means a lot to me because I tried so hard and
this Olympics is very important to me because it's my last
competition," said the 21-year-old Chinese, with eyes full of tears.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Game hero Pavel Bure scored
five goals to lead Russia a 7-4 semifinal victory over Finland on
Friday, setting up a final meeting at the Nagano Olympic men's ice
hockey with the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
"I guess this only happens once every four years at the Olympics,"
the 26-year-old Bure said. "That's amazing. It's really outstanding.
For having a tournament of stars no one put us in the top four. It's
the best tournament I've ever played at. we're at a different level
here."
</P>
<P>
Czech, who upset the United States in the quarterfinals, surprised
pre-tournament favorite Canada 2-1 in a penalty shoot out semifinal
earlier Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bure, who played in Vancouver, Canada, was hot from the start of
the first period, putting the Russian team on the board at 9:51 with a
power play.
</P>
<P>
Then at 17:28, the puck was deflected off Dmitri Mironov in the
neutral zone in Bure's direction for him to beat Finn Goalie Jarmo
Myllys for the second point of the game.
</P>
<P>
Just after the face-off the second period, the elder of the Pavel
brothers swiped the puck from Finns in the neutral zone to charge the
goal at 20:59 to end his hat trick.
</P>
<P>
The Finns staged a comeback with Raimo Helminen putting the blue
and white on the board at 23:28, and then at 24:59 Finland's Kimmo
Rintanen faked a shot and then hit it for the second point.
</P>
<P>
At 33:53, Russian Boris Mironov cross-checked Finland's Temmu
Selanne throwing him into the Finn goal. Mironov was put in the
penalty box giving the Finns a two-man advantage.
</P>
<P>
Selanne got his revenge during the power play, scoring at 34:07 fed
by Jari Kurri and Saku Koivu, tying the score 3-3.
</P>
<P>
Russians pulled ahead at the end of the period with Alexei Zhamnov
netting at 37:26.
</P>
<P>
Finland never gave up in the third period and tied score 4-4 at
45:11. But Russia's Andrei Kovalenko answered a minute later.
</P>
<P>
Bure slammed it in at 55:58 for his fourth goal, almost ensured
Russia's triumph.

manpower, but the Bure was at it again, netting his fifth goal with

<HEADLINE> Best Ever Field Expected for World Cup Swimming in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- An impressive field
including six current world record holders, 10 world champions and
20 world championships medalists is set to make this year's EPSON
Swimming World Cup Hong Kong the best ever meeting here since it
was established in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A total of 139 swimmers from 20 countries and regions will
attended the tournament which is to be held in the Kowloon Park
swimming pool over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Fielding two world record holders and a world champion, China
is believed to be the biggest obstacle for Australia in defending
their first place overall. The Chinese swimmers arrived here on
Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Teenager Chen Yan from China's Northeastern Liaoning Province,
world women's 400-meter medley record holder, is to take on
Germany's Sandra Volker and Australia's medal hopeful Julia
Greville in the short distance freestyle events.
</P>
<P>
Chen captured four gold, one silver medals and set two world
records in last year's Eighth National Games in Shanghai, before
taking two gold and one silver medals in the world championships
last month in Perth.
</P>
<P>
Women's backstroke will likely be an area of Chinese dominance
as another Chen Yan, a world champion and Olympic bronze medalist,
has entered herself into three events.
</P>
<P>
Germany is sending a squad of experienced internationals,
headed by all-round European champion Sandra Volker, breaststroke
specialist Mark Warnecke and distance swimmer Joerg Hoffmann.
</P>
<P>
Nichol Hetzer, 19, of the team, who won two silver medals in
Perth, is believed to be a strong contender to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
In the men's events, the much fancied Russian Alexander Popov
is expecting a stiff challenge from Australian Geoff Huegill and
William Kirby, members of the world record holding team of the
4x100m freestyle relay and 4x200m freestyle relay respectively.
</P>
<P>
Popov, currently holding three world records and one Olympic
record, has set Hong Kong's first recognized sporting world record
four years ago in the inaugural EPSON World Cup here.
</P>
<P>
Australia won nine gold, four silver and three bronze medals
last year in Hong Kong to top the medal table.
</P>
<P>
Hosts Hong Kong is sending the biggest squad of all
participating teams, comprising 11 male and 10 female swimmers.
</P>
<P>
Local swimmers had smashed 40 short course records in the past
four meetings here.

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM Survives Censure Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Surya
Bahadur Thapa on Friday afternoon survived a no-confidence motion
with a slim majority in the Lower House of the parliament, ending
a nearly one-and-half-month political crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The censure motion, tabled by the main opposition Communist
Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML), was defeated
with a vote of 103 to 100 in the 205-member lower house. The
speaker did not vote while MP Prem Singh Dhami from CPN-UML died
last year in a traffic accident and the seat remains vacant. But a
simple majority of 103 votes is still needed to pass or defeat a
motion in the house.
</P>
<P>
The three ruling partners -- the Nepali Congress (NC), the
National Democratic Party (RPP) and the Nepal Sadbhavana Party --
plus the Nepal Workers and Peasants' Party, have a total of 104
MPs. All of them except Speaker Ram Chandra Poudyal from the NC
voted against the motion.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML and a breakaway faction of the RPP led by former
Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand together have 97 seats in
the lower house. The Communist Party of Nepal (Masal) and an
independent supported the move against the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of political crisis in the Himalayan kingdom
emerged on January 8 when Thapa recommended that King Birendra
dissolve the parliament and hold mid-term elections to preempt a
move by 96 MPs from the CPN-UML and his own RPP to file a censure
motion against the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the 96 MPs asked the king to summon a special
session of the parliament to discuss their censure motion against
the government.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra could not make a decision after days of
consultations with advisors, legal experts and political parties.
He therefore referred the matter to the Supreme Court. The apex
court on February 4 advised the king to convene a special session
of the parliament and the advice was accepted.
</P>
<P>
On February 6, the CPN-UML and Chand registered a censure
motion against the government at the Parliament Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Thapa's coalition government is the fourth in Nepal since the
mid-term elections in late 1994. Thapa came to power last October.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Japan to Re-allocate Slots Fairly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission wrote
to Japan's Transport Ministry on Friday to apply for more fair
treatment of European air carriers when re-allocating unused or
under-used landing and take-off slots.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, applied for more non-discriminatory and transparent rules
at Japan's airports.
</P>
<P>
The commission took the move after Japan and the United States
held aviation talks that the commission feared would lead to a
further aggravation of the existing imbalance of landing and
take-off slots in favor of U.S. air carriers at Narita Airport.
</P>
<P>
U.S. airlines now have five times more slots at Narita than EU
airlines.
</P>
<P>
Under the rules set by the International Air Transport
Association (IATA), allocated slots that over a period of time are
not used should be re-allocated according to fair and transparent
criteria to favor new market entrants.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission has requested that a transparent, fair
and equitable system be instituted at all international airports
in Japan to allocate slots. Unused slots should be re-allocated in
a non-discriminatory manner among all airlines, irrespective of
their nationality.
</P>
<P>
Japan said it intended to apply the IATA rules but as part of a
recent U.S.-Japan aviation agreement the U.S. and Japan appear to
have agreed that landing and take-off slots currently under-used
by the U.S. airline Federal Express will be redistributed to
U.S. airlines only, through private deals.
</P>
<P>
The number of under-utilized slots in question is 28, according
to an EU spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials argued that the EU has transposed the IATA
rules on slot allocation into community law that guarantees EU
airports treat all airlines fairly, EU and non-EU alike.
</P>
<P>
Japanese air carriers, commission officials say, have benefited
from this approach. The EU also wants Japanese authorities to
respect their commitment to transparent and fair slot allocation.

an important way for China to intensify its reforms, open wider to
the outside world and reform its legal system.
</P>

with foreign lawyers, thus improving the work of Chinese lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Larry Jackson, a representative from the Blake Dawson Waldron
Law Firm of Australia, which has just obtained approval, said that
China is now a very attractive market for international lawyers to
provide legal services.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in the European
Union dropped again, though slightly, in the last three months of
last year, Eurostat reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate dropped another 0.1 percentage point to 10.5
percent at the end of December 1997, said the statistical arm of
the 15-nation union.
</P>
<P>
The rate was 0.3 percent lower than that at the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
During 1997, the unemployment rate fell in most of the EU
member states, down by at least 1 percentage point in the
Netherlands, Portugal, Finland, Sweden, Britain and Ireland,
Eurostat said.
</P>
<P>
The only EU member state where there was a noticeable increase
in unemployment in 1997 was Germany.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate rose from 9.2 percent to 10 percent in Germany
during the first nine months of last year and remained at the
10-percent level at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Eurostat unemployment rate is calculated in accordance with
the recommendations of the International Conference of Labor
Statisticians.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S'pore External Trade Expands by 3.2 Pct in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total trade
expanded by 3.2 percent in January this year on a three-month
moving average basis, with exports and imports growing by 5.5
percent and 1.1 percent respectively, the Singapore Trade
Development Board (TDB) said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports increased by 7.8 percent while non-oil
re-exports rose by 7.7 percent on the three-month moving average
basis, the TDB said.
</P>
<P>
But oil domestic exports declined by 16.3 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
On a monthly basis, the level of trade in January declined
compared to that a year ago. "It was partly statistical because
there were three less working days in January 1998 due to the
festive season," TDB said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, non-oil domestic exports dropped marginally by 0.5
percent. Non-oil re-exports declined by 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The TDB noted that non-oil domestic exports to the United
States and European Union remained strong, expanding by 12.5
percent and 16 percent respectively on the back of strong economic
growth in these two economies.
</P>
<P>
But non-oil domestic exports to Malaysia and Japan declined by
5.7 percent and 7.6 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Domestic exports of oil continued to be weak in January as it
declined by 16.3 percent due mainly to lower shipments of oil to
the Asian region. The poor performance was due mainly to keen
competition from the regional refineries, the TDB explained.
</P>
<P>
In January, non-oil imports grew by 2.4 percent. The TDB said
increases were registered in imports of integrated circuits,
computer parts and peripherals, semiconductors and parts, printed
circuits, parts of aircraft, and other products.
</P>
<P>
However, there were declines in imports of disk drives, parts
of color television sets, radios and video-cassette recorders,
capacitors, blank computer tapes and discs, jewelry and
cigarettes. Higher imports of ships and aircraft in January 1997
contributed to the lower growth for January this year, the TDB
said.

<HEADLINE> Forum to Mark 150th anniversary of Communist Manifesto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Communist Party
theoreticians and researchers held a forum here today to mark the
150th anniversary of the publication of the Manifesto of the
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
They said that it is a great work of intellectual history and
the first programmatic document of scientific socialism, which for
the first time made a comprehensive, systematic and mature
exposition of the Marxist theory.
</P>
<P>
It helped produce a number of Communists and proletarian
revolutionaries including Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, and
Marxism is a living theory and should grow with time.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communists, as represented by Mao Zedong, combined
Marxism and Leninism with China's reality and created Mao Zedong
Thought about Chinese revolution and construction.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping continued Mao's thought and made some
breakthroughs in interpreting Marxism and opened a new field by
providing answers to such fundamental questions as what is
socialism and how to build socialism.
</P>
<P>
Deng's theory meant that Marxism had entered a new development
stage, and Marxism, Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng
Xiaoping Theory are of the same origin and are closely intergrated
with one another.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party's nature, its basic principles and ultimate
goals set forth by the Manifesto are significant in guiding the
Chinese Communist Party in today' China and should be upheld to
advance China's opening-up and reform and modernization
drive.

<HEADLINE> Mainland Remains HK's Largest Re-export Trade Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- China's mainland remains the
largest partner for Hong Kong's re-export trade, according to the
latest figures released by the Hong Kong Census and Statistics
Department here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that the value of Hong Kong's total
re-exports amounted to about 1.245 trillion HK dollars (159.5
billion U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent or some 1.119 trillion HK dollars (143.5
billion U.S. dollars) of the total re-exports going through Hong
Kong in the year were related to the mainland if counting only
once the value of merchandises originating from and re-exported
back to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
As a source, the department said, re-exports originating from
the mainland accounted for 58 percent of the value of re-exports
of Hong Kong last year. As a destination, the mainland's share was
36 percent.
</P>
<P>
The department noted that much of the re-export trade involving
the mainland is related to outward processing, as raw materials
and semi-manufactured goods are exported to the mainland for
processing, with the final products subsequently returned to Hong
Kong and re-exported to overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Other main origins of Hong Kong's re-exports in 1997 included
Japan, Taiwan, the United States and the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The other main destinations included the United States, Japan,
Germany and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's re-exports last year accounted for 85 percent of
the value of its total exports and 41 percent of the total value
of its external trade and their corresponding shares were broadly
similar to the previous year's figures.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Introduces New Bill on Hazardous Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore introduced new
legislation on Friday to formalize an earlier set of procedures
for the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes in
accordance with an international convention.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore government said the country acceded to the Basel
Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous
Wastes and Their Disposal on January 2, 1996, and the convention
came into force in Singapore on April 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Prior to becoming a party of the Basel convention, Singapore
had already adopted a comprehensive set of procedures for the
control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes in
accordance with the convention, the Singapore government said.
</P>
<P>
However, it added, the procedures are administrative and there
was a need to introduce a new bill to formalize them.
</P>
<P>
"The Hazardous Waste (Control of Export, Import and Transit)
Act and its regulations are, therefore, promulgated to formalize
the existing control procedures," the government said.
</P>
<P>
It said the new legislation, gazetted on Friday, will come into
force on March 16, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under the new act and regulations, a permit is required to
export, import or transit hazardous wastes. Such a permit may be
granted subject to applicants obtaining prior informed consent
from the authorities of the countries of transit and import for
the waste. In addition, the hazardous waste would have to be
managed and treated in an environmentally sound manner in the
country of import.
</P>
<P>
Severe penalties will be imposed for illegal export, import and
transit of hazardous wastes under the new act and regulations. For
a body corporate, the maximum penalty fine is 300,000 Singapore
dollars (about 182,927 U.S. dollars), while for an individual, the
maximum fine is 100,000 Singapore dollars (about 60,976 U.S.
dollars) or an imprisonment term not exceeding two years, or both.

<P>
NANNING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Coastal and border areas,
major rivers, and railways in south China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region are expected to take the lead in improving
ethnic areas there.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi will focus on agriculture, industry, infrastructure,
and the service sector, its vice-chairman, Zhang Wenxue, said at
an opening-up conference today.
</P>
<P>
The region will try to make the best use of the new
Nanning-Kunming Railway line, which began operation last December
and connects mountainous areas with the coast, Zhang said. So,
it will increase infrastructure in communications and energy in
the two major ports of Beihai and Fangcheng.
</P>
<P>
It will also establish agricultural development zones,
processing industry zones, and tourist sites along the Xijiang
River, using investment from neighbouring Guangdong province, and
Hong Kong and Macao regions.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi plans to give preferential treatment to major cities
along the railway to develop the poor areas, according to Zhang,
and it will greatly improve border trade with neighbouring
Southeast Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region last year used 1.27 billion U.S.dollars
worth of foreign funds, up 24.6 percent from the previous year,
and foreign trade was worth 3 billion U.S.dollars, an increase of
9.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: War Against Iraq to Distablize Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Osama Al Baz, political adviser
of the Egyptian president, has said a possible war in Gulf
triggered by the U.N.-Iraq standoff will certainly have grave
consequences on the whole region.
</P>
<P>
In an interview carried by Egypt's Middle East News Agency
Friday, Baz said the Mideast peace process, which has been
deadlocked since last March, will further deteriorate if Iraq is
under attack.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to launch military action
against Iraq if it does not allow U.N. weapons inspections free
entry to some places closed to them now.
</P>
<P>
Such a strike will certainly poison the atmosphere and push the
peoples into losing confidence in the prospects of a peaceful
settlement or progress in the Mideast peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Arab world is strongly critical about
the double-standard policy of the US towards Iraq, apparently
referring to U.S. bias in favor of Israel on Mideast issues.
</P>
<P>
Baz underlined his expectations that riots will be unleashed in
various parts of the Arab world if Iraq is attacked.
</P>
<P>
Baz said Egypt is trying its best to help avert the outbreak of
a Gulf war and to search for common grounds for a diplomatic
solution.

<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- A Public Security Ministry
spokesman said today that there were 834 road accidents every day
in China in 1997, resulting in 203 deaths, 521 injuries, and
losses of 5.06 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Traffic administration offices across the country dealt with
over 300,000 road accidents, which caused 74,000 deaths, 190,000
casualties and direct economic losses of 1.85 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of road accident deaths among every 100 motor
vehicles dropped from 0.204 to 0.173.
</P>
<P>
The drop in the percentage of road accident deaths is
attributed to improved management of the country's road network
and motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
However, in terms of the total number of people killed each
year, China still stands high on the list countries.
</P>
<P>
Last year, drivers were responsible for a large proportion of
the road accidents, exceeding the speed limit, driving whiled
intoxicated, and fatigue driving were major causes, the number of
hit-and-run cases dropped.

<HEADLINE> China Increases Tax Rebates for Textile Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- China has increased its tax
rebate rate for textile exports to 11 percent from the previous
nine percent, starting on January 1 this year, according to the
State Taxation Administration.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry, China's leading exporter, sells
nearly half its products overseas. But, in 1996, textile exports
fell to 38 billion US dollars, and the textile industry lost its
top position among exporters.
</P>
<P>
The export situation improved somewhat in 1997, to more than 40
billion US dollars by the end of November. However, this came mainly
from the processing of imported materials, while other categories
of exports were in fact down.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China's textile industry now faces new
challenges from the Southeast Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Administration sources say the central government will provide
three billion yuan (365 million US dollars) to support the
increased tax rebates for exports.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Agriculture, infrastructure,
high-tech industries, housing, and central and western parts of
China will be this year's investment priorities in fixed assets,
according to Song Mi, director of the State Planning Commission's
Investment Department.
</P>
<P>
Song said that agriculture will top the list of priorities and
that certain fields will need some adjustments. In fact,
structural adjustments will be a major task, along with faster
construction of key projects and higher investment efficiency.
</P>
<P>
China predicts fixed assets investment to amount to 2.8
trillion yuan or so this year, a rise of 10 percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
Although goals and methods have changed greatly, China will
continue to give top priority to the harnessing of major rivers
and lakes, construction of grain, cotton and oil production
centers, and a group of forest protection shelters and ecological
forests to improve farming and water conservancy.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to place great emphasis on infrastructure,
Song said, with the power industry giving priority to construction
and upgrading of power grids, the coal industry increasing
construction of high-yield, high-efficiency coal mines and
improving coal dressing capacity, the petroleum and gas sector
focusing on exploring for domestic resources and increasing
reserves, and the transportation sector speeding up construction
of a comprehensive transportation network.
</P>
<P>
China will also give support to key technology and high-tech
industries and will continue to encourage investment
in the central and western parts of the country.

policy is opening to the outside world, non-alignment and giving
top priority to national interests.
</P>
<P>
He said this in an article in today's official newspaper

</P>
<P>
The president noted that Mongolia will keep good relations
first of all with China and Russia. Then, he continued, it will
also maintain good relations with the developed countries such as
the United States, Japan and Germany, and still others like India,
South Korea, Singapore, Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia has established diplomatic relations with 136
countries in the world today, he added.
</P>
<P>
On China, he said, Mongolia attaches great importance to their
bilateral relations which had witnessed great improvements since
1994 when the two signed agreements of friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Having solved completely their border problems, he said, the
two countries are now keeping a border of peace, friendship and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the two will maintain high-level contacts and
further tap potentials for cooperation.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Ramos Denies Masterminding Plan to Reduce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos Friday denied that the Presidential Palace was behind a
statement that suggested reducing the number of presidential
candidates in the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
Ramos branded as "unfounded and baseless" opposition
accusations that the Presidential Palace had a hand in the
statement of Bernardo Pardo, chairman of the Commission of
Elections.
</P>
<P>
Pardo said earlier that if it were all up to him, he would trim
down the number of presidential candidates to only five from the
83 who had submitted certificates of candidacy to his commission.
</P>
<P>
"I deny this," Ramos said, adding that officials of the
Commission of Elections had made it clear that they were holding
hearings on the bids of all presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a unilateral or a dictatorial process. There is
still an opportunity for everybody to go the Commission of
Elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Filipinos are to vote to elect a president, a vice
president and about one third of congressmen in the May 11
elections. President Ramos would step down as his six-year single
term ends in June.

<P>
HONG KONG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- New anti-smoking measures
provided in the Smoking Ordinance 1997 (Amendment) will be
enforced in batches, the Hong Kong government announced here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
These measures include the prohibition of the sale of tobacco
products through vending machines starting from April 1 and the
designation of all supermarkets, banks, department stores and

the restaurant within a department store or a shopping mall.
</P>

A spokesman for the Health and Welfare Bureau said: "Although
sale of tobacco products through vending machines is not common in
Hong Kong, we are taking preventive measures against it so that
people cannot gain easy access to tobacco products through such
kind of machines."
</P>
<P>
"From April 1, it is also illegal for anyone to place a tobacco
advertisement on the Internet," he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the spokesman said, the management of all
restaurants, schools, colleges, universities and the Hong Kong
Academy for Performing Arts can designate any area of the premises
concerned as no-smoking areas starting from April 1.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Down on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Share prices went down on
the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials
Index lost 7.68 points to close at 1545.79 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said stock prices ended lower. But reaction to
disappointing trade data for January and expected weak bank
earning was muted.
</P>
<P>
They said there was selective demand for blue chips and even
banks, in spite of 1997 profits falling by 30 percent.
Profit-taking on banks had waned with some still managing gains,
they added.
</P>
<P>
The market's response to a fall of 0.5 percent in non-oil
exports year-on-year in January was measured, the dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume shrank to 368.73 million units, valued
at 452.3 million Singapore dollars (about 275.79 million U.S.
dollars). Declines overtook advances by 225 to 130 while 256 other
counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Easyknit was the most actively traded counter as it registered
a turnover of 27.15 million units. It was followed by M Resources
which had 23.82 million shares traded. Pub. Bk Foreign was next
with 21.8 million units changed hands.
</P>
<P>
SPH (Singapore Press Holdings) and SPH Foreign shared the top
spot on the gainers' list as each of them rose by 40 cents to
finish at 20.4 and 24.2 Singapore dollars respectively. CMB Asia
increased by 26 cents to end at 1.7 Singapore dollars while OUB
(Overseas Union Bank) Foreign was up by 25 cents to close at 5.9
Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Asia Pacific was the biggest loser as it
declined by 1 dollar to end at 3.78 Singapore dollars. Asean Fund
and KL Kepong fell by 30 cents each to close at 8.2 and 3.62
Singapore dollars respectively. Local car distributor Cycle &AMP;
Carriage (C&AMP;C) lost 20 cents to finish at 6.35 Singapore dollars.

Moreover, he said, prescribed certificate and information must
be submitted to the board before any transplant involving the use
of imported organs can take place.

Information on human organ removals, transplants and disposals,
whether the organs are obtained locally or imported, must be
submitted to the board in appropriate statutory forms within 30
days after the relevant events have taken place, the spokesman

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Tackle Degradation in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing 20th United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) regional
conference for Africa Friday called on African countries to
design and implement policies to check the current high rate of
natural resource degradation.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is the backbone of African economic development.
The agricultural sector accounted for 40 percent of Gross
Domestic Product in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, Africa's agricultural sector has been lagging behind
the other continents over the past decades. According to the U.N.
agencies, Africa is the only continent where per capita food
production has been stagnating or declining in the past three
decades.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the world's 800 million hungry and
malnourished people are residing in Africa, especially in
sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, half of the 86 low income food
deficit countries are African countries, and up to half of
African population suffers from absolute poverty.
</P>
<P>
It is also estimated that Africa will be the only continent to
continue with such poverty rate for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Although the root causes for Africa's backward agriculture are
under-development and rapidly increasing population, natural
resource degradation is also an important factor.
</P>
<P>
Africa's annual population growth of almost 3 percent remains
the highest in the world. Food problem and population pressure
have led to an alarming rate of environmental degradation as a
result of soil erosion, widespread depletion of soil nutrients
and deforestation.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released from the conference, it is
estimated that about 802.4 million hectares or 60 percent of the
total area in Sahel is prone to human-induced degradation, of
which 224 million hectares are severely degraded.
</P>
<P>
About 2 million hectares of farmland in Ethiopian highlands
have been degraded irreversibly, of which 80 percent is due to
cropping activities.
</P>
<P>
The degradation or pollution of both groundwater and surface
water in sub-Saharan Africa is largely due to agricultural
activities. Fertilizers and other agricultural chemicals are also
pollutants to water resources.
</P>
<P>
Over exploitation of the forest resources for wood and fiber
is a major cause for deforestation and loss of biodiversity
throughout the sub-Saharan region. The deforestation rates are
297,000 hectares per year in west Sahelian Africa and 642,000
hectares per year in east Sahelian Africa. The forests of the
tropical southern Africa are subject to the highest deforestation
rate of 736,000 hectares per year.
</P>
<P>
Africa is a region of immense potentials for agricultural
development. However, the degradation of natural resources in
Africa will certainly damage the continent's capacity for
self-reliance in food production and poverty reduction as well as
to its entire economy.
</P>
<P>
The meeting urged policy-makers in Africa to adopt their
strategies and policies for sustainable use and management of
their limited natural resources, including measures which are not
only productivity-improving, but also environmentally
sustainable.

<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The world community will
provide 366,000 US dollars to earthquake victims in Zhangjiakou,
north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
This was announced today by an official in the Beijing Office
of the United Nations Development Program.
</P>
<P>
The funds will be used to buy padded tents, food and medicines
for the victims, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The project is being backed by Australia, France, Denmark,
the Netherlands, the United States, and the UN Office for
Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Li Bengong, an official in the Department of Disaster and
Social Relief of the Chinese Civil Affairs Ministry, said that the
relief work has made progress in its first phase, and the
quake-hit area has returned to normal.
</P>
<P>
The temperature in the area was very low, sometimes at 35
degrees below zero Centigrade, worsening the situation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed gratitude on behalf of the Chinese Government and
people to the international organizations for their assistance .
</P>
<P>
The funds will be used in accordance with the donors' wishes
and representatives will be invited to inspect the area.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP will strengthen cooperation with the Civil Affairs
Ministry to improve co-ordination and management in future relief
efforts.

<HEADLINE> China Providing Better Protection For Religious People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- China will follow its policy
of freedom of religion and will improve controls on religious
affairs according to law to protect normal religious practices and
the rights of religious people, according to Ye Xiaowen, director
of the State Council's Bureau of Religious Affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said that managing religious affairs in accordance with the
law doesn't mean government intervention in normal religious
activities, but rather aims at stopping a small number of law
breakers from making use of religions and religious activities to
commit crimes or cause social turmoil.
</P>
<P>
This is better implementation of the policy to protect citizens
freedom, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government adopted this policy in 1991, to help
religions adapt to a socialist society. In January, 1994, the
State Council promulgated two regulations on managing religious
sites and foreigners' religious activities in China.
</P>
<P>
By the end of September, 1997, there were 78,134 places for
religious activities in all parts of China outside Tibet
registered at the Bureau of Religious Affairs, said Ye, and this
has effectively protected the legal rights and interests of
religious people.

PARIS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan Friday began his
mission to Baghdad in his last attempt to prevent a military
solution to the Iraqi crisis. Although speaking in an optimistic
tone before the press when he made a stopover in Paris Thursday,
Annan is not clinging to illusions. In private, diplomatic
sources in Washington and Paris believe the chances for the
success of his mission are small.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- In an interview with Le Figaro, Russian Vice Prime Minister
Boris Nemtsov said that to bomb Iraq does not make any sense. "If
the objective of a military strike against Iraq is to destroy
chemical and bacteriological weapons, bombing would only create
greater risk of contamination for the whole region. If we don't
want to touch these weapons, why should we risk bombing them?" he
said.

TIRANA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Albania hopes that

<P>
In an announcement issued Thursday, the Albanian government
voiced its support of all diplomatic efforts to solve the crisis
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The announcement also called on the Iraqi government to comply
with U.N. resolutions and carry out all its international
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
If Baghdad lacks the political willingness to solve the crisis
through diplomatic means, other measures will have to be taken,

<HEADLINE> Iceland's Ambassador Says It Expects To Increase China Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Hjalmar W. Hannesson,
Iceland's first ambassador to China, told the local press today
that he has seen the diplomatic activities between high-ranking
officials of the two countries and trade and cultural exchanges
and thinks cooperation can be further expanded.
</P>
<P>
The distance is not the barrier to expanded ties, he said,
because bilateral trade over the past four years was worth more
than 100 million U.S. dollars, with Iceland's imports increasing
steadily and exports to China showing marked growth.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that other fields could be explored in the
years ahead like computer software, new fishery techniques, the
use of geo-thermal resources, and recycled paper products.
</P>
<P>
As one of the few pollution-free areas, he said, Iceland can
export deep-sea products to China as "green products."
</P>
<P>
Cultural exchanges are also growing. Icelandic artists staged a
modern opera in Beijing and the country plans to hold an
exhibition featuring Iceland's paintings in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
When he returns home, Hannesson said he will take the post of
director of the International Department of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, and China will have "one more friend in Iceland."

<HEADLINE> Seven More Australians Test Positive for Steroids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Seven Australian athletes
tested positive for steroids in the last three months of 1997, the
Australian Sports Drugs Agency (ASDA) said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Weightlifters and bobsleighers each accounted for three
positive tests while the seventh was a rugby league player.
</P>
<P>
ASDA chairman Peter Baume said the total was six more than
those for the corresponding period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The high number of steroid positives, particularly in the
Olympic sports, is the worst result in this category of substances
for some time," Baume said.
</P>
<P>
ASDA conducted 997 tests between October 1 and December 31,
compared to 686 tests during the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the seven positives for anabolic steroids, there
were also four for pseudoephedrine and one for cannabis.

<HEADLINE> Garmaba Living Buddha Worships Figure of Sakyamuni in Lhasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Early this morning, lamas at the
Johkang Monastery in Lhasa lined up to greet a living Buddha who
came to worship before the statue of Sakyamuni, the founder of
Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
The 17th Garmaba Living Buddha O'kying Chilai, 14, was
confirmed in 1992, and makes a pilgrimage to the monastery every
year to worship Sakyamuni before the Tibetan New Year.
</P>
<P>
The monastery, in the center of Lhasa, is the most sacred place
of Tibetan Buddhism because of its Sakyamuni, which was brought in
by Wencheng, a princess of the Tang Dynasty (618-917). It also has
statues of the founders of different sects of Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
The young living buddha, clad in yellow silk shirt and purple
monk's robe, seemed rather mature and bowed to the figure of
Sakyamuni and presented a hada, a piece of white silk used by
the Tibetans to show respect.
</P>
<P>
Sitting cross-legged in the major hall of the monastery, he
recited Buddhist scriptures and prays. He also added butter to the
golden lamps in front of the figure and made a donation to the
Johkang.
</P>
<P>
While living and studying at a monastery 70 km from Lhasa, he
was the first reincarnated living Buddha in Tibet confirmed by the
Chinese central government since the democratic reform in 1959.

BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The annual Spring Employment
Market, which opened today at the Beijing International Exhibition
Center, made nearby streets the most congested in the Chinese
capital.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people showed up and sponsors expect at least
10,000 people to come looking for jobs during the three-day
event. More than 1,200 employers, government departments,
state-owned companies, and private and overseas-funded businesses
have set up booths.
</P>
<P>
The market, which is Beijing's largest, began three years ago,
according to Wu Yong, the vice-director of the Beijing Personnel
Service Center. He said that people with marketing, management,
information science, computer, finance, and tax expertise are
the most sought after.
</P>
<P>
About 60,000 Beijing college students are due to graduate this
summer, and one fourth or more are expected to be looking for jobs
in Beijing. Many came to the market. There are also many people
who are dissatisfied with their jobs, and the employment market is
the best place for them to find a better job, says Wu.
</P>
<P>
Employment markets are thriving in China as economic reforms

<HEADLINE> Macao Telecom Announces Controversial Price Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- A price change announcement by
the Macao Telecommunications Company (CTM) on Thursday has given
rise to much controversy.
</P>
<P>
The CTM announced on Thursday that there will be an increase of
fees for local telephone users and cuts in long-distance calls and
mobile phones under a new telecom charge program, on which it had
reached agreement with the Macao government and which is expected
to become effective on March 1.
</P>
<P>
While the price of international direct dialing service has
been cut by an average of 17 percent and users of mobile phones
are offered more varieties of charging packages, the charge for
using local phones will rise by some 11 percent, compared with the
inflation rate of 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new announcement has caused much controversy in Macao. Many
local residents complained that the cost of long-distance calls
is still too high while others said the increase of fees for
using local phones is "disappointing."
</P>
<P>
The Macao Daily News said in a commentary on Friday that the
negotiation between the government and the CTM on the price
adjustment is a "failure" and "disappointing to local residents."
</P>
<P>
Macao has witnessed an economic slowdown since 1993, with the
economic growth rate for 1997 estimated at less than 1
percent. Many local companies and residents have repeatedly called
for reductions in the prices of telecom service.

HONG KONG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- "Hong Kong's economy is
sound, for all the present upheavals, and political developments
are heading in the right direction" following the city's return to
 China, a senior European Union (EU) official said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the immense challenges thrown at Hong Kong since the
Special Administrative Region (SAR) came into existence, the EU is
highly impressed by the way it has handled its affairs so far,"
said Vice-President of the European Commission (EC) Leon Brittan,
who arrived here Thursday after a visit to China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon hosted by the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council, Brittan said Hong Kong has shown its "customary grit and
determination" to survive all the challenges and "has done so with
its reputation as an independent, free-market economy as strong as
it was before the handover."
</P>
<P>
He attributed the accomplishments to "not just its (Hong
Kong's) own faithful compliance with the Joint Declaration and the
Basic Law, but also to the careful, hands-off approach of
Beijing."
</P>
<P>
Brittan applauded Hong Kong's performance in face of the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"In Hong Kong, the economic fundamentals are perceived to be
broadly sound. Its dogged insistence on maintaining the currency
board has earned it respect and China's repeated promise at its
highest levels not to devalue its currency has helped keep Hong
Kong's currency secure," Brittan noted.
</P>
<P>
What is more, the crisis has "highlighted Hong Kong's well
regulated and transparent financial system and the openness of
that system to the outside world," the EU official commented.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong would have suffered much more had it not built its
own banking and securities sector on solid foundations," he said.

"I'm convinced that the confidence of outside investors will
not be gone for long," he observed.
</P>
<P>
Comparing Hong Kong with its Asian neighbors where there is a
major loss of investor confidence, Brittan said Hong Kong should
spread the message across Asia, including the Chinese mainland,
that "the right mix of regulation and liberalization in financial
services will make for a healthy and robust financial market."
</P>
<P>
Turning to the SAR's democratic development, Brittan said the
EU regards as a positive sign "demonstrations or media criticism
of public figures in Hong Kong." "To us, these are the outward
signs that fundamental freedoms are alive and well."
</P>
<P>
Brittan said the EU is watching the development of the
electoral process here with close interest and is impressed by the
SAR's decision to hold the first Legislative Council elections in
May. He called the polls to replace the Provisional Legislative
Council "a sign that the SAR is keeping to its word."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the "one country, two systems" concept is
"proving to be good for China, good for Asia and good for the
world" and that Hong Kong's successful handover bodes well for
Macao, which is to return to China in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is currently the third largest trading
partner of Hong Kong, which serves as Europe's key business hub in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
According to Brittan, the two sides are negotiating a customs
agreement which will help strengthen the "fight against copyright
piracy, counterfeiting, drug trafficking and other shared
concerns" while further exploring other areas of economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Brittan, who will end his first visit to Hong Kong after the
handover on Saturday, is expected to meet Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa and principal officials of the SAR and representatives of
 the European business community in Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai municipal
government passed a rule today to stop undercutting of milk prices.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai had a fierce milk price war on its hands during the
past month, with some milk producers trying to get a larger share
of the market by pricing one-liter containers below cost or even
by buying up other producers milk.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that, although producers have the right to set the
price themselves, price undercutting will harm the market and
other companies and consumers in the long run.
</P>
<P>
The new rule, which is expected to take effect February 25, set
the price cut ceiling at 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The local government said the rule will help maintain market
order and ensure fair, legal and open competition among producers.

<HEADLINE> Abacha Could Win Presidential Election: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State General
Sani Abacha will win the forthcoming presidential election if he
agrees to contest, Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi has said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a western media Thursday, Ikimi also
tacitly endorsed calls by the country's political parties,
traditional rulers and other interests groups on the head of
state to succeed himself as president.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Abacha has demonstrated his ability
to hold the country together, improve the economy and pull
together the military and civilians.
</P>
<P>
"His plans have worked and so i believe that if indeed he will
accept this overwhelming call to contest the presidency, we
shall then say he will win," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi, a politician and former chairman of the defunct
National Republican Convention during the period of the country's
third civilian government five years ago, said he was speaking
for himself.
</P>
<P>
He, however, believed that other Nigerians aspiring to contest
the presidential election should be given the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
There are only two politicians in Nigeria who have expressed
their willingness to contest.
</P>
<P>
Last week, four of the five political parties of the country
adopted Abacha as their consensus presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Traditional rulers in the country also joined in the call and
pledged their support for Abacha to succeed himself, while
Abacha, in response, requested for prayers to help him take the
right decision on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Calls from interests group which initially started in whispers
have become intensive. They also imported television sets and
rice and sold the "Abacha TV" and "Abacha Rice" at low prices in
an effort to solicit support from the public.
</P>
<P>
It seems that Abacha still keeps his position of "let the
constituency to decide", which he made known earlier last year in
an interview with the United States-based Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
Under the Abacha administration's transition to civil rule
program, presidential election is to be held in August this year,
when governorship election will begin simultaneously.

<P>
KAMPALA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- India is to fund a
feasibility study to develop an industrial complex in eastern
Uganda, "The Monitor" paper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Patirck Nyayika, the head of regional centers and investors
land at the Uganda Investment Authority (UIA), said, "we are
looking for between 200,000 and 250,000 U.S. Dollars."
</P>
<P>
But the modalities for the development of Mases complex north
of Jinja have not yet been worked out, and UIA did not get the
lease of the 133.3-acre land in the complex, he added.
</P>
<P>
In view of confusion in the wake of development of some areas
in the country in the past, the feasibility study and assessment
of environment impact is vital for the development, Nyayika
noted.
</P>
<P>
With funding from the Indian government, Bilal Engineering
Company would build infrastructure such as shelter, roads,
electricity and water in the area.
</P>
<P>
Jinja is the most important commercial center in the east of

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Botswana has eased
foreign exchange controls to pave the way to attract more
internal and external investment.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued Thursday by the Bank of
Botswana, with immediate effect, non-residents will be able to
trade in and issue bonds denominated in the Botswana currency
Pula and hold large stakes in Botswana companies.
</P>
<P>
They will be able to borrow more Pula, get longer foreign
exchange forward contracts on foreign exchange and were assured
that if they disinvested they could take their money with them.
</P>
<P>
Besides, individuals and companies would be able to invest
significantly more overseas, borrow offshore and travelers take
more money out of the country. It would be easier to open a
foreign currency account in Botswana.
</P>
<P>
This is an effort to encourage inward portfolio investments
and the development of capital markets, the bank said.

<HEADLINE> UAE Calls for Iraq's Maximum Cooperation With Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- United Arab Emirates Friday
called the Iraqi leadership to offer the "maximum cooperation
possible" to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan in his efforts to
defuse the Iraqi-UN crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan
urged that "the leadership of Iraq must do everything possible in
order to remove any reason for war and the destruction that would
inevitably result."
</P>
<P>
"This would save Iraq and the (Gulf) region as a whole from the
anticipated negative effects that would follow if there were to be
a resort to military action (against Iraq)," he said.
</P>
<P>
A peaceful solution to the current crisis "cannot be achieved
without a full compliance by Iraq with all relevant resolutions of
the United Nations, within the framework of respect of the
sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of Iraq," he added.
</P>
<P>
The UAE president's statement was published by the official
Wam news agency coincided with Annan's projected 13-hours visit
to Baghdad from Friday morning in his last ditch to avert the
possible U.S.-Iraq military confrontation in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain warned Annan's efforts in Baghdad was the
"last chance" for the peaceful end to the crisis, which was caused
by Iraq's ban on UN arms inspectors from entering suspected sites
containing weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Washington said all the U.S. troops and warplanes in the Gulf
have been in their places in preparation for the possible use of
force to pound Iraqi targets if diplomacy for a peaceful solution
fails.
</P>
<P>
Zayed, whose country openly opposes military action against
Iraq, called upon the U.S., as well as all concerned parties to
"allow maximum time possible for diplomatic efforts," especially
for Annan's current mission which is the "most important."
</P>
<P>
"This would remove any reason for military action," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his warnings against the use of power against
Baghdad, saying "a resort to military action is not in the
interests of any party to the crisis."
</P>
<P>
"A hasty rush to military action will have unforeseeable
results...and would have repercussions on the stability and
security of the Arabian Gulf in particular and the Middle East
region in general," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It would also have an adverse effect upon current and
future relations between East and West, and would destroy the
many positive achievements of trust and cooperation that have
been built up over the past years," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, in Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton warned on
Thursday that if Annan's trip to Baghdad fails, the U.S.
"must be and are prepared to act" against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Japan to Grant Export Credit to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States, Japan and
Australia will grant export credits to Indonesia in March to help
the country fill its basic demands for commodities and industrial
raw materials, an official said.
</P>
<P>
The export credit grant will help Indonesia, especially the
country's importers of raw materials, Djoko Moeljono, Director
General for International Trade of Ministry for Industry and Trade
said here Thursday, official Antara news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We are worried we will not achieve our export target of 50
billion U.S. dollars this year if we cannot import the raw
materials needed to produce Indonesia's export-oriented industrial
goods," he said.
</P>
<P>
Djoko disclosed the U.S. will give credit worth 460 million
dollars for the Indonesian import of cotton, corn, cornmeal,
leather, soybean, rice and meat from the country.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will also use the Australian credit to import cotton,
meat, livestock, dairy products, sugar, aluminum and automotive
components from Australia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, Japan, through its Exim Bank, will provide
credits and guarantees Indonesia's Letters of Credit (LCs) to
enable Indonesian businessmen import raw materials from the
country.
</P>
<P>
Beside the three industrial countries, Canada and Singapore
reportedly offered similar facilities to Indonesia also, while
offers from Germany is still being discussed.
</P>
<P>
However, Djoko said that Indonesia itself will arrange the
import activities without depending on credit facilities provided
by the industrial countries in order to fulfill the demand of
basic commodities and industrial raw materials.
</P>
<P>
According to the Indonesia Importers Association (Ginsi),
Indonesia's import value of raw materials and capital goods
drastically declined since December last year.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Indonesia's import value averaged at 2.5 billion
dollars per month, while at present the value does not even reach
100 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Ginsi's Chairman Amiruddin Saud said there might be a number of
industries that will go out of business if by next month (March)
Indonesia could not bring in raw materials from foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that Indonesian importers are having difficulties in
carrying out their business since the national currency, rupiah's
plunge against the u.s. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has lost more than 70 percent of its value against
the u.s. dollar since July last year.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Cigarette Consumption Shrinks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- High taxes and
advertisement control has dragged cigarette consumption in South
Africa down 20 percent in the past four years, local daily
Business Day reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Excise revenue collected from tobacco last year was about 1.7
billion Rand (340 million U.S. Dollars) compared with the 1.2
billion Rand (240 million Dollars) in 1995, an increase in real
terms of almost five percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Rowena van der Merwe, economist of University of Cape Town,
said between 1970 and 1988 the real price index of cigarettes
declined from 100 to 63, while excise duties fell from 46 percent
of total price in the 1970s to 20 percent in early 1990.
</P>
<P>
This meant a higher profit margin for cigarette companies and
represented a failure on governemnt's part to optimize revenue
from cigarettes, thereby effectively encouraging consumption.
</P>
<P>
Van der Merwe estimated that the government lost about 1.9
billion Rand (380 million Dollars) in revenue in 1995 alone as a
result of excise duties not keeping pace with inflation.
</P>
<P>
"In a developing country like South Africa, taxation is a more
potent mechanism to reduce consumption than in developed
countries because consumers of cigarettes tend to be more price
sensitive in developing countries," Van der Merwe said.
</P>
<P>
"High excise duties are therefore strongly synonymous with a
reduced consumption," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to high taxes, the economist said, more stringent
advertizing controls have also brought negative impact to
cigarette consumption in the country.
</P>
<P>
Research showed that a one percent rise in the growth of
advertizing expenditure translated into a growth in cigarettes
demand of between 0.18 percent and 0.24 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the cigarette industry spent 256 million Rand (51.2
million Dollars) on tobacco advertizing.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, about 34 percent of South African population, or
about 7.6 million people smoked, spending about 1.6 billion Rand
(320 million Dollars) on the habit. In 1996, 27.5 billion
cigarettes were consumed in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to Van der Merwe, about two billion cigarettes were
smuggled into South Africa annually, representing between five
percent and seven percent of the total market and a loss of 100
million Rand (20 million Dollars) in government revenue in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Achieves 97 Percent Salt Iodization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has achieved 97 percent
salt iodization, resulting in a drastic reduction in estimated 20
million sufferers of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) in
Nigeria, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has said.
</P>
<P>
Nimal Hettiaratchy, head of the UNICEF nutrition section said
this while presenting a certificate of commendation to Nigeria's
Dicon Salt Company in Lagos Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian company has emerged the winner of the 1997 UNICEF
prize for sustainable and purposeful leadership in the control of
IDD.
</P>
<P>
Iodization is the addition to iodine to edible salt to
forestall mental retardation, goitre, growth retardation,
physical sluggishness, childhood mortality, reproductive failure
and nervous system defect.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF plans to eliminate IDD worldwide by the year 2000,
mainly through salt iodization.
</P>
<P>
Hettiaratchy said a survey would soon be conducted to update
the 1993 prevalence of IDD sufferers in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He also asked Nigeria to assist its neighboring countries in
the control of the disease.

<HEADLINE> Panda Dies of Senility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Qiang Qiang, a female panda,
died at the age of 30 in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's
Sichuan Province last month after living 22 years in northeast
China.
</P>
<P>
Experts say Qiang Qiang died of senility, for the life span of
panda averages at only 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Qiang Qiang, who had lived in the zoo in Shenyang, capital of
northeast China's Liaoning Province since 1975, began to show
signs of senility ten years ago, said zoo keepers. "She ate very
little, and became languid, and one of her eyes suffered from
cataract."
</P>
<P>
Experts made special recipes for Qiang Qiang, such as rice
gruel, carrots, milk, eggs and apples. Nutrients including various
vitamins and royal jelly were also added into the gruel, which has
helped prolong the life of Qiang Qiang, said experts.
</P>
<P>
However, since the end of last year, Qiang Qiang's symptoms
worsened and sometimes she ate nothing at all for several
consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
The zoo transported by air fresh bamboo leaves from Sichuan
Province, the hometown of pandas. Experts from a panda breeding
center in Chengdu were also invited to the city to give treatment
to Qiang Qiang.
</P>
<P>
On January 8, experts decided to take Qiang Qiang to the
breeding center in Chengdu, in the hope to provide her with better
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Qiang Qiang died at last on January 28. Qiang Qiang had never
given birth in her life.
</P>
<P>
Qiang Qiang's body has been taken back to Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
The population of pandas, the world's best-known endangered
species which can only be found in the mountains of southwest
China, stands at less than 1,000.

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Development Paid Off in Pastoral Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The annual per capita share of
grain in Inner Mongolia, a pastoral area in north China, doubled
to reach 610 kg by the end of 1997, a local agricultural official
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
This has put an end to a long-term grain shortage in the region
dominated by the animal husbandry industry.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed this to large scale comprehensive
development of agriculture in the past nine years.
</P>
<P>
The local government has allocated 2.2 billion yuan in the
third phase agricultural comprehensive development project under
which, farmers have improved 518,600 ha of low-yielding fields,
opened 92,000 ha of wasteland and afforested 73,300 ha of land.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, farmland covered by the third phase development
scheme produced 3.9 billion kg of grain last year, more than
double of the pre-development figure. The output of rape seed,
sugar beet and meat increased by 60-70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other factors contributing to agricultural progress included
water conservancy projects, infrastructure construction,
application of modern science and combination of agriculture,
industry and trade.

<HEADLINE> Protectionism, "Great Risk" of Asian Crisis: New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting New Zealand Prime
Minister Jenny Shipley said Friday one of the great risks of the
Asian economic crisis was that some economies might become
protectionists.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly from New Zealand's point of view - when we have for
12 years tried to concentrate on opening up to the world and
looking outward - it would be disappointing if that was one of the
results of this current economic environment," she was quoted by
Australian Associated Press as telling the Trans Tasman Business
Circle in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
In a wide-ranging speech, which departed from the pre-published
media text, Shipley said a protectionist approach would contradict
the expansionist approach of the recent past.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister did not go into detail.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand coalition leader also praised the close ANZAC
military ties and the economic cooperation between Australia and
New Zealand, but said New Zealand reserved the right to make its
own military decisions.
</P>
<P>
ANZAC is initials of Australian and New Zealand Army Corps
formed during World War I.
</P>
<P>
But she said it was New Zealand's earnest hope that a
non-military resolution would be achieved in resolving the Iraq
weapons inspection crisis.
</P>
<P>
Australia and New Zealand, which have dispatched troops at the
request of the United States, are considering uniting their
dispatched forces in possible operations, Australian media
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Shipley, who is in Australia on a two-day visit, discussed the
move during her talks Friday with Australian Prime Minister John
Howard.

GUANGZHOU, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The output value of
industrial enterprises in south China's Guangdong Province
reached 1.2 trillion yuan last year, an 18-percent increase over
1996.
</P>
<P>
The province led the country last year in output value of
industrial enterprises at or above township level. Such
enterprises in the province produced 840-billion-yuan worth of
products last year.
</P>
<P>
Local industrial enterprises turned out more than 52 billion
yuan in pre-tax profits last year, up 19 percent from the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Provincial officials attributed the industrial growth to reform
measures.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 115 industrial enterprises in the province declared
bankruptcy or were merged. And in the past two years, 55 big
industrial enterprises have been transformed in accordance with
corporate laws to help them expand at low cost and improve their
product mix.
</P>
<P>
Industrial businesses are also placing much importance on the
market share at home and abroad. The province exported more than
280 billion yuan worth of industrial products in 1997, accounting
for nearly 35 percent of local industrial sales.

<HEADLINE> Deng Xiaoping's Strategic Decision On Sino-Soviet Relations (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily carried an
article today by Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on
Deng Xiaoping's strategic decision to institute the normalization
of Sino-Soviet relations.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative to take a big move" to seek a great
improvement of the Sino-Soviet relations, Deng said at a meeting
at his home in the Summer of 1982, recalled Qian, who, then the
vice-foreign minister responsible for Soviet Union affairs, was
also present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Deng's call for the big move was based on the changing
international situation at that time in which the Soviet Union was
compelled to readjust its foreign policy when its ability fell
short of its wishes in scrambling for world power with the United
States after the Soviet Union collapsed from the top as an
expansionist nation, following its military intrusion into
Afghanistan in December of 1979.
</P>
<P>
It was under this situation that Soviet leaders announced in
March of 1982 the wish to improve its relations with China while
stressing China's sovereignty over Taiwan, Qian recalled.
</P>
<P>
However, taking the big move to improve Sino-Soviet relations
should be based on a principled prerequisite, Deng noted. That is,
he indicated, the Soviet Union should do something, namely,
voluntarily resolving the issue of "three major obstacles" in the
way of the bilateral relations so as to remove its threat to
China's security.
</P>
<P>
The "three major obstacles" were the Soviet's mustering of a
large armed forces along the Sino-Soviet and Sino-Mongolian
borders, the military intrusion of Afghanistan and Soviet support
of Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia, and conducting military
provocations against China's border.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pledges More Patriot Missiles to Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
promissed to provide Israel additional Patriot missiles and
launchers if U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan fails at his
mediation in Baghdad, a senior Israeli military officer told
Xinhua Friday.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, U.S.-Israel ties have been strengthened and
information concerning the Iraqi crisis is being exchanged at the
highest level, according to the officer who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The United States has promised to help upgrade Israel's missile
defense system. A great deal of military supplies from the
U.S. and Germany has arrived in Israel, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to attack Iraq if it doest not
allow U.N. weapons inspectors free entry into places now closed to
them.
</P>
<P>
Although the chances of Iraqi attack against Israel in response
to a U.S. strike are still considered low, the Israel Defense
Ministry is continuing to take precautions.
</P>
<P>
The Home Front Command of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) set
up a situation room Thursday and additional stations are being
opened since Friday to distribute gas masks, putting the number of
gas masks distribution centers to 61 in the whole country.
</P>
<P>
Sirens were being tested around the country on Thursday,
including some that have recently being installed in large cities.
</P>
<P>
Israel has requested Turkey to let Israel fly its planes over
Turkey to strike back if Iraq fires missiles at Israel in
retaliation for a U.S. attack.
</P>
<P>
Annan visits Baghdad Friday and is due back to New York on
Tuesday.

<P>
At the meeting, Deng Xiaoping also made specific suggestions as
to how to start the "big move." The director of the Soviet and
European Affairs Department of the Foreign Ministry was sent to
Moscow in the name of inspecting the work of the Chinese embassy
there.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with a Soviet vice-foreign minister on August 10,
1982, the director simply recited the message drafted by Deng
himself. The message read to the effect that the Chinese people
did not want to see abnormal relations between the two countries
last for long and that both sides should make concerted efforts to
bring Sino-Soviet relations back on a normal track to establish a
good-neighbor relationship. The message also called for taking
specific actions to remove the major obstacles at the start, which
the Chinese side believed helped promote the growth of bilateral
relations in all other areas.
</P>
<P>
Ten days later, the Soviet Union gave a formal reply to the
message, agreeing to discuss bilateral relations with the Chinese
side "at any time, at any venue and at any level."
</P>
<P>
The first round of political consultations between vice-foreign
ministers of the two countries began in October in Beijing. The
consultations signified the end of the period of having only
confrontation without dialogue between the two countries and
signaled that Sino-Soviet bilateral relations would shift to
detente from long-time confrontation.

<HEADLINE> Czech Republic Enters Men's Ice Hockey Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 20 (Xinhua) -- One penalty shot from Robert
Reichel sent the Czech Republic into the final of the men's ice hockey
tournament in a semi-final match against Canada here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
After playing to a 1-1 draw in overtime, the semi-final match came
down to the famed goalies -- Czech Dominik Hasek and Canadian Patrick
Roy -- to see who would stop the one-on-one shoot out by five men from
each team.
</P>
<P>
From the start, Czech players were faster on ice with aggressive
forechecking, and outplayed their opponents, keeping the puck moving
to avoid Canadian forechecks.
</P>
<P>
The Czech held the Canadians to three shots on goal to their five
in the first 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
In the second period, the Czech team outshot their opponent 14-11,
but neither team could find a chance to attack.
</P>
<P>
After the interval, the Czech sped up offence and the first mark
was put up when Czech forward Pavel Patera won a faceoff and knocked
the puck to Jiri Slegr who was waiting on the blue line.
</P>
<P>
On Slegr's straight slapshot, the puck bounded off Canada's goalie
Roy's shin protector, bounced over his shoulder and into the net at
49:46.
</P>
<P>
But Canadians rallied back. After three consecutive missed goal
attempts, Eric Lindros passed the puck to Trevor Linden who found the
hole past goalie Hasek at 58:57 and made the score draw at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
In the overtime period, Czech and Canadians both failed to score.
</P>
<P>
In the shootout, Hasek saved five shots but Roy missed one, and
missed chance for the final.
</P>
<P>
The other semi-final match picks Russia against Finland Friday
evening.

<TEXT>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping dispatched former State Councillor and Foreign
Minister Huang Hua, as a special envoy of the Chinese government,
to Moscow to attend the funeral of Leonid Brezhnev, former leader
of the Soviet Union, who died on November 10, 1982.
</P>
<P>
This was seen as an uncommon action because of the separation
of high-level contacts between the two countries over the years.
</P>
<P>
Huang, in a meeting with new Soviet leader Yuri Andropov on
November 15, conveyed the congratulations of the Chinese leaders to
Andropov on his election as general secretary of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Huang also expressed the hope that joint efforts would enable
the two countries to restore normal relations gradually.
</P>
<P>
The following day, Huang also met with former USSR foreign
minister Andrei Gromyko, stressing in accordance with Deng's
suggestions that the Soviet Union should take concrete measures
and remove hurdles to arrive at a real improvement of bilateral
relations and that the Soviet Union should do a couple of things,
for example, prompting Vietnam to withdraw its troops from
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The process of the normalization of bilateral relations was set
in motion because of Deng's resolute and accurate decision.
</P>
<P>
Deng asked a visiting Romanian leader on October 9, 1985 to
convey a verbal message to Mikhail Gorbachev who assumed the
supreme leadership in the year that he was prepared to meet with
Gorbachev if the two countries reached a common understanding on
Vietnam's withdrawal of troops from Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said in late July of 1986 that the USSR was ready to
seriously discuss with China additional measures concerning the
establishment of good-neighbor status at any level at any time and
to align the border in accordance with the main channel of the
Heilongjiang River.

<P>
He also declared that the Soviet Union would withdraw its
troops from Afghanistan in separate phases and was consulting with
Mongolia on withdrawal of most of Soviet troops from Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Deng told a U.S. TV station reporter on September 2 of 1986
that Vietnam's withdrawal of its troops from Cambodia was the key
issue for the improvement of bilateral ties, and that he would
like to meet with Gorbachev in any place in the Soviet Union if
the problem could be resolved.
</P>
<P>
The two countries made major progress in their political
consultations thanks to Deng's efforts.
</P>
<P>
The USSR changed its attitude toward the Cambodia issue step by
step and reached an agreement with China in this regard, thus
paving the way for the normalization of relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Deng decided that it was time for an exchange of visits between
foreign ministers of the two countries, marking a "semi
normalization" of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen paid a visit to the USSR
in December of 1988, the first visit in 30 years by a Chinese
foreign minister since 1957.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the two sides engaged in an in-depth exchange
of views on the Cambodia issue and a summit meeting between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Former USSR Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze paid a return
visit to China in February of 1989 to further prepare for a
Sino-USSR summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the two sides discussed a statement
concerning the settlement of the Cambodia issue and the date of a
summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side agreed to Gorbachev's visit to China in May of
1989 proposed by the USSR, but then the USSR changed its attitude
toward the Cambodia issue.
</P>
<P>
Deng, in a meeting with Shevardnadze, pointed to the importance
of early settlement of the Cambodia issue. As a result, the two
sides finally reached an agreement on the wording of the statement
on the Cambodia issue.

<P>
The high-level meeting between leaders of the two countries was
a great event in the world and the protocol arrangement was also
an extremely sensitive political issue, which had been taken into
consideration by Deng.
</P>
<P>
Under Deng's concerns, the two sides finally agreed that
leaders of the two countries would only shake hands while not
embracing each other when they met, which correctly outlined the
characteristics of bilateral relations at that time and shaped the
future development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
During Gorbachev's visit to China on May 15-18, 1989, Deng was
considering what to talk about in their meeting since bilateral
relations in the former four decades had experienced dramatic
highs and lows.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that their talks should focus on the
establishment of a new bilateral relationship without too much
mentioning the past.
</P>
<P>
He held that the central task of the normalization of bilateral
relations and their talks should be "to summarize the past and
pioneer the future."
</P>
<P>
In the meeting with Gorbachev, Deng said the emphasis should be
placed on the future, however, it was improper for China to skip
the past.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side would present its views which was aimed at
progress on a more substantial basis and would require no answers
from the Soviet side on the past, and the two sides should not
argue any more about the past, Deng told Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
Deng reviewed the past from two aspects: one, the losses China
had suffered throughout history from the oppression imposed by
various powers in the world; and, two, where the greatest threat
to China came from in the past several decades.
</P>
<P>
Deng pointed out that starting from the Opium War, big powers
had bullied China, and Japan was the country which had brought
about the most harm to China while tsarist Russia, including
certain periods of the Soviet Union on certain issues, benefited
the most.

<P>
Deng went on to say that the major threat to China came from
the United States in the '50s, and from the Soviet Union in
the '60s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
Summarizing the past decades in bilateral relations, Deng
stressed that the Soviet Union had put China in a wrong place and
the nature of such a wrong place was inequality.
</P>
<P>
However, China would always remember that the Soviet Union
under Stalin's rule helped China form an industrial base, Deng
noted.
</P>
<P>
On ideological disputes between the two sides, Deng said that
they were all idle talk, pointing out that one must build
socialism in accordance with its own conditions, and socialism
could not be limited to a single mode.
</P>
<P>
As to those arguments, the Chinese side did not believe they
were all true, said Deng, adding that these historical issues
should come to an end.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said that the Soviet Union should shoulder part of
the responsibility in some areas on bilateral relations in the
near past, echoing Deng that this concluded the past.
</P>
<P>
On future bilateral relations, Deng, summarizing historical
lessons in the international communist movements in past decades,
emphasized that bilateral relations should be based on the Five
Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence and any alignment or
confrontation was not successful.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique issued at the end of bilateral high-level
meetings stated that the normalization of bilateral relations was
not directed against or meant harm to any third party, which was
different from the alignment in the '50s and the confrontation in
the '60s and '70s between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral ties should be a normal state-to-state relationship
characterized by non-alignment, non-confrontation, and not
directed against the third party and good-neighbor friendship.

<P>
History has proved that such a new bilateral relationship was
not only in the fundamental interest of the two peoples, but also
conducive to safeguarding world peace and stability, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
Through this meeting, the two neighbors ended their abnormal
relationship and promised to develop their relations in accordance
with the principles of mutual respect of sovereignty and
territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in
each other's internal affairs, equality, reciprocity and peaceful
coexistence.
</P>
<P>
Qian voiced that both sides should treasure such a result which
cost a high price and was not easy to come by.
</P>
<P>
During the process of normalizing bilateral relations, the
political turmoil in the Summer of 1989 was impending, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the normalization of bilateral ties, international
situations have undergone great change. The normalization of
bilateral relations and Sino-Russian good-neighbor friendship has
withstood various tests and continues to develop in a sound and
steady manner, finally forming a strategic cooperative partnership
oriented to the 21st century and based on equality and mutual
trust, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Although the Soviet Union no longer exists, Qian noted that
Deng's diplomatic thoughts are still of pragmatic significance for
China's current diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
"We should still hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping's
Theory in further advancing China's diplomacy in the years to come
under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core," Qian said.

<HEADLINE> Germans Break World Record Twice, Win Gold and Silver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The world record was broken
twice within 10 minutes by two Germans in the Nagano Olympic women's
5,000m speed skating race with Claudia Pechstein retained her Olympic
title Friday, last day of the sport at the "M-Wave".
</P>
<P>
Defending gold medalist Pechstein, 25, set the world record in six
minutes and 59.61 seconds for her country's second gold medal in the
sport in Nagano.
</P>
<P>
Pechstein, completing in the last of eight pair races, surpassed
the short-lived mark of 6:59.65, set by her teammate Gunda
Niemann-Stirnemann in the second last pair race about 10 minutes ago.
</P>
<P>
"It was such a hard race," Pechstein said. "I saw Gunda's time, and
I saw her world record before mine. My best time before was only 7
minutes 14 seconds, so it was very hard for me.
</P>
<P>
"I found my pace, I had good laps, and I had a good finish time.
Now I have a world record in the 3,000 meters and 5,000 meters. I
didn't think about the gold medal, but I have it here now, and I am
very happy."
</P>
<P>
Both Germans brought the event under seven minutes for the first
time, better than Niemann's former world record of 7:03.26 established
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"If Gunda had skated after Claudia the result would have been
different. Both have the same ability to skate but Gunda could have
done better," Stephan Gneupel, personal coach of Niemann, who aslo won
the silver in the 1,500m race on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bronze medal went to Kazakstan's Lyudmila Prokasheva in
7:11.14, itself an Olympic record when it was set.
</P>
<P>
A new junior world record was set by 17-year-old Kirstin Holum of
the United States with a time of 7:14.20, which secured her seventh
place.
</P>
<P>
The skaters from the powerhouse Netherlands were knocked out of the
podium Friday, taking fourth, fifth and sixth through Barbara De Loor,
Tony De Jong and Carla Zijlsttar with a close time of 7:11.81, 7:12.77
and 7:12.89 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands, replacing the position of Norwegians who dominated
the Lillehammer Games in 1994 with three golds and two silvers, bagged
the most five of 10 gold medals and set two world records in the speed
skating races during the Games, mostly thanks to their new slap skates
and areodynamic strips on the skaters' uniforms.
</P>
<P>
Germany was second at the medal table, taking home two golds, three
silvers and one bronze. Norway, Canada and Japan won one gold each.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which took three gold medals in Lillerhammer,
managed only one silver and one bronze here. Other two countries who
took the medal, were Belgium and Kazakstan with each one bronze.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Trade Official Says Transport Should Serve Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- China's Assistant Minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Liu Xiangdong told a
foreign trade conference recently in the city of Beihai in China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region that transport should be part of
China's diverse strategy for foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade has gotten the participation of various
businesses in research, production, distribution, technology,
capital, labour, and they have mutually-helpful multi-lateral
commercial ties, Liu said, and transport work should serve the
development of foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Transport of goods should get the cooperation of
communications, railways, aviation, and customs, he said, and
transport enterprises should join together to form large groups to
face the fierce competition in the international market.
</P>
<P>
It should have a diverse strategy, especially in view of the
financial turmoil in Southeast Asia. China should consolidate its
markets in Europe and America and put more energy into Africa, the
Middle East, Commonwealth of Independent States, Eastern Europe,
Latin America, South Asia, and the South Pacific, he added.

<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- In a letter to a national

said that there should be more effective publicity in the rest of
the world to create a more favorable environment for the country.
</P>
<P>
Li is also a standing committee member of the Political Bureau
of the Chinese Communist Party Central committee.
</P>
<P>
Publicity outside China should have the mission of getting
China and the rest of the world to know each other better, Li
said, and that even local officials should place greater
importance on publicity work.
</P>
<P>
Ding Guangen, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC
Central Committee, told the five-day meeting that people should
get to know the world better and introduce China to other
countries, while the opening-up and the modernization drive
continue.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Jianhui, director of the State Council's Information
Office, gave an overall guide and the goals for publicity in 1998,
and said that there should be active and effective publicity for
people overseas to give the nation a better image.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sends Aide to Help With S. African Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton has sent his race relations adviser Duvall Patrick to
South Africa to help with a survey of 10,000 South African
companies this month ahead of the employment equity legislation.
</P>
<P>
According to local paper The Star Friday, Labor Department
Director General, Sipho Pityana, said his department would send
out letters next week to 10,000 companies with 50 or more
employees which would be affected by the controversial
legislation.
</P>
<P>
The survey, to assess race relations and employment equity,
will begin within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Employment Equity Bill, which was unveiled last November,
requires all companies with more than 50 employees to make up a
plan of affirmative action and to submit the plan to the Labor
Department.
</P>
<P>
Should a company fail to do so, it faces a fine up to 900,000
Rand (180,000 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the legislation argued that the bill would give
the Labor Department too much power to interfere in businesses'
daily running and would hinder employment.

last year. By the end of the year, the export trade volume reached
4.5 billion U.S. dollars, up 11 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
-- Exports of foreign-funded enterprises went up 11 percent
compared with the figure a year ago to reach 2.9 billion
U.S. dollars. Export-oriented firms sold 1.6 billion
U.S. dollars-worth of products to other countries and regions last
year, a 37-percent rise over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
-- With improvement of the export structure in recent years,
the export value of industrial goods reached 5.3 billion
U.S. dollars, accounting for 64 percent of Liaoning's total
export. Its export to Latin America grew by 42 percent and the
amount to Africa rose 64 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, losses incurred by state-owned enterprises in

<HEADLINE> EU Leader Supports China Holding World Gardening Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Leon Brittan, vice president
of the European Union, recently showed great confidence in the
event that Kunming, the capital of southwest China's Yunnan
province, could successfully host the '99 World Gardening Fair.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Kunming, Brittan said the city has a
pleasant climate, without being extremely hot in summer or
severely cold in winter. Kunming, known as a "city of spring," is
quite suitable for the growth of various plants.
</P>
<P>
Abundance of natural resources makes the host more attractive,
said the EU vice-chairman. Kunming is called a "kingdom of
plants," where more than 18,000 different plants grow in tropical,
sub-tropical, temperate and frigid zones. It is also one of
China's major flower producers.
</P>
<P>
Brittan also spoke highly of efforts made by the Chinese
government for the event and said he would encourage more EU
member countries to participate in the fair.
</P>
<P>
The '99 World Gardening Fair, the first of its kind to be held
in China, is scheduled from May to October of 1999, with the theme
"Man and Nature -- Entering the 21st Century."
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 50 countries have expressed their intent to
attend the fair.

</P>
<P>
This was part of a national spindle-cut drive with the aim to

discharging 9,000 textile workers, Jinan Mayor Xie Yutang said.
</P>
<P>
The local government will be providing with new jobs in eight
areas and distribute each laid-off worker a monthly income of 168
yuan before he or she is reemployed, Xie added.

<HEADLINE> Narcotics Consumption high in Western Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Drug abuse among young
Kenyans is increasing "at an alarming rate, especially in western
kenya," the Daily Nation Friday quoted an official as saying.
</P>
<P>
J.W. Mucithi, Chairman of Kenya Pride, told an on-going

Some 80 percent of pupils in schools are aware of illicit
drugs, but only 6 percent know the harmful effects of narcotics,
the report added.
</P>
<P>
Mucithi said at the seminar that his organization would
continue with enlightening school children on the dangers of drug
abuse.
</P>
<P>
A pilot project will be launched to sensitize teachers, and
students to the negative effects of drug abuse in selected five
to seven schools in western kenya, he added.
</P>
<P>
International Narcotics Control Board is scheduled to release
its annual report here next Tuesday which reportedly said that in
recent years drug use and abuse in certain circles in the world,
especially in Africa, had gained acceptability.
</P>
<P>
The board said in a press release issued here Thursday that
"drug abuse appears to be almost normal, even fashionable and

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Coup Suspects to Face Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Legal Affairs Minister Vincent
Malambo has said that 97 suspects arrested in connection with
Zambia's military coup attempt last October will be brought to
trial within a few days, Times of Zambia reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on the outcome of police investigations into
the coup attempt, Malambo said Thursday in parliament that seven
suspects picked up soon after the foiled coup have been released.
</P>
<P>
His statement has been prompted by the anxieties expressed by
the public and outcry for a speedy trial of those allegedly
involved in the event four months ago, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He added that police have begun preferring charges on suspects
and are constantly consulting the Director of Public Prosecutions
who in turn liaises with the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
"These consultations are at an advance stage and I want to
assure this House that the persons involved in this matter will
be brought to court in the next few days, not weeks," said
Malambo.
</P>
<P>
The legal affairs minister also disclosed that since the start
of investigations, 104 suspects have been picked up and hundreds
other prospective witnesses interviewed.
</P>
<P>
Malambo expressed his gratitude to parliament which ratified
last month a further extension of the state of emergency imposed
after the coup was foiled.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has come under both local and
international scrutiny since the attempted coup and subsequent
arrests. It is urged to release or try as soon as possible the
arrested suspects, including former president and opposition
leader Kenneth Kaunda who now is under house arrest.

<HEADLINE> Ousted Kabbah to Return to S. Leone Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Ousted Sierra Leone President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah is expected to return to his war-torn country
after nearly nine months of exile in neighboring Guinea.
</P>
<P>
"It will not be long before Tejan Kabbah returns home to
Sierra Leone," said Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi at the
end of Thursday's visit to the bases of the Nigerian-led west
African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG around Freetown,
capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi left for Freetown Wednesday to chair a meeting of the
committee of five on Sierra Leone set up by west African
countries.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations special envoy to that country, Francis
Okello was also there to assess the situation in the country,
where the junta which toppled Kabbah's government in a coup last
May and was driven out of Freetown by ECOMOG a week ago.
</P>
<P>
On top of Ikimi's are also a series of meetings with Kabbah,
Ghana's foreign minister and the heads of state of the
Organization of African Unity next week in Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
While a reinforcement of about 400 Nigerian soldiers were sent
to Freetown, Ikimi said he expected more troop commitments from
Guinea, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Niger and Mali to help secure the
country for Kabbah's return.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG force Commander Maj.-Gen. Timothy Shelpid disclosed
earlier this week, the peace-keepers deployed in Sierra Leone
were from Nigeria, Ghana and Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fall in Freetown, the junta has vowed to fight
back from the provinces and soldiers loyal the junta has launched
attacks in some of the major towns across the country.
</P>

There are reports of looting, killing and burning of houses
by these soldiers, especially in Bo, Sierra Leone's second
largest city.

<HEADLINE> Southern Chinese Re-employment Project Making Some Headway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 20 (Xinhua) -- A re-employment project in
south China's Guangdong Province has had some success, the deputy
governor of the province, Zhong Qiquan, told a provincial labor
conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 180,000 workers that had been laid
off, or 67 percent of Guangdong's army of laid-off workers, had
found new jobs. The overall employment situation in Guangdong is
stable, Zhong said, and the 2.3 percent of urban workers reported
as laid-off, are fewer that the 3 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to coal, textile, and sugar industries
this year as an important means of relieving the burdens of
unemployment in state enterprises, Zhong said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the prosperous province started establishing
re-employment foundations to help cash-starved enterprises and
increase re-employment methods. It also provides free training for
unemployed workers to improve working skills, and 300,000 workers
have taken these courses, accounting for 45 percent of the
province's laid-off force, and over 70 percent of the trainees
soon got new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Gan Zhaojiong, the director of the provincial labor department,
said that the province plans to continue the re-employment project
this year and see to it that over 70 percent of the laid-off
workers find new jobs this year.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM to Visit Malaysia, PNG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The financial crisis gripping
the region will be on top of the agenda when Australian Prime
Minister John Howard visits Malaysia next week.
</P>
<P>
Howard will leave for Malaysia on his first official visit
Sunday, followed by a two-day visit to Papua New Guinea, a
spokeswoman for the prime minister told Xinhua Friday.
</P>
<P>
Howard will hold talks with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad on the Asian financial crisis, the Australian Associated
Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has been hit hard by the Asian financial crisis, with
the Malaysian currency, the ringgit, dropping some 44 percent
against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
But Malaysia has weathered the crisis better than many of its
neighbors and has avoided any intervention by the International
Monetary Fund to shore up its economy.
</P>
<P>
Despite often testy bilateral relations between Australia and
Malaysia, trade and economic ties have remained strong.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is Australia's 11th largest trading partner, with
two-way trade totaling 2.4 billion U.S. dollars a year and
Australia exporting more than 1.47 billion U.S. dollars worth of
goods.
</P>
<P>
The relationship hit a low point in 1993 when former Prime
Minister Paul Keating called Mahathir "recalcitrant" for not
attending the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group
summit in Seattle, the United States.
</P>
<P>
But it has since improved markedly, with Mahathir making a
flying visit to Brisbane, capital of Queensland state in east
Australia, to meet Howard shortly after the coalition won power in
the 1996 election.
</P>

<HEADLINE> About $52M Agro Funds Wasted, Says Zambian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Financial Minister
Ronald Penza has revealed that over 70 billion Kwacha (about 52
million U.S. Dollars) of agro funds has been wasted since 1992 in
a maize marketing program, Zambia Daily Mail reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed Thursday by Penza at a seminar reviewing
Zambia's poverty levels.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is appalling to pump such a huge amount of
money when it could be used in other sectors of the economy to
effectively reduce the intensity of poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
Penza argued that although agriculture is part of the
government's priorities, the major policy under the country's
Agriculture Sector Investment Program (ASIP) has been
misconceived at institutional level.
</P>
<P>
The financial minister expressed his disappointment at the
implementation of ASIP, saying that it "has been badly
misconceived. It is supposed to be the best service delivery
system to the peasants in rural areas, but these people do not
benefit from it."
</P>
<P>
Penza even wondered why he should be putting more money in
some of the program when rural farmers did not get anything from
the whole 70 billion Kwacha, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
"That money has not been accounted for," said Penza.

<HEADLINE> China Approves First Onland Joint Oil Exploration Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, February 20 (Xinhua) -- An overall plan for exploring
the Zhaodong Cooperative Zone of the Dagang Oilfield in north
China's Tianjin city has passed appraisal by experts recently.
</P>
<P>
The China National Petroleum and Gas Corporation decided to
give approval for starting commercial exploration.
</P>
<P>
The Zhaodong Cooperative Zone has an area of 197 sq km and has
six subzones. The Dagang Oilfield has been cooperating in the zone
with Apache and XCL companies of the United States since a
contract of cooperation became effective on May 1, 1993. They
have used advanced technology and equipment to prospect and
explore the tidal areas of the sea.
</P>
<P>
From June 1994 to October 1997, the Chinese and American oil
developers sunk seven wells, including two wells with an average
daily output of over 1,000 tons. The proven petroleum geological
reserves stand at 37 million tons.
</P>
<P>
A group of 30 experts from China and overseas concluded after a
thorough study of the plan that the Zhaodong Cooperative Zone has
the foundation for commercial oil exploration.
</P>
<P>
According to the development plan, oil exploring workers will
altogether sink 42 wells in the zone and use different exploration
methods to tap oil reserves distributed in different strata.
</P>
<P>
Six platforms will also be erected on the offshore areas,
including two for drilling, two for central treatment and
production, one for oil storage and one for oil loading. The
installation will be finished within this year.
</P>
<P>
The principle of "safety, simplicity and environmental
protection" will be strictly observed in oil exploration, said oil
developers at the Dagang Oilfield, adding that they hoped to form
a production capacity of one million tons a year in the Zhaodong
Cooperative Zone after two years' construction.

NANJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Industrial enterprises in east
China's Jiangsu Province made 18.1 billion yuan in net profit last
year, up 22 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu's gross industrial profits grew 12.6 percent to 51.2
billion yuan in 1997, while the industrial economic efficiency
ratio reached 100.1 percent, up 4.7 percentage points from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu is one of China's economic powerhouses, with its
industrial production capacity accounting for one tenth of the
national total.
</P>
<P>
Last year enterprises in Jiangsu stepped up their efforts for
economic restructuring and successfully cut their average
asset-to-liability ratio by one tenth. By the end of last year a
total of more than 41,800 enterprises had been turned into
joint-stock firms.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese province also reported progress in enterprise
association and merging to form large enterprise groups, with more
than 300 down-performing enterprises being merged in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu selected 30 key enterprises in sectors of machinery,
electronics, chemicals and auto-making for priority financial
support last year. A total of 114 billion yuan has been invested
in 147 key projects.
</P>
<P>
As enterprises in Jiangsu become larger, their products have
also become better and more competitive. A sample survey showed

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
higher Friday in Sydney in choppy dealings during which Asian
currencies were the focus of the market.
</P>
<P>
The local currency ended at 67.58 US cents, from 0.6733 US
cents late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"All eyes have been on Japan and Asia," said Paul Macarounas,
foreign exchange manager with Rothschild Australian.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar had fallen back to an intraday low of
67.24 US cents on the back of reported remarks by US Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin and expectations that a Japanese government
fiscal stimulus package would not live up to expectations.
</P>
<P>
But institutions had used the pull back as a buying
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Washington, Rubin played down notions of a
concerted plan by the Group of Seven nations to intervene to
support sagging Asian currencies, Dow Jones Newswires reported.
</P>
<P>
That sent the Japanese, Indonesian, Thai and Malaysian
currencies lower, and the New Zealand and Australian dollars
softened as well.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Australian dollar ended in Sydney also at 85.59
yen from 84.46 yen, and at 1.2261 marks from 1.2258.

<HEADLINE> CSC Outlines Trans-Century Strategy for Shipping Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The China Shipping (Group)
Company (CSC) will work to double its assets and earnings by
implementing a new strategy.
</P>
<P>
Information from a recent working meeting held by CSC which is
headquartered in Shanghai said that the group company will
actively advance the enterprise reform and complete reorganization
of the assets of four subompanies, and establish five major
shipping fleets.
</P>
<P>
CSC will also vigorously develop by-line services as a way to
expand diverse businesses, while taking shipping as the main
operation.
</P>
<P>
It will also improve management of assets and make preparations
for the establishment of a financial company under CSC. It will
try more ways to raise capital and work for expansion by way of
purchase, merger and stock control and inject funds into listed
companies.
</P>
<P>
CSC will expand overseas businesses and make an effort to
improve the general qualities of its workers, especially training
more qualified personnel and a group of senior marketing and
administrative managers.
</P>
<P>
As an important move to implement this strategy, CSC announced
on February 10 the establishment of three specialized companies --
the China Marine and Seamen Service Co. Ltd., China Shipping
International Trade Co. Ltd., and China Shipping Development
Tanker Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The reorganization of assets is designed to advance CSC's
structural adjustment, improve efficiency through increased scale
of operation and eventually enhance its competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The China Shipping Development Tanker Co., which has a fleet of
96 oil tankers with a combined DWT (dead weight tonnage) of 2.16

<HEADLINE> Feature: Sri Lankan Soldiers Fighting Jungle War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before starting to move to the frontlines near Mankulam, the
northmost point the journalists were allowed to go, they were each
given a helmet and a bullet-proof jacket and warned not to speak
loudly as that might invite rebel mortars.
</P>
<P>
"They cannot see us and we cannot see them. All the movements
are stealthy, planned and quiet," an officer said.
</P>
<P>
On the front line southwest of Mankulam, another officer said
scarcely any birds can be seen in the jungle. "They all left
because of the gunfire," he said, adding that there used to be
many kinds of birds before the operation began.
</P>
<P>
He seemed satisfied with the morale of his men. One wounded
soldier was summoned to meet the journalists and tell them how he
sustained wounds due to a mortar attack by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old soldier said he joined the army to fight, not
to go home. Around him were his field commander and Brigadier
Munasinghe.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers were scattered in small groups in the jungles, taking
cover of the bunkers they dug. When they are out to patrol around,
the military equipment they have on their shoulders could be as
heavy as 25 kilograms, an officer said.
</P>
<P>
While the journalists were having their field lunch with
soldiers, a round of mortar shell exploded about 100 meters away
from where the group was staying. A senior officer said that must
be fired by the rebels, who were retaliating upon the front line
troops. The troops fired many rounds of mortar shells half an hour
ago.
</P>
<P>
At another military camp guarded by the Air Force, which is
located eight kilometers west of the main road, Flight Lieutenant
Keerthi Pinnawala said they were guarding the west flank of the
road to prevent LTTE infiltration.
</P>
<P>
When asked how much he missed his family, the unmarried man
smiled and said "very much". He has to serve the Air Force for 20
years.
</P>
<P>
Pinnawala also said there were not many deserters in the Air
Force troops. In his squadron, which is about 120 men, only one or
two have deserted the service.
</P>
<P>
The army has much more deserters, Pinnawala added. Since the
ethnic war broke out in 1983, around 24,000 have deserted the
services. Though the authorities have offered seven amnesties
since 1995, only about 10,000 soldiers have returned.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting for a separate state of
their own in the north and east of the country since 1983. At
present most of the major fightings are reported in the north,
where the troops are pushing their way northwards through the
jungles.
</P>
<P>
The monsoon season of last year brought too much rains to the
region and slowed down the movement of the troops. Meanwhile,
rebel counter attacks and strong resistance also frustrated the
troops greatly.
</P>
<P>
Local military observers said it seems that the current
operation could definitely go on for a few more months. As for how
long the war would continue, no ready answer is available.
</P>
<P>
After the January 25 bomb blast in the central hill city of
Kandy, which killed 17 people and seriously damaged the Dalada
Maligawa (Tooth Relic Temple), the holiest shrine of Sri Lankan
Buddhists, the government has banned the LTTE, leaving military
strike the only option to settle the ethnic dispute.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Sri Lankan Soldiers Fighting Jungle War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- In the thick jungles near
Mankulam, a strategic town in the north of Sri Lanka, soldiers are
fighting with rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) in a ten-month operation code-named Operation Jayasikuru
(Sure of Victory).
</P>
<P>
The troops have thrust their foremost defense line to only
around one to two kilometers away from Mankulam, where a large
amount of the rebels put up intense resistance against the
military offensives.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 local and international journalists were brought
to the front line Wednesday and were allowed to interview soldiers
and officers. This was the first time foreign journalists were
given a chance to visit the war-zone at Mankulam ever since the
operation was waged last May.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the operation is to open a land route
running from Vavuniya to Kilinochchi in the north, which when
captured could enable a more economic transportation route on land
as well as divide the LTTE into two separate parts on either side
of the road.
</P>
<P>
Destruction and terror were obvious wherever the group of
journalists went in their trip from the Vavuniya city up to the
Mankulam battlefield.
</P>
<P>
The ride on the main road to the military front lines at the
outskirts of Mankulam was a good test of one's endurance and
stamina. Lots of pits, dust, road blocks and check points made the
travel a suffering.
</P>
<P>
Of the 43-kilometer Vavuniya-Mankulam road, only a small
section was covered with tarmac. The dust on the road has turned
the color of nearby trees and bushes into yellow.
</P>
<P>
Rich lands along the road have been deserted, leaving weeds to
grow freely. Bulldozers have been called in to clear trees and
bushes within 100 meters on both sides of the road to create a
buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
The military has said one of the objectives to capture the road
is to enable free civilian movement on it. However, hardly any
civilians can be observed during the whole day visit to war zones.
</P>
<P>
Most of the vehicles on the rough road are military ones. Apart
from tanks, armored vehicles, jeeps and trucks, there are many
tractors. The thing is, on board are not farmers, but fully armed
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the 600,000 or so civilians in this area have left
their homes for a long time, an officer providing security for the
journalists said. Their houses, which were along the road side,
have been ruined in fighting.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the houses are roofless, many of them have been
reduced to the ground by gunfire. Holes created by bullets on
walls turn out to be a perfect illustration on the cruelty of war.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the capture of the road is the result of a great loss
of lives.
</P>
<P>
At the Vavuniya military headquarters, where the journalists
started their journey, Overall Operations Commander Major General
Srilal Weerasooriya said 3,200 LTTE rebels have been killed since
Operation Jayasikuru started.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the casualties of the military, a senior aid
to the general put it at around 1,400 deaths while about five
minutes later Military Spokesman Brigadier Sarath Munasinghe
revised it to 937, including 42 officers.
</P>
<P>
So far the 32-kilometer road between Mankulam and Kilinochchi,
which is further north, is controlled by the Tigers. Previously
the military has claimed that only 20 kilometers of road were left
untaken.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) has set aside over 100
million U.S. Dollars this year to boost its existing conventional
telephone system and the cellular network.
</P>
<P>
Under an expansion program, which is expected to be completed
by the end of next year, the number of lines for the existing
fixed network (conventional telephone system) will be increased
from the present 200,000 to 700,000 lines.
</P>
<P>
New board chairman of the PTC Moses Mashumba Thursday said,
"the board's first priority is to increase the capacity of the
existing fixed network and the cellular network to satisfy
demand."
</P>
<P>
To realize this, a number of training programs for those in
managerial positions will be conducted, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added it was also necessary for the board, which will
shortly be restructuring the corporation, to explore different
methods of sourcing funds for capital projects.

<HEADLINE> Balanced Coal Supply Predicted for China in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Coal Industry
has predicted a balanced coal supply this year, according to
today's International Business Daily.
</P>
<P>
The ministry forecast this year's demand for coal at
1.35-to-1.4 billion tons, equivalent to last year's real
consumption figure and this year's expected output.
</P>
<P>
Coal exports are expected to reach 30 million tons and imports
are estimated at 3 million tons this year.
</P>
<P>
In the next three years, the annual growth rate for coal
production will be 2.2 percent, or 30 million tons, according to
the ministry.
</P>
<P>
This year's coal market features a "buyer's market," but the
price of coal will remain stable because of the impact of a stable
international market and the slowing down of domestic coal
production.
</P>
<P>
Prices for clean coal and quality anthracite will slightly
increase, while those for other varieties will be kept at the last
year's level.
</P>
<P>
As the coal transportation bottleneck eases, the coal supply
for eastern and coastal areas will be ensured, according to the
ministry.

<HEADLINE> Anhui Province Reports Steady Growth of Securities Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The securities industry of east
China's Anhui Province has developed steadily in recent years,
according to a local official.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 Anhui issued its first A shares, designed for domestic
investors. Since then 14 listed companies have issued A shares, B
shares (issued in China but reserved for overseas investors), and
H shares (those issued in Hong Kong).
</P>
<P>
The share issues have raised funds worth 12.2 billion yuan in
aggregate, which is about 21 percent of the net asset value of
Anhui's state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
"The funds raised have effectively helped to invigorate our
provincial economy," said Fang Junwen, director of Anhui
Provincial Securities Administration Office.
</P>
<P>
The business records of Anhui's listed companies are fairly
good, Fang said, adding that their core business income grew an
average 41.1 percent to a total of 7.03 billion yuan in the first
half of last year while their profits soared more than 60 percent
to 765 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In another analysis, the per share post-tax profit of the
companies reached 0.224 yuan in the first half of 1997, nearly 50
percent higher than the average for all companies listed on
China's two stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, according to
Fang.
</P>
<P>
He said that this year Anhui will attach greater importance to
the issuing of new shares and gradually open its securities market
while setting up more powerful securities intermediary agencies.
</P>
<P>
Anhui will issue a number of documents to strengthen
supervision over the securities and futures sector to ensure
standard development, Fang said.

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan
Province will increase investment to improve its
telecommunications facilities this year.
</P>
<P>
Henan is the most populous province in China. The posts and

Chu Junguo, director of the Henan Provincial Administration of
Posts and Telecommunications, said his province would increase
30,000 channels and add 670,000 mobile phone subscribers this year.
</P>
<P>
The province also plans to add 11,000 digital
telecommunications outlets and 11,000 digital subscribers, and add
switchboards with a combined exchange capacity of handling 1.3
million calls at the same time to make sure that all villages in
the province be connected with dialing service.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13,000 long-distance computer-controlled exchange
boards will be added in the province, and 25,000 long-distance

<P>
FUZHOU, February 20 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province
will open its agricultural sector wider to the outside world,
according to Chen Mingyi, secretary of the provincial committee of
the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
The move is designed to raise Fujian's level of export-oriented
agriculture, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Fujian used to be rather backward in terms of agricultural
development but has over the years gained importance in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
This year Fujian will expand agricultural cooperation with
Taiwan, encouraging more academic exchange with Taiwan and beefing
up efforts to develop the two cross-straits agricultural
experimental zones in Fuzhou and Zhangzhou, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Fujian will enhance its efforts to attract more
overseas investment and introduce more fine breeds and advanced
faming techniques.
</P>
<P>
Measures will also be taken to develop agricultural products
with a high added value and form some large agricultural
enterprise groups to enhance competitiveness.

102 million U.S. dollars for its agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Bordering the South China Sea and with a subtropical climate,
Chaozhou boasts rich agricultural resources. The city, which is in

The city has in recent years invested more than 6 billion
yuan (722.89 million U.S. dollars) to improve water conservation,
transportation, energy and telecommunications to improve the
investment environment.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka's Export Earnings to Rise 36 Percent: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh would earn 6 billion
U.S. dollars from export during the current financial year, an
increase of some 36 percent over the last fiscal year, according
to Commerce and Industries Minister Tofael Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
"All barriers have been removed to increase export earnings,"
local newspapers Friday quoted Tofael as saying Thursday at a
function here marking the launch of computer education in the
Bangla language.
</P>
<P>
The rise in export earnings is possible because the government
has taken prompt action to solve problems faced by the exporters,
he said, citing as example the fact that the government succeeded
in making the European Union lift a ban on Dhaka's frozen food
export.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government gives top priority to developing
information technology to earn more foreign currency through the
export of computer software.
</P>
<P>
The country earned about 2.6 billion dollars from export during
the first half of the current fiscal year beginning July 1,
showing a growth of 18.9 percent over the corresponding period of
the last fiscal year.

<P>
BANGKOK, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand maintains its
position as the world's largest rice exporter, a report released
by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In its latest food outlook, FAO reported that Thailand
accelerated its pace of rice exports considerably during December
1997 and the total volume for the year is now estimated at more
than 5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam followed with its 3.5 million ton export as the world's
second largest rice exporter.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. organization estimated the world rice output in 1997
at a record 571 million tons with that for Thailand alone at 20.6
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Thai Rice Exporters Association expected the
country's 1998 rice output to be at 28.88 million tons, of which,
according to FAO forecast, about 5.3 million tons will be
exported.
</P>
<P>
FAO predicted that a number of countries, especially in the
Asian and Pacific region, are expected to import more rice in 1998
to make up for the shortage resulting from crop damage triggered
by the El Nino effect.

NAGANO, Japan, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Julija Tchepalova of Russia
clinched her first Winter Olympic Games gold medal as she took the
women's 30km freestyle race Friday in Hakuba, giving the Russia
women's a clean sweep of the cross-country gold medals in Nagano.
</P>
<P>
"I have dreams, I have goals, maybe it's just the beginning for
my sports career," said the 21-year-old rising skiier.
</P>
<P>
Tchepalova made a strong second-half push to overtake Italian
Stefania Belmondo, who led for more than two-thirds of the race, for
the triumph with a time of one hour 22 minutes and 01.5 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Belmondo took the silver, only 10.2 seconds behind the Russian
winner. Tchepalova's teammate Larissa Lazutina won the bronze, her
fifth medal of the Games in 1:23:15.7.

</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied, it was a good race," said the Italian, a
specialist in the freestyle technique.
</P>
<P>
"It's too bad for being defeated in the last but the result was
O.K. It caused problems with the skis today," she said of the light

<HEADLINE> Five Countries Help Indonesia Overcome Forest Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- China, Japan, Finland, Norway
and France have provided equipment for Indonesia to overcome the
forest fire in East Kalimantan, Indonesian government officials
confirmed here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The assistance was delivered by Coordinating Minister of
People's Welfare Azwar Anas to Minister of Forestry Djamaludin
Suryohadikusumo here on Thursday, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The equipment provided by these countries include hand tools,
overalls, helmets, boots, gloves, water pumps, powder
extinguishers and portable jet shooters will be managed by the
East Kalimantan's governor and the head of the unit coordinating
the fire-fighting effort, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
As of February 17, the number of hot spots in the region had
been reduced to 74 from the previous 600, Anas said when
delivering the equipment.
</P>
<P>
He said the fires, which started in the past few weeks, have
destroyed 4,430 hectares of forest in East Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
Environmental experts said the new fires were linked to the
reduced monsoon rains caused by the El Nino weather warming
phenomenon in the tropical Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Last year, bush fires destroyed more than 1 million hectares of
forest in Indonesia with an economic loss of 3.1 billion U.S.
dollars, official sources estimated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
has also expressed its readiness to act fast if Indonesia asks for
help in fighting fires blazing on the island of Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
The resurgence of the fires has raised fears of a possible
repeat of the smog that blanketed large parts of Southeast Asia
last year as a result of forest fires in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Secretariat based in Jakarta said last week that ASEAN
 would establish in June this year computer links between all
member nations for them to share satellite images, wind charts and
air quality data.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Laos, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

</P>
<P>
Caompagnoni was quite happy with the race. She said:"I think it was
my best race. I could see this morning that it was a difficult
piste."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippine New Oil Law Gets IMF Nod </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has given its approval to the Philippines' new oil
deregulation law, completing the last structural reform required
for the country to exit from the institution's conditional lending
program.
</P>
<P>
"The law was found satisfactory by the IMF," the leading
newspaper Philippine Star Friday quoted Central Bank Governor
Gabriel Singson as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new law, which was signed into law last week to replace an
earlier version nullified by the Supreme Court last November,
allows companies to set their own prices and opens the industry to
new entrants.
</P>
<P>
The IMF earlier opposed the provision of a 2.9 billion peso
(72.5 million US dollar) buffer fund that would continue to
subsidize oil prices within a five-month transition period for
full deregulation in the new oil law.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said that allowing another transition period would mean
that oil pricing will not be market-oriented right away and the
government would be forced to subsidize price adjustments again.
</P>
<P>
An IMF mission is in Manila to review whether all the terms of
its lending program have been met and to discuss a new standby
credit line to help replenish the country's foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines will finally exit from the IMF program -- a
so-called Extended Fund Facility -- when an agreement is reached
with the IMF on the country's 1998 economic program.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Pledges to Overcome Economic Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia President Soeharto
has said his country would continue to make efforts to cope with
the current economic and monetary turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a state banquet held Thursday night in honor of
visiting Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh at the State Palace
here, Soeharto said the economic crisis had made basic commodities
in the country more expensive.
</P>
<P>
"Unemployment is increasing and the people's purchasing power
is declining while our economic growth stagnates for the time
being," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are now making all efforts and exerting our strength to
overcome the test," he told the Yemeni guest.
</P>
<P>
On the economic situation in the world, Soeharto said countries
across the globe, particularly the developing ones, still had
shortcomings such as shortage of capital, low technology
acquisition and low quality human resources.
</P>
<P>
In view of that, he said, developing countries should therefore
enhance cooperation through the so-called South-South cooperation
besides with multilateral bodies.
</P>
<P>
"Opportunities are open for countries to jointly develop a more
peaceful, just and prosperous world," he added.
</P>
<P>
President Ali Abdullah Saleh arrived here on Thursday on a
four-day state visit to Indonesia. He will hold talks Friday
morning with President Soeharto on bilateral, regional and
international issues, officials here said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand supports a diplomatic
solution to defuse the gulf crisis, the Thai Foreign Ministry
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government backs the efforts by United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who headed for Baghdad as "broker of
peace", the Bangkok Post Friday quoted the Foreign Ministry as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, ten present and former Thai Muslim
legislators sent a letter to Annan, urging the avertion of use of
force and a peaceful end to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the United States' threat of strike on Iraq
as President Saddam Hussein refused to allow UN weapons inspectors
free access to his palaces.
</P>
<P>
The UN weapons inspection team suspected some of the sites may
have been used to store biological or nuclear weapons which the
Iraqis undertook to destroy after they lost the 1991 war.
</P>
<P>
U.S. long-range bombers were given permission to use the Thai
naval airfields to refuel during the 1991 Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Media Hails Than Shwe's Manila Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The official New Light of
Myanmar newspaper Friday hailed the country's leader Than Shwe's
three-day state visit to the Philippines as another significant
milestone in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe, chairman of the Myanmar State Peace and Development
Council, paid the visit to Manila, capital of the Philippines,
from February 17 to 19 at the invitation of Philippine President
Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
In its editorial, the paper attributed the closer ties to the
two countries' geographical link and the fellow membership of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), quoting the two
heads of state.
</P>
<P>
The editorial cited three years of increasingly dynamic
interchange, better understanding and commitment to mutual help
and cooperation since the 1995 Bangkok meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two sides shared the view that Myanmar and the Philippines,
being more closely related in the ASEAN family now, should
maximize cooperation for the benefit of the two countries and the
two peoples, the paper said, quoting the joint communique issued
in Manila at the end of Than Shwe's Philippines visit on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to continue to improve bilateral
relations, promising to work closely and cooperatively in
implementing various bilateral agreements, it added.
</P>
<P>
During Than Shwe's visit to Manila, four agreements or
memorandums of understanding were signed between the two
countries on investment promotion and protection, cultural
cooperation, human resources development and visa exemption for
diplomats and officials.

confidence in their neighbors, visiting New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley said Friday in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Trans Tasman Business Circle, Shipley said
ripple effects from the Asian currency crisis were being felt in
New Zealand with business liquidity tightening, a drop in tourist
numbers and falls in export demand.
</P>
<P>
"But, speaking from a New Zealand perspective, we believe now
is a time for purpose not panic," she was quoted by the Australian
Associated Press (AAP) as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Just because things are difficult in Asia for the time being
is no reason to lose confidence, or to change course from the
government and business efforts to draw closer to our own region."
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand prime minister, who arrived in Australia
Thursday on a two-day visit and held talks with Australian Prime
Minister John Howard Friday morning, said there was no reason to
doubt that Asian neighbors would meet the challenge of regaining
sustainable growth in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
Shipley said the current economic troubles in Asia did not
detract from the region's "remarkable" growth record, which she
believed would provide a good foundation for future policy
adjustments to achieve economic stability.
</P>
<P>
On the weapons inspection crisis between the United States and
Iraq, New Zealand, which had provided defense force personnel in
support of the U.S., hoped that "diplomacy will prevail but this
cannot be assumed," Shipley said.
</P>
<P>
She stressed New Zealand's support for current efforts being
undertaken by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan to seek
a diplomatic solution to the weapons inspection crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu Thursday promulgated a new privatization bill to
speed up the reform of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The bill, on the privatization of commercial enterprises, is
the second of its kind adopted since 1990. The first privatization
bill was decreed by former president, Ion Iliescu, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
By adopting the new bill, the Romanian authorities intend to
gradually weaken the government's role in the economy by
transferring shares of state-owned enterprises to private
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Many privatization organs which used to function independently
will be put under the control of the Privatization Ministry. The
ministry was set up last year to strengthen the management,
coordination and monitoring of the privatization process.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists announced
recently that they have found 684 million tons of bauxite reserves
in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, making it
possible for the region to become one of the country's major
aluminium mining bases.
</P>
<P>
The region is estimated to have more than a billion tons of
bauxite reserves -- the ore used in producing aluminum, accounting
for nearly a quarter of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Most of the proven bauxite reserves lie in the western parts of
the region, either opencast or scattered along railways and
highways, easy for processing and transport.
</P>
<P>
The finding of nine large, high-quality bauxite mines at more
than 20 million tons of reserves poses favorable conditions to the
region in developing its aluminium mining industry, experts said,
adding that Guangxi is also rich in water and power resources, a
prerequisite for the sector's economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Finnish Government Adopts EMU Participation Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Finnish government
adopted a report Thursday calling for the country's entry into the
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) among the first group of
European Union (EU) countries at the start of next year.
</P>
<P>
To be one of the founders of the single currency will be the
best way to guarantee a sustained and stable economic development
for Finland, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Participation in the euro will bring Finland both economic
efficiency and financial stability. It will also make positive
contribution to higher growth and the creation of new jobs."
</P>
<P>
The report added that an EMU membership will also win Finland
more chances to exert its influence upon European affairs.
</P>
<P>
The report, outlined by the five-party government of Prime
Minister Paavo Lipponen, is to be submitted to parliament for
further discussion next week. And in April, the parliament will
hold a final vote on it.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe the report will get through parliament by
a simple majority, and thus, by January 1999, Finland will be the
only one of the five Nordic countries in the EMU.
</P>
<P>
After obtaining the EU membership in early 1995, Finland is
making efforts to meet the EMU criteria set by the Maastricht
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
One of the criteria is that the budget deficit and national
debt of a member country must not exceed 3 and 60 percent
respectively of its gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the Finnish government announced that it
had almost fulfilled all the criteria.

WARSAW, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Poland's Sejm (the House of
Representatives) on Thursday adopted a bill which would pave the
way for the Polish government to send troops to the gulf to take
part a possible military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The bill, on the use of Polish forces abroad, was proposed
after a February 10 decision by the Polish government when
preparing to send troops to the gulf. It was challenged by some
parliament members who said the move lacked legal grounds.
</P>
<P>
Under the new bill, the president can decree the use of Polish
forces overseas when there is a proposal from the government. But
the decree is valid only after it is signed by both the president
and the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The bill, adopted in the Sejm with 237 for, 134 against and 16
abstentions, is subject to approval by the Senat, and the
signature of the president before it takes effect.
</P>
<P>
As the legal battle for deployment of troops abroad continued,
the Polish military announced on Thursday that it is dispatching a
216-strong antichemical warfare battalion to Kuwait by March 5.

<P>
CHANGSHA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 1.15 million people
escaped poverty in the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous
Prefectures in central China's Hunan Province in the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
As one of China's 18 impoverished areas, Xiangxi has a
difficult natural environment which has delayed its economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Since the Chinese government set the goal to eliminate poverty by
2000, Xiangxi has become the main target of the Hunan government.
</P>
<P>
Materials and personnel were sent to the Xiangxi area to help
the locals. Six well-off areas in Hunan have lent a hand to Xiangxi by
providing funds and technicians.
</P>
<P>
Peng Jun, a local official in Xiangxi, said that since the
anti-poverty campaign was expanded, the economy has been
developing and people's living standards have improved.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the average annual income of residents in
Xiangxi is more than twice that of five years ago. The average
consumption of food and durable consumer goods also increased, as
well as living space.
</P>
<P>
An official from the provincial government said that, if the
present pace continues, Xiangxi is expected to eliminate poverty
before 2000.

ROME, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Despite a division over whether
they should support a United States military strike against Iraq,
a strong majority of Italians believe U.S. bases in Italy should
not be used for such an attack.
</P>
<P>
A survey for the weekly news magazine, Expresso, found that of
800 Italians interviewed, 41 percent backed a U.S. military
intervention in Iraq and 42.8 percent opposed it.
</P>
<P>
Of those questioned, 66.2 percent said it would be better "to
avoid the use of U.S. bases in Italy" for an air strike against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Thomas
Pickering said the U.S. would use military bases in the Italian
territory in a military strike against Iraq only with the
authorization of the Italian government.
</P>
<P>
In a video conference via satellite links between Washington,
London, Moscow and Rome, Pickering said that if the trip by United
Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to Baghdad fails, Iraq "must
expect the use of rather violent force, and not a small scale
intervention."

SHANGHAI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Trading in B shares, which
are reserved for overseas investors only, rocketed 125 percent to
21.29 billion U.S. dollars on the Shanghai stock market last year.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics indicate that trading by domestic
brokerages grew by an even greater rate, at 160 percent. The local
Shenyin &AMP; Wanguo Securities Co. Ltd. topped the turnover ranking
with a 24 percent market share.
</P>
<P>
The trading volume of the top 10 securities firms -- which
included Jun'an, Guotai, Huaxia, Jardine Fleming Security Ltd.,
Credit Ygonnais Security and HG Asia Ltd. -- reached more than 1
billion yuan each.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the proportion of B share trading by overseas
securities declined in 1997, a tendency experts say will continue
this year because of volatility on the international
market.

<HEADLINE> Kuchma: CIS's Future Depends on Russia's Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The future of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) depends primarily on "Russia's position"
and on its willingness to treat other countries as "equal
partners", Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said this at a joint press conference after meeting his
Uzbek counterpart Islam Karimov on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma expressed his belief that the coming CIS summit to be
held in Moscow in March would be "fruitful".
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Kuchma said,
his nation holds the view that the keynote to the CIS's future
would have the economy holding prior place to politics.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral ties should be further strengthened, considering the
vast potential of the group to be tapped, said Karimov. Uzbekistan
was willing to develop close cooperation with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Karimov arrived here on Wednesday evening for a three-day
visit.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- China will open more
international air routes to cater to developing markets and to
link the country with other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
The number of international routes will increase from the
current 106 to 124 by July, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
By then, the civil aviation sector will extend its flights to
62 cities in 32 countries, and the number of air passages
connecting the Chinese mainland with Hong Kong and Macao will
reach 26.
</P>
<P>
Air China's new route - a Beijing-Hiroshima round trip with a
intermediate stop at Dalian - will be opened today in both
directions.
</P>
<P>
China Southern Airlines will open a new route on March 29 to
bring Guangzhou, Xiamen and Kuala Lumpur nearer.
</P>
<P>
Other air routes to be opened include those linking China with
Japan, Mongolia, the Philippines, Malaysia, the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea and two with Macao.
</P>
<P>
The number of people flying the country's international air
routes has been increasing in recent years thanks to improved
living standards, flight safety and in-flight service, noted the
Beijing-based paper.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a total of 5.05 million passagers travelled to or
from overseas by the country's flights, up 14.7 percent from the
1996's figure.

<HEADLINE> Firecrackers: Tradition in Conflict with Law, Safety (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Due to public outcry, the ban was then lifted in some
cities. However, the problems also returned.
</P>
<P>
Appalling news of personal injuries were reported one after
another in the country's major newspapers. One recent accident
left 47 people dead as a result of an explosion in a
firecracker-market.
</P>
<P>
People are beginning to seek a compromise, "Experts should
invent a kind of electronic firecracker which can maintain the
festival atmosphere, but does not inflict personal injuries,"
suggested one engineer.
</P>
<P>
Others oppose the suggestion, saying that it's inadequate to
consider only the noise.
</P>
<P>
"The whole process of setting off firecrackers -- the action of
igniting, the deafening sound, and the thick smell of the powder
-- combines to result in feelings of participation, celebration,
relaxation, as well as expectation, while electronic firecrackers
could only offer a sense of imitation," said one observer.
</P>
<P>
The seesaw battle between tradition and law goes on unabated,
and no one knows which side eventually will win. But one thing is
for sure, the process of the battle records the development of
human society -- from benightedness to civilization.

The nomination brought to an end a two-month deadlock over the

Clinton proposed spending 568 million dollars next year and 2.3

<HEADLINE> U.S. Troop Reduction Planned in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
expected to reduce its troops in Bosnia this year from 8,500 to
7,000, an administration official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity,
said the number of U.S. "maneuver battalions," the equivalent of
combat battalions, will remain at three, an Associated Press
report said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the reduced U.S. presence, the overall NATO commitment
is expected to remain at its current level at least until national
elections in Bosnia this fall.
</P>
<P>
American troops have been in Bosnia for more than three years.
President Bill Clinton has set departure deadlines twice and
extended them twice.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, Clinton decided that the U.S. troops
will continue to be deployed in Bosnia, setting no deadline for an
American pullout.
</P>
<P>
Some members of Congress are uneasy about the open-ended
commitment, but Clinton has warned that an ethnic war could be
reignited in Bosnia if the U.S. troops leave.

<HEADLINE> Firecrackers: Tradition in Conflict with Law, Safety (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Firecrackers, banned three
years ago in China's major cities, tiptoed back across the country
as people could not give up their tradition of setting off
firecrackers during festivals.
</P>
<P>
As objects that can make deafening sounds, firecrackers were
first invented to scare off a kind of monster called "Year" which
comes down the mountains and disturbs people when heavy snow
falls, according to Chinese folklore.
</P>
<P>
The practice then gradually evolved into a widely recognized
tradition and became a major part of holiday celebrations.
</P>
<P>
While helping to create a kind of festival atmosphere,
firecrackers also present a hazard. They can cause personal
injuries, start fires and cause noise problems, issues which
resulted in an increasing number of complaints.
</P>
<P>
In response to these complaints, China's local legislatures --
such as the Standing Committee of the People's Congress of dozens
of cities including Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang
Province -- issued the ban on firecrackers.
</P>
<P>
Authorities say the ban has resulted in fewer fires and less
pollution.
</P>
<P>
However, many people believe festivals are incomplete without
the traditional firecrackers.
</P>
<P>
"Without the deafening sound of firecrackers, we have a feeling
of emptiness, and it's not like festivals at all," said one young
man.

<HEADLINE> Latin American Economic News Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are the
major economic news briefs from Latin American countries over the
past few days.
</P>
<P>
SANTIAGO -- Chilean textile exports amounted to 208.6 million
U.S. dollars in 1997, a 12 percent increase over the previous
year, according to Chilean Textile Institute statistics.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur was the main market for Chilean textile products,
concentrating 38 percent of the remittances, against 31 percent in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chilean textile imports amounted to 999.143 million
dollars, a figure representing a 1.6 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- The Argentine industrial output grew 6.9
percent last January over the same month of 1997, according to
Latin American Economic Investigations Federation estimates.
</P>
<P>
This was attributed mainly to the motor vehicle industry's good
performance, of which the January production registered a 30.9
percent increase over the same month of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The federation acknowledged that there was a 9.1 percent drop
compared to last December.
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- Brazilian exports to Asia dropped 19.7 percent in
January compared to the same month of 1996, according to Brazilian
Foreign Trade Minister Mauricio Cortes.
</P>
<P>
The exports reduction cannot be automatically attributed to the
financial crisis there, since some of the Brazilian products
exported to Asian countries had some influence on the prices drop
in the international markets.
</P>
<P>
PANAMA CITY -- Panama has become Hong Kong's second most
important market in Latin America after Brazil, the Hong Kong
Trade Development Council said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong sold 1.2 billion dollars worth of goods to Panama and
the Colon Duty-Free Zone in 1997, a 26 percent increase over 1996,
while total Hong Kong exports to Latin America was 5 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
MEXICO CITY -- Mexico replaced Japan for the first time as the
second market for United States exports by acquiring goods worth
more than 71 billion dollars in 1997, announced the United States
Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, Mexico imported
71.378 billion dollars worth of U.S. goods and services last
year. U.S. exports to Japan in the year was 65.673 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Silkworm Technician Revered by Village Peasants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- For hundreds of years,
peasants in Hushan village in southwest China carried sacrifices
to the temples during the silkworm-breeding seasons and paid their
respects to their god.
</P>
<P>
They now frequent the residence of Wan Shude, a local
agricultural technician, who has helped more than a few peasants
make a fortune by providing information and technical assistance
concerning silkworm-breeding.
</P>
<P>
The silkworm seeds supplied by Wan have brought good luck to
the villagers for five consecutive years, As one local peasant put
it, "Wan Shude is more reliable than the god."
</P>
<P>
More than 75 percent of the villagers were still living below
the state-set poverty line in Hushan (Qianjiang County, Chongqing)
in 1994 because of historical and geographical reasons.
</P>
<P>
Under the state's call for enriching the peasantry through
science and technology, Wan, a self-taught technician, began to
teach peasants advanced techniques for breeding silkworms by
reading and learning from newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
Wan also instructed local peasants to apply advanced skills to
growing rice, improving the village's rice production from 3,000
kilograms (kg) per hectare to 7,500 kg per hectare.
</P>
<P>
One village head said that the silkworm seeds cultivated by Wan
were designated by the local government as the sole seeds to be
used by area peasants, which has helped them reap an annual income
of 130,000 yuan (15,600 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Qianjiang County now has 76 technicians like Wan who occupy an
almost holy position in the hearts of local people.

LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- West Ham striker Samassi Abou
has been fined 1,000 poinds and given an extra ban by the Football
Association for his altercation with referee David Elleray last

</P>
<P>
The French star was sent off after fouling Tottenham defender
Ramon Vega in the January 17 loss at White Hart Lane.
</P>
<P>
Abou squared up to the official, clearly laying his hands upon
Elleray before going down the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
The striker, signed from Cannes, was given a three-match ban
for violent conduct and also handed a misconduct rap.
</P>
<P>
But on Thursday the FA announced that he had been handed an
extra one-match suspension, starting immediately.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Dismisses Single Currency for Mercosur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Foreign
Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia considers premature the adoption of
a single currency for all the Southern Common Market (Mercosur)
countries.
</P>
<P>
"The adoption of a single currency would crown the integration
process, and we are still very distant from it," said Lampreia,
quoted Thursday by the "Jornal Comercio" newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia said that before the launching of a single currency,
the Mercosur countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay)
need to complete integration in several sectors, including
legislation, for which negotiations are in process.
</P>
<P>
Argentine President Carlos Menem proposed last year the
creation of a single currency for Mercosur. He will repeat the
proposal during the next meeting of the bloc scheduled for late
June in Ushuia, Argentina.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan-Nepalese Ties to Be Further Strengthened: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Nepalese Crown
Prince said Thursday night that the relations between Pakistan and
Nepal will further enhance with the expansion of SAARC (South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) role.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the banquet hosted in his honor by Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif, Dipendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev said that as SAARC
members, "We have been encouraged by SAARC's concerted efforts to
tackle common problems of the region."
</P>
<P>
Alleviation of poverty, expansion of regional trade and
protection of the environment have rightly been accorded high
priority in the SAARC agenda, the Crown Prince said.
</P>
<P>
"Nepal was watching with keen interest the progress Pakistan has
made in various fields in recent years," he said, adding that
this visit will prove an educational exercise enhancing his
knowledge and understanding of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the visit will also contribute towards
further promoting mutual goodwill and strengthening the existing
friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Nepal and Pakistan have commonality of interests and
challenges, said the Crown Prince. "We understand and appreciate
each other's aspirations," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said both the countries also share many of the
socio-economic problems while striving to raise the quality of
life of people. For that reason, the two countries can learn from
each other's experiences in addressing the respective problems.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Pakistani entrepreneurs have shown interests in
joint ventures in Nepal. Two potential areas which readily come to
mind for such investments in Nepal are water resources and
tourism, he added.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Companies Flock to U.S. Capital Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 19 (Xinhua) -- More non-U.S. companies are
trading their stocks in U.S. markets through the American
Depositary Receipt (ADR) process, the U.S. Conference Board has
found.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the securities of an estimated 1,400
foreign companies from over 44 countries were traded in U.S.
public equity markets, the board said in a report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The companies are willing to put themselves under U.S.
reporting requirements in order to participate in the vast and
liquid U.S. markets, the board said.
</P>
<P>
The number of these companies are on the rise partly because
they want "to improve their image, marketability and even their
credit ratings" through exposure in U.S. markets, it added.
</P>
<P>
The board said global equity markets are dominated by U.S.
institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
U.S. investment in the equities of foreign corporations more
than quadrupled from 91.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1988 to 397.7
billion dollars in 1996 and 423.5 billion dollars in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
Besides targeting equities of Western European corporations,
U.S. investment has risen in Asian markets, specially in Japan
from 1988 to 1996.

<HEADLINE> France Supports Turkey's Bid for Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said Thursday that France supports Turkey's application for
European Union (EU) membership but called on Ankara to be patient
in the slow process for its integration with Europe.
</P>
<P>
In his toast at the state banquet in honor of Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel, Chirac asked Turkey to attend the session of the
European Conference, the enlarged political forum of the EU, which
will be held in London on March 12.
</P>
<P>
"The European Conference is the carrier of a dynamic and will
be the framework in which the architecture of Europe of tomorrow
will be defined," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Turkey cut its political dialogue with the EU after the EU
summit held on December 13 in Luxembourg decided to exclude Turkey
from the first wave of talks for admission of new EU members.
</P>
<P>
France, together with Britain, the Netherlands and Italy, then
expressed regret over the EU decision to exclude Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also cautioned Turkey that its war with Kurdish rebels
is making the country pay a high price in its international image.
</P>
<P>
"We are following with close attention the progress in building
democracy that is accomplished by your country, while in the
meantime measuring fully the price that Turkey is paying in its
fight against terrorism," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Demirel, who is the first Turkish head of state to visit France
in 30 years, said that the EU should hold no prejudice against
Turkey and instead treat it on an equal stand with 11 other
candidate countries for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey will maintain its commitment to the ideal of an
integrated and democratic Europe. We would like to hope that the
EU will do the same in the same spirit," said Demirel.
</P>
<P>
He said the objective of Turkey is to "fully respect democracy,
the secularism, and human rights" while strengthening and
developing its economy and ensuring social prosperity.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Businesses Post Record Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Canadian businesses rode the
coattails of the healthy North American economy to post a record
111.0 billion dollars (76.6 billion U.S. dollars) in operating
profits last year, Statistisc Canada reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
These profit levels were well above the 95.7 billion dollars
earned in 1996, the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
"Profits improved steadily in all quarters of 1997 and the
gains were widespread, with 22 of the 30 industry groups
bolstering profits in 1997," it noted.
</P>
<P>
Canadian banks once again played a major role in the profit
growth, seeing profits jump 32.9 percent to 15.7 billion dollars
for the year.
</P>
<P>
The transportation services industry was another big winner,
with profits up 80.0 percent to 3.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Motor vehicle, petroleum and natural gas, and electrical and
electronic industries also posted healthy profits throughout the
year of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Canada's wood and paper industry suffered a major decline
in operating profits. The Asian economic downturn was a major
contributor to this recent slump, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Drop NATO Cost Estimate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A new study by the U.S.
Defense Department soon to be sent to Congress dramatically
reduces earlier estimates of the cost for the expansion of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a news report said.
</P>
<P>
Defense News, a weekly magazine published in the U.S., said in
its February 16-22 edition that the Pentagon's report concurs with
NATO's finding that admitting Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic will need 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The report, still in draft form, was designed to explain the
differences in assumptions underlying the Pentagon's original cost
estimate of up to 9 billion U.S. dollars and that of NATO, U.S.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate will start a detailed debate on the alliance's
expansion later this month and is expected to vote in March on
ratification.
</P>
<P>
Under NATO's founding treaty, all 16 parliaments of the NATO
members must ratify the enlargement plan which was made last year.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon's report is scheduled to go to Congress this week
or early next week, Defense News quoted U.S. officials as saying.
Its aim is to update the Pentagon's original study in February
1997.
</P>
<P>
That study shows that to accept four new members into NATO, the
U.S. would need to pay about 2 billion U.S. dollars into NATO's
infrastructure fund while the other 15 allies would need to
contribute about 7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the original study also found that the European
allies would be required to spend another 12 billion U.S. dollars
to improve their own military capabilities.
</P>
<P>
But NATO issued a report in November last year, saying that a
sum of 1.5 billion U.S. dollars is enough for NATO's commonly
funded budget to finance the cost of accepting three new members.
</P>
<P>
However, the study has been widely criticized as failing to
adequately account for the decrepit state of militaries in the
three countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Viable economic
alternatives to cultivating and trafficking illicit drugs must be
created, Executive Director of the Office for Drug Control and
Crime Prevention Pino Arlacchi told the United Nations Commission
for Social Development Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Arlacchi said his office was striving to eliminate illicit crop
cultivation over the next 10 years, but it counted on the active
support of donors for the alternative forms of development.
</P>
<P>
Another key factor in the fight against drugs, he added, was
convincing the world community that the problem could be solved.
The final goal of anti-drug efforts should be eliminating the
problem, not coexisting with it.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly's special session on international drug
control, scheduled for June, would start the real war against
drugs and convince nations and people that there could be a
drug-free world. That session would be called upon to adopt a
declaration on the guiding principles of demand reduction, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The international community had instruments to address the drug
problem, he noted. The drug control treaties had yielded positive
results. On the eve of the 21st century, the international
community must define the legacy it wished to pass on to the next
generation in the field of drug control, crime prevention and
criminal justice.

DAMASCUS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of
Syria and Iran Thursday expressed welcome to U.N. chief Kofi
Annan's upcoming visit to Iraq, hoping it will successfully defuse
Iraq-U.N. crisis over arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation between Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi to his Syrian counterpart Farouq al-Sharaa, the two
expressed the hope that Annan's visit can avert a possible
U.S. military strike against Iraq and spare Iraqi people further
sufferings.
</P>
<P>
Thus the security and stability in the region can be
maintained, the ministers said.
</P>
<P>
They also called on Iraq to comply with the U.N. Security
Council resolutions, according to sources of Syrian Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that leaders of the two countries will make more
efforts and increase consultations over the situation in the
region for the benefit of peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Annan, backed by the five permanent members of Security
Council, is due in Baghdad on Friday to persuade the Iraqi
leadership to open up all suspected sites to U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has geared up military buildup in the Gulf region in
preparation for a strike if Iraq continues barring U.N. arms
inspectors from entering presidential sites.
