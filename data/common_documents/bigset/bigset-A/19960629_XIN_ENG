<HEADLINE> Jiang Holds Talks with Norwegian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSLO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland agreed today to
push forward bilateral cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Jiang said that relations between China and
Norway, one of the first Western countries to establish diplomatic
ties with the People's Republic of China, have been going well
over the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past few years, political contacts and
exchanges between the two sides have increased remarkably while
economic and scientific cooperation has expanded steadily.
</P>
<P>
"We regard highly the positive attitude of the Norwegian
government, and the prime minister in particular, to the
development of bilateral relations," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China attaches importance to developing relations with Norway,
he said. "China and Norway have no conflict of fundamental
interests and have common or similar positions on many major
international issues."
</P>
<P>
Speaking about economic cooperation, the Chinese president said
that the two economies are highly complementary and have much
potential to be tapped.
</P>
<P>
As the world moves toward multipolarity, strengthening
bilateral friendly and cooperative relations not only conforms
with the common interest of China and Norway, but is also in line
with the general trend of increasing cooperation between Asia and
Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready, together with the Norwegian side, to further
enhance bilateral political contacts, open up new areas in trade
and economic cooperation, and expand exchanges in science,
technology and culture on the basis of mutual respect, equality,
mutual benefit, and seeking common ground while shelving
differences, " he said.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Brundtland agreed with Jiang that the two
countries have long-standing and extensive cooperation and
relations, and that trade and economic cooperation in the past few
years have injected fresh vitality into bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
She said that Norway hopes to cooperate with China in energy,
environmental protection and infrastructure development as Norway
possesses advanced technology in these domains which can be
transferred to China.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Jiang also briefed Brundtland on economic,
cultural and religious developments in Tibet and reaffirmed
China's position on the issue of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Dalai Lama is a political fugitive who
has for many years conducted activities that attempt to split the
motherland and sabotage national unity.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's policy toward the Dalai Lama has been
consistent and clear-cut: it will hold negotiations with him at
any time on condition that he gives up his stand of "independent
Tibet" and stops splittist activities, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Norway will guard against the
Dalai's attempt to seek international support for his splittist
activities and that the friendly relations between China and
Norway will not be disrupted or undermined by the Dalai clique.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who arrived here Thursday for a three-day official
visit, has met with Norwegian King Harald V, Parliament President
Kirsti Kolle Grondahl and local business leaders.

national savings too low, unemployment is still unacceptable high
in many countries, their economies "are not yet as resilient and
adaptable to changes as they should be," the Declaration said.
</P>
<P>
It also noted:"Outside the G-7 sphere, economic prospects also
look very encouraging. Emerging economies are experiencing robust
growth. Sound macroeconomic policies and progress toward
market-based institutions have contributed to improving economic
performance in many developing countries and countries in
transition."
</P>
<P>
The G-7 leaders expressed their welcome for the broad
movements in the major currencies since April 1995, because of
"these are positive and promising developments, and have helped to
improve the conditions for sustained growth across the G-7."
</P>
<P>
They also endorsed the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the
World Bank and other international bodies concerned for for their
further enhancing of market monitoring and surveillance and the
adoption of strong prudential standards in emerging economies and
increasing cooperation with their supervisory authorities.
</P>
<P>
The seven leaders also welcomed the agreement reached on a
framework for doubling the resources from currently available 25
billion U.S. dollars to 50 billion dollars to the IMF under the

<P>
HANOI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today met
with Vietnamese Communist Party (CPV) General Secretary Do Muoi
over bilateral relations and international issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li Peng, who is also a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), said cooperation
between the two countries has greatly expanded in recent years in
various fields including politics, economy and culture.
</P>
<P>
Leading a CPC delegation, Li is here to attend the Eighth
National Congress of the CPV, which opens Friday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee
Jiang Zemin's Vietnam visit in November 1994 and Muoi's China
visit a year later have made significant contributions to further
consolidating and developing the friendly cooperation between the
two parties and two countries.
</P>
<P>
The visits have brought the Sino-Vietnamese relations into a
new era, he added.
</P>
<P>
China highly values the grand achievements made in Vietnam's
comprehensive renovation and socialist construction over the past
decade, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He described such achievements as a result of integrating the
fundamental tenets of Marxism with the specific national
conditions and a development of Ho Chi Minh's Thought.
</P>
<P>
He expressed appreciation over the successes Vietnam has
achieved by adhering to socialism and upholding the leadership of
the Communist Party of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
China and Vietnam, both developing countries with identical
social systems, are now seeking a development path suitable to
their respective conditions, said the premier.
</P>
<P>
He said that further strengthening cooperation between the two
countries and promoting regional peace and development are in
their common interests, as their economic construction with
socialist orientation needs a peaceful and stable external
environment.
</P>
<P>
Expressing sincere gratitude for the presence of Li's
delegation at the congress, Muoi said the CPV and the Vietnamese
people will never forget the great support and assistance given to
them by the CPC and the Chinese people in their revolutionary
struggle in the past.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Li Peng and his delegation have come to attend
the CPV national congress shows the "comradely and brotherly" ties
between the two parties and the two peoples, marking a milestone
and a new level in the development of the relations of the two
parties, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed sincere hope that the friendship between the two
parties, two countries and two peoples will be passed on from
generation to generation.

and Li Shuzheng, and CPV Politburo member and Prime Minister Vo
Van Kiet, and Politburo member and Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh

<HEADLINE> G-7 Summit Endorses Mutually Beneficial Growth of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lyon (France), June 28 (Xinhua) --The 22nd Summit of the G-7
industrial nations adopted an "Economic Declaration" here this
afternoon, calling for enhancing strong and mutually beneficial
growth of trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
The 17-page document said expanding trade and investment has
led to marked increases in global wealth and prosperity and should
continue to play this role in the future. "Growth in trade and
investment will be sustainable and therefore most beneficial to
all if conducted within a strong multilateral framework of rules,"
it stressed.
</P>
<P>
As an important step, the industrial nations within the
Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have
been seeking for a multilateral agreement on investment which
would provide high standards of investment protection and
liberalization for settling disputes and are expected to complete
the negotiations by June 1997, the Declaration said.
</P>
<P>
"We reaffirm the central role of the World Trade Organization
(WTO) and the preeminence of multilateral rules, which should
serve as the framework for regional initiative. We reaffirm our
commitment to working to strengthen the confidence in and
credibility of the multilateral trading system by avoiding taking
trade and investment measures that wold be in contradiction with
WTO rules and OECD codes, and by using and complying with any
applicable provisions for consultation and dispute settlement when
differences arise," the Declaration stressed. The para is
apparently referred and directed to the U.S. frequent threat of
using unlateral sanctions in settling disputes with other
countries.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 leaders' declaration declined to mention China's
admition to the WTO, but stating "In accordance with the rules of
WTO and on basis of significant liberalization commitments, we
support the accession of new members to the WTO."
</P>
<P>
About enhancing approach to employment problems, the G-7
leaders welcomed the conclusions reached by the Ministerial
Conference on Employment in Lille and agreed to pursue policies
that promote a sound basic education, prevent and fight against
social exclusion, carry out practical reforms aimed at achieving a
high level of employment and widely-shared prosperity, facilitate
the dissemination, notably in the direction of small and
medium-sized businesses.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions to be Reimposed Unless Karadzic Quits: Bildt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- International envoy Carl Bildt
today threatened to reimpose sanctions on Belgrade or the Bosnian
Serbs if Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who has been
indicted for war crimes, did not resign by July 1.
</P>
<P>
"Karadzic has to step down by July 1 or after that sanctions
will be reimposed against Republika Srpska (the Bosnian Serb
entity) or the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or against both",
Bildt's spokesman Colum Murphy told a briefing here.
</P>
<P>
"We will use any weapons at our disposal" after the July 1
deadline, Murphy stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said it had been made very clear to Yugoslav president
Slobodan Milosevic that sanctions would be "triggered most
speedily" unless he used his influence to convince Karadzic to
resign from public office.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic said Thursday he would resign after the Bosnian
elections in September and would not take part in the polls on
condition that the international community ensure the security of
the Bosnian Serb entity as a fully sovereign state within Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"There is no condition of Dr. Karadzic that we accept", Murphy
said, noting that Karadzic's demand had already been included in
the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Deputies from the Serb Democratic Party (SDS), led by Karadzic,
are holding a meeting in the Serb stronghold of Pale over whether
to name Karadzic as a candidate in the first post-war elections in
Bosnia scheduled for September 14.
</P>
<P>
The SDS, the ruling party in the Serb-held area in Bosnia, is
also expected to draw up a list of candidates in the next couple
of days.

<HEADLINE> Latin American, Caribbean Economies Lag Asian Tigers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Latin American economies are
lagging behind the Asian "tiger" economies and should improve the
competitiveness of their exports by speeding up technological
development and specialization, the Economic Commission for Latin
America and the Caribbean (CEPAL) said today.
</P>
<P>
Investment in technology in Latin American and Caribbean
countries is much lower than in Asian countries such as South
Korea, Singapore, China and Indonesia, and researchers don't have
enough money or support, CEPAL said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The slower pace of technological specialization of exports in
the region compared with its Asian competitors is caused by
several factors, including poor public policy toward technological
development, poor investment in research and development and
negligible spending on innovation by private enterprises, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Most Latin American countries increased their exports
considerably at the beginning of the 1990s, but progress toward
boosting exports of products with higher added value has been very
limited.
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem lies in poorly defined policy objectives,
failure to prioritize technological development and poor
development and education of the workforce, said the report.

<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Hanhai Art Auction
Corporation, one of the largest in China, put 356 modern Chinese
paintings and calligraphy on the auction block, selling 332 for
some 25.3 million yuan, today.
</P>
<P>
The Hanhai Spring Auction today sold 93 percent of its modern
Chinese paintings and calligraphy.
</P>
<P>
The most expensive piece was a picture of Su Dongpo, the
prominent Song Dynasty (960-1279) poet, painted by Zhang Daqian, a
well-known contemporary Chinese painter, which sold for 655,000
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Qin Gong, Hanhai's manager, attributed the brisk business to
strict appraisals of artworks and the efforts made to satisfy
collectors' appetites.
</P>
<P>
"We have tried to select some excellent works done by ordinary
painters and artworks of delicacy and lovely color, which are
welcome in the present market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some observers noted that some of the artworks painted by
famous painters and appraised at a high price failed to sell,
including one made by Zhang Daqian.
</P>
<P>
The auction will end on Sunday, auctioning 1,200 artworks
appraised at a total of 80 million yuan, which fall into five
categories: modern Chinese paintings and calligraphy, ancient
Chinese painting and calligraphy, curios, rare books, and
treasures of the study.

MOSCOW, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A bomb explosion on a bus killed 10
people and wounded more than 20 in the Russian North Caucasus this
morning, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The blast occurred as the bus was en route from Nalchik,

capital of North Ossetia, which lies just west of war-torn
Chechnya.

home-made explosive device had detonated in the bus, which arrived
in Nalchik from the spa town of Mineralniye Vody in the Stavropol
region.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin denounced the explosion as a "terrorist
act" and sent a telegram of condolences to the head of the
republic of Kabardino-Balkaria.
</P>
<P>
"With a feeling of deep sorrow I have learned about the
terrorist act which led to the loss of life," the telegram said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Calls for Directing Peace Efforts at Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has called on all those
interested in assisting toward a solution of the Cyprus problem
to concentrate their efforts on convincing Turkey to abandon its
intransigent position.
</P>
<P>
The call was made today by government spokesman Yiannakis
Cassoulides at his daily press briefing following a meeting
between U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister
John Major on the sidelines of the Group 7 summit in France.
</P>
<P>
According to a White House statement, Clinton and Major
"touched on Cyprus and compared the conversations they had with
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides over the last weeks".
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that the U.S. president and the British
premier agreed they needed to coordinate efforts, not undertake
separate initiatives but try to combine efforts in seeking to
secure a settlement in Cyprus over the next year or so.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides described the statement as a "natural development
which is in line with previous statements on the need for
cooperation and coordination".
</P>
<P>
Commenting on statement of Clinton and Major that they would
seek a solution to the Cyprus problem "over the next year or so,"
the spokesman said the Cyprus government believes "a Cyprus
settlement is a matter of urgency."
</P>
<P>
He noted that a solution is preferable "before the start of
Cyprus-EU accession talks to allow the Turkish Cypriot community
to participate in the talks."
</P>
<P>
The EU has decided that the EU-Cyprus accession talks will
start six month after the EU Intergovernmental Conference.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides also stressed the need to reach common ground
between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides before the direct
talks. He said noting that this was pointed out in the latest
U.N. Secretary-General's report on his mission of good offices, as
well as in the Security Council's draft resolution for the renewal
of the mandate of the U.N. Peace-Keeping Force on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and
Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
seized the northern third of the island following a short-lived
Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Contract On Large-Capacity Power Generators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China's largest publically-held
power company, Huaneng Power International, Inc., signed a
273.64-million-US-dollar contract with the US's GE, and Babcok &AMP;
Wilcox and Black &AMP; Veatch, today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
This is the second import project for Huaneng this month, after
it signed a 217-million-US-dollar deal for two large-capacity
generators with Siemens and Mitsui Babcock on June 11.
</P>
<P>
The two 350-megawatt coal-fired generators will be installed in
the Huaneng Nantong Power Plant, and go operational in
1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility rearch report of the project was approved by the
State Council on March 28.
</P>
<P>
The import program will use foreign loans, 85 percent of which
will be in American export credits and the rest in commercial
loans. The credits have an annual interest rate of 6.6 percent,
and payment term of 16 years.
</P>
<P>
Huaneng Nantong is one of the largest power plants of Jiangsu
Province in East China and has two 350-megawatt generators that
went operational in 1989 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the plant had generated energy totaling 24
billion kilowatt-hours, largely easing the bottleneck in the
province's energy supply.
</P>
<P>
Ye Qing, vice-minister of the State Planning Commission, and
Shi Dazhen, minister of the power industry, attended the signing
ceremony this afternoon.

MOSCOW, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Aleksandr Lebed, Russian President
Boris Yeltsin's new national security aide, today urged Russia to
explore closer cooperation with the Asian and Pacific countries,
including China.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, who was appointed secretary of the Security Council of

</P>
<P>
Lebed said that obviously Russia can hardly find a true
strategic partner in Europe though efforts to that end should
continue.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that Russia should instead strengthen its trade,
production, scientific, military, political and cultural ties with
the Asian and Pacific countries.
</P>
<P>
Developing ties with the Asia-Pacific region is not only a
political need for Russia's security strategy, he added, it is an
economic necessity as well.
</P>
<P>
Cooperating with the Asian and Pacific countries will enable
Russia to pursue an independent and effective foreign policy in
dealing with any other geopolitical systems, Lebed added.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian troops today began their
long-promised pullout from Chechnya with the 245th mechanized
infantry regiment in the lead.
</P>
<P>
The regiment's withdrawal was the first under a peace plan
signed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Chechen separatist
leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev in Moscow on May 27.
</P>
<P>
However, skirmishes between Russian troops and Chechen
separatists have continued.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Yeltsin ordered all Russian troops to withdraw from
the rebel republic before September this year.
</P>
<P>
Vyacheslav Tikhomirov, commander of Russian army in Chechnya,
told the Interfax News Agency that the pullout showed the goodwill
and determination of the Russian government to bring about peace
in Chechnya. Moscow has said there are about 48,000 Russian troops
in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The pullout is seen as a pre-election move by Yeltsin to show
voters he is taking decisive steps to end the 18-month-old
conflict which has killed about 30,000 people. Yeltsin faces
Communist rival Gennady Zyuganov in the second round of the
presidential election on July 3.

<HEADLINE> G-7 Summit Calls for New Global Partnership for Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lyon (France), June 28 (Xinhua) --The 22nd Summit of the G-7
most industrialized nations adopted an "Economic Declaration" here
today, calling for a new global partnership for development as a
major strategy entering the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The 17-page Declaration noticed, that due to sound domestic
policies and to an increasingly global economy, many developing
countries are experiencing robust growth, assisted by their
expanding involvement in international trade and capital inflows.
However, it also said, there is a growing divide between these
countries and those, mainly low income countries, which are
currently unable to benefit from these opportunities and are
falling further behind.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to overcome the economic globalization's negative
impact on some poor countries, this new partnership should set its
sights on enabling all developing countries, whatever their stage
of development, to "share and participate in the benefits of
globalization." The major objectives of the new partnership
include the reduction of poverty and social inequities, the
respect of internationally recognized labor standards, protection
of children, a strengthened civil society, protection of the
environment, improved health and education.
</P>
<P>
"The new development partnership should be mutually beneficial
and based on a spirit of solidarity and burden-sharing among all
those countries involved," the document claimed.
</P>
<P>
In line with the "new partnership", external financial support
would take into full account the differentiation between countries
in transition, emerging economies and the poorest countries, more
explicit priority would be given to "sustainable development and
the alleviation of poverty, more support for the establishment of
a dynamic and competitive private sector in developing countries
based on small and medium scale entreprises as well as using the
full range of policy instruments to help the Least and Less
Developed Countries integrate into the global economy.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 leaders agreed to request the Paris Club creditor
countries to consider poor nations' debt conversion schemes up to
20 percent instead of currently 10 percent of stocks of debts and
increased debt alleviation on a case by case basis.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- National Party (NP) members
of the government today vacated their offices in the
parliamentary complex on the eve of the NP's departure from it at
midnight on Sunday to become a fully fledged opposition party.
</P>
<P>
African National Congress (ANC) ministers and deputy ministers
replacing them are expected to move into their new offices next
week.
</P>
<P>
In the current ANC-led cabinet, there are six NP ministers and
three deputy ministers.
</P>
<P>
The NP, led by outgoing deputy president f w De Klerk since
1989, has had a continuous presence in government since it first
came into power on May 26, 1948.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, who has been in government himself since April 3,
1978, announced on May 9 that his party would quit the government
of national unity (gnu), just one day after the adoption of the
new constitution by the constitutional assembly.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said the main reason for NP leaving the gnu, in which
the NP spent just over two years with the ANC, is that the new
constitution does not allow for formal power sharing in the
executive branch of the government in the future.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Urges Norwegian Businessmen to Expand Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSLO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here today that he hoped Norwegian businessmen will
"improve their competitiveness in the Chinese market and open up
still more areas of cooperation with a far-reaching and strategic
vision."
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Norwegian industrial and business leaders,
Jiang extended welcome to Norwegian economic and trade cooperation
with Chinese partners.
</P>
<P>
"Direct contacts between the business communities will offer
you more opportunities for cooperation and push ahead
Sino-Norwegian economic cooperation and trade," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He outlined China's reform, process of opening to the outside
world and economic development, which he said will "surely expand
the scope of economic and technological cooperation between China
and the rest of the world, including Norway, and provide a huge
market and better terms of cooperation for overseas investors and
businessmen."
</P>
<P>
In the run-up to the end of this century, China will have an
accumulated import and export volume of more than 1.6 trillion
U.S. dollars, Jiang said. "Broader economic exchanges between
China and the rest of the world will undoubtedly serve the
country's economic development but also instill fresh vitality
into the world economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President said the business communities of China
and Norway enjoy an excellent cooperative relationship and the two
countries are highly complementary economically.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation in the future will expand from ship-building,
hydro-electric power and chemical industry to energy,
communications and infrastructure, which are sectors of priority,
he added.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Norwegian Minister of Trade and Shipping Grete
Knudsen introduced local business leaders to Jiang. She said the
companies at the meeting represent the best of what Norway can
offer and illustrate the broad range of trade and economic
cooperation that exists between Norway and China.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have conducted excellent and remarkable
cooperation in the fields of maritime sector, energy and chemical
industry, Knudsen said, adding there is, however, still much
potential to be tapped in economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian minister also said her country knows China's
economic strength and strongly supports China's membership in the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions and the
Confederation of Norwegian Business and Industry "are now looking
forward to developing closer contacts with their Chinese sister
organizations, thereby supplementing and enhancing the good
relations established between Norwegian companies and their
Chinese counterparts," She added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President arrived here Thursday for a three-day
state visit, the first such visit ever by a Chinese president.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Upholds Existence of UN Peacekeeping Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi,
stressed here today an adherence to the existence of U.N.
peacekeeping force in south Lebanon while meeting a special envoy
of U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his meeting with the Lebanese president, Kufi
Anan, U.N. assistant secretary general for the peacekeeping
affairs, said, "President Hrawi expressed his adherence to an
extension of the UNIFIl's job, the necessity to activate its role
and not to reduce its number and otherwise the political and moral
position of the (U.N.) force will be negatively effected."
</P>
<P>
Anan said the talks dealt with the U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) and a renewal of its term which expires in the
end of July.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council considers the peacekeeping force's
existence in south Lebanon in every six months, and in July 1995
it adopted a decision to decrease the force's strength by 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
In an addition to the general situation in the region and the
peace process in light of the changes which took place recently,
"we also discussed a fear of the terrorism in the region and the
world," Anan added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it would be difficult for the U.N. Security
Council to increase the number of the peacekeeping force after the
last year's reduction.
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese government enquired and demanded the increase
after the recent reduction by 10 percent, I will bring this
demand to New York," he said. "But I should be frank that in view
of the U.N.'s financial condition, this is difficult."
</P>
<P>
He noted that he did not see an "obstacle" before the
extension of the multinational force's term.
</P>
<P>
Anan confirmed that there were "some tensions" between the
peacekeeping forces and anti-Israeli guerrillas of the Lebanese
resistance movement, "but the relation is good on the whole."
</P>
<P>
"We have encountered some problems but the two sides
understand that either of them has its own duty," the U.N.
official said, underlining a support which the Lebanese
government and the Lebanese people accord to the U.N. force in the
south.
</P>
<P>
Anan held meetings Thursday with Lebanese House Speaker Nabih
Berri, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and other government ministers
and Army Commander Major General Emil Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy inspected the headquarters of the U.N.
peacekeeping force at the south Lebanese coastal town of Nagura
this afternoon and had meetings with its high-ranking officers.
</P>
<P>
The UNIFIL, comprising contingents from Fiji, Finland, France,
Ghana, Ireland, Italy, Nepal, Norway and Poland, was set up in
1978 to restore the Beirut government's authority over the south
of the country occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment, some 200 of its soldiers have been
killed in exchanges of fire between the Israeli forces and its
client militia on one side, and Lebanese and Palestinian
guerrillas on the other.

<HEADLINE> UK World Trade Deficit Reaches 1.3bn Pounds in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 28 (xinhua) -- Britain's global trade deficit
unexpectedly widened in April to 1.32 billion pounds (2.03 billion
US dollars), almost double the previous month's deficit of 765
million pounds (1.18 billion US dollars), according to the latest
figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
Stripping out oil and erratic items such as precious stones and
aircraft, the underlying deficit in visible trade rose to 1.7
billion pounds (2.62 billion US dollars) from 1.5 billion pounds
(2.31 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The ONS figures show that total exports rose 100 million pounds
(154 million US dollars) to 13.9 billion pounds (21.41 billion US
dollars), with a 2.5 percent fall in exports to the European Union
(EU) offset by a four percent rise in non-EU exports.
</P>
<P>
The beef export ban took effect from April and the ONS said
that the ban partially accounted for the decline in EU exports.
</P>
<P>
The statistics office said that the deficit trend was broadly
flat with both imports and exports rising. However, measured on a
three-monthly basis, and excluding oil and erratics, the data
pointed to a longer-term deterioration.
</P>
<P>
In the three months to April, the deficit was five billion
pounds (7.7 billion US dollars), compared with 4.7 billion pounds
(7.24 billion US dollars) in the previous three months, and 3.7
billion pounds (5.7 billion US dollars) in the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Some economists fear that the trade deficit is set to widen
further in the next few months as consumer demand begins to suck
in imports.

<HEADLINE> Water Supply Cut Off in Angola's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Tap water supply in Angola's
capital has been cut off for a third day today, which has brought
about much inconvenience to the daily life of its residents.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that Luanda's running water supply has
been cut off this year. It was caused by a crack in the water
pipeline from Luanda Tap Water Plant to the city proper.
</P>
<P>
According to the plant's press office, the rush-repair work
has been underway since the water supply was discontinued on
Wednesday, but it did not disclose when the water supply will
become normal.
</P>
<P>
During March to April, water supply in the whole city had
been off for nearly one month.

<HEADLINE> G-7 Finance Ministers Say Intervention Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LYON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The finance ministers of the seven
Western industrialized powers said here today that government
interventions in exchange markets can be effective in certain
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
In a report on international monetary stability to the heads of
state and government of the G-7 meeting here, the finance
ministers said that ``intervention are more likely to be effective
when they are concerted and reflected a common assessment" of
Western nations.
</P>
<P>
"An important condition for success is the appropriate timing
of intervention," said the report.
</P>
<P>
It said that ``the most important foundation for exchange rate
stability is the maintenance of sound macroeconomic policies aimed
at achieving sustained non-inflationary growth and avoiding the
emergence of large external or internal imbalances."
</P>
<P>
It also pointed out that flexibility in exchange rates of major
currencies is "a basic feature of the system".
</P>
<P>
"The G-7 surveillance process provides a framework for
identifying and formulating appropriate responses to risks for our
economies and for the stability of the international financial and
monetary system,"said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that while the process of the globalization of
world economy moves forward, it is necessary to enhance
"cooperation across markets to strengthen supervision of
financial institutions."
</P>
<P>
While welcoming the efforts made by Western organizations in
launching such cooperations in the past few years, the ministers
said that ``the changes in the structure of global finance and the
emergence of new participants and markets require the supervisory
response, including international cooperation, to evolve
continually."
</P>
<P>
The ministers said that a complete and effective regulation and
control of the markets plus improved international cooperations
make up the essential elements for the maintenance of the
stability of the international financial and monetary system.
</P>
<P>
The report also called for the strengthening of "prudential
standards in, and supervisory cooperation with emerging markets",
the encouragement of private sector's efforts to enhance market
transparency, the improvement of "reporting and disclosure of
derivatives activities", and the enhancement of "cooperation
among exchanges".
</P>
<P>
Apparently referring to the exchange rates between the U.S.
dollar and other Western currencies, the ministers said that the
"orderly reversal" in key exchange rates since April 1995 is a
positive and promising development.

<HEADLINE> G-7 Leaders Voices Support for Russia's Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lyon (France), June 28 (Xinhua) --The on-going 22nd Summit of
the G-7 most rich countries today voiced their support for
Russia's political reform and its commitment to democracy.
</P>
<P>
The lengthy "Economic Communique" adopted by the G-7 leaders
also said:"Economic and political reforms are mutually reinforcing
and position Russia to play a more significant role in the global
economy.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 nations which include the United States, France,
Canada, Japan, Germany, Britain and Italy, also welcomed the
agreement between the Russian authorities and the International
Monetary Fund, saying that the agreement "testifies to Russia's
continued commitment to financial stabilization and economic
reforms."
</P>
<P>
"Russia's economic success and its integration in the world
economy depend on full implementation of its commitment," the
communique asserted.
</P>
<P>
The leaders once again expressed their welcome for the
agreement between Russia and the Paris Club on a comprehensive
medium-term rescheduling of Russia's external debt.
</P>
<P>
The communique welcomed the good economic results achieved by
many countries in transition which have undertaken macro-economic
stabilization and structural reform. Many countries, especially in
Central Europe, have pursued resolute stabilization and structural
reform programs and have achieved robust growth last year.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 leaders also backed the broadening and deepening of the
reform process for the United Nations system and urged greater
cooperation between UN agencies, the international financial
institutions and the WT0.
</P>
<P>
According to a series of recommendations put forward by the G-7
leaders, the three Secretariat responsible for development should
be merged under the authority of a single Under Secretary-General
and the Under Secretary-General should serve as Executive
Secretary of ECOSOC in order to enhance the Council's policy
formulation and coordinating role.

<HEADLINE> Maritime Transport Talks Suspended Till 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Participants to the negotiations on
liberalizing global shipping services market agreed two days
before a self-imposed deadline to suspend the talks till the year
2000, according to trade sources here Friday.
</P>
<P>
They agreed at a formal negotiating group meeting Friday that
the talks will be resumed on the basis of existing or improved
offers in the year 2000 when comprehensive negotiations on
services are scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The failure to reach a deal was unavoidable after the United
States walked away from the talks, reiterating on June 18 its
position not to submit a market opening offer for dissatisfaction
with offers tabled by others.
</P>
<P>
42 countries (with the European Union as one) took part in the
maritime transport services talks sponsered by the World Trade
Organization (WTO). 24 countries have so far put forward offers.
</P>
<P>
It was also decided at the Friday meeting that the participants
intending to make specific commitments as a result of the
negotiations will be given 30 days as of Friday to notify WTO and
make their decisions known to other members.
</P>
<P>
The maritime transport services talks began in April 1994,
aiming to lowering barriers and expanding trade in ocean shipping,
port use and port services -- market worth more than 100 billion
U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
It is among the unfinished work left over from the 1986-1993
Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks, along with the
negotiations on financial and telecom services.
</P>
<P>
Due to U.S. dissatisfaction with market opening offers from
other countries, only limited success were made in the talks on
financial and telecom services last year.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Approves Coalition Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
approved here today a 37-man cabinet list for the coalition
government between the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) and True
Path Party (DYP).
</P>
<P>
RP Chairman and Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan announced the
cabinet list after one-hour meeting with Demirel at the
presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan submitted the cabinet list to the president for the
approval after holding a two-hour-long talks with DYP leader and
former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller.
</P>
<P>
The two party leaders reached an agreement for the coalition
formation through four rounds of arduous and long talks in recent
days after Erbakan was assigned to form a government.
</P>
<P>
At last, Erbakan realized his wish for becoming prime minister
in Turkey, which he had cherished for dozens of years.
</P>
<P>
Ciller takes the post of deputy prime minister and foreign
minister, Mehmet Agar (DYP) serves as interior minister, Turhan
Tayan (DYP) works as national defense minister, and Abdullatif
Sener (RP) as finance minister.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan was born in Sinop province in northern Turkey, which
borders the Black Sea, on October 29, 1926 and graduated from
Istanbul Technical University in 1948. In 1972, Erbakan, chairman
of the then National Salvation Party, acted as deputy prime
minister in a coalition government with the People's Republic
Party (CHP). On July 19, 1983, he was elected RP chairman.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan is a father of three children and knows English and
German.
</P>
<P>
He was assigned by President Suleyman Demirel to form a
coalition on June 7 after Prime Minister and Motherland Party
(ANAP) Chairman Mesut Yilmaz submitted his resignation to Demirel
on June 6.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz resigned as the Turkish Constitutional Court announced
that the vote of confidence for the center-right coalition
government between the ANAP and the DYP was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for Yilmaz's resignation was that the struggle
between Yilmaz and Ciller remained more serious. Since the
coalition government was set up in March, Yilmaz and Ciller were
not in good cooperation, but have been fighting against each
other.

<TEXT>
<P>
Lyon (France), June 28 (Xinhua) --The leaders of the G-7 most
industrialized nations held a working session here this afternoon
with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Tchernomyrdine over a wide
range of issues.
</P>
<P>
It was revealed that the leaders of the G-7 richest nations
which include the United States, France, Japan, Germany, Canada,
Britain and Italy discussed with the Russian Prime Minister on
issues of the nuclear security, environmental protection, the UN
system reform, combat financial crime and other related
international problems.
</P>
<P>
The French Presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said it
was impossible to discuss these problems without the participation
of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Tchernomyrdine arrived here this afternoon to attend today's
meeting with the G-7 leaders in representing Russian President
Boris Yeltsin. The Russian President was invited to the political
consultations with the G-7 leaders since 1994. This year's absence
was apparently attributed to the second round presidential
elections which is set on July 3.
</P>
<P>
According to the arrangement, the Russian Prime Minister will
attend the welcoming dinner hosted by French President Jacques
Chirac this evening. This year's G-7 Summit opened by a working
dinner which was attended by the G-7 leaders and Jacques Santer,
the President of the European commission.
</P>
<P>
It was formally announced here today that the next G-7 Summit
will be held in Denver, Colorado state, next year.

<HEADLINE> No Nuclear Test Ban Pact Yet, Talks to Resume July 29 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Geneva-based Conference on
Disarmament missed a target date of Friday to reach a treaty on
nuclear test ban because participating nations are still widely
divided on some key issues.
</P>
<P>
A draft treaty, with key issues still unresolved, was put
forward Friday by the Dutch chairman of the negotiations Jaap
Ramaker, and will then go to capitals for further study,
negotiators said after the final meeting of the current
negotiating session Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
They also said that consultations would resume on July 29, as
the disarmament conference begins the third part of its 1996
session, to make the final decision or possible amendments to the
draft.
</P>
<P>
"There is no point in going on with the negotiations under
current circumstances," Ramaker told a news conference after the
meeting."No real movement were made during the past two week," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Several negotiators told reporters that although they regret
that no agreement has been reached on Friday, they are still
hopeful that a treaty could be ready for signing by the beginning
of the 51st session of UN General Assembly in September.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators here had been optimistic until last week that they
could reach consensus on a draft treaty.
</P>
<P>
But those hopes faded when India announced last Thursday that
it would not sign the treaty in its present form because it did
not explicitly call for the destruction of existing nuclear
weapons within a given time period and because it would require
India, Pakistan and Israel -- the three so-called nuclear
"threshold states" -- to sign and ratify the pact before it could
go into force.
</P>
<P>
India ambassador in Geneva reinterated Friday that India will
not sign the treaty unless its concerns are taken on board.
</P>
<P>
The issue of entry into force has divided the United States
from other declared nuclear weapons states which believe that the
treaty must be accepted by the "threshold states" for it to have
any important meaning.
</P>
<P>
The United States have been holding out for a less-demanding
set of requirement to prevent any move by a single nation to
indefinitely block the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Another sticking point of the negotiations so far is on-site
inspection, Western countries led by the United States want a
mechanism which could quickly trigger such a inspection to
investigate possible treaty violations, for example by the
approval of a simple majority in the executive committee of the
future treaty organization.
</P>
<P>
Other countries, particularly Russia, China and some other
nations in the developing world, demand a two-third majority to
approve on-site inspections. They stress that the on-site
inspection is politically highly sensitive and only a more
cautious mechanism can prevent possible abuses.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The National Economic
Development and Labour Council (NEDLAC) of South Africa today
ratified four agreements and agreed to follow up proposals on
NEDLAC's future agenda, processes and structure.
</P>
<P>
At the NEDLAC's Executive Council's quarterly meeting held in
Johannesburg, amendments to the Labour Relations Act and the
Insolvency Act were approved, and the council gave its support
for the passage of the small business bill to parliament, and the
framework for a social clause.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after the meeting, Executive Director
Jayendra Naidoo said the agreements tabled for approval by the
Executive Council showed that the NEDLAC process was maturing and
the process of negotiating difficult agreements was becoming more
focused, more efficient and more effective.
</P>
<P>
Naidoo said the Executive Council also mandated the Labour
Market Chamber to conclude NEDLAC's consideration of the green
paper on employment, and to oversee the drafting of an employment
standards bill. enditem

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Divisions Remain a Threat in Bosnia, UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 28 (Xinhua) - United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said ethnic divisions
between Serbs and Croats remains a major issue in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council, he said that the
peace agreement negotiated at Dayton of U.S. and signed in Paris
has achieved its immediate aim of stopping the conflict and
bloodshed in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
However, "fear and the obstruction of freedom of movement by
authorities at various levels, including the police, have deterred
refugees and displaced persons from returning to their homes," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the police forces continued to discriminate
against, harass and intimidate citizens who were not of their own
ethnicity, the efforts of the International Police Task Force
(IPTF) would have little chance of success.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Croats were blamed for
ignoring the Dayton accords while some Bosnian Moslem leaders also
seemed inclined to favor separatist trends, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The crucial question is whether the signatories to the
agreement remain committed to their undertakings, or whether one
or more continue to pursue the aim of separation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations in the Dayton peace accords fields an
international police force and is responsible for helping refugees
return through the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees offices.
</P>
<P>
He said that so far only 10,000 out of 2 million refugees and
displaced persons had returned to their homes, virtually all of
them to areas where their community is in the majority.

<HEADLINE> S.Leone's Mining policies To Be Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The civilian government of
Sierra Leone led by President Tejan Kabbah has set up two
committees to review all mining agreements and policies
established by the former military government.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing on Friday, S.Leonean Mineral Resources
Minister Prince Harding disclosed that agreements signed by the
Swiss run Sierra Leone Ore and Metal Company (SIEROMCO), the
United States owned Sierra Rutile and the British based Branch
Energy, an affiliate of the South African mercenary group,
Executive Outcomes are also being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
Both SIEROMCO and Sierra Rutile are inoperative after their
sites were attacked by rebels in January 1994 while Branch Energy
is involved in kimberlite mining in the diamond area of Kono in
the east.
</P>
<P>
The minsiter said that SIEROMCO has conducted an assessment
damage to the mine site after the rebel attack and ''all
indications are that the damage is not beyond repair. We are now
waiting for the damage to be quantified before the shareholders
will make a decision about its reopening.''
</P>
<P>
On Sierra Rutile, Harding said about 25,000,000 dollars are
needed for it to recommence operations which he forecast will be
in early 1997.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Number of Disabled Children up in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The number of disabled Iraqi
children hit 2 million whose ages range between one and six years,
according to a report jointly compiled by the commission of the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) here and the Iraqi Central
Agency for Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Citing the report in its recent issue, the local weekly
magazine Alf Baa said the number of disabled in Iraq went up and
the disabilities varied during the embargo the U.N. imposed on
Iraq in August 1990 for its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The number of the disabled children account for 10.6 percent of
Iraq's total population of 21.2 million, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The total number of the disabled worldwide is estimated at 550
million, of which 20 million are in the Arab world alone, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The figures increase by 8.5 million per year.
</P>
<P>
The magazine pointed out that the World Confederation of Labor
launched, in cooperation with the commission of the
U.N. Development Program here, a vocational training project for
the disabled in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A joint action document was worked out, which includes an
analysis of the vocational training system for the disabled. The
document is aimed at providing them with job opportunities and
proper employment.

LUANDA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The National Liberation Front of
Angola has expressed its opposition to the talks being held
here between the government and the former rebels UNITA
movement on the amendments of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued here today, the NLFA said it is not
suitable for the government and the UNITA to hold talks on the
amendments of the constitution in view of the formation of the
Joint Commitee of the Angolan Peace Process.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the NLFA opposes the talks because the
talks are being held only between representatives of the government
and the UNITA and attended by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
"Such a practice has trampled upon the sovereignty of
Angola," it said.
</P>
<P>
A conference of peace and national reconciliation should be
held so as to create necessary condtitions for the establishment
of a reliable and feasible government, it added.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the government and the UNITA started their
talks on the amendments of the constitution in Luanda this week.

<HEADLINE> UN Observers in Eastern Slavonia to be Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali recommended that the
mandate of the military observers in Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and
Western Sirmium of Croatia be extended 6 months to January 15,
1997.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council, he noted that
since the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern
Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) was established
last January, it has achieved significant progress in the
implementation of its mandate and contributed to the gradual
normalization of the relations between Croatia and Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"After five years of war and tension, there are signs of a new
spirit of cooperation between the parties," he said.
</P>
<P>
Though the demilitarization of the region has been completed
with relative ease, quantities of small arms and ammunition have
nevertheless been retained by people who are anxious about their
future security, he said.
</P>
<P>
While the mandate of the military observers who serve with
UNTAES will expire on July 30, the post-demilitarization period is
a critical time for UNTAES, with the region still tense and
subject to the possibility of infiltration, he said.
</P>
<P>
A continued presence of United Nations military observers will
enhance the ability of UNTAES to monitor the situation, to ensure
that demilitarization is and remains complete, to monitor any
infractions and to report on other developments relevant to the
maintenance of peace and security in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
On challenges awaiting UNTAES, he said that the return of
displaced persons is among the most daunting, another is to define
mechanisms and assurances to protect the cultural and social
identities and the heritage of national minorities in a
multiethnic society, and the financial situation of the region is
precarious.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Renews Mandate of UN Operation in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
voted on Friday to renew the U.N. Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus
(UNFICYP) until 31 December, 1996.
</P>
<P>
In making the decision, the Security Council reiterated its
concern that there has been no progress towards a final political
solution between the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The council, in a unanimously adopted resolution, called upon
the military authorities on both sides:
</P>
<P>
(a) To respect the integrity of the U.N. buffer zone, ensure
that on further incidents occur along the buffer zone, prevent
hostile actions, including live-fire against UNFICYP, grant
UNFICYP complete freedom of movement and extend their full
cooperation to UNFICYP;
</P>
<P>
(b) To enter immediately into discussions with UNFICYP, in line
with paragraph 3 of resolution 839 of 11 June 1993, with a view to
adopting reciprocal measures to prohibit along the cease-fire
lines live ammunition or weapons other than those which are
hand-held and to prohibit also the firing of weapons within sight
or hearing of the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
(c)To clear all minefields and booby-trapped areas inside the
buffer zone without further delay, as requested by UNFICYP;
</P>
<P>
(d) To cease military construction in the immediate vicinity of
the buffer zone;
</P>
<P>
(e) To enter immediately into intensive discussions with
UNFICYP with a view to extending the 1989 unmanning agreement to
cover all areas of the buffer zone where the two sides are in
close proximity to each other, on the basis of the updated
proposals submitted by the UNFICYP Force Commander in June 1996.

<HEADLINE> Development of Service Trade Urged in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's service trade should be
fully developed so that it can serve as good sources of foreign
exchange earning, a senior trade official said today.
</P>
<P>
Moses Adesina, Executive Director of the Nigerian Export
Promotion Council (NEPC), said that the service sector of the
country was currently insignificant although the country had
enormous potentials.
</P>
<P>
''The neglect of the sector has resulted in annual net
outpayment of about 3.4 billion US dollars for services between
1988 and 1992'', he said, quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The official identified the categories of services that could
be developed as road, rail and air and water transportation and
telecommunications, postal services and the mass media.
</P>
<P>
Another category of service, such as international shipping
and air travel, tourism, investment income consultancy and
management services could boost the country's foreign exchange
earning if properly developed, he said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Swiss Stock Exchange To Start Electronic Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland will undergo a
financial revolution in early August when the traditional floor
trading of Swiss stocks will be replaced by an electronic trading
system, local press reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
On August 2, all Swiss stocks will be quoted on the Electronic
Swiss Stock Exchange (BES), followed by all bonds two days later.
Swiss stock traders in Geneva, Zurich and Basel will be able to
work through computer terminals in their banks without coming to
the exchange.
</P>
<P>
The board of directors of the BES has fixed these two dates
following successful trials of the computerized system which
simulated an entire day's trading. A final test is planned for
June 29.
</P>
<P>
Since December 8, all foreign stocks, which represents 5
percent of all trade, have been quoted electronically in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said the project is aimed at enhancing the
international competitiveness of Switzerland as a key financial
centre for particularly international asset management. The
country now deals with some 40 percent of global cross-border
asset management for private clients.
</P>
<P>
Due to technical problems, Swiss bankers failed to introduce
the system for all tradings last year. The delay has made the
Swiss Exchange lose some one million Swiss francs (800,000 U.S.
dollars) per month over the past one and a half years.
</P>
<P>
According to the press report, the total cost of the project is
likely to double the original estimate to reach 200 million
francs, or 160 million dollars at last.

<HEADLINE> Embargo on Namibian Cattle Lifted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The temporary embargo on
cattle exports from Namibia to South Africa had been lifted after
tests for lung sickness proved negative, the South African Press
Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Windhoek, Namibia's Deputy Director
of Veterinary Services Archie Norval said the South African
authorities informed the Ministry of Agriculture on Thursday that
cattle could again be exported freely for breeding purposes on
the open market in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's embargo on Namibian cattle, applied only to
cattle destined for the open market and not for slaughtering, was
imposed on Monday after reports that cattle from Namibia had been
idagnosed with lung diseases in the country.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the ban, no livestock could be exported to South
Africa from Namibia until further notice pending the results of
blood tests.
</P>
<P>
The tighter measure was apparently the result of South Africa
being declared a foot and mouth disease free country last month.
</P>
<P>
Namibia earlier closed its veterinary border with Botswana to
prevent the spread of lung diseases from that country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Norval said farmers exporting cattle to South
Africa should get all the relevant permits before transporting
their animals otherwise the Namibian beef industry would develop
a bad name. enditem

<HEADLINE> SADC Launches Security Organ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) today launched its security organ
aimed at securing and maintaining peace in the region,
the South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
At a summit meeting in Botswana's capital Gaborone,
representatives from 11 of the 12 SADC member states, six of them
are heads of state, authorised the security organ's
implementation.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe was elected Chairman of the
organ for the first year at the summit.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the summit, SADC Executive
Secretary Daire Mbuende said the organ sought to facilitate the
peaceful settlement of disputes by negotiation, mediation and
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende said military intervention would be decided upon only
after all political remedies had been exhausted in accordance
with the charter of the Organisation of African Unity and the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
''We shall develop a collective capacity and conclude a mutual
defence pact for responding to external threats, and a regional
peacekeeping capacity within national armies that could be called
upon within the region, or elsewhere on the continent,'' said
Mbuende.
</P>
<P>
On releasing an official communique of the summit, Mbuende
said the security organ respected the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of each state, and the inalienable right to independent
existence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, SADC Chairman and Botswanan President Ketumile
Masire said the summit was a clear reflection of commitment to a
new southern Africa, concerned about peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Masire said the SADC had already made significant progress in
strengthening cooperation among the countries of southern Africa.
However, he said, these achievements alone would be meaningless
if ''we do not make efforts to develop, at the same time, a
culture of democracy, peace and security in our region.''
</P>
<P>
Participants of the summit included presidents of Botswana,
Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, foreign
ministers of Zambia, Mauritius, Swaziland and Tanzania, and
deputy prime minister of Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
The only member state not at the summit was Angola.

<HEADLINE> UN Establishes New Mission in Haiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council decided today to establish the United Nations Support
Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH) until November 30.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted unanimously today, the council noted
that the mission is aimed at assisting the government of Haiti in
the professionalization of the police and in the maintenance of a
secure and stable environment conductive to the success of the
current efforts to establish and train an effective national
police force.
</P>
<P>
The UNSMIH will also support the role of the special
representative of the U.N. secretary-general in the coordination
activities by the U.N. system to promote institution-building,
national reconciliation and economic rehabilitation in Haiti,
according to the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided that the UNSMIH initially will be
composed of 300 civilian police and personnel and 600 troops.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 700 soldiers who will cooperate with the UNSMIH
will be financed by voluntary contributions.
</P>
<P>
The council commended the role of the United Nations Mission in
Haiti (UNMIH) in assisting the government of Haiti in fulfilling
its responsibilities to sustain the secure and stable environment
and professionalize the Haitian national police.
</P>
<P>
The current UNMIH was established to take over on March 31,
1995 from the U.S.-led multinational force to help maintain
security and stability in Haiti. The UNMIH had 6,000 troops and
850 police officers at its peak in June 1985. Last February, the
Security Council approved a final four-month extension of the
UNMIH's mandate.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Security Council today, Chinese Ambassador Wang
Xuexian said that the Chinese government has all along attached
importance to and supported the peace progress in Haiti and the
positive efforts made by the secretary-general, his special
representative, the Organization of American States and the UNMIH
in restoring peace and stability in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
As the task of creating a national police force in Haiti has
been completed, there are no indications that the government of
Haiti is faced with any organized threat, nor does the situation
in Haiti pose any threat to international peace and security.
"We have reservations on continued presence of U.N. military
personnel in Haiti," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, having carefully studied the recommendation by the
secretary-general on the establishment of the UNSMIH and taken
into full account the urgent requests of the Haitian government
and the desires of the Latin American countries, we have made our
utmost efforts and agree in principle to the establishment of the
UNSMIH in Haiti," he said.

<HEADLINE> Air Bags Could Be Fatal in Car Crashes: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Air bags can hurt or even kill
people -- especially children -- if they are not wearing seat
belts or sitting too close to the dashboard during crashes,
Transport Canada warned.
</P>
<P>
Common on new cars, air bags are designed to work with seat
belts to protect the head from contact with the steering wheel,
dashboard or doors of the car. They burst from steering wheels and
passenger-side dashboard in less than one tenth of a second or at
300 kilometers an hour.
</P>
<P>
In high speed crashes, their cushioning is extremely effective
at preventing or lessening head and facial injuries, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Yet, they are also triggered during low-speed crashes, when
seat belts alone are often enough to prevent injuries.
</P>
<P>
"Air bags can and do save lives," an official with the agency
was quoted by today's local newspapers as saying. "There is the
risk of serious and even fatal injuries for out-of-position
occupants or where seat belts are improperly used."
</P>
<P>
A Transport Canada study of 400 collisions, in which the bags
burst, found 286 drivers and passengers injured from the bags and
three others died.
</P>
<P>
"Children are particularly vulnerable," the agency said, adding
that improperly belted children, unbelted children sitting or
standing close to the dashboard, and infants in rear-facing child
seats installed in the front seat are at particularly high risk of
the injury.
</P>
<P>
The agency is exploring the possible use of softer air bags
that don't burst so aggressively.
</P>
<P>
It's also considering whether air bags should be made to open
only in high speed crashes. Now, they are designed to open in a
crash equivalent to striking a concrete barrier at 15 or 25 km/h.

<HEADLINE> Few Bulgarians Want to Study in Russia at State Expense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Only four Bulgarians are willing to
be sent by the government to study in Russia because each student
can get only 16 U.S. dollars in monthly allowance from the
government during their study abroad.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991 only three Bulgarians have gone to study in Russia,
local press quoted the Education Ministry as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Under an accord between Bulgaria and Russia, the two countries
can exchange 15 students every year as part of a government-funded
education program. Many Russians have applied to study in Bulgaria
but few Bulgarians wanted to go to Russia for study.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 29 (Xinhua) -- People from all walks of life in
Romania hail the forthcoming visit by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, saying that his visit will further the economic relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers, which all carried Jiang's picture with his
biographical notes today, said that his visit will be of great
significance to the Romanian-Chinese ties.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for the Romanian Presidency, Tranian Chebeleu,
told a press conference that Jiang's visit, which is a good omen,
will promote the economic links between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Foreign Ministry spokesman Sorim Ducaru described
Jiang as an old friend of Romania, saying his visit will bring the
Romanian-Chinese relationship to a new stage.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Romanian-Chinese Friendship Association Florea
Dumitrescu said Romanian people will give Jiang a warm welcome as
they cherished very friendly feelings for the Chinese president,
who worked as the head of the Chinese experts group in Romania in
the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Dumitrescu, once Romanian ambassador to China, spoke highly of
his talks with Jiang, who was then Minister of Electronics
Industry and emphasized the importance of developing the friendly
ties between China and Romania.
</P>
<P>
Aristide Predoi, an advisor of the Romanian Information
Commission, said he was deeply impressed by Jiang's erudite,
humorous style of conversation and amicability when he worked in
Romania more than 20 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Perry: Saudi Blast May be Linked with Last </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 29 (Xinhua)-- The truck bomb blast Tuesday
night at a U.S. personnel residential complex in the eastern
Saudi city of Dhahran may have links with a similar attack last
November, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said today during a
visit to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kuwait News Agency (KUNA), Perry made the
statement following a closed-door briefing with officials of
U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations shortly after his arrival in
Saudi Arabia earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The strong explosion killed 19 American soldiers and injured
several hundred others.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. FBI officials rushed to the kingdom to probe into the
incident shortly after it happened, a second such attack against
U.S. targets in seven months.
</P>
<P>
Perry said that investigations suspected Tuesday's blast at a
military residential complex could be linked to a similar attack
last November that killed five Americans and two Indians at a
U.S.-run military training center in Riyadh, Saudi capital.
</P>
<P>
"We are centering on the possibility that it is the same group
that did the November bombing, but it is by no means limited to
that," Perry said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia in May beheaded four Saudi men who confessed they
were behind last year's blast and that they were influenced by
Islamic groups and Saudi dissidents.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified group threatened to revenge on the Americans
before and after the four were executed.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Saudi authorities had received "a good
description of the two men who parked the truck outside the
housing compound. They have also identified the getaway car as a
white Chevrolet Caprice."
</P>
<P>
An unknown group "Hezbollah-Gulf" has reportedly claimed
responsibility for the explosion.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government says that
it will speed up economic and social development in areas
inhabited by ethnic minorities during the Ninth Five-Year Plan
period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Concrete plans for the effort have been made by relevant
government departments in accordance with the five-year plan
adopted by the Eighth National People's Congress recently; they
include:
</P>
<P>
-- Accelerating work on the Nanning-Kunming electrified railway
and a national highway from Lianyungang, in east China's Jiangsu
Province, to Horgos in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region; and improving highway, rail and air transport for various
ethnic minority areas;
</P>
<P>
-- Building a number of large water control projects in
Xinjiang, southwest China's Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, and in
the Tibet Autonomous Region and Qinghai Province;
</P>
<P>
-- Allocating 50 million yuan annually for development of
pastoral areas in Xinjiang, Qinghai, Tibet, and north China's
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region;
</P>
<P>
-- Further prospecting for minerals and developing oil
resources in the Tarim, Junggar, and Turfan basins in Xinjiang;
building thermo- and hydro-power plants in various provinces and
autonomous regions, and developing processing and manufacturing
industries in those areas to help ethnic minority people;
</P>
<P>
-- Improving educational and health care conditions in ethnic
minority areas, and providing them with greater access to
television and radio broadcasts;
</P>
<P>
-- Increase the number of loans that support agriculture,
township enterprises, and commodity distribution enterprises
there; and
</P>
<P>
-- Approving foreign-funded projects with less than 30 million
US dollars in backing, instead of the ten million US dollars in
the past, in those areas, in agreement with a State Council
decision.

HONG KONG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Trade Development
Council has welcomed the decision by the US House of
Representatives to endorse the unconditional renewal of China's
Most Favored Nation (MFN) trading status this year.
</P>
<P>
Michael Sze, executive director of the TDC, said:" Hong Kong
has once again been spared the prospect of significant damage,
which would be an inevitable outcome of any disruption in normal
trade between its two largest trading partners."
</P>
<P>
On June 27, the House rejected a draft resolution to disapprove
the President's decision to extend China's MFN status for another
year. This in effect means the end of this year's debate on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
Sze said:" This is in the interest of everyone, including the
America's." He continued that harmonious Sino-US relations help to
underpin stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region, in
which Hong Kong plays a leading role in trade and investment.

<HEADLINE> PHS Users Expected to Reach 5 million in Japan by March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Subscribers of personal handy-phone
systems (PHSs) are expected to reach 5 million in Japan by March
1997 amid intensifying price-cutting competition, industry sources
said here today.
</P>
<P>
There were about 2.44 million Japanese PHS users by the end of
May, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The DDI Pocket Telephone Group of nine companies launched a
price-cutting war in February by raising sales promotion
incentives for mass-sale outlets of consumer electronics
products. Dealers have had their bonus raised from 5,000 yen
(about 45.7 U.S. dollars) to 20,000 yen (183 dollars) for selling
a set of PHS receiver.
</P>
<P>
The group had sold 1,235,000 sets of PHSs by June.
</P>
<P>
In an initial response to the higher incentives, the outlets
sold each PHS receiver for some 10,000 yen (91.4 dollars), much
lower than the manufacturer-suggested prices of around 40,000 yen
(365.6 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Some older types of PHS receivers have been discounted to nine
dollars, 6.2 dollars and even less than 15 cents in Tokyo's
Akihabara district, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The NTT Personal Group and the Astel Group, each comprising
nine companies, also took steps on sales incentives this spring
and respectively claimed 611,000 and 598,300 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
PHS service had reached almost all prefectural offices around
the country by this spring.
</P>
<P>
The PHSs were introduced last July in the Tokyo downtown area
and the northern island of Hokkaido.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a growing demand for PHSs to be used in
entertainment facilities such as skiing grounds and Tokyo
Disneyland," said an official of the DDI Pocket Group.

<HEADLINE> PHS Users Expected to Reach 5 million in Japan by March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Subscribers of personal handy-phone
systems (PHSs) are expected to reach 5 million in Japan by March
1997 amid intensifying price-cutting competition, industry sources
said here today.
</P>
<P>
There were about 2.44 million Japanese PHS users by the end of
May, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The DDI Pocket Telephone Group of nine companies launched a
price-cutting war in February by raising sales promotion
incentives for mass-sale outlets of consumer electronics
products. Dealers have had their bonus raised from 5,000 yen
(about 45.7 U.S. dollars) to 20,000 yen (183 dollars) for selling
a set of PHS receiver.
</P>
<P>
The group had sold 1,235,000 sets of PHSs by June.
</P>
<P>
In an initial response to the higher incentives, the outlets
sold each PHS receiver for some 10,000 yen (91.4 dollars), much
lower than the manufacturer-suggested prices of around 40,000 yen
(365.6 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Some older types of PHS receivers have been discounted to nine
dollars, 6.2 dollars and even less than 15 cents in Tokyo's
Akihabara district, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The NTT Personal Group and the Astel Group, each comprising
nine companies, also took steps on sales incentives this spring
and respectively claimed 611,000 and 598,300 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
PHS service had reached almost all prefectural offices around
the country by this spring.
</P>
<P>
The PHSs were introduced last July in the Tokyo downtown area
and the northern island of Hokkaido.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a growing demand for PHSs to be used in
entertainment facilities such as skiing grounds and Tokyo
Disneyland," said an official of the DDI Pocket Group.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni President Sees His Visit to France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
today described his talks with French President Jacques Chirac as
"positive and fruitful."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon return from his visit to France,
Saleh said, "the visit contributed to the development of the
bilateral relations which experience steady growth and serve the
common interests of two peoples of Yemen and France."
</P>
<P>
He underscored the keenness of his government and people on
expanding the relations and cooperation with France in all fields.
</P>
<P>
He also praised France for its positive role as mediator
between Yemen and Eritrea to settle the dispute over the Red Sea
island of Greater Hanish.
</P>
<P>
On the Arab summit which was held last weekend in Cairo, Saleh
expressed satisfaction with the results of the summit, describing
them as "good."
</P>
<P>
"The convention of the summit in itself after six years of Arab
disunity constitutes a success and gain as the success managed to
realize rapprochement and solidarity among the Arab brothers and
thawed the snow which shrouded the inter-Arab relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the necessity of holding Arab summit on a
regular basis under "a specific mechanism" to iron out the
inter-Arab differences through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He said Yemen introduced its viewpoint in this regard and
called for lifting the U.N.-imposed embargos on Iraq and Libya.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the peace process must ensure the restoration
of the Arab legitimate rights and put an end to the Israeli
occupation of Arab territories such as Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in France, he met with Chirac and other French
leaders and discussed with them the bilateral relations and
cooperation. They also probed the ways of promoting the
Yemeni-French cooperation and reviewed the recent regional and
international developments.

<P>
OSLO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin today
wound up his three-day state visit to Norway and left for Romania
to continue his six-nation European and Central Asian tour.
</P>
<P>
Jiang left Bergen, a coastal city about 300 kilometers
northwest of Oslo, this afternoon after a several-hour stay there.
</P>
<P>
During his visit in Oslo, Jiang held talks with Norwegian
leaders over a wide range of bilateral and international issues of
mutual interest. The two parties have reached extensive common
ground.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the Sino-Norwegian relations will be further
consolidated and developed in all areas on the basis of mutual
respect, equality, mutual benefit, and seeking common ground while
shelving differences," he said in a written statement before
leaving for Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
China and Norway have signed three trade and economic
cooperation agreements. The two countries have also agreed to open
general consulates in each other's cities.
</P>
<P>
Romania is the third leg of Jiang's current tour which will
also take him to Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. He had

<HEADLINE> Major Attacks Suspected IRA Bombing in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
today launched verbal attacks upon the suspected IRA terrorist
attack on a British army base in Germany, saying it would further
isolate its political wing Sinn Fein in the Ulster peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC television interview this morning, Major said
that such terrorist actions were unacceptable to both the Irish
and British governments.
</P>
<P>
"The presumption must be that it's the IRA (Irish Republican
Army)...the nature of the attacks suggests very strongly it was
them," he said.
</P>
<P>
This latest terrorist action strongly indicated that "they are
becoming more and more isolated internationally" and there had
been a "sea change" in the U.S. public opinion over Sinn Fein,
said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it was impossible for the IRA to win a seat in
the republican movement at the on-going Ulster peace talks through
a bombing campaign. "Every single attack divorces them further
from the mainstream political parties and...the peace talks."
</P>
<P>
Major urged Sinn Fein to use its influence over the guerrilla
movement to end the violence if it wished to enter into the talks.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that unidentified attackers fired two mortars
from a nearly parked van at the British military base near
Osnarbruck in northern Germany on Friday night, but no injuries
were reported.
</P>
<P>
The IRA guerillas, fighting to end British rule in Northern
Ireland, attacked the same barracks in 1989 by placing a 150-kg
Semtex bomb next to a dormitory block.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The purpose of China's housing
reform is to speed up construction and to establish a new housing
system, State Councillor Li Tieying recently pointed out, prior to
making an inspection tour of housing reform work and the Anju
Project in 20 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Li is head of the Housing System Reform Leading Group of the
State Council and will accompany a group of members and standing
committee members of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, and leaders from the
municipal people's congresses of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai
for the tour.
</P>
<P>
The new housing system is meant to factor in workers' salaries,
payment by installments, an accumulation funding system, and
mortgage loans, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
For the Anju Project, Li said, houses should be built at
minimum cost, but without sacrificing quality.
</P>
<P>
All localities should strictly abide by unified policies of the
State Council on this, and they must not develop preferential
policies of their own, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Head of French National Railway Company to Attend Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Head of the National Railway Company
of France (SNCF), Le Floch Prigent, has been ordered by a local
judge to attend a court hearing on July 4, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Prigent, president and general-director of the SNCF, will have
to clarify on a "doubtful" financial case, in which the
Elf-Aquitaine oil company spent 800 million francs (153 million
U.S. dollars) in saving the textile group Bidermann in the early
1990s, said the Agence France Press quoting "certain and
coordinated sources."
</P>
<P>
Prigent was the president and general-director of the
Elf-Aquitaine oil company from May 1989 to August 1993.
</P>
<P>
Two French watch-dog institutions, the Commission of Stock
Exchange Operations and the Court of Accounts, submitted two
reports expressing doubt over the case, and the Paris Attorney
General launched an inquiry into the affair in August 1994.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry led to the detention of the head of the Bidermann
group, Maurice Bidermann, on May 24, and the judicial
investigation of six other persons, including the ex-wife of
Prigent, Fatima Belaid.
</P>
<P>
Belaid, who was suspected of having benefited from the
"generosity of Maurice Bidermann," was accused of "covering the
action of abusing social properties."
</P>
<P>
Prigent has pleaded innocence in the case.

BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Airline International
will add a flight to its Beijing-Vancouver route on July 3,
bringing the total to four flights per week, and giving it the
most China-North America flights for a foreign airline.
</P>
<P>
Brian Walsh, president of the company's China business, said
that the move is the result of increasing trade between China and

</P>
<P>
Trade stands at six billion to seven billion US dollars
annually and is expected to hit 20 billion US dollars by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Travel both ways is expected to become more fashionable among

both for commercial activities and for sight-seeing.
</P>

The airline's good business record over the past two years,
with passenger levels of 75 percent in the first half of the year,
led to the decision to add another flight between Beijing and
Vancouver, according to Walsh.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> US Defense Secretary Visits Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 29 (Xinhua) -- United States Defense
Secretary William Perry started a two-day visit to Saudi Arabia
today to inspect the site of bomb blast and visit some of the
U.S. servicemen wounded in the blast, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) quoted sources at the
U.S. Embassy in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, that Perry would be
briefed on the outcome of investigations Saudi and U.S. Federal
Bureau of Investigation officers were conducting on the explosion,
which happened Tuesday night at Dhahran and killed 19
U.S. servicemen.
</P>
<P>
Perry will meet senior Saudi government officials and discuss
with them tighter security measures aimed at protecting some
5,000 U.S. military personnel in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Perry would also meet Saudi King Fahd Bin Abdel-Aziz, KUNA
said.
</P>
<P>
Perry's visit to the kingdom is the second by a U.S. senior
official since the explosion. U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher paid an unscheduled visit to the explosion site at
Dhahran Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Perry is due to leave Saudi Arabia Sunday to continue his
previously scheduled trip to Italy, Hungary, Bosnia, Slovenia and
U.S. warships in the Mediterranean before returning to Washington
on July 4.
</P>
<P>
Questions have been raised about the level of security at
the housing complex where American troops were housed in
view of threats against Americans stationed in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Some of the 64 people hospitalized after the blast have
been flown to a U.S. military hospital in Germany, but
others remain in Saudi Arabia. U.S. sources said one of the
wounded Americans was still in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
The investigation into the attack, the second against U.S.
military personnel in Saudi Arabia in seven months, is still
going on, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Two previously unknown groups opposed to the presence of
U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia claimed responsibility for the bomb,
but there was no firm indication of who had detonated it.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that Saudi Ministry of Information officials
were questioning late Thursday three security officers who saw
the bomb truck pull up near the complex and two men jump out and
speed off in a waiting car.
</P>
<P>
The explosion killed 19 Americans and wounded a total of 386
people, including 147 Saudi nationals, 118 Bangladeshis, 109
Americans, four Egyptians, two Jordanians, two Indonesians, two
Filipinos and two unidentified.
</P>
<P>
A further 200 people of different nationalities were treated
for minor injuries after the attack.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Emphasizes Role of Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Agriculture's importance to the
national economy must be fully understood and all possible efforts
should be made to increase the income of farmers, Vice-Premier Zou
Jiahua said during an inspection tour of north China's Shanxi
Province, June 24 to 28.
</P>
<P>
"Agriculture is the foundation of our national economy," he
noted, and grain production must not be neglected.
</P>
<P>
Importance should be placed on developing the rural economy and
increasing farmers' incomes, the vice-premier said, emphasizing
the relation between agriculture and industry.
</P>
<P>
"Raising grain production, improving rural economy, and
increasing incomes for farmers will promote industrial
development," Zou explained.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore we must fully understand the basic role of
agriculture in the national economy," he went on to say, and an
important way to develop the rural economy and increase farmers'
income is to improve processing of farm produce.
</P>
<P>
After a visit to the Wanjiazhai Water Conservation Project,
Fenhe Reservoir, and another water project, Zou said that "the
important issue of water has a bearing on Shanxi's agricultural
and industrial production and the lives of its people."
</P>
<P>
"The development of and the saving of water are of equal
importance," the vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
Zou was accompanied by provincial officials and had a look at
the Taijiu Expressway, a 144-km-long expressway that opened
earlier this week.

<HEADLINE> Environment Agency Urges Curbing "Greenhouse Gas" Emission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- An advisory body of Japanese
Environment Agency today urged Japanese to change their life style
to prevent global warming.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the advisory body unveiled a message, to be
included in a July report of the agency, calling for a rethinking
of the life style that gives Japan its prosperity but produces
large amounts of the "greenhouse gas" carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
The agency's call for urgent cuts in carbon dioxide emissions
is likely to have a bearing on the carbon dioxide reduction
targets to be set at a third conference in late 1997 of signatory
nations to the Framework Convention on Climate Change.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which is a strong contender for hosting the conference,
is expected to submit its bid at a second meeting of signatory
nations in July in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The message said that both developed and developing nations
must combine to reduce the world's emissions of carbon dioxide to
a level considerably below the present one.
</P>
<P>
"The prosperity which developed nations currently enjoy poses a
danger of seriously undermining the benefits of future
generations, and is being maintained at the cost of jeopardizing
the future development of developing countries," the message said.
</P>
<P>
It acknowledged that global climate is the subject of research
which facilitates the introduction of measures to prevent climate
change.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries must cooperate to build a framework for the
reduction of increasing carbon dioxide emissions from developing
countries, it added.

<HEADLINE> International Telecom Meeting in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 multinationals
talked about global telecom services with Chinese
telecommunications officials at the annual meeting of World
Partners Association, a global consortium of telecommunications
companies, in Beijing June 24 to 27.
</P>
<P>
Started jointly by AT&AMP;T, KDD, and Singapore Telecom three years
ago, WPA is an association of top-rated telecom businesses with
the goal of providing high-quality service to multinational
corporations.
</P>
<P>
It is involved in technically advanced items such as frame
relay, private line, and Virtual Network Service (VNS). The
Chinese meeting was sponsored by AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
In related developments, the biennial conference of AT&AMP;T's
customer advisory council opened here to advise both AT&AMP;T and WPA
on how to improve communications services to meet the expanding
needs of multinationals in the Asia and Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The council said that business in China should be given top
priority, as multinationals' telecoms demands increase along with
their business.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, John Legere, president of AT&AMP;T Asia and
Pacific, led a group of international participants in a meeting
with Yang Xianzu, vice-minister of Posts and Telecommunications.
Their "productive discussion", as an AT&AMP;T representative described
it, covered a wide range of issues, including China's telecoms
development during the Ninth Five-Year Plan, and telecom service
needs of multinationals.
</P>
<P>
As the largest foreign telecom carrier in China, AT&AMP;T has
provided a dozen international services, ranging from direct
telephone, digital optical line, and Internet to satellite digital
communications.
</P>
<P>
To show its determination in development in China, the company
provided three Chinese customers with a free package trip to the
Olympic Games in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> United Front Work to be Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The continuing theme of the
party's united front work is uniting all forces that can be
united, noted an official from China's top advisory body today.
</P>
<P>
In this, it should get the overwhelming majority of the people
to rally around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), headed by Jiang Zemin, in order to realize the grand
goal of the Ninth Five-year Plan and the long-term program up to
2010 for China's national economic and social development, said
Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the national committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came during a recent inspection tour of Shanghai,
China's largest industrial center and the birthplace of
non-Communist parties, which Wang pointed out has a glorious
tradition of various non-Communist parties cooperating with the
CPC.
</P>
<P>
He urged Shanghai to increase its cooperation with
non-Communist parties, implement the policies of the Party central
committee in relation to this, and encourage non-Communist parties
to improve their party growth.
</P>
<P>
In today's conditions, united front work departments should
coordinate better and make full use of the magic weapon of united
front work, Wang said, urging united front work departments in
Shanghai to achieve new things and increase experience.

<HEADLINE> Palace Museum Acquires National Treasure at Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Palace Museum spent 8.8
million yuan today in buying back a 500-year-old Chinese painting
which was once listed as one of the top 100 relics in the museum's
collection.
</P>
<P>
The museum's bid this afternoon was submitted over the phone in
the ancient Chinese paintings and calligraphy category of the
spring auction held by Beijing's Hanhai Art Auction Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The painting, "Landscape after Huang Gongwang's style", was the
work of Shen Zhou, a famous painter from the Ming Dynasty
(1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
It was modelled after a landscape work done by Huang Gongwang,
which is regarded as the best of Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368)
paintings.
</P>
<P>
Shen owned the original, but it was taken from him when he
asked a friend to critique the scroll and the friend's son stole
it. His offspring later sold it.
</P>
<P>
Shen, who was 60 at that time, could not afford to buy it back,
and he loved the scroll so much that he tried to reproduce it from
memory.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that Shen's copy, 855 cm long, is similar to the
original, but in style, and "It's the best of Shen's works."
</P>
<P>
In 1973, Shen's copy was taken from a private collector and
placed in storage at the Palace Museum, and was not returned until
the end of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the original landscape by Huang Gongwang is now
part of a collection in Taiwan, while the remaining one third,
which was damaged in a fire, is in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time for the Palace Museum to buy expensive
artwork at auctions: It set a world record by spending 18 million
yuan to buy a Chinese painting dated from the Song Dynasty
(907-1279) at Hanhai's Autumn Auction last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Panzhihua Iron and Steel (Group)
Corporation (Pangang), one of China's ten iron and steel
giants, has paid off the 210 million-US-dollar loans it borrowed
nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
The repayment of principal and interest totaled 287 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Pangang signed an agreement with an international banking
consortium in 1987 for the nine-year-term commercial loans
totaling 210 million US dollars. The consortium consisted of 24
banks from 12 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Pangang, located in southwest China's Sichuan Province, has
used the loans for its second-phase construction, which was a
key project in China and involved a total investment of nearly 10
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The loans were used to import advanced technology and
equipment, such as blast furnace control systems and key equipment
for coking gas treatment.
</P>
<P>
Started in 1986, the second-phase construction has turned
Pangang into the largest iron and steel production base in China's
southwest region, as well as the largest production base for
railway-use steel products and vanadium and titanium products
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Pangang now has had a capacity to produce 2.5 million tons of
steel annually. It mainly produces large heavy-rail section steel,
1450mm hot-rolled strip, 1220mm cold-rolled strip and vanadium and
titanium products.
</P>
<P>
Pangang is expected to complete the second-phase project by the
end of this year, to lift its annual production capacity of iron,
steel and rolled steel by one million tons, respectively.

<HEADLINE> No Political Crisis in Zambia: Chiluba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- There is no political crisis in
Zambia and the country's general elections will be held later
this year, President Frederick Chiluba has said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Ndola airport of Copperbelt province north of
Lusaka on Friday, Chiluba said the government has formed three
committees, one on foreign affairs and others on home and
economic fronts to tackle issues in the three fields.
</P>
<P>
The foreign service committee headed by Foreign Minister
Christon Tembo has visited some neighboring countries, Chiluba
said, adding the neighbors had insured Zambia that the
constitution issue is a purely internal one in Zambia and
therefore has nothing to do with them.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba reiterated that the constitution would not be changed
as was demanded by the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
A political strife has arisen around a constitution amendment
bill which went into effect in late may.
</P>
<P>
According to the new constitution, only aboriginals in Zambia
are qualified to run for the presidency, which actually bars
former president and opposition United National Independent Party
leader Kenneth Kaunda from contending for the post in the
forthcoming general elections as his parents were immigrants from
neighboring Malawi.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties are making efforts to try to repeal the
amendment.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's State-Run Press Accuses US of Interfering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's state-run press today once
again took up the issue of Scud missiles and accused the United
States of interfering in Egypt's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"There are things that can not be acceptable in international
relations, even among friendly countries," the Cairo leading
newspaper Al-Ahram said in its editorial today.
</P>
<P>
"In actual fact, the furore, raised by the United States and
Israel vis-a-vis the procurement, by Egypt, of Scud missiles and
their technology from North Korea, is unacceptable and an act of
interference in the internal affairs of Egypt," it added.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Israel have shown special concerns over
reports that Egypt has bought Scud missiles and their components
from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Israel even
accused Egypt of causing instability in the region with its
reported deal with the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has responded by saying that any country is entitled to
purchase sophisticated weapons to enhance its combat capabilities
but stopped short of either admitting or denying its purchase of
the missiles.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, the Egyptian state-run and opposition
media has accused the United States and Israel of using the issue
to pressurize the Arab summit hosted by Egypt on June 22-23 not to
adopt a tough stand against Israel and later in an attempt to
overshadow the outcome of the Cairo summit, which requested that
Israel fulfill its obligations in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram today reiterated that "Egypt has the full right to
possess weapons, seen to be necessary for its security and the
protection of its sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
The paper also accused the United States of adopting double
standards over the issue of armament in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"If the United States is really concerned about the issue of
armament in the region, then it will have to start first with the
nuclear and chemical weapons of Israel as well as its
ground-to-ground missiles, which have a range that goes beyond
neighboring countries, something which shows Israel's desire to
become a super regional power," it said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has demanded that Israel, widely believed to possess
nuclear weapons, join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Israel
has refused citing security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Israel's arsenal "does not entitle Israel nor the United States
to ask about any Egyptian weapons," said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is a close ally of the United States in the Middle
East. Egypt, being the second largest recipient country of the
United States behind Israel, gets 2.1 billion U.S. dollars of
aid each year from Washington.

HONG KONG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Eastern Express, one of the
three major Hong Kong-based English language newspapers, is to
cease publication from next Monday.
</P>
<P>
An announcement of the paper says here today that the decision

Eastern Express was launched on February 1, 1994 and it
belonged to the Oriental Press Group which also publishes
Oriental Daily News, one of the major Chinese language newspapers
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
There is no report here today that the newspaper's closure is
related to price war.
</P>
<P>
But Eastern Express cut half of its total pages to 12 early
this year when the newspaper price war prevailed.

BAGHDAD, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has protested anew the
violation by the U.S., British and French warplanes of its
airspace and condemned "the provocative surveillance" conducted by
these warplanes.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali

representative to the U.N. said the warplanes violated the Iraqi
airspace between June 1 and 15 and carried out 757 flights in

<P>
The planes dropped 6 flare bombs in Basra and Zi Qar
governorates, the Iraqi representative said, adding that these
actions terrorized the civilians and inflicted damages on the
public and private properties.
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi government reserves its right to claim for
compensations for the damages of the Iraqi people," the letter added.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government asked its representative to distribute the

<HEADLINE> Members of Indonesian Democratic Party Told to Stop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Loyalists to Megawati
Sukarnoputri, the ousted leader of the Indonesian Democratic Party
(PDI), have been warned to quit their mass street protests, which
the authorities said have disrupted the order and security in
Jakarta, the Indonesian Observer reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Jakarta regional military command Maj. Gen.
Sutiyoso issued the warning Friday evening after supporters of
Megawati, daughter of former President Sukarno, held a protest
rally at the parliament.
</P>
<P>
He termed the street protests as "destructive, brutal, and
terrifying," said the report.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 supporters of Megawati rallied in the lobby of
parliament Friday to protest against a congress held by the
anti-Megawati faction in the PDI.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, clad in the party's red-and-black colors and
chanting slogans in support of Megawati in the parliament's huge
marbled foyer, tried unsuccessfully to meet the legislators, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The PDI's leadership is split into two factions, one of which,
formed at a congress held on June 20-22 in Medan, capital of North
Sumatra province, is led by Soerjadi and officially recognized.
</P>
<P>
The other faction, headed by the party's former leader
Megawati, depends on the support of loyal party members.
</P>
<P>
On June 20, thousands of Megawati's supporters marched through
central Jakarta in protest against the "rebel congress," which
culminated in a clash with security forces, leaving more than 100
people injured.
</P>
<P>
On the following day, the embattled PDI Executive Board and the
Jakarta Military Command agreed to allow no more violence by
either side.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Jakarta police Maj. Gen. Hamami Nata said Friday
that police would slap criminal charges against any violation of
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Soerjadi is seeking to take control of the PDI headquarters in
central Jakarta, which is now being occupied and guarded
around-the-clock by hundreds of Megawati's supporters, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Anti-riot police have been stationed around the PDI
headquarters to maintain peace and order.
</P>
<P>
There are three parties in Indonesia, namely the United
Development Party, the PDI and one functional group (the ruling
Golkar), all of which are preparing to take part in the country's
next general elections scheduled for June next year.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial Greets Hong Kong's Return to Motherland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- China will as always resolutely
implement the principles of "one country, two systems", "Hong Kong
governing by the Hong Kong people" and a high degree of autonomy,
so as to ensure the region's smooth transition, stability and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
An Editorial of People's Daily to be published June 30, just
one year before Hong Kong's return to the motherland, says that
the great concept of "one country, two systems" put forward by
Deng Xiaoping is the best way to settle the Hong Kong issue left
over by history.
</P>
<P>
It is not an expedient measure, but a basic state policy which
has brought the future of Hong Kong, the country's long-term
strategic development and its reunification with motherland
together, it says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial entitled "greeting Hong Kong's return to the
motherland and creating a bright future" says that since the
country's reform and opening up to the outside world, the
sustained economic development of the Chinese inland areas has
become an important factor for maintaining Hong Kong's economic
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, bridging the inland areas with the world, is playing
an important role for the country's economic growth and its
opening up, it says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial notes that it is a "complicated and systematic
project" for China to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong
Kong, adding that fruitful results have been achieved since the
signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of
Hong Kong, the formulation of the Basic Law for the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR), and the establishment of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
"We should race against the time and adhere to the principles of
mainly relying on ourselves and the Hong Kong people, earnestly
making well preparations for the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR,"
the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial expressed the hope that both Hong Kong and the
inland area should abide by the Basic Law, a fundamental law for the
Hong Kong SAR after 1997.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that after 1997, the central departments,
provinces, autonomous regions as well as municipalities will act
strictly in accordance with the Basic law, not interfering in
the affairs of the government of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that the issue of Hong Kong is a major issue
in the Sino-British relations. Practice over the past years has
proven that bilateral cooperation is the only correct way to
settle the Hong Kong issue.
</P>
<P>
Noting the improvement of the Sino-British relations, it says
that efforts should be continued to maintain this trend. So
long as the two countries enhance cooperation, reduce troubles,
can the Hong Kong's stable transition be realized.
</P>
<P>
This not only conforms to the fundamental interests of the two
peoples, but also reflects the aspirations of the people the world
over, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that the people throughout the country
including the Hong Kong compatriots will surely overcome
difficulties and accomplish this glorious task entrusted by
history.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- While unemployment increased by 1 percent in May, the labor
conflict worsened at the air company Air Inter (also called Air
France Europe). After six trade unions called for a strike to
protest the closing by the company's leaders of 18 lines, 500
flights were canceled on Friday, affecting 65,000 travelers.
</P>
<P>
-- The G-7 decided on Friday to cancel two thirds of the debts
of the world's poorest countries. The leaders of the seven most
industrialized countries stressed the role of "major trump" the
globalization of trade would play, but they recognized the
possible risks globalization could impose on poor countries.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- A black Friday for Air France Europe. No planes of Air
France Europe (also called Air Inter) took off Friday, leaving the
Orly airport of Paris in a great mess. About 300 to 400 employees
of the company illegally detained for five hours the company's
general director, Jean-Pierre Courcol, and released him after the
company agreed to freeze for one week a plan to lay off 900
employees in two years and to refrain from announcing a possible
merger with Air France until Thursday next week.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde:
</P>
<P>
-- General Alexander Lebed puts forward his "new moral order"
plan for Russia. President Boris Yeltsin has let the rising
strongman of the Kremlin to play at the front of the stage. Less
than a week from the start of the second round of presidential
poll, Lebed, who ranged the third in the first round and has been
named the head of the Council of Security of Russia, urged a fight
against criminal gangs, Western culture and (political-religious)
"sects" in Russia. Meanwhile, doubts about Yeltsin's health
increase.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Turkey's New Coalition Government Still </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's new coalition government
was formed between the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) and the
center-right True Path Party (DYP), but many people are still
thinking how long the new coalition can last and RP leader
Necmettin Erbakan and DYP Chairwoman Tansu Ciller can cooperate.
</P>
<P>
Following the formation of the coalition government, the RP is
cheerful while the DYP feels sad.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan has realized his wish for taking the post of the prime
minister in this country, which he had cherished for 27 years. To
avoid meeting with reporters, Ciller returned home instead of
submitting, together With Erbakan, a 37-person cabinet list to
President Suleyman Demirel, who regards Ciller as his "daughter."
</P>
<P>
According to the coalition protocol to be signed today,
Erbakan will head the government for the first two years and then
turn it over to Ciller for the remaining two years.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Democratic Left Party (DSP) leader Bulent Ecevit said
that Erbakan would not give the post of the prime minister to
Ciller after two years. Ecevit cooperated with Erbakan in a
coalition government in the 70s, but the government collapsed after
nine months.
</P>
<P>
After the approval of the cabinet list by Demirel, Erbakan
thanked Ciller for her "understanding and sacrifices." Seeking
relief from corruption charges threatening her political career,
Ciller reversed her earlier hostility to the RP and snubbed a
last-minute call for unity from Motherland Party (ANAP) leader
Mesut Yilmaz, her former government partner, to set up the
alliance with the Islamists.
</P>
<P>
Ciller accused Yilmaz of not preventing his deputies from
voting in favor of the RP motions to investigate Ciller over
alleged irregularities at the Electricity Distributing Company
(TEDAS), to investigate Ciller about corruption allegations
during the sale of state-owned shares of Turkey's leading
automobile plant TOFAS and to inquire into Ciller's assets both at
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for Yilmaz's act, Ciller decided to withdraw
her party from the coalition government with the ANAP and asked
Yilmaz to render his resignation to Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Ciller had repeatedly said she would not join a coalition
government with the RP after last December's general election as
the RP becomes the first party in the parliament. But after the
ANAP-DYP coalition government resigned on June 6, Ciller changed
her mind and cooperated with the RP for the formation of the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
However, is Ciller really safe after the RP-DYP coalition
government was formed?
</P>
<P>
The skeptics said that there is no doubt that Ciller has
entered this coalition simply to save herself from the
parliamentary probe. They feel the RP has given a major
concession by covering up the investigations against Ciller, and
in return the DYP has agreed to accept the RP Chairman Erbakan as
prime minister. As a whole, Ciller is now cornered by the probes
against her and thus has no way out but to join forces with the
RP.
</P>
<P>
If the RP-DYP coalition obtains a vote of confidence in
parliament, Yilmaz can present motions asking parliamentary
investigations into Ciller's many corruption files.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a strong opposition group in the DYP is shaking the
newly-formed coalition between the DYP and the RP.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the coalition was formed, DYP deputy Necdet
Menzir announced to resign from the DYP in protest against the
DYP-RP coalition.
</P>
<P>
DYP deputy and former parliament Speaker Ismet Sezgin has said
that if the DYP-RP coalition was formed, he would quit the
politics.
</P>
<P>
A DYP opposition group of over 10 deputies led by Cavit Caglar
are observing the latest developments following the formation of
the new government.
</P>
<P>
Six DYP deputies resigned because of opposition to Ciller's
intention to obey the RP demand for the formation of the coalition
during the Ciller-Erbakan talks.
</P>
<P>
Most people are doubtful that the new coalition government can
obtain a vote of confidence in parliament as a opposition group in
the DYP is trying to cast "no" votes to the government.

<HEADLINE> Mandela on S. Africa's Finance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The manner in which South
Africa has ridden out the financial turbulence of the past few
months would benefit the lives of all people and add impetus to
economic growth and job creation, President Nelson Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the major banks for deciding to cut interest
rates in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the remarks at a function in Pretoria last night
to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Reserve Bank,
the central bank of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
A local daily ''the Citizen'' today quoted the president as
saying that the environment in which the bank operated gave
little room for error, but the experience it has acquired over
the decades has stood the bank and the country in good stead.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the major devaluation of the local currency Rand
against foreign currencies earlier this year and the decision of
major commercial banks to increase interest rates last month,
Mandela said South Africa has had its share of ''rude shocks'',
but the finance ministry and the Reserve Bank has come out of the
crises ''with flying colors''.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Mandela said the stability that has set in and
the ensuring decision taken by the major banks this week to
reduce rates would not only impact on the material lives of all
citizens, but also add impetus to the government's efforts of
ensuring rapid economic growth and the creation of much-needed
jobs.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela also urged the Reserve Bank to employ more
people from the country's various race groups.
</P>
<P>
''One of the greatest challenges now facing the bank today is
to ensure that its staff complement, at all levels, reflects the
diversity of our country,'' said the president, adding steps
already taken in this regard are encouraging.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Guerrillas Attack Israeli Positions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli forces in the so-called
"security zone" in southern Lebanon bombarded today a number of
Lebanese villages in retaliation for a series of attacks launched
by guerrillas at the Israeli occupied buffer zone this morning.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security sources said that Israeli tanks in the
position of Sejoud intensively shelled the vicinities of the
southern Lebanese villages of Sarba and Ein Kana.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Israeli warplanes hovered at low altitude over
the same area, the security sources added.
</P>
<P>
At 9:15 a.m. (06:15 GMT), the Israeli tanks resumed the
bombardment at Iglim Al-Toffah, or Province of Apple, a mountain
area which is oftened used by Lebanese Moslem guerrillas as a
springboard to launch attacks at the Israeli occupaton forces and
its client militia in the south.
</P>
<P>
In Western Beqaa, Mona Mohammed Maki, 30, was injured in the
Israeli shelling at Libbayeh and damages were caused to  the
village.
</P>
<P>
This was the third report on civilian casualties since Lebanon
and Israel reached a cease-fire understanding on April 26, which
ended 16 days of Israeli blitz in southern lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces also bombarded the villages of Burkat
Jaboud, Abou Rashid and the hills of Sreira and Gatrani.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that more than 80 shells hit these villages in
a couple of hours. And the bombardment did not stop when this
story was dispatched.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, announced that its
guerrillas launched attacks this morning at the Israeli positions
at Kaukab, Zaghli, Ein Genya, Abou Gamha, As-Souida, Bir Kalab
and Sejoud.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the militant group, which spearheads a
guerrilla warfare against the Israeli occupation in southern
lebanon, said that the attacks caused heavy casualties and
serious damages to the targets.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the guerrillas managed to control the Israeli
position on the hill of Ahmadiyeh for 15 minutes before the
Israeli forces mounted a counterattack.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio confirmed the morning operations by Lebanese
guerrillas armed with mortars and anti-tank rockets, saying that
the attacks were targeted at seven positions of the South
Lebanese Army militia.
</P>
<P>
It claimed one Hezbollah infiltrator was killed and a number of
others were injured, in addition to three militiamen wounded, in
the exchange of fire between the fighting sides.
</P>
<P>
The radio added that one group of infiltrators attempted to
seize the position of Kaukab, "but the Israeli troops and the SLA
militia managed to repulse the assault."
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security sources reported that Israeli helicopters also
participated in fighting the Hezbollah infiltrators back.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic exchanges of fire have been witnessed in the Israeli
occupied border strip in southern Lebanon, in which nine Israeli
soldiers were killed and 23 others were wounded, since the
U.S.brokered the cease-fire some three months ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE -- Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic Friday urged Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to quit power immediately so as to
help the Serbs resume normal contacts with the international
community as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with the local newspaper, Politika Express,
Lilic said Bosnian Serbs need a leader who is acceptable to the
international community and able to guide the Republika Srpska, a
Serb entity in Bosnia, back to the right track of development.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic is obviously not such a leader, Lilic said.
</P>
<P>
Under the mounting pressures from the international community
and Yugoslavia, Karadzic has offered on Wednesday his conditional
resignation as "President" and withdrawal from Bosnia's
nation-wide election on September 14.
</P>
<P>
But his conditions were regarded as unacceptable by the
international community, and International envoy Carl Bildt
threatened on Friday that sanctions would be reimposed upon
Belgrade or the Bosnian Serbs if Karadzic, who is indicted as a
war criminal by the Hague International Tribunal, failed to resign.
</P>
<P>
Lyon, France -- U.S President Bill Clinton's two major
assistants, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Secretary of
the Treasury Robert Rubin, Friday outlined main issues the United
States was pressing during the three-day G-7 summit.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing here this afternoon, Christopher said the
U.S. government identified two priority areas that attention
should be focused on: first, securing the peace in Bosnia and
second, combating international crime and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations Security Council decided
Friday to establish the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti
(UNSMIH) until November 30.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted unanimously, the council noted that the
mission is aimed at assisting the government of Haiti in the
professionalization of the police and in the maintenance of a
secure and stable environment conductive to the success of the
current efforts to establish and train an effective national
police force.
</P>
<P>
The UNSMIH will also support the role of the special
representative of the U.N. secretary-general in the coordination
activities by the U.N. system to promote institution-building,
national reconciliation and economic rehabilitation in Haiti,
according to the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided that the UNSMIH initially will be
composed of 300 civilian police and personnel and 600 troops.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 700 soldiers who will cooperate with the UNSMIH
will be financed by voluntary contributions.

<HEADLINE> Committee To Meet On Security Aid For Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 29 (Xinhua) -- A Burundi request for
foreign military intervention will be considered on Monday by a
special committee in Arusha, Northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
This was what an official from the Tanzanian ministry of
foreign affairs told reporters in Arusha in northern Tanzania on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said a committee headed by Tanzania would meet to discuss
the request on Monday in Arusha, where leaders of six east and
central African states agreed at a summit last Tuesday to set it
up.
</P>
<P>
The official said the committee would consist of foreign and
defense ministers as well as government officials.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the committee should report back to
regional leaders on how to provide security assistance either
before or shortly after the summit of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) held in Cameroon from July 8 to 10.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, Ethiopia and
Burundi agreed to set up the committee at the Arusha summit after
the Burundi government requested regional "security assistance'
to help put an end to bloodshed in that central African country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Council for the Defense of Democracy
(CNDD), the main Hutu rebel movement, in a statement on Friday,
rejected the government request for aid, saying it would consider
any foreign troops intervening in Burundi as an invasion force.
</P>
<P>
CNDD said foreign military assistance for the government is
aimed at salvaging a power-sharing agreement between the Tutsi
Uprona and Hutu Frodebu parties.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here from Arusha today said, Burundi's main
Tutsi-dominated Uprona party also rejected the government request
for foreign help as "high treason" and vowed to resist any foreign
military intervention.

<HEADLINE> Iranian  Press Denounces Turkish Incursion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian press today denounced
Turkish incursion by publishing editorials and commentaries in
both English and Persian dailies, despite a strong denial from
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The English daily "Kayhan International" regarded the recent
incursion of Turkish military aircraft into Iranian airspace as
another "criminal act against defenseless people" in its
northwestern region.
</P>
<P>
Early local press reports said that three Turkish helicopters
Wednesday violated Iranian airspace and fired several rockets,
killing six civilians and injuring 15 others inside Iranian
territory, in Silvana region, 25 kilometers west of Orumiyeh.
</P>
<P>
But officials from Turkey's General Staff of the Armed forces
denied the allegation, calling it a "lie".
</P>
<P>
The editorial by the paper called on the Foreign Ministry to
take the issue seriously and ensure that the innocent blood of
Iranian citizens would not be shed.
</P>
<P>
"This cowardly and impudent act comes amid the new military
cooperation between Turkey and Islam's main foe, the Israeli
regime, under which Ankara hopes to boost its defense
capability," it noted.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the Ankara-Tel Aviv military pact, it remarked that
Wednesday's incident indicated the well-calculated Israeli plan
to sow and spread discord and dispute among regional countries.
</P>
<P>
"Given the wide scope of the new cooperation between Turkey
and Israel, it is appropriate to ask whether Israeli pilots were
behind this incident which caused the death of four women and two
children and left 15 injured," it wrote.
</P>
<P>
"No doubt, our response should be tough and our Foreign
Ministry officials should note all the developments that
culminated in the close military agreement between Turkey and
Israel," it added.
</P>
<P>
The paper stressed that this unprecedented cooperation between
a Moslem state and Israel poses a major threat to the national
security of regional states.
</P>
<P>
The editorial also reminded the people of the incident by a
Turkish fighter, which killed nine people and injured many others
in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily "Jomhuri Islami" said in the editorial that
the repetition of such bitter incidents is indicative of the
existence of hands within the Turkish government to undermine
Tehran-Ankara relations.
</P>
<P>
Particularly, it noted, the Turkish government is showing no
interests to follow up the incidents and does not attempt to
compensate those affected by these attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily "Abrar" called Turkey as a "Trouble-making
neighbor" in the editorial, saying "the Turkish government in the
past 18 years has always been responsible for disruptions in
Ankara-Tehran ties."

<HEADLINE> Taylor Makes 75m Dollars Yearly from War: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAOGS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's factional war leader
Charles Taylor has made at lease 75 million U.S. Dollars every
year since the war in the country started six years ago, the
Guardian newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The money was mainly realized as booty from the sales of
Liberian diamonds, gold, iron ore and timber to companies mostly
in Belgium, France and Malaysia, the newspaper claimed, quoting a
U.S. state department official.
</P>
<P>
''Charles Taylor, who has long controlled the most lucrative
areas of the countryside, could have upwards of 75 million
Dollars a year passing through his hands,'' said Deputy Assistant
Secretary of State for African Affairs William Twadell, quoted by
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
This ''upwards of 75 million Dollars'' is in addition to
Taylor's share of the 16-20 million Dollars in his registry
revenues which he and the five other members of his Council of
State shared among themselves last year, Twadell told the Africa
subcommittee of the house of representatives.
</P>
<P>
Quoting ''publicly available statistics,'' the state
department official said that from 1990 to 1994, Liberia's
diamond exports averaged 300 million Dollars a year. During the
same period, timber exports averaged 53 million Dollars yearly,
and rubber exports 27 million Dollars a year. Iron ore exported
from 1990 to 1993 averaged almost 41 million Dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
Stating that ''the steady flow of arms depends on a steady
supply of money,'' Twadell identified Taylor's National Patriotic
Front of Liberia, his ally Alhaji Kromah's Ulimo-K and the
euphemistically named Liberian peace council as ''the primary
recipients of illicit arms shipment.''
</P>
<P>
But much of the work to achieve peace and stop the warlords
from flouting the United Nations arms embargo would have to be
done by neighboring countries, he said.

<HEADLINE> Subic Bay, Philippines, Sees Large Export Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Subic Bay, the former US military
base in the Philippines, saw its exports dramatically rise from
the level in 1995, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
In a report to President Fidel Ramos Friday, the Subic Bay
Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) said exports from Subic Bay reached
102 million US dollars in the first four months this year, or 520
percent more than the figure for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
SBMA Chairman Richard Gordon said Subic Bay is well on its way
to surpassing its 1995 total export value of 182 million dollars
and expected to hit at least 300 million US dollars in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Kaunda Insists on Running for Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's former president and
opposition leader Kenneth Kaunda is insisting on running for the
presidency in the forthcoming general elections scheduled later
this year, Zambia News Agency (ZAMA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda said in an interview that he himself and the
vice-president of his United National Independent Party (UNIP)
would stand for elections and that nobody would stop them.
</P>
<P>
The UNIP is a non-tribal party and ''we have great respect for
our party, nation, region and the future of Zambia... we are
action-oriented and use civil disobedience as a weapon for
struggle,'' Kaunda said.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, however, Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba is maintaining his stand that Kaunda is not qualified for
contending the presidency.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated on Wednesday that only Zambians should become
presidents of the country, saying the president has to be left
for real Zambians at all cost.
</P>
<P>
The present political strife in Zambia has arisen from a
constitution amendment which has gone into effect at the end of
May. According to the new constitution, only aboriginal Zambians,
or the grand sons of immigrants, are qualified to run for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
As Kaun accda's parents immigrated from neighboring Malawi
before the country's independence, he is not qualified for the
presidency according to the constitution amendment.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties are opposed to the constitution
amendment and they are making efforts to repeal it.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Olympian Jenny Thompson
took the limelight by chalking up two golds at the Santa Clara
International swimming meet in Santa Clara on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who was disappointed after failing to quality any
single events for the upcoming Atlanta Games, eased to victory in
the 100-meter freestyle and 100 butterfly in the final major
pre-Olympic tuneup meet.
</P>
<P>
Thompson, 23, a gold medalist in two relays in the 1992
Barcelona Games, clocked a winning time of 55.28 seconds in the
100m freestyle. She is also the event's American record-holder.
</P>
<P>
She had to pin her Olympic honor on the 4X100m freestyle
events, the only event she will participate in the Centennial
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Thompson also won the 100-meter butterfly in 1:04.
</P>
<P>
In the other events of the day, another U.S. Olympian, Allison
Wagner, captured the women's 400 individual medley in 4:48.82.

<HEADLINE> One Quarter Of Nairobi Women Are HIV Carriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 29 (Xinhua) -- One quarter of the women in
Nairobi are carrying HIV virus which causes the dead disease of
AIDS, an American official has said.
</P>
<P>
Gray Newton who is head of health and population in the United
States Agency for International Development (USAID) said 25
percent of the women attending antenatal clinics in the Kenyan
capital here are carriers of the virus.
</P>
<P>
He was announcing the preliminary results of Nairobi's 1995
AIDS survey at a luncheon hosted for him by the Kenyan Ministry
for Health on his being transferred to Cairo from here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Newton said that early in 1995 3.5 per cent of Kenyans were
carriers of the virus and the figure rose to 7.5 per cent at the
end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The U.S official appealed to the Permanent Secretary in the
Ministry for Health to request the Treasury to allocate more
money to assist in management of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Gray Newton said AIDS epidemic in Kenya is worse than
earthquake and asked all those concerned not to give lip-service
when attempting to reduce the number of AIDS infections in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Market Capitalization Up in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The market capitalization of all
stocks listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore increased 5.8
percent to about 192.1 billion US dollars in the first half of
this year, slightly below the overall earnings growth of companies
last year, the Straits Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the average net earnings of companies with
their financial years ending in December 1995 grew 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the local bourse's total capitalization rose by a
healthy 17.5 percent over the 163.6 billion US dollars level a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
It said that the figures were distorted by the overwhelming
presence of Singapore Telecom, which had enjoyed a fine run-up in
it share price for most of the year so far.
</P>
<P>
If the giant telecommunications company was excluded, growth in
market capitalization in the first six months would have been
flat, it said.
</P>
<P>
"This is not surprising as nothing of great consequence
happened so far as fundamentals are concerned," RHB-Cathay
research head Yang Sy Jian was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
There were merely six new listings in the first half of the
year, all of which were relatively small issues and thus failed to
have a significant impact on the market's total capitalization, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) was on a
roller-coaster ride, market watchers said.
</P>
<P>
A bright start in the year took the index to a record high of
2,493.71 points on February 6, but the market turned bearish soon
afterward, following a spate of poor corporate results exacerbated
by interest rate worries in the United States and the government's
crackdown on property speculation last month.
</P>
<P>
The STII ended the first half of the year at 2,296.21 points,
registering an increase of 1.7 percent. Meanwhile, the average
daily trading volume was 81.1 million units worth 311.9 million
Singapore dollars (about 222.79 million US dollars), significantly
up from the level of the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> HK Delegation Leaves for Textiles Talks with US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong delegation, led by
commissioner of Customs and Excise Lawrence Li, left here this
afternoon for Washington D.C. to continue consultations on
textiles with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral talks will mainly focus on the additional import
measures imposed by the United States on a number of textiles and
clothing products from Hong Kong, a government spokesman said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that during the consultations, the Hong Kong
delegation will maintain its fundamental objections to the
additional measures and to the way they have been introduced.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong has found the US measures discriminatory
and that they had been introduced unilaterally without any prior
consultations with Hong Kong nor adequate prior notice.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the measures are disruptive to Hong Kong's trade
and they affect both legitimate and illegitimate traders
indiscriminately."
</P>
<P>
"Since the implementation of the new measures on June 17, we
have receiving reports from the trade that already there have been
cancellation of orders and other adverse effects on trade," he
said.
</P>
<P>
If bilateral consultations failed to produce a satisfactory
solution, Hong Kong would reserve its rights to raise the matter
to the World Trade Organization, he added.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Afghan Conflict Far From Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The four-year-old Afghan civil
war is far from over despite the latest reconciliation between the
country's two major rival factions.
</P>
<P>
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Chief of the Hezb-i-Islami, entered Kabul
Wednesday and assumed the premiership of a new coalition
government in which his old rival Burhanuddin Rabbani remains as
the president.
</P>
<P>
Both Hekmatyar and Rabbani have highlighted the reconciliation
as a landmark in the Afghan peace process. However, observers here
believe that the process will be very difficult without the
participation of the Taliban, which keeps a large military force
and controls half of the Afghan territory.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, a new player of the Afghan bloody drama, has been
trying to take over Kabul since October last year after capturing
most of the Hekmatyar-held territory and some under Rabbani's
control.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban has totally rejected the Hekmatyar-Rabbani
reconciliation agreement signed on May 24, saying that the civil
war will be intensified if Hekmatyar and Rabbani plan to jointly
attack the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban held an emergency meeting earlier this month in
Kandahar, the second largest city of Afghanistan, which was also
attended by four small Afghan parties.
</P>
<P>
Besides denouncing Hekmatyar's "betrayal" to the anti-Rabbani
group, the meeting once again called for the unconditional
stepdown of Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban has been shelling and rocketing Kabul since last
Saturday. They intensified their attacks Wednesday in a bid to
prevent Hekmatyar from entering Kabul. More than 60 people have
been killed and over a hundred injured this week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the powerful Junbush-i-Melli leader, Rashid Dostum,
and the Junbush ally Hezb-i-Wahdat (Khalili group) have refused to
join the new coalition.
</P>
<P>
So far, among the 12 Afghan factions, five have been involved
in the newly-established coalition government while the rest have
boycotted it.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, Rabbani, Dostum and Hekmatyar are generally
believed to be the top four players in the Afghan arena and have
major influence on the situation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Among the 32 Afghan provinces, 13 are now under the control of
the Taliban. Dostum and the Hekmatyar-Rabbani alliance are
controlling seven and six provinces respectively.
</P>
<P>
Considering the Taliban's firm stand and its military strength,
Hekmatyar and Rabbani are reported to have been seeking Dostum's
support.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, one day before Hekmatyar's entry to Kabul, Dostum's
top aide Rasool Pahalwan was mysteriously killed by unknown gunmen
in an ambush near the Junbush headquarters of Mazar-i-Sharif in
northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Pahalwan, the number two Junbush leader and a famous hardliner,
had great influence on Dostum who has so far refused to follow
Hekmatyar and form an alliance with Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Dostum's swing to whatever faction will
have a decisive influence on the Afghan situation in the future.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the operation of the new coalition government will
no doubt exert a great influence on the political situation in the
country. Yet the future of the coalition government is still hard
to predict as it is facing major problems, including the limits of
the authority of the defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Although Rabbani has decided to give the portfolio to
Hekmatyar's party, he has also raised a proposal of setting up a
joint committee to command the coalition army.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar has offered to appoint a Rabbani's man as the deputy
defense minister in a bid to keep the balance in the military
power.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the future Afghan situation will
mainly depend on how the new government cope with its internal
troubles and its relations with other groups.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the long-running Afghan conflict can only be
solved peacefully when a broad-based government including all
parties is set up.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on CPO, Rubber Markets in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUE, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Crude palm oil (CPO), tin and
rubber markets in Malaysia ended the week mixed with CPO and
rubber prices lower while the tin price higher.
</P>
<P>
The price on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) closed the week
higher following bullish sentiment on the London Metal exchange
(LME).
</P>
<P>
The tin price rose 31 sen to end the week at 15.49 Malaysian
Ringgit (about 6.19 US dollars) per kg compared with 15.18 Ringgit
(about 6.07 dollars) per kg on last week's close.
</P>
<P>
Turnover rose to 561 tons this week from 506 tons for the
previous week.
</P>
<P>
The KLTM's price differential against the LME was at a premium
of 120 dollars per ton from a premium of 85 dollars per ton
previously.
</P>
<P>
Crude palm oil physicals ended the week lower in line with the
soft performance on the international markets.
</P>
<P>
The price for June South ended the week at 1,110 Ringgit (about
444 dollars) per ton, 15 Ringgit lower from 1,125 Ringgit (about
450 dollars) per ton last week.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian rubber market closed the week lower due to a lack
of direction.
</P>
<P>
Players were sidelined in a market that was still bearish. The
market saw price drifting throughout the week in line with the
weak Tokyo and Singapore future markets.
</P>
<P>
Players also said inquiries from China did little to improve
the weak market.
</P>
<P>
July RSS1 dipped 15.5 sen to close at 354 sen (about 1.41
dollars) per kg this week while SMR 20 dropped 11.5 sen to 299 sen
(about 1.2 dollars) per kg.

NEW DELHI, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The State Bank of India (SBI) is
finalizing plans to raise 250-300 million US dollars in the global
deposit receipts (GDR) market, SBI sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
SBI executives are keen to launch the GDR issue either in July
or early September this year. Investment bankers have said that
the bunching of issues should not cause any problems for SBI.
</P>
<P>
The SBI will use the money it collects from the issue to set up
two new subsidiaries, SBI gilts and SBI securities. It also needs
extra cash to fulfill capital adequacy requirement, the SBI
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Investment bankers said that the big American houses are the
favorites to win the SBI mandate. Lehman Brothers, for instance,
already has a tie-up with SBI caps.

<HEADLINE> SADC Organ to Respect Territorial Integrity: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) organ on politics, defense and security will not
be used to interfere in the domestic affairs of its member
states, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing journalists in Gaborone at the end of a closed
three hour extraordinary session of the SADC summit on Friday,
Mugabe, its first rotating chairman, emphasized the organ would
respect its members' territorial integrity and operate within the
principle of observing national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
It intervenes only after consultations with the respective
countries, zimbabwe national news agency quoted Mugabe as saying.
</P>
<P>
''There is no room for imposing one's will on anybody. The
fact of our being sovereign states demands that the principle of
sovereign states is taken into account,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to speculation, the summit did not dwell much on the
worsening political tension in Zambia and the leaders resolved
that the issue could be solved internally.
</P>
<P>
However, Zambian President Fredrick Chiluba was conspicuous by
his absence and conflicting reasons were given. SADC executive
secretary Kaire Mbuende said Chiluba is campaigning for the
October presidential elections while Botswana President Ketumile
Masire said he is officiating at a national show.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba was represented by his Foreign Minister Christon Tembo
who said the political tension in Zambia is being unnecessarily
internationalized.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe whose tenure of office as SADC chairman would be one
year, said the organ which was launched on Friday, once sensing
any instability in any country, would first consult the
government concerned.
</P>
<P>
However, the guidelines establishing the organ have a
provision for punitive measures, should a country choose to
ignore the diplomatic approach.
</P>
<P>
The organ has the potential of becoming a powerful force for
regional peace, stability and security, if its clauses which are
intolerant to human rights abuses and threatening behavior, are
followed to the letter, the news agency said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Choice of Profession Changing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- China's opening up to the outside
world has brought a big change in the favorite choices of
profession among Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The significant changes follow the rapid economic development
in the country, experts say.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the State Statistics Bureau found that the
traditional craze in China for edging into officialdom has
drastically waned, placing the option of "being cadres" and
"participating in important decision making" at the bottom of
personal values.
</P>
<P>
The survey, on the migrant population, was conducted in
Shenzhen and Foshan, both cities in south China's Guangdong
Province. Research on data gathered from the massive survey
spanned two years by experts from SSB and Germany's Koln
University. The research results will be published soon in Chinese
and English.
</P>
<P>
In Shenzhen, where people enjoy the highest social status,
professional choices are engineers and technicians. The social
status of businessmen, who were traditionally dubbed with the
stinging "none of the businessmen fail to be foxy", has been
raised, along with that of farmers.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen was only a town and a few scattered fishing hamlets
with just 50,000 residents in 1979. But the granting of special
economic zone status in 1980 brought about surging economic
development and waves of migrant laborers from the rest of the
country. By the end of last year, Shenzhen had 7.9 million people.
</P>
<P>
Chen Runtian, an expert from SSB, said that the elevation of
farmers in society benefited from their aggressive involvement
in the market economy.
</P>
<P>
"Shenzhen's agriculture has withered, since the majority of
farmers sold their land-use rights to industrialists for
lucrative profits," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Those who held on to their land-use rights earn wages by
working in village and township enterprises. Their land is
ploughed by their hirelings, and they grow mainly cash crops, such
as vegetables and flowers for local and Hong Kong and Macao
markets.
</P>
<P>
Compared with Shenzhen, Foshan, which got its name in the year
of 628, is more traditional in the value and views of its people,
according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Foshan people put officials as the most important job, followed
by professionals.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey finds people in both places view the family
as their most important asset and pursuit in their life, followed
by a "high-income job", "job promotion" and "leisure time."
</P>
<P>
Chen concluded that the survey has pinpointed one point in the
footprints of China's economic development. Because of the
disparity in development of coastal regions and inland areas,
"What happened to the people of Shenzhen and Foshan three years
ago will gradually take place in Hebei, Liaoning and other inland
areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that waves of migrant labors started following China's
reform and opening up to the outside world policy in late 1970s and
that the phenomenon of migrant laborers will exist for "a long
time, historically."

NEW DELHI, June 29 (Xinhua) -- India has increased its share of
world trade and has improved its world ranking.
</P>
<P>
India has improved its share of world trade to 0.62 percent
from 0.5 percent, an official quoted provisional data of the World

become more open and integrated with the global economy, the

<HEADLINE> Aouth China Farmers Make Profits From Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Throughout history, Chinese people
have blown off the heat of summer with ordinary fans. But for
farmers in Yangshuo county, fans mean money.
</P>
<P>
Yangshuo, in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
attracts millions of visitors each year for its beautiful mountain
scenery. However, the city is just as renowned for its fan
paintings.
</P>
<P>
Fuli, a town in Yangshuo, is considered the "home of fan
painting."
</P>
<P>
The town has more than 40,000 residents, and more than half are
engaged in fan painting or related businesses. The average annual
income for each household in the town is more than 10,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Yangshuo's painted fans are made of paper, cloth or silk, and
are 0.5 to 1 meter long. The ribs of the fans are made from
high quality bamboo strips.
</P>
<P>
Paintings on these fans illustrate people, mountains, water,
flowers, birds, tigers, leopards and horses, but most show the
famous scenic spots of Guilin and Yangshuo, both well-known
tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
Farmer Zhao Qiaofa and his entire family can make 20 to 30
painted fans every day, and they sell about 10,000 a year. Their
annual income from fan painting is more than 100,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of painted fans are sold in Fuli each year. These
fans are bought by tourists to Yangshuo, and also sold elsewhere
in China and abroad. Visitors often buy several of the painted
fans for themselves or to give to friends.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers not only have prospered from fan painting, they
also have improved their painting skills. Many fan paintings by
local farmers have been exhibited in the United States, Japan and
Singapore.

<HEADLINE> New Drug to Be Used in Snail Fever Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 29 (Xinhua) -- A new drug jointly developed by
two Chinese medical research institutes and a pharmaceutical
company will bring hope to prevention of snail fever.
</P>
<P>
The drug, named Artesunate, has proved an effective and safe
oral pill to prevent snail fever, a common endemic disease in
south China. Clinical trials on 467 patients have demonstrated the
success of the treatment.
</P>
<P>
Researchers have found that Artesunate can damage the outer
skin of immature worms of schistosomes, inhibiting the growing of
the worms and finally killing them.
</P>
<P>
The researchers from the Zhejiang Academy of Medical Science,
the Jiangxi Parasitosis Research Institute and the Guangxi Guilin
Pharmaceutical Factory, applied for trial use of the drug on 467
patients living in high-risk areas. The study found no side
effects caused by the drug.
</P>
<P>
However in a a separate control group of 397 patients, who did
not take Artesunate, three were found to be suffering snail fever
and the positive rate in stool examinations reached ten percent.
</P>
<P>
The drug has passed the assessment by China's Ministry of
Public Health.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Vows to Fortify Organization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP), the country's largest opposition, has vowed to intensify
organizational activities at all levels across the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing party leaders in Dhaka last night, BNP Chairperson
Khaleda Zia instructed leaders and workers of the party to
consolidate its position in the political arena.
</P>
<P>
The BNP, the ex-ruling party, secured 116 parliamentary seats
in the June 12 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Khaleda, the country's former prime minister, said the polls
proved that the BNP has a massive popularity among the common
people, adding that this public support should be sustained in
future.
</P>
<P>
She urged party leaders and workers to brave all types of
terrorism and injustice to make the BNP's message available at the
doorstep of people through mass contact programs, public meetings,
processions and rallies.
</P>
<P>
She also urged the country's newspapers to play an active role
in reflecting the actual situation of the country and the
condition of the people.
</P>
<P>
After the AL government headed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
was sworn in last Sunday, the BNP decided to join the parliament
as the opposition and extended its cooperation to the new
government.
</P>
<P>
But Khaleda's latest speech smacked of a stronger sense of
hostility, which echoed the atmosphere at a recent meeting of the
party's national executive committee, at which concern was raised
over "police atrocities" and "attacks" against BNP leaders and
workers by political opponents.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's Parliament Oks Post-Soviet Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Deputies of the Supreme Soviet of
Ukraine, the country's parliament, approved here today by 315 to
36 the new constitution, the country's first constitution since it
won independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the parliament announced that the country's
1978 constitution and the "Law on Power" adopted in 1995 are
invalid.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the new constitution automatically cancelled a
decree issued by President Leonid Kuchma on June 26 calling for a
national referendum to seek popular approval for the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The parliament decided that June 28 will be honored annually as
a national holiday of the country -- the Constitution Day.
</P>
<P>
Both Kuchma and parliament speaker Alexander Moroz spoke highly
of the new constitution.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma told the parliament that today Ukraine has become a
genuine Ukraine -- a Ukraine with its own constitution.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the approval of the new constitution ended the
period of transition of the country and Ukraine has entered a new
stage of historic development.
</P>
<P>
Moroz said that the approval of the new constitution is a
historic step of social harmony and a holiday of national unity.
</P>
<P>
The newly approved constitution provides broad powers for the
president and decided on a single-chamber parliament as at present.
</P>
<P>
It sets down the right to own private property and entrenches
Ukrainian as the sole state language in the country of 52 million
people.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's Crimean peninsula retains much of its autonomy in a
unitary state, according to the new constitution.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the constitution will promote the
process of political and economic reforms of the country and will
have a far reaching impact on the social development of Ukraine.

in the country this year are Hong Kong-based multinational
corporations, the officials noted.

<HEADLINE> Volcanic Mudflow Warned in Luzon, Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- A great volume of mudflow of
volcanic debris is expected to come down the slopes of Mt.
Pinatubo on the largest Philippine island of Luzon this year, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The warning was issued by the Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) at a conference on disaster
preparedness and management Friday in Angeles city at the foot of
the mountain.
</P>
<P>
According to Phivolcs Director Raymundo Punongbayan, some 70
million to 100 million cubic meters of lahar -- the volcanic
mudflow -- is expected to roll down the major river channels of
the mountain this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the threat of lahar will remain up to the year 2005,
when the lahar may drop to one million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The Phivolcs chief called for the repairing of the Gugu dike to
check the threat of floods and lahar flows to Angeles city.
</P>
<P>
The 24-kilometer Gugu dike, built at a cost of 120 million
pesos (4.6 million US dollars), failed to protect neighboring
cities and towns when many of its sections were damaged by lahar
flows in a major tropical storm in October last year.
</P>
<P>
The lahar flows, with a height of 20 feet, engulfed several
towns and killed an undetermined number of people last October.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices in Philippines to Rise Slightly in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Oil prices in the Philippines are
expected to rise slightly when the oil deregulation package takes
effect in August, the Philippine Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
Bayani V. Faylona, chairman of the country's Energy Regulatory
Board (ERB), doused speculations of a steep hike of oil prices
once the automatic pricing formula for petroleum products is put
into motion on August 18.
</P>
<P>
The automatic pricing formula allows domestic pump prices to be
adjusted upward or downward every month, based on movements in the
foreign-exchange rate and the prices of crude oil on the world
market.
</P>
<P>
Faylona did not categorically say that there would be a price
hike in August and declined to speculate on how much the impending
adjustment would be.
</P>
<P>
However, on the basis of the ERB figures, the increase may not
exceed 30 centavos (1.1 cents) per liter.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav President Says Karadzic Should Quit Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic
today urged Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to quit power
immediately so as to help the Serbs resume normal contacts with
the international community as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with the local newspaper, Politika Express,
Lilic said Bosnian Serbs need a leader who is acceptable to the
international community and able to guide the Republika Srpska, a
Serb entity in Bosnia, back to the right track of development.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic is obviously not such a leader, Lilic said.
</P>
<P>
Under the mounting pressures from the international community
and Yugoslavia, Karadzic has offered on Wednesday his conditional
resignation as "President" and withdrawal from Bosnia's
nation-wide election on September 14.
</P>
<P>
But his conditions were regarded as unacceptable by the
international community, and International envoy Carl Bildt
threatened on Friday that sanctions would be reimposed upon
Belgrade or the Bosnian Serbs if Karadzic, who is indicted as a
war criminal by the Hague International Tribunal, failed to resign
by July 1.
</P>
<P>
However, Lilic denied the reports of possible resumption of
sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, saying his
country has been always making efforts to cooperate with the
international community and to fulfil its obligations in the
Dayton peace accord which ended the nearly four-year Bosnian war.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTO DOMINGO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Dominican Republic was
expecting the arrival of the general secretary of the Organization
of American States (OAS) and three former presidents from OAS
member states, who will observe the country's second round
elections on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
OAS General Secretary Cesar Gaviria and former presidents Jimmy
Carter of the United States, Belisario Betancur of Colombia and
Ramiro de Leon Carpio of Guatemala are due to arrive here today at
the end of the electoral campaigns of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
A civic movement created by several groups to prevent electoral
fraud, called "Citizens' Network of Electoral Observers", said it
has mobilized some 5,000 observers to witness polling in all the
108 municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Some 22,000 members of the National Police have been ready in
their barracks since 6:00 a.m. (local time) today, while Police
Commander Maj. Gen. Camilo Nazir Tejada announced a rigorous
surveillance in the voting stations to maintain order during

<P>
Some 3.7 million Dominicans will go to cast their ballots in
some 10,376 voting booths, said the Central Electoral Board.

the general elections on May 16 to win outright.
</P>
<P>
The race is to be fought between the Dominican Revolutionary
Party (PRD) candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez and his rival

<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Tegucigalpa,
capital of Honduras, were amazed last night when a two-meter-long
alligator was seen "strolling" in the main avenues of the city,
near a national museum.
</P>
<P>
People in the area said that the reptile emerged from a tunnel
located in a gulch in the city.
</P>
<P>
A caiman expert said that it is very unusual that an animal of
this species, which can grow to three meters, could have grown in
the premises, because its natural habitat is living in the
tropical climate zones.
</P>
<P>
People spent several hours to capture the alligator and put it
into an iron cage to return it back to its natural habitat.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Poland and Lithuania have signed
agreements on free trade and industrial cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were signed after the talks between Polish Prime
Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz and Lithuanian Prime Minister
Mindaugas Stankyavicius, who paid a visit to Poland on June 27-28.
</P>
<P>
Under the free trade agreement, 90 percent of the industrial
products and 70 percent of the agricultural products of the two
countries will be exempted from customs duties as of the beginning
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Before 2001, the two countries will gradually exempt or reduce
the tariff on the so-called sensitive products which refer to cars
and textile products in Poland and sugar and flour in Lithuania,
the agreement said.
</P>
<P>
Cimoszewicz spoke highly of the free trade agreement, saying
that it is the first step for Lithuania to become a member of the
Central Europe Free Trade Zone (CEFTZ), which comprises Poland,
the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia now.
</P>
<P>
It is also an important event in the bilateral relations
between the two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
The industrial departments of the two countries will cooperate
and help each other in establishing new industrial complex and in
markets in the third countries, according to the industrial
cooperation agreement.
</P>
<P>
They will exchange experts, offering latest technology and
consultation to each other, the agreement said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will also cooperate in the fields of
petro-chemical industry, vehicle manufacturing, food processing
and agricultural machinery industry.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Stankyavicius also held talks with Polish
President Aleksander Kwasnievski and Jozef Zych, speaker of the
House of Representatives of Poland.
</P>
<P>
They discussed the political, economic and cultural relations
between the two countries and exchanged views on regional and
international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Both prime ministers said that their countries attach much
importance to the development of the economic and trade relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
There is still potential for further development of the
bilateral relations between Poland and Lithuania despite the rapid
progress of ties in the past few years, the two sides agreed.

GENEVA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- World Breaststroke Champion
Samantha Riley's coach Scott Volkers had his 12-month ban reduced
to seven months, according to the decision by the Lausanne-based
International Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ban reduce means that Volkers now can go to Atlanta next
month to coach Riley at the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The CAS said three of its arbitrators considered an appeal by
Volers and decided that his year-long ban should come to an end on
June 30.
</P>
<P>
Samantha Riley of Australia, world 100 and 200 meters
breaststroke champion, tested positive at the World Short Course
Championships in Rio de Janeiro after grabbing two golds in both
events. Her coach stood out and took all the resposibility
alleging that he unintertionally gave her a painkiller for her
headache that contain suspended substance.
</P>
<P>
Riley escaped with a warning after the International Swimming
Federation (FINA) decided that the drug in question was not
performance-enhancing but Volkers was accused of negligence for
giving her the drug and took the blame.
</P>
<P>
He was given a two-year ban. It was cut to one year on appeal
but that still ruled him out of the Atlanta Games.

<HEADLINE> Taking Better Care of Nurses Essential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Tiring work, low income and poor
welfare benefits have prompted many nurses, who called "angels in
white" in China, to "fly" out of the nursing profession, according
to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
China now has 3.13 million beds, however, only 1.13 million
nurses. At least 130,000 are needed.
</P>
<P>
The hospitals nationwide are shortage of nurses, according to
Zeng Xiyuan, president of the Beijing-based Chinese Nursing
Association, when the balance is not maintained, nurses will be
over burdened and patients cannot be properly cared for.
</P>
<P>
"A nurse in China usually works a night shift for an average of
120 days every year. This makes it difficult for them to care for
their own family. According to State regulations, a nurse in
Beijing can earn only two yuan allowance for working a night
shift," said Zeng, who once worked as a nurse in Beijing Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Promotions and the distribution of housing are based on
schooling, which leaves nurses in an unfavorable position because
90 percent of them graduate from nursing schools and do not have a
college diploma.

HAVANA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- In defiance of the U.S.
Helms-Burton law, Cuba and Switzerland signed an agreement here
today to promote and protect each other's investments to further
enhance economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
The United States began in late March to implement the
Helms-Burton law, which aimed to tighten its decades-old economic
sanctions against Cuba. The new anti-Cuba action was taken after
Cuban Air Force shot down two small U.S. airplanes early this
year. Havana has accused Washington of violating the air space of
the island country.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, named after two U.S. congressmen, met strong
opposition from U.S. trade partners worldwide, including Europe,
Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Investment Minister Ibrahim Ferradaz and a Swiss
trade official, Nicolas Imboden, signed the document.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss official will meet with Foreign Trade Minister
Ricardo Cabrisas, Economy and Planning Minister Jose Rodriguez and
the President of the National Bank Francisco Soberon.
</P>
<P>
Imboden, who headed a 15-member delegation, arrived in Havana
on Thursday.

<P>
MANILA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bayern Motor Works (BMW) group,
one of the world's largest car manufacturers, is seeking to
conquer Asian markets, including the Philippines, by expanding its
volume of sales by 25 percent in the next five years, the Manila
Chronicle reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the BMW car sales in the Philippines have been
growing since the group established a joint venture in 1993 with
its Philippine counterpart, Manila Center Motor Works.
</P>
<P>
However, the BMW cars on the Philippine market are assembled by
local importers, for car imports are practically impossible in the
country, as well as in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the BMW's Asia-Pacific office, the group has been
selling some 40 million cars in Asia since 1995, with the biggest
shares of its sales going to China and Japan.

SHANGHAI, June 29 (Xinhua) -- With the improvement of living
conditions and residences in modern China, Chinese families have
begun to pay greater attention to interior decoration, something
that was simply not affordable for most people several years ago.
</P>
<P>
The problem now however, is just what kind of decorative

</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the China International Building and Interior

is coming to the rescue and may be just the good news that the
modern troubled family with cash to spend faces.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The air routes from Beijing to
Shanghai and Guangzhou are scheduled to be handed over completely
to the control of civil aviation departments, effective one minute
after midnight June 29.
</P>
<P>
In the past, state limitations on the use of airspace and
altitude made it difficult for the country's civil aviation
departments to open new air routes or add flights, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the departments are able to arrange flights
details, including distance, altitude, flying time, and number of
flights, on the two air routes, below an altitude of 12,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government first gave approval to civil aviation
departments to control Beijing-Guangzhou-Shenzhen air route
themselves in April of 1994.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, more air routes will be controled by civil
aviation departments, authorities say.

<HEADLINE> Fujian's Struggle to Contain Pollution (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 29 (Xinhua) -- When a foreign businessman was
inspecting the investment environment last March in Fujian, the
southeast coastal province with the healthy economy, local
officials made some frantic changes in the itinerary for a very
important reason: avoid the pollution.
</P>
<P>
The route originally planned would go past Jingjiang and
Nan'an, along the Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway, an area notorious for its
pollution and smog caused by the local ceramics industry.
</P>
<P>
Today, such last minute changes have become less of a headache
for Fujian as local governments bring the worst pollution under
control. A number of the serious polluters have been closed down
and many other pollution sources have been brought under control.
</P>
<P>
One of China's more thriving provinces, Fujian has seen rapid
economic growth in the last couple of years, but the economic
miracle has had a price tag: it was achieved at the expense of
clean air and water, the result of dumping of industrial waste
water, gas, and materials.
</P>
<P>
According to sources there, the province has established nearly
20,000 overseas-funded enterprises and 670,000 township
enterprises, about 70 percent of which are processing industries
characterized by high input, high consumption, and low output.
</P>
<P>
The provincial environmental protection agency reports that the
water pollution in the Minjiang, the major river in the province,
in the ceramics industry, and the waste gas from the shoe-making
industry are three major pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
The pollution had hindered the readjustment and improvement of
the industrial structure. Overseas businessmen to the province
have placed increasingly higher demands for better environmental
protection. This has prompted provincial officials to look at the
issue more seriously and say that Fujian must no longer seek
higher economic growth by sacrificing the environment.

<HEADLINE> Fujian's Struggle to Contain Pollution (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chen Mingyi, the province's governor, said that only by making
optimal use of resources and minimizing environmental pollution
can Fujian stand the fierce market competition. "Environmental
protection is a challenge to Fujian as well as an opportunity," he
noted
</P>
<P>
In June last year, the province started a campaign against
pollution targeting at the three major pollution sources. It
closed all glass mosaic production enterprises that were serious
polluters and pushed new technology in 2,500 kilns and for the
shoe-making business in Quanzhou, a coastal city and Putian,
another economic center.
</P>
<P>
The province is working on a vast pollution control project in
the Minjiang River Valley. It has also increased cooperation with
Britain, the United States, and Singapore in environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
An environmental protection information center funded by the
World Bank began operation earlier this year and more is being
done to cooperate with Taiwan region in monitoring the ocean
environment.
</P>
<P>
The province has seen some good results in pollution
control. In Jingjiang City, piles of coal disappeared from the
ceramic factories and quality controls have been increased.
</P>
<P>
Chen Fuxi, director of Jingjiang City Environmental Protection
Bureau, says that the amount of smog has fallen from an annual 22
million tons to four million tons this year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the great progress in pollution control, however, local
officials are still not confident about the achievements. "Fujian
is still plagued by weak economic power, lack of advanced
technology, and expertise in environmental protection," explains
Yang Mingyi, director of the provincial environmental protection
bureau, who says that the province has a long way to go in
controlling the problem.

<P>
NEW YORK, June 28 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks moved higher
broadly, encouraged by the sharp decline of the long-term
interest rates and continuous rebound of technology issues.
</P>
<P>
But the Dow Jones industrial average fell 22.90 to 5,654.63,
as some blue chips lost steam.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly 5-to-2 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,820 up, 743 down and 624 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume totaled 462.11 million shares, much higher than
405.21 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 1.62 to 359.20, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.08 to 670.63.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 15.96 points to 1,181.97.
</P>
<P>
Bonds jumped again today, and the yield on the 30-year Treasury
bond fell below 6.90 percent, down from late Thursday's 6.99. Two
weeks ago, the yield surged to nearly 7.20 percent amid growing
fears of higher inflation, which makes bonds and their fixed rate
of return less enticing.
</P>
<P>
Although recent readings on inflation have been tame, signs of
strong employment and wage growth have spurred worries that a
rapid increase in consumer spending power would generate too much
demand and inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Fed's policy makers will be deciding next week whether to
raise interest rates as a means to muffle inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported this morning that the nation's
economy was growing at a moderate 2.2 percent annual rate as
winter ended and recent signs suggest it picked up momentum as
summer approached. The revised advance in the January-March gross
domestic product was down from the 2.3 percent gain reported a
month ago and 2.8 percent estimated in April.

<HEADLINE> Atalanta Needs Outside Force to Move Olympic Athletes, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 28 (Xinhua/OANA) -- With the Olympics less
than one month away, Atlanta officials are busy in preparing for
transportation facilities and finding enough drivers and buses to
ensure a smooth movement of the athletes, VIPs, media and
spectators during the Games on July 19-August 4.
</P>
<P>
Construction worders are battling round the clock to repave
more than 30 miles of the city's downtown streets. Engineers are
installing cameras at road crosses for remote control of traffic.
And the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) is
trying to find enough drivers and vihicles for peak movement of
game players and watchers.
</P>
<P>
Organizers expect one million passengers a day during the
games, two times the normal capacity of MARTA. So it will be a
great challenge to the MARTA system. It has to manage the moving
of people to and from downtown, considering that most of the
Olympic competition will take place in the downtoun area,
including the track and field events at the 85.000-seat Olympic
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that MARTA will be pressed to its fullest.
About 200 of its 240 rail cars and its fleet of 700 buses will
be fully used.
</P>
<P>
However, a total of 2,000 buses will be required and 3,600
drivers needed. The organizers have to hire 1,500 buses from other
transit systems from other cities and thousands of drivers.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 of the drivers will come from the military and
another 1,000 from other cities, while the rest will be hired from
the rest of the Atlanta area. To boost enrollment, organizers
increased pay for drivers from around seven dollars to nine
dollars an hour.
</P>
<P>
Arrangement has been made to ensure the rolling of the games.
The military drivers will be asigned to drive the athletes to and
from their competition. Several hundred buses will be used by the
organizers for its athletes, VIPs and media. About 400 other
buses, including school buses will be used to transport staff and
volunteers. And some 100 motor coaches, which contain room for
luggage underneath, have rented for transportation of Olympic VIPs
from the Atlanta airport to their accommodations.
</P>
<P>
However, what the organizers are concerned about is the so
called "background traffic," which could cause havoc to the
transportation plan. It reffers to non-Olympic Atlantans who live
in the city and use the tranportation system for everyday
commutes, a recent Washington Post report said.
</P>
<P>
The organizers hope spectators to walk between events to be
held in places within the Olympic Ring and hope the weather will
not disrupt outdoor events so as to avoid double amount of
tranportation users for later date events.

<HEADLINE> Injured Becker Pulls Out of Wimbledon Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WIMBLEDON, ENGLAND, June 28 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Three-times
Wimbledon Champion Boris Becker of Germany was unable to fulfill
his cherished hope of winning a fourth Wimbledon title as he was
injured earlier today and forced to pull out of the Championships.
</P>
<P>
Second seed Becker was the latest of a series of top seeds
casualties including Andre Agassi, Stepan Edberg, Michael Chang,
Jim Courier and world women's joint number one Monica Seles since
the beginning of the fortnight Championships.
</P>
<P>
In a third-round match with South African player Neville
Godwin played earlier today, the German tennis ace, who ranked
fourth in the world, suffered an unexpected wrist injury and was
later forced to pull out.
</P>
<P>
Becker is considered one of the hottest candidates to win the
Wimbledon men's singles honour as top seeds Jim Courier and French
Open Champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov, also in the lower half, crashed
out of the first two rounds.
</P>
<P>
Becker's dramatic exit means the lower half of the draw now
has only two seeds left, number 11 Wayne Ferreira and 13 Todd
Martin of the United States, who are scheduled to meet in the
semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the pull-out, Becker said, "It is a big
diappointment for me. I felt I was ready for something major here.
</P>
<P>
The German player said that he was convinced that the injury
was serious, "I had many injuries in my carrer before and I know
when it was serious."
</P>
<P>
In the women's third round competitions today, 11th-seeded
Brenda Schultz-McCarthy of the Netherlands became another casualty
by losing to Belgian Sabine Appelmans 5-7, 6-3, 10-12.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former French Open and U.S. Open Champion Sanchez
Vicario and Mary Joe Fernandez of the United States defeated their
Japanese and Argentine opponents respectively in straight sets to
enter the last sixteen.
</P>
<P>
Defending Chamipion Pete Sampras of the United States and
Steffi Graf of Germany are to take on their unseeded opponents in
the third round matches on Saturday to fight for a berth in the
last sixteen.

<HEADLINE> US Officials Outline Major Issues at G-7 Lyon Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lyon, France, June 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S President Bill Clinton's
two major assistants, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and
Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin, today outlined main issues
the United States was pressing during the three-day G-7 summit.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing here this afternoon, Christopher said the
U.S. government identified two priority areas that attention
should be focused on: first, securing the peace in Bosnia and
second, combating international crime and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
About the situation in Bosnia, Christopher said "very
considerable strides" in implementing the Dayton Agreement have
been achieved. The guns have fallen silent in Bosnia and the
opposing military forces have been separated and "they're now
demobilizing." The parties have agreed, only a few days ago, to
far-reaching conventional arms reductions and virtually all the
prisoners of war have been released.
</P>
<P>
He noted the long-term project of reconstruction is underway
and elections will take place as scheduled under the Dayton
agreement on September 14 this year.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said the U.S. government insists that indicated war
criminals like Karadzic must be removed from power, removed from
influence, be out of the country, and in the hands of the War
Crimes Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Talking about combat terrorism, the U.S. secretary of state
said that Thursday night, at the urging of both President Clinton
and French President Chirac, the G-7 summit adopted a statement
declaring the fight against terrorism to be "an absolute priority
for all of them." The 40-point program of anti-terrorism which is
expected to be adopted at Saturday's meeting "represents a very
important series of steps in addressing what is obviously one of
the most important problems facing the world today," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the economic field, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Robert
Rubin said the G-7 leaders welcomed the broad movements in
exchange rates in the major currencies since April 1995 and
instructed their finance ministers to continue to cooperate on
economic and foreign exchange matters.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the G-7 leaders welcomed the progress achieved in
implementing the Halifax initiatives, which were designed to
strengthen the financial system, including the establishment of an
earlier warning system through the disclosure requirements
promulgated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, Rubin said, the leaders reaffirmed a result-oriented
partnership for development which emphasizes the importance of
sound economic policies and good governance in the developing
world. Assistance would be focused particularly on poverty
alleviation and stimulating private sector development, he added.
</P>
<P>
The 22nd G-7 summit, which started Thursday, is expected to
conclude Saturday after adopting a political statement.

<HEADLINE> Blair Tries to Defuse Anger on Policy Shift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- British Opposition Leader Tony
Blair today desperately quelled a growing storm both within and
outside his party over his plans to hold a referendum on a
Scottish parliament.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Edinburgh, where he is selling the policy change
direct to his supporters, Blair said he had to win the consent of
the Scottish people before Labor could set up a tax levying
parliament in Scotland, according to a report from Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
Labor's Scottish executive has backed Tony Blair's plans for a
referendum on Scottish devolution by 20 votes to four. But
Scottish Nationalists said Blair had betrayed his party's
commitment to Scotland, caving in to Tory pressure.
</P>
<P>
The proposal has not only infuriated the Scottish Labor Party,
but also has prompted the resignation of Lord Ewing, a Labor peer,
from his post as co-chairman of the Scottish Constitutional
Convention, the body which drew up the blueprint for a Scottish
parliament.
</P>
<P>
John McAllion, a Labor frontbench spokesman on Scotland, was
threatening to resign, although Donald Dewar, the chief whip, made
strenuous attempts to dissuade him, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Shadow Cabinet was only fully informed of the plan
Wednesday night, the day after it had leaked to the press.
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Prime Minister John Major, Deputy Prime Minister
Michael Heseltine and Michael Forsyth, the Scottish secretary, did
their best to exploit the turmoil. In a barnstorming performance
in the Commons, Heseltine said Labor's policy was in a "shambles"
and he accused Blair of being panicked into holding a referendum.
</P>
<P>
"He has sold out his promises to Scotland at the first whiff of
anxiety in Middle England," Heseltine said.

<HEADLINE> China Hopes to Forge Cooperative Ties With Norway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSLO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
expressed his hope here today that China and Norway will establish
"a friendly and cooperative relationship of long-term stability
oriented towards the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
At the banquet held by Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem
Brundtland tonight in his honor, Jiang said Sino-Norwegian
relations have developed smoothly over the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The economies of the two countries have their respective
advantages and are highly complementary to each other, and the
bilateral economic relations and trade have grown rapidly these
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
In international affairs, both China and Norway are committed
to the cause of peace and development and hold identical or
similar views on many manor international issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that to further develop Sino-Norwegian relations
"is not only in conformity with the common interests of our two
countries, but also conducive to world peace, stability and
development."
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that with our joint efforts, China and Norway
will establish and develop, on the basis of mutual respect,
equality and mutual benefit, a friendly and cooperative
relationship of long-term stability oriented towards the 21st
century," the president said.
</P>
<P>
On domestic issues, the Chinese president said China will
continue to further intensify the reform, open still wider to the
outside world and work hard to attain the grand goal of building
China into a strong, democratic, culturally advanced and modern
socialist country.
</P>
<P>
"The development and prosperity of China constitute a positive
factor for world peace and stability and also open up a broad
prospect of expanded cooperation between China and all the other
countries in the world, including Norway," Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
At the banquet, the Norwegian prime minister said she was
delighted that the Chinese president visited Norway for the first
time, which "confirms extensive exchanges between us and will
further expand and push forward bilateral friendship and
cooperation," Prime Minister Brundtland told the Chinese guests.
</P>
<P>
"With her rich resources, culture and history of several
thousand years, China is playing a more and more important role.
In international affairs, we needs China as an active and reliable
cooperator; in developing international trade and working out
global laws and rules, we need China as a partner; in solving
global environment problems, we need China as a participant," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy will lead the world early in the next
century and the development mode of the Chinese economy is
important not only to China itself but to the whole world as well,
the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to bilateral cooperation, Brundtland said Norway
can offer technical expertise to China in the fields of maritime
navigation, energy, chemical industry, environment protection and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here Thursday for a three-day state visit to
Norway, the first such visit ever paid by a Chinese president.
During his stay in Oslo, he held talks with the prime minister,
King Harald V, parliament President Kirsti Kolle Grondahl and
local business leaders.
</P>
<P>
Jiang will continue his trip to Romania, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan
and Kazakhstan before flying home on July 6.
