<HEADLINE> Starr's Ethics Adviser Suddenly Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Sam Dash, U.S. Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's ethics adviser, resigned abruptly on
Friday to protest Starr's decision to testify in the House
impeachment hearing against President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"You have violated your obligations under the independent
counsel statute and have unlawfully intruded on the power of
impeachment," the press quoted Dash as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I resign for a fundamental reason," Dash said in a letter to
Starr. "Against my strong advice, you decided to depart from your
usual professional decision-making by accepting the invitation of
the House Judiciary Committee to appear ... and serve as an
aggressive advocate for the proposition that the evidence ...
demonstrates that the president committed impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
"As independent counsel you have only one narrow duty under the
statute relating to the House's power of impeachment," Dash
wrote. "That one duty ... is to objectively provide for the House
substantial and credible information that may constitute grounds
for impeachment."
</P>
<P>
Dash has counseled Starr on a wide range of issues for the past
four years, reviewing evidence and participating in the process on
deciding whether grand jury indictments should be sought.
</P>
<P>
Dash, chief counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee a quarter
century ago, has been a lawyer for nearly five decades and teaches
at Georgetown University Law Center.
</P>
<P>
Dash, a registered Democrat, has long said that if Starr failed
to heed his advice, he would not stay on in the post.
</P>
<P>
"You have no right or authority under the law, as Independent
Counsel, to advocate for a particular position on the evidence
before the Judiciary Committee or to argue that the evidence in
your referral is strong enough to justify a decision by the
Committee to recommend impeachment," Dash wrote.
</P>
<P>
In his two-page letter, Dash said that "my decision to leave
has nothing whatsoever to do with the many unfounded and
misinformed attacks on your conduct as independent counsel.
Through most of your tenure, I have been fully informed by you and
your staff on all major decisions.... Where I disagreed, you
showed your willingness to be open to my advice and you came to
different decisions."
</P>
<P>
Dash said that Starr and his staff had conducted themselves
"with integrity and professionalism", said the reports.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Needs Supportive Climate for Growth: UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. official said here
Friday that Zambia needed supportive climate for growth since it
faced numerous challenges in its industrial development and
modernization, according to Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of African Industrialization Day falling on
Friday, Miels Biering, country director of the U.N. Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO), said if Zambia and its
neighbors were to reap benefits of a single market, to create
more jobs and fight poverty, a sustainable industrialization was
essential.
</P>
<P>
He called on managers in industries to be more competitive by
selling more of what they produced especially to the overseas
market.
</P>
<P>
"The industrial base must be expanded to generate more jobs
which must be achieved in an era of global economic upheavals and
constant change," Biering said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that what was needed was the balancing concerns
for a competitive economy, making it grow and become more
competitive with structural changes.
</P>
<P>
The UNIDO official added that Zambia's economy should take
advantage of the existing infrastructure to support a "dynamic"
export-oriented industry by adding value to the country's rich
natural resources and agricultural produce.
</P>
<P>
"This would not only multiply the non-traditional export
earnings many times over but allow the establishment of thousands
of industrial jobs by attracting domestic and foreign investment
in the global market," said Biering.
</P>
<P>
He further said that such a situation would dramatically
increase government revenue and above all be a powerful and
sustainable contribution toward poverty alleviation and
socio-economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Acquit Osama of Terrorism Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
has acquitted Saudi dissident Osama Bin Laden on charges of his
alleged involvement in terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban announced the decision Friday, as they were not
provided any proof in this regard till November 20, a report
reaching here from the Afghan capital of Kabul said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the Taliban had asked the United States to provide
proof of Osama Bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activities in
Kenya and Tanzania so that they bring him to justice .
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a spokesman of the Taliban as saying that as
they were not provided with any proof so the matter should be
closed.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban announcement made an end to a three-week inquiry
headed by Afghanistan's Chief Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib into
allegations that Laden is waging a war of terror against the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"It's over and America has not presented any evidence," Saqib
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Without any evidence, Bin Laden is a man without sin ... he is
a free man," he said.
</P>
<P>
Osama Bin Laden has been living in Afghanistan for years with
the permission of the Taliban, who control most of the Afghan
territory.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. court has indicted Bin Laden in connection with the
August 7 bombings of the two U.S. embassies in East Africa that
killed 224 people.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago Washington offered a 5 million U.S. dollar reward
for the capture of Bin Laden, something the Taliban said was
tantamount to encouraging terrorist activity inside their
war-shattered country.

<HEADLINE> Allied Forces in Congo (K) to Protect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe said Friday peacemaking and peace enforcement operations
by allied forces in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) should
be viewed within the context of non-aggression and Congolese
community's desire to protect its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the restoration of peace in the DRC should create
a conducive atmosphere for development and promotion of
self-determination which should lead to the start of the
democratization process and a program for a legitimate
government.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at the graduation of senior army officers who
underwent joint command and staff course in Harare, the Zimbabwe
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the southern African region remained hopeful that
the current military and diplomatic efforts toward the
restoration of peace would culminate in a permanent solution to
the crisis in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
A total of 43 senior army officers from different African
countries were presented with certificates at the end of the
46-week-long course.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said constant training of members of the Zimbabwean
defense forces was the corner-stone of the country's defense
which enabled it to produce well-trained and well-equipped
soldiers against any would-be aggressors.
</P>
<P>
A total of 272 officers from all over the continent were
trained this year in different courses at the Zimbabwe Staff
College.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Committee Extends Impeachment Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Soon after Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr testified in U.S. President Bill Clinton's
affair with Monica Lewinsky Thursday, U.S. House Judiciary
Committee decided to extend the inquiry into the Kathleen Willey
case and other matters.
</P>
<P>
Before exhausted lawmakers went home Thursday night, they met
in closed session to extend the inquiry. Majority Republicans
approved subpoenas for Clinton's lawyer in the Paula Jones case,
Robert Bennett; Daniel Gecker, attorney for Willey, a former White
House aide; and an acquaintance of Willey, major Democratic donor
Nathan Landow.
</P>
<P>
Committee officials announced that Clinton's closest aide,
Bruce Lindsey, also would be subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
No vote was required, because Democrats did not object. All
four will appear for sworn interviews in closed session, but it is
not clear that they would testify at hearings.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who is on visit in Asia, said Friday he did take issue
with the committee's vote to subpoena Bennett, according to the
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, there has never been a case where a person's
lawyer was asked to come and testify," Clinton told reporters at
Tokyo's Haneda airport before boarding Air Force One for South
Korea, his second-leg tour.
</P>
<P>
Starr made a 12-hour appearance before the committee Thursday,
fencing with Democrats and basking in Republican praise before
trading arguments with David Kendall, Clinton's private lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Although Starr's presentation was praised by Republicans, his
decision to testify before the committee resulted in the
resignation of his ethics adviser, former Senate Watergate
Committee Counsel Sam Dash.
</P>
<P>
Dash said in a letter to Starr that in testifying, Starr had
become "an aggressive advocate for the proposition" that Clinton
had committed impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day Thursday, Democrats pounded Starr with
allegations of misconduct, accusing him of failing to disclose
contacts with Paula Jones' lawyers to the Justice Department and
by discouraging Lewinsky from calling her lawyer last January,
when prosecutors and FBI agents working for Starr first confronted
her about the affair with the president.
</P>
<P>
Starr denied the allegations.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Trying to Protect People From Terrorism: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government is
doing all it can to sensitize its population against all kinds of
terrorism which is becoming increasingly rampant across the
country, a senior security official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Permanent Secretary of
Internal Affairs Bachengana Paul said sensitization is his
ministry's big task now.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Internal Affairs, together with the military
intelligence, Internal Security Organization and External
Security Organization, has launched several sensitization
programs to let people be aware of the potential dangers they may
be exposed to, he said.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure security down to the grassroots, Uganda has set up
local defense units to work under police. They are selected from
local people and receive best military training. Their work is to
keep security in villages," he added.
</P>
<P>
When asked about measures taken to curb terrorism in urban
areas, the official said anti-terrorism squads were formed in
August 1998 to monitor and fight against terrorists.
</P>
<P>
"Even when I am talking to you, a big operation of this nature
is going on," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Rebels in the north and west also infiltrate into Kampala and
other parts of the country. They hit and run. But we can
identify the terrorists by intelligence and can destroy them," he
said in English with a strong accent.
</P>
<P>
He said that foreigners should be more careful because
terrorists often target them in order to scare foreign investors
away and by doing this tarnish the image of the government.
</P>
<P>
They just want to attain the aim of toppling the government by
letting people hate the government, he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,000 new policemen have been added to the police
force this year and more will be recruited, he added.

<HEADLINE> Report of Terrorism in Kampala Exaggerated: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The report about terrorists'
plan to blow up Kampala at the time of Nairobi bombing was
exaggerated, a senior Ugandan government official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In an one-hour interview, Permanent Secretary of Internal
Affairs Bachengana Paul said it is true that some terrorists
wanted to bomb some big places here, but the explosives they
would use are not more powerful than those used in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision daily reported on September 24 that 18
suspected terrorists held by security had confessed they had
targeted at least four places here including the U.S. embassy,
the post office, and a big market the day the Nairobi and
Dar-es-Salaam bombings took place in early August.
</P>
<P>
Some of the suspects have been released because they have not
been proved guilty, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said security has been tight in the whole of the
capital city and important buildings are carefully guarded.
</P>
<P>
In response to the question whether some other places were
also targeted, he said: "Terrorists are clever people. They are
no fools. When they tell you they will target one place, they
most probably hit another."
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that the police are under-funded and training
has just resumed this month after being neglected for a long
time.

<HEADLINE> 841 Farms Acquired for Zimbabwe's Resettlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Deputy Minister of
Lands and Agriculture Olivia Muchena said Friday the 841 land
acquisition orders that have been served to white commercial
farmers were in line with the Land Acquisition Act gazetted last
year.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters at a press conference in Harare, Muchena
denied allegations that it was a new list of farms that the
government was forcibly acquiring.
</P>
<P>
The commercial farmers said that they had never been consulted
with and no assessments for compensation had been done.
</P>
<P>
But Muchena said since the orders were sent it meant that the
farms had been assessed.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister reminded commercial farmers that last year
the government gazetted the preliminary notice to acquire 1,471
farms throughout the country as part of the phase two of the land
reform program.
</P>
<P>
She said so far 118 farms with a total of about 200,000
hectares had been offered to the government.
</P>
<P>
Since independence in 1980, the government has resettled about
70,000 landless families. In the next five years, it plans to
resettle another 90,000 landless families.

ADDIS ABABA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Natural Gum
Processing and Marketing Enterprise of Ethiopia said Friday that
it will sell out 17.9 million Birr (2.5 million U.S. Dollars) of
natural gum in 1998/99, over 30 percent more than the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Arega Habtewold, general manager of the state-owned
enterprise, told the press here that it will gather some 3,095
tons of natural gum in the current year.
</P>
<P>
Arega noted that in the last couple of years, the El-Nino
weather phenomenon had affected the collection of natural gums.
However, he said forecasts based on the enterprise's performance
in the last three months indicate that the output will increase
this year.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is one of the sub-Sahara countries that supply the
world market with natural gum.
</P>
<P>
Arega said the enterprise will export 14.6 million Birr (two
million Dollars) worth natural gum this year, compared with 9.3
million Birr (1.3 million Dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
The enterprise, established in 1996, produces, collects and
processes gum olibanum, gum arabic, gum myrrh and gum opopanas in
various types and grades and exports to various countries in Asia
and Europe, Arega added.

UNITED NATIONS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations will
continue to play its role to support Africa's effort to eradicate
poverty, but Africans must rely on themselves for prosperity, a
senior U.N. official said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. deputy secretary-general, Louise Frechette, made the

Industrialization Day 1998. The theme of this year's Africa
Industrialization Day is "Poverty Alleviation Through
Industrialization."
</P>
<P>
"We in the national community and the U.N.-system in particular
will continue to play our catalytic role. But ultimately, only
Africa's own initiative and imagination will make the difference
between poverty and prosperity," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Only Africa's own determination to end the conflicts that
still plague many of its peoples can make the difference between
lasting stability and endless suffering," she said.

U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the first black African to

the Security Council in last April. This was generally considered
one of the most important reports since Annan took office in
January 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Annan emphasized that all efforts at securing
peace had to be combined with steps towards ending Africa's
poverty. Specifically, he called for the promotion of investment
and economic growth, of ensuring adequate levels of international
aid, of reducing debt burdens and opening international markets to
Africa's products.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- At least 269 people had been
killed during the communal conflicts in Takum of Taraba State,
eastern Nigeria, according to a local government official.
</P>
<P>
Justice Admau Aliyu, chairman of a peace committee set up by
the Taraba state government, made the revelation in Jalingo
Thursday when he submitted the committee's report to State
Administrator Aina Owonoyi, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
He told the administrator that the conflicts had involved the
ethnic Jukuns and the Chambas on one hand and Tre Kutebs on the
other, and property destroyed during the conflicts amounted to
6.6 billion Naira (about 57 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Aliyu noted that 43 villages in the two local government areas
were affected and that hundreds of buildings were completely
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the prolonged conflicts which took place last
October to the failure of previous administrations to implement
the recommendations raised by earlier peace committees.
</P>
<P>
The state administrator appealed to the ethnic groups involved
in the conflicts to eschew their differences and promised that
the government would punish anyone caught promoting
misunderstanding and violence among the ethnic groups.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- An explosion rocked the
Swaziland's capital of Mbabane Friday afternoon, killing at least
one man, and severely injuring two others, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, which demolished part of office of Deputy Prime
Minister Arthur Khoza and a security hut, went off just before 5
p.m.
</P>
<P>
The explosion came hours after Swaziland's King Mswati III
swore in a cabinet of 16 following the country's general
election, in which opposition parties were banned.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people gathered at the site where police and
firemen searched the rubble, and found three seriously injured
victims.
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, police were searching for a fourth
person who was seen closing office windows in the building, which
houses newly re-appointed Deputy Prime Minister Arthur Khoza.
</P>
<P>
Swazi police said that the blast did not look like "child's
play", and could not have been set off without expert explosives
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago a small explosion went off at the Matsapha
Bridge which is not far away from the capital.
</P>
<P>
So far, nobody has claimed responsibility for the blast.

ATHENS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- British film director Ken Loach
on Friday criticized the British government for refusing to return
the Parthenon marbles to Greece.
</P>
<P>
Loach, who arrived in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki
to attend the 39th film festival, told reporters that Britain
should return the marbles to Greece because they were a piece of
Greek history. The British government was behaving like an
imperialist power against a weak country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Greece has been demanding for years the return by Britain of
the marbles, which were removed from the Parthenon by Lord Elgin
before Greece won its independence from Ottoman rule.
</P>
<P>
But Britain has repeatedly rejected Greece's requests by saying
that the marbles kept at the British Museum were safer in London
than in the heavily-polluted Athens.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the marbles were reported to be damaged while
British experts were trying to clean them in 1937.

<HEADLINE> China on Enlargement of UN Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Necessary and
appropriate reform of the United Nations Security Council would
enable it to better carry out its responsibility of maintaining
international peace and security, China said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 53rd session of the General Assembly, Chinese
Deputy Permanent representative to the Unted Nations, Shen
Guofang, said the core issue in the reform of the Security
Council was how to enlarge it.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang said China was of the view that the primary
task in enlarging the Council should be to solve the problem of
the under-representation of developing countries in it according
to the principle of equitable geographical distribution.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the membership of the United Nations has increased
by nearly a half and most of the new members were developing
countries since the first enlargement of the Council in 1963 ,
and as one of the main organs of the organization, the Security
Council should reflect such a change in its composition.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said it had been widely accepted and
acknowledged that the representation of developing countries in
the Council should be strengthened, and this hard-won common
understanding should be the basis and prerequisite for further
reform of the Council.
</P>
<P>
Shen pointed out the Security Council was a political,rather
than economic organ, and enlargement of the Council should not
use the wealth of a country as a criterion and the Council
should not be turned into a club of the rich or a board of
directors of a company.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Foreign Affairs
Minister Kelly Walubita Friday rebuked Norway's Ambassador to the
country for his sponsoring local gays, according to Zambia News
Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released in Lusaka, a spokesperson for the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Walubita summoned Jon Lomoy to
protest his embassy's funding of homosexual activities in Zambia
and demanded a full explanation of the "unfriendly" action.
</P>
<P>
Walubita, said the spokesperson, refused to accept the
explanation given by Lomoy that Norway had no say on how Zambia
Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) which has been advocating the
rights for gays used its donated funds.
</P>
<P>
During the summons, Walubita expressed his displeasure at
Norway's move to sponsor homosexual activities spearheaded by
ZIMT and warned that the Zambian government might not stop any
demonstrations against the embassy.
</P>
<P>
He described homosexual activities as "illegal and prejudicial
to the interest of the Zambian people" and said it was
regrettable for Lomoy to encourage the "lawless" activities in
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Lomy, who admitted funding ZIMT programs, however, explained
that he gave funds to ZIMT to organize workshops and radio
programs on gay rights and not for the establishment of the
country's Lesbians, Gays and Transgender Association (LEGATRA).
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has warned LEGATRA activists that try
to register the organization as a legal one of facing arrests if
they continue to move ahead.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hopes to Have Close Ties with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 20 (Xinhua) -- In a further sign to show
goodwill to Iran, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said on
Friday that Cairo bears the desire to have "close and sound
Egyptian-Arab-Iranian ties."
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remarks when denying the reports that Lebanon
was mediating between Egypt and Iran at Egypt's request, saying
the Cairo-Tehran ties can be developed through direct dialogue and
contacts.
</P>
<P>
"Yet we would thank Lebanese Premier Rafik Hariri if he had
done so on his own," Moussa said. "Any effort in this direction
will be appreciated and we would not object to it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hariri visited Iran last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said it is "just natural (for Egypt) to have good ties"
with Iran on the grounds that Iran is "an ancient and a great
country" and the relations between the two countries are
"time-honored."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Egyptian-Iranian ties are "moving forward
slowly but surely."
</P>
<P>
Iran severed diplomatic relations with Egypt in 1979 to protest
its peace treaty with Israel signed in March of that year right
after Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
A warming-up seems to have appeared in the recent months
through exchanging visits by economic and cultural delegations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egypt also upgraded its diplomatic mission in Iran
in September by sending ambassadorial Mohammed Rifa, the
highest-ranking diplomat since 1979, to Tehran to head its
interests section.

<HEADLINE> Duisenberg And Greenspan Reject Exchange Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bonn, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The president of the European
Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg, and the chief of the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board Alan Greenspan both rejected Friday in Frankfurt the
recent calls for exchange-rate corridors to dampen worldwide
currency speculation.
</P>
<P>
At the International Banking Congress friday here, Duisenberg
said the exchange-rate targets for such a huge currency area as
the euro- zone could easily come into conflict with the objective
of price stability. The ECB could not possibly cope with
exchange-rate targets as well. Price stability targets are the way
central banks measure their success in combating inflation.
</P>
<P>
He said that central bank chiefs concurred that credible
monetary policy and low inflation were better ways to counter
sharp fluctuations in currency values. "The value of the euro will
be therefore an outcome, not an end, of economic and monetary
policy in the euro zone", he said.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said that exchange-rate targets offered no substitute
for sensible, stability-oriented central bank policy. A definition
and defense of exchange-rate corridors might be desirable but was
simply not practicable. According to Greenspan, if banks
concentrated on fighting inflation, the outcome would be
relatively stable currencies. The exchange rate targets, in order
to clear the fluctuation of course, were an illusion, he said,
adding that efforts to defend currencies had not only been
failures but very expensive ones as well.
</P>
<P>
About six weeks before the launching of the euro, Duisenberg
and Greenspan, backed by the heads of German Bundesband and Bank
of England Governor Hans Tietmeyer and Edward George, believed
that the euro was bound to gain a major role in the world economy.

<HEADLINE> Congo Peace Talks Held in Botswana Without Kabila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Talks on cease-fire in
Democratic Congo (DRC) was held in Gaborone, Botswana Friday
without representatives of Congolese President Laurent Kabila's
government.
</P>
<P>
The start of the talks was delayed pending the arrival of an
eight-man delegation representing the rebels fighting Kabila. The
delegation is headed by rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba,
South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks were organized by the Southern African Development
Community (SADC), and were attended by South Africa, Mozambique,
Tanzania, Zambia, and representatives of the United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the Organization of African
Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
The talks are a follow-up to a ministerial meeting held in the
Zambian capital of Lusaka last month when a committee was
established to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict raging in
Congo (K) since early August.
</P>
<P>
Bizima Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister who switched
sides to the rebels, told reporters that he hoped the talks would
improve peace prospects.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to make it a success because we want to end
the war in the DRC," he said before going into the conference
center where the talks were held.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of the talks Botswana Foreign Minister Mompati
Merafe urged the rebels to be prepared to compromise and told
them compromise was not necessarily surrender.
</P>
<P>
He said he was pleased the peace initiative was an African
one, and that the future of Congo (K) had to eventually be solved
by the people of Congo themselves.
</P>
<P>
After the official opening, the talks continued behind closed
doors.
</P>
<P>
But Dia Wamba said the rebels would continue fighting if they
were attacked by Congolese government forces or their allies.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot allow Kabila to win militarily," "we will force him
to come to the negotiation table," Dia Wamba told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said the Congo problem was political, and required a
political solution. He said he believed all Congolese people
should be afforded an opportunity to work out a cease-fire
agreement through peaceful talks, a move that would enhance the
democratization of that country.
</P>
<P>
There was a need for the Congolese people, Kabila and the
rebels included, to join efforts aimed at reaching a cease-fire,
Dia Wamba was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest information from Gaborone, Congo
rebels had adopted the draft cease-fire agreement hammered out at
the last round of talks held by SADC countries in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The regional peace formula proposed by the SADC ministers
there includes an immediate cease-fire, standstill of all troops
and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
However, Kabila rejected it saying he wants the pullout of
Rwandan and Ugandan troops, not the soldiers of Zimbabwe, Angola,
Namibia and Chad invited to defend his country. And this time,
Kabila's government was not represented at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted sources closed to the talks as saying that the
rebel representatives said they wanted to be recognized and be
included in all future negotiations on Congo (K), including a
meeting due to be held on December 6 in Lusaka and a SADC summit
meeting in Pretoria on December 8.

"Unfortunately, both sides continue to commit acts that violate
the cease-fire and harm the prospects for peace," said Albright.
</P>
<P>
She urged the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) refrain from
reprisals and efforts to intimidate, but its provocations do not
justify failures by the Serb government to meet its obligations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Albright complained that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic is violating ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
"President Milosevic is increasing, rather than decreasing, the
number of special police in Kosovo. And he is failing to ensure
proper police behavior," said Albright.
</P>
<P>
She warned that Serb actions are being monitored and that NATO
will insist on compliance.
</P>
<P>
The secretary called on both sides to "work to improve the
climate for an interim political settlement."
</P>
<P>
Albright also stressed the importance of NATO in European
security structure. Many believe that NATO, an outcome of the
Cold War, should have gone away with the break-up of the former
Warsaw Pact.
</P>
<P>
Both Albright and Solana agreed that the indispensable function
played by NATO in Bosnia and now in Kosovo is "evidence of the
alliance's continued role as the foundation of European security,"
said Albright.
</P>
<P>
The two also focused on plans for next month's NATO ministerial
in Brussels and the April summit in Washington, where the alliance
will chart a course for the alliance's second 50 years.
</P>
<P>
"we discussed the need to convey to the public more effectively
NATO's purpose and role in the new century," said Albright.

<HEADLINE> Albright Praises Israeli, Palestinian Peace Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Friday voiced approval at the moves by
Palestinians and Israel in implementing the Wye River agreement
they signed on October 23.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with visiting Secretary
General Javier Solana of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), Albright also expressed confidence that Israel eventually
would release Palestinian political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
"I spoke to (Israeli) Prime Minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu this
morning and told him how pleased we were that the process is going
forward.... I think today is a very important step in a process...
that is not an easy one," she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners, but 150 of them were
common criminals. Senior Palestinian officials complained that
their inclusion breached obligations they said Israel made under
the Wye River deal to release political detainees.
</P>
<P>
Israel agreed while negotiating the latest peace deal to
release Palestinian prisoners in a gesture that is mentioned
neither in the accord nor in accompanying letters.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that ultimately 750 prisoners were to be freed
and "I feel very strongly that within that number, there will be
those who are significant to the Palestinian leadership and the
Palestinian people."
</P>
<P>
She said she had placed a telephone call to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and expected to speak with him later in the day.

<P>
PARIS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- France said on Friday that it
would continue to support Spain in its fight against the terrorism
perpetrated by the Basque separatist movement ``ETA", despite a
truce declared by the movement in September.
</P>
<P>
French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna quoted
President Jacques Chirac and Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar as saying at their summit in La Rochelle, southwest France,
that France and Spain will continue to cooperate in fighting the
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Aznar said that the truce declared by the ETA has offered ``a
great opportunity'' for Spain to finish with the Basque
separatism.
</P>
<P>
But Spain will keep a cold head and will maintain the policy of
cracking down on terrorism as long as ETA has not formally given
up its action, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that France will continue to support Spain in this
field, saying that ``France and Spain enjoy solidarity'' there and
the fight against terrorism should be maintained now.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Slams Italy for Freeing Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Friday slammed
Italy for freeing the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) leader
Abdullah Ocalan who has been wanted on charges of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Ankara, Turkish Foreign Ministry
spokesman Necati Utkan said that the ruling made by the Italian
court was hard to understand, according to the Anatolia News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was freed early Friday but was asked to remain in
Rome. The Italian court, which made the decision, said that Italy
cannot extradite a criminal to a country which permits death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, the point that worries us most is that the court
made this decision at the encouragement of the Italian
government," Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested by the Italian police last week after
arriving in Rome from Russia. Police said the PKK leader held
a forged passport.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government immediately demanded that Italy
extradite Ocalan to Ankara, saying that the PKK leader should
be held responsible for deaths of many innocent people.
</P>
<P>
Italy, however, has not yet made a positive response to
Turkey's call for the extradition of the PKK head.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Ambassador to Rome Inal Batu said that Ocalan was
being treated as a guest. "Now this status has been legitimized,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the Turkish-Italian ties would be
severely undermined if Rome finally refuses to extradite the PKK
leader to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting the Turkish government since 1984
in an effort to establish an independent Kurdish state in
southeastern Turkey. The separatist war has claimed more than
35,000 lives.

PARIS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Three French policemen were
suspended their duty because of suspected racist brutality against
an African, who died after being arrested by them.
</P>
<P>
French interim Interior Minister Jean-Jack Queyranne decided to
suspend three policemen of the city of Toucoing who arrested a

</P>

Nzeza died soon after being brought to the police station.

The suspension, proposed by the general director of the

<HEADLINE> U.N. Inspectors Continue Work in Iraq on Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. weapons inspectors
have changed their traditional policy to take a day off a week and
continued their routine work on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hussam Mohammed Ameen, director-general of Iraqi National
Monitoring Directorate, told reporters that a missile team of the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) visited a site in Baghdad while
two chemical groups toured two others in the outskirts on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three teams of the International Atomic Energy Agency
inspected three sites throughout Iraq and checked the tagged
equipment there, said Ameen.
</P>
<P>
One of the inspection teams used a helicopter to photograph
two weapon sites, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the mission was made with full cooperation from the
Iraqi side.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for UNSCOM, which oversees Iraq's disarmament, said
teams would work seven days a week in future.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. arms inspection in Iraq was resumed Wednesday, one day
after the inspectors returned from Bahrain, where they had
relocated last week amid fears of air strikes.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. threated to use force if Iraq did not reverse its
decision in August and October that halted the activities of
UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
The weapons inspections of UNSCOM began in 1991 after the Gulf
War, sparked by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council maintains that the eight-year
devastating sanctions on Iraq will not lifted until UNSCOM
verifies that Baghdad has eradicated all its weapons of mass
destruction, as required in U.N. resolutions adopted after the Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
Iraq heeded an appeal from U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
and backed down last Saturday as the U.S. was on its course to
raid Baghdad.

UNITED NATIONS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Mission in the
Central African Republic, known as MINURCA, has deployed 108
observers and is transporting electoral materials in preparation
for the legislative elections scheduled for Sunday, Fred Eckhard,
U.N. spokesman, announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General's Special Representative, Oluyemi
Adeniji, will read a message on MINURCA radio on Friday evening,
calling on all Central Africans to vote in calm, with dignity and
in a spirit of civil responsibility, he said.

<P>
The Security Council adopted a resolution on October 15 to
renew the mandate of MINURCA until February 28, 1999, and send 250
peacekeepers to render assistance to the proposed elections in the
African country.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, in the resolution, also called on the
international community to offer technical, financial and logistic
assistance to the legislative elections.

UNITED NATIONS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Members of the former
Rwandan government forces, who were scattered all around Africa,
have now gathered in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda,
and are fighting alongside troops of President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard made the announcement on the basis
of a report by the International Commission of Inquiry on the flow
of arms to former Rwandan government forces.
</P>
<P>
The report concludes that the flow of small arms into and
within Africa is a long-term cause of insecurity and instability
in the Central African region, and it is fueled by the presence of
a multitude of rebel groups in the Great Lakes, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
About six African countries are being involved in the conflicts
in Congo (K) by giving separate assistance to warring parties.

A deaf driver can "see" where the horns of other cars are

<P>
CAIRO, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
MANAMA -- Bahraini Minister of Oil and Industry Sheikh
isa bin ali al-Khalifa has announced a giant project for the
development of petroleum-related industries, with an investment of
800 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The project will basically include the modernization of
Bahraini oil refinery sector to sharpen its competitiveness on
international arena, the Arabic Al Hayat reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Khalifa said that Bahrain is aware that dependence on
traditional energy exports, such as petroleum and gas, as the
principal source of revenues and the prime motivator to other
economic sectors "ought to be reconsidered," particularly in the
context of the crumbling world oil markets.
</P>
<P>
Such a situation, the minister said, obliges Bahrain to explore
diverse revenue sources while diminishing its dependence on
petroleum exports.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- Belgien capital Brussels will host the upcoming eighth
session of the joint Yemeni-EU committee, which is to start on
December 4.
</P>
<P>
In a statement printed in Friday's Arabic daily Al Hayat, the
Undersecretary of Yemeni Ministry of Planning and Development
Hisham Sharaf Abdulla said that the four-day meeting will discuss
Yemeni-EU cooperation in food security, economic development,
rehabilitation of establishments exposed to natural disasters,
non-governmental organizations, trade and politics.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Minister of Petroleum Hamdi Al Banbi has
said that world major oil companies, such as AMOCO, ENI, SHELL,
and RAPSOL, will invest some 4.1 billion dollars in Egypt for its
off-shore natural gas exploitation and oil prospection.
</P>
<P>
Banbi said that crude and gas prospection in untapped areas,
particularly in the Gulf of Suez, will be the focus in the
foreign-funded projects, the Arabic Al Hayat reported Friday.

<HEADLINE> Marathon Meetings Yield Hope in NBA Labor Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Marathon talks that lasted
lated into the evening finally have yielded progress toward
ending the NBA lockout.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators for NBA owners and players met for more than 12
hours yesterday and emerged closer to a deal than at any point
during the 143-day lockout.
</P>
<P>
"I think what we can say for the first time is we feel we had
a productive day," said NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik.
"Unfortunately we are still far apart on a lot of issues, but I
think we did make some progress, we got closer together on some
of the key issues."
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that any progress achieved today was due to
the increased chance of losing the entire 1998-99 season, a
prospect NBA commissioner David Stern described as a very real po
ssibility as recently as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"There's a slogan, 'The sight of the guillotine improves your
hearing.' And I guess maybe we're hearing each other a little
better because the guillotine's being sharpened," Stern said late
tonight. "It's too bad it has to come to this. But I would
characterize that we had for us a productive, cordial meeting."
</P>
<P>
Today's bargaining session was the first since October 28th.
It was said that each side had moved about a couple points off
its desired salary percentages. The owners had been demanding 50
percent, while the players wanted 60.
</P>
<P>
The owners also agreed to accept, with several conditions, the
idea of a percentage limit on the amount of an "escrow tax" that
could be withheld from players' paychecks in years four, five and
six of a seven-year deal, sources said. The players had already
offered to withhold as much as 10 percent of their annual
salaries in those years.
</P>
<P>
Owners continued to ask for a four-year rookie scale with a
right of first refusal in the fifth year and a 5 percent limit,
down from the old 20 percent, on yearly salary increases for
players without Larry Bird exception rights.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in a while, I feel real optimistic that a
deal can be made," Miami's Alonzo Mourning said.
</P>
<P>
"We obviously modified our respective positions," said Billy
Hunter, executive director of the union. "We want to have a
season, we don't want to see the season go up in smoke. We know
there's a certain period of time we have if we're going to have a
season. We also want to minimize the damage, the downside. I
think that's what's setting in more than anything else."
</P>
<P>
The sides have been unable to reach a solution on how to
divide the basketall-related income, which last year was nearly 2
billion U.S. dollars. The league's latest proposal offered a
50-50 split, but the players want no less than 60 percent.

Relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia had been tense since

The ice began to thaw after Iran's moderate President Mohammad
Khatami took office in August last year.

<HEADLINE> Russia Establishes Agency to Rescue Ailing Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia will set up an agency
to rescue the country's ailing banking system, the government
information department said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the body, with the task of "restoring and
efficiently developing the banking system", was ordered by Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov in a decree Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Agency for the Restructuring of Credit Organizations will
be a "non-bank credit organization" in the form of a closed
joint-stock society with authorized capital of 10 billion rubles
(about 625 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federal Property Fund will hold 51 percent of the
shares and the Central Bank will take 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank will register the agency by December 1 and
issue it a license to operate as a non-banking credit organization.
</P>
<P>
Part of the unspent loans extended by the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the World Bank will
finance the restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The Finance and Economics Ministry jointly with the EBRD and
World Bank will redistribute the funds.
</P>
<P>
Government experts estimate 150 billion rubles (9.37 billion
dollars) will be needed to revive the entire banking system.
</P>
<P>
A 40-billion-ruble (2.5 billion dollars) bailout will be
provided by the central bank to the important banks, however some
720 commercial banks may be shut down as a result of the
restructuring.

<HEADLINE> DRC Rebels Demand Full Membership in Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The rebels fighting
President of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Laurent
Kabila demanded Saturday that it should be recognized as a full
participating member to all subsequent meetings on the DRC
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese Rally for Democracy (CRD) made the demand at a
Southern African Development Community (SADC) meeting in
Botswanan capital Gaborone, South African Press Association
(SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
In a three-page document proposing amendments to a draft
cease-fire agreement, the rebels led by Ernst Wamba dia Wamba,
said that the committee of Southern African Development Community
(SADC) foreign ministers should help facilitate face-to-face
talks between the rebel movement and Kabila's government.
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, the contents of this agreement should be discussed
directly between the CRD and the government or in the presence of
other interest parties," said the document.
</P>
<P>
The talks began Friday, but was interrupted when the rebel
delegation left the negotiating table late that night, clearly
unhappy with the draft cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
The talks resumed Saturday morning, but ended inconclusively
later the same day.
</P>
<P>
Bizima Karaha, a rebel leader, said his movement would now
seriously embark on the DRC peace process and was ready to talk
to Kabila at any time.
</P>
<P>
He said although they had not fully agreed to the cease-fire
agreement, they would continue to work toward its implementation.
</P>
<P>
The Gaborone meeting, chaired by Zambia, brought together
representatives from South Africa, Tanzania and Mozambique, as
well as envoys from the United Nations and the Organization of
African Unity. However, Kabila's government was not represented.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was a follow-up to the Lusaka regional meeting
held on October 26, where the draft cease-fire agreement was
prepared.

order to close military businesses, handed over one of its major

The company is engaged in real estate, automobile repairs,
transport, storage, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, hardware,
electrical equipment, and building materials. All the firms have

<HEADLINE> SADC Meeting on DRC Ends Inconclusively </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- A Southern African
Development Community (SADC) meeting on the Congo crisis held in
Botswanan capital Gaborone ended inconclusively Saturday, South
African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted SADC Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende as saying
that although the two-day meeting ended inconclusively, it laid
basis for moving the peace process forward in the Democratic
Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The DRC rebel delegation reportedly proposed changes to a SADC
cease-fire document, but the details of the rebel movement's
proposals were not made public.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende said that the proposals were going to be forwarded to
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba who would find ways of
incorporating them into the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The SADC chief earlier Saturday accused the rebel delegation
of being childish and spoiled.
</P>
<P>
Talks between SADC foreign ministers and the rebels began in
Gaborone Friday.
</P>
<P>
The talks, aimed at convincing the rebels to accept a
cease-fire plan, adjourned abruptly Friday night when rebel
delegation, led by Ernst Wamba dia Wamba, left the negotiating
table, clearly dissatisfied with cease-fire proposals laid before
them by a four-nation committee.
</P>
<P>
Zambia chaired the talks, which brought together the rebel
team and foreign ministers of South Africa, Tanzania and
Mozambique, as well as representatives of the United Nations and
the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
Another rebel leader, Bizima Karaha, who was former foreign
minister of DRC President Laurent Kabila's government, said his
movement would now "seriously embark on the peace process" in the
DRC and was ready to talk to Kabila at any time.
</P>
<P>
Karaha, who is in charge of foreign affairs in the Congolese
Democratic Coalition, said although they had not fully agreed to
the cease-fire agreement, they would continue to work toward its
implementation.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo expressed
satisfaction with the outcome of the talks, saying it had
narrowed the gap toward the full implementation of the cease-fire
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said that the talks had also improved the chances of the
first face-to-face talks between Kabila and the rebels.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 21 (Xinhua) -- A private organization
Gallup Pakistan in a randomly conducted opinion poll in urban
areas has claimed that the three-fourth of Pakistan's 140 million
population is opposed to the idea of imposing debt moratorium by
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The organization said that the survey showed that only
one-fourth of the people interviewed were found inclined to wards
defaulting on foreign loans, while the remaining three fourths are
of the view that despite financial difficulties, Pakistan should
fulfill its international obligations.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Saturday by Gallup Pakistan said the survey
was conducted among more than 1,000 men and women randomly in the
urban areas of all the four provinces of Pakistan, and the sample
comprised a cross-section of various socio-economic and linguistic
groups.
</P>
<P>
The citizens were asked to give their view about the option
whether the installments of the debt are paid back in time or due
to the resource crush they should choose to default.
</P>
<P>
The data collected showed 76 percent Pakistanis were in favor
of paying the foreign loans, while 24 percent were in favor of
postponing payments.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, which is facing serious balance of payments crisis,
is now discussing with the International Monetary Fund for
reviving the stalled financial assistance and a five-billion U.S.
dollar bailout package in a bid to avoid default.

<HEADLINE> Requirement for Final Party Registration Eased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Independent
National Electoral Commission (INEC) has adjusted the guidelines
for the final registration of political parties and the local
government elections.
</P>
<P>
INEC Chairman Justice Ephrim Akpata said in capital Abuja
Friday the requirement that provisionally registered parties
should score 10 percent of the total votes cast in at least 24 of
36 states had been reduced to five percent in at least 24 states.
</P>
<P>
The INEC chairman rejected the argument of the political
leaders that having functional offices in 24 states had qualified
them for registration because that alone showed their intention
to have national spread.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Times newspaper Saturday quoted Justice Akpata as
saying that "it is the result of the election that will decide
whether, indeed, they have the required national spread, hence
the need to make the electorate the ultimate arbiter."
</P>
<P>
In addition, the INEC chief said that if only one party
satisfies the requirement of scoring at least five percent in at
least 24 states, the next two parties which achieve the five
percent threshold in the larger number of states will be
registered.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the amendment is aimed at ensuring that as
many of the provisionally registered parties gain full
recognition and final registration for subsequent elections.
</P>
<P>
Under the new guidelines issued in Abuja Friday, the
non-refundable deposits payable by prospective chairmanship
candidates have been reduced from 10,000 Naira (about 116 U.S.
Dollars) to 5,000 Naira and that of their councillorship
counterpart slashed to 1,000 Naira from 2,500 Naira.

<P>
KUNMING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- As of this morning, the 2
earthquakes that hit south China's Yunnan Province Thursday night
had claimed the lives of 3 people, according to the provincial
government Civil Affairs Department.
</P>
<P>
The 5.0 and 6.2 earthquakes struck the Ninglang Yi Autonomous
County at 19:31 and 19:38, respectively. By this morning, there
were 211 serious injuries reported, 1,173 people slightly injured,
and 30,000 people left homeless.
</P>
<P>
The quakes damaged 17,500 houses and 395 school buildings and
caused cracks in a number of roads and 13 reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that 1,000 tents and 1,000 blankets were
sent to the area but that they are far from adequate. The
situation is made worse by the fact that it is getting
colder. Nighttime temperatures have fallen to zero.
</P>
<P>
The Seismology Bureau of Yunnan says that they cannot rule out
the possibility of another earthquake in the area.
</P>
<P>
Three quakes struck the county previously on Oct. 2, 23 and 27

<HEADLINE> Privatization Program for State Railway Is Worked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Transport and
Communications Ministry has worked out a plan to privatize the
loss-ridden State Railway of Thailand (SRT), Thai News Agency
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The plan divides the SRT's operation into three categories:
infrastructure, service and non-rail business.
</P>
<P>
The ministry proposes that the state bear all investment in the
infrastructure category which comprises the construction of
railway tracks, the installation of signaling equipment, and their
maintenance, while the private sector take more roles in its
operation.
</P>
<P>
The SRT will take charge in train-related service which
consists of passenger and cargo trains and railway-linked
container depots, and non-rail business which features the
commercial development of the SRT's property such as railway
stations and land plots.
</P>
<P>
The SRT has 254,853 rai (40,776 hectares) of land plots, 405
railway stations, and railway tracks with a combined length of
4,032 kilometers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The private sector will be encouraged to take part in the three
categories.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also suggests that the state bear loan and
interest payment for the SRT's train-related service in the next
five years so that the state enterprise will have enough money to
improve its train service.
</P>
<P>
The ministry expects to implement the plan from next year under
which the state will no longer have to subsidize the loss-ridden
train service of the SRT. The plan should enable the SRT to
generate enough income to continue its train operation on its own
and especially to maintain the third-class train service with
cheap fares especially for the poor.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Nine people were killed
and about 28 injured when a bus overturned outside Kokstad in
KwaZulu-Natal Province Saturday morning, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Provincial Transport Minister Sibusiso Ndebele was quoted as
saying that the crash was apparently caused by excessive speed,
as confirmed by two witnesses.
</P>
<P>
The bus apparently went out of control around a bend and hit
the side of a bridge before overturning.
</P>
<P>
Several people were trapped under the bus and emergency
workers struggled for four hours to remove them from the
wreckage, using a crane to lift the bus.
</P>

One of the injured, a pregnant woman, was airlifted to the
Port Shepstone hospital and was said to be in a serious
condition.

<HEADLINE> Osama Issue Closed for Good: Taliban Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Afghan Taliban official
responsible for information and culture Amir Khan Muttaqi has said
the issue of Osama Bin Laden is closed for good as no evidence
were found or produced of his involvement in terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the media in Kabul Saturday, Muttaqi said the
Taliban have discharged their obligations and fulfilled
responsibilities by conducting probe into the allegations about
Laden's involvement in terrorism, according to a report by Bakhtar
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Muttaqi said the Taliban supreme court kept on waiting to
receive evidence and proofs against Laden till November 20, the
deadline for the trial of the Saudi dissident.
</P>
<P>
But neither any evidence or proof was produced before the
supreme court nor anybody filed any suit against him, Muttaqi
noted.
</P>
<P>
Muttaqi said that Laden was living in Afghanistan even much
before the emergence of the Taliban Islamic Movement. The United
States, he alleged, is now repeatedly raising the Osama issue in
a bid to find illogical excuses for another attack on the
war-ravaged Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Taliban authorities want to establish good
relationship with the United States and other countries and ready
in principle for every kind of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
But if they want to strain the relations and again raise the
issue of Osama, it would mean finding excuse for attack on
Afghanistan, which Muttaqi said, would be an unreasonable act.

<HEADLINE> Globalization Process Should not Penalize Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Switzerland
President Flavio Cotti said Saturday that the world must make sure
that the globalization process did not penalize weaker economic
players and results in the denial of social needs.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon meeting in Mumbai hosted by Confederation
of Indian Industry (CII), the president said that a global order
cannot be sustainable without a global ethic.
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow we should not forget how important it is to balance
the economic and social requirements, i.e., to maintain an ethical
perspective on our economic strategies and practices," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cotti is heading an official and business delegation to India.
It is the first time that a Swiss head of state visited India in
the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The visiting president said that he was convinced that
globalization was a positive development and that it would be
beneficial for everyone in the long run. The recent turmoil in
international financial markets, however, "has shown us another
side of globalization". This shock has been a rude reminder that
permanent economic growth was an illusion and cannot be taken for
granted even in the new post-cold war world order.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that liberalization was fundamental to future
economic success. He said that he would utilize every opportunity
during his visit to India to stress on estimates of steps for
greater openness of Indian economy including insurance sector.

<HEADLINE> DRC Rebel Delegation Childish: SADC Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) chief Saturday harshly criticized
the rebel delegation of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) at
peace talks in Botswana, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
SADC Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende was quoted as saying
that they behaved like spoiled children and bandits.
</P>
<P>
Before the delayed start of the second day of peace talks in
Gaborone, the SADC chief said that Friday's deadlock was caused
by the rebel movement delegation's lack of statesmanship.
</P>
<P>
A committee of SADC foreign ministers is in the Botswana
capital to hold talks with the DRC rebels to find a peaceful
solution to the political crisis in the vast central African
country.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps we took them more seriously than we should have,"
Mbuende said. "We thought we were dealing with statesmen."
</P>
<P>
He said there was an agreement in principle for a cease-fire.
But, the rebel delegation made additional demands Friday, and
accused DRC President Laurent Kabila's government of genocide.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that the SADC ministers endorse the partition of
the DRC and allow two governments to co-exist.
</P>
<P>
"We think that this behavior is tantamount to that of bandits
and not statesmen. But we have given them a second chance to
come to the meeting today (Saturday) with a view of pushing the
peace process in the DRC forward.
</P>
<P>
"They behave like spoiled children and they think we owe them
something and we have to run after them," Mbuende said.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's meeting was scheduled to start at 10:00 a.m. but
only started after 11:00 a.m. because the rebel delegation
arrived late.
</P>
<P>
The DRC government is not represented at the Gaborone meeting,
which is a follow-up to a SADC meeting in Zambian capital on
October 26.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Launch Military Maneuver in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced on Saturday
that it would launch a five-day military maneuver in the Persian
Gulf and the Gulf of Oman in December.
</P>
<P>
This was announced at a press conference jointly held by the
Commander of the Naval Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards
Corps (IRGC), Ali Akbar Ahmadian, and Commander of the Naval
Forces of the Army Abbas Mohtaj.
</P>
<P>
The maneuver will be co-conducted by the naval forces of the
IRGC and the Army on December 4-9 in an area of 20,000 nautical
miles, mainly in the waters close to the strategic Hormoz Strait,
said Ahmadian.
</P>
<P>
Some 50,000 troops of the IRGC and the Iranian army will
participate in the war games, code-named "Vahdat (Unity) 77,"
Mohtaj said.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at demonstrating that Gulf countries have
the capability to maintain stability in the region, said Ahmadian.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected to promote cooperation between the IRGC
and the Iranian army, to train the country's new military
formation after the establishment of the army's command in
September and to defuse the military presence of foreign powers
in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time for the IRGC and the Iranian army to
hold joint war games after the establishment of the army's
command under the order of the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, who is also the country's Commander-in-Chief.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC has had its own command since the Islamic
revolution in 1979, but the Iranian army has been commanded
only by the chief of staff, with the absence of the post
of commander during the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Ahmadian also said Iran is ready to expand military
cooperation with the Gulf states, adding that the slogan for the
maneuver is "cooperation with regional countries."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian armed forces support any cooperation which will
benefit the regional countries, he said.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto's Wealth to Be Probed: Indonesian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie will set up a committee to probe into the wealth of former
president Soeharto as decreed by the People's consultative
Assembly (MPR), a senior official said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The president is preparing the steps needed to follow up MPR
Decree, which explicitly mentions former president Soeharto,"
State Secretary/Minister Akbar Tanjung told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The Special Session of the MPR, which ended on November 13,
agreed to add a provision in a decree on clean government,
preventing centralization of power, corruption, collusion and
nepotism.
</P>
<P>
Many people including political parties, public figures and
students have urged the government to realize the decree
immediately in bid to push forward total reforms in the country.
</P>
<P>
Tanjung said the committee will be made up of figures with
strong integrity and credibility.
</P>
<P>
Habibie himself will appoint the members of the committee,
Tanjung said without elaborating on when.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday morning, Habibie summoned some ministers and gave
directives to them to study the MPR decrees.
</P>
<P>
"The government is aware that the result of the special MPR
session is the manifestation of the people's aspirations," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we will see the government's response next week,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
In September this year, President Habibie had set up two teams
to investigate the wealth of Soeharto. An official at the Attorney
General's office Friday said Soeharto has 2.3 million U.S. dollars
in 72 domestic banks. But some estimates have put Soeharto's
wealth as high as 40 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Leprosy Patients Decrease by 30 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 21 (Xinhua) - The number of leprosy
patients in Tanzania has decreased from nearly 5,000 in 1990 to
about 3,500 in 1997, according to a local health official.
</P>
<P>
The east African country has been encouraged by some 30
percent decline of its registered leprosy patients during the
seven years, local press reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Dr P.M. Kilima, Director of the Preventive
Services of Tanzania, as saying that the cure rate for all forms
of leprosy was very high by taking the Multi-Drug Therapy (MDT).
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting here by experts from the English-speaking
African countries over the weekend, Kilima said that the only
challenge is to make (MDT) available to the patients timely. MDT
is a product promoted by the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
However, Kilima said, the decline of leprosy was not uniform
in the country due to patients' delay in diagnosis and treatment
and sometimes rejection by the community.
</P>
<P>
He called for government's involvement in fighting against
leprosy by improving surveillance at community level and
supplying drugs to patients all over the country.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that elimination can only be achieved if community
awareness is raised and management of leprosy patients is
included into the general health services at peripheral level,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The health official said that the sufferings and economic
losses to the patients and their families due to the persistent
disease warranted more vigorous attention from the whole society
in all the African countries.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Committed to Full Utilization of Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is determined to tap
the nation's gas resource for national economic development,
thereby reducing dependence on oil, Nigerian Head of State
Abdulsalam Abubakar has said.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar made the remarks Friday when he commissioned an
810-million-U.S. Dollar Oso Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project
in eastern Rivers State.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Times newspaper Saturday quoted the head of state as
saying that government's 2.8-billion-Dollar investment in the
petroleum and gas utilization projects was a sign of its
determination to make use of the nation's gas resources for
economic development and to diversify its economic base.
</P>
<P>
"In energy terms, Nigeria has three times as much gas reserve
as it has petroleum," said Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
The head of state pointed out that the project, which is
described as the world's largest off-shore gas project, is aimed
at making better use of the country's gas reserve and stopping
the harmful flaring of gas in the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that a new national gas policy aimed at boosting
the country's energy sector is underway.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria recently set the year 2010 as its target deadline for
the complete elimination of gas flaring and the full harnessing
of its massive gas resources.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar reaffirmed that his administration's determination to
check gas flaring was irrevocable.
</P>
<P>
The Oso LNG project, which is jointly owned and operated by
U.S. oil and gas giant Mobil and the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation, can produce 50,000 barrels per day of natural gas.

<HEADLINE> Today's Snow Closes Beijing Airport For 5 Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's Capital
International Airport was closed from 10:30 a.m. to 3:45
p.m. today by the city's first snowfall this winter.
</P>
<P>
Over 300 flights and more than 20,000 passengers were delayed
by the heavy snow.
</P>
<P>
The airport officials predicted that all the stranded
passengers will leave Beijing tonight.
</P>
<P>
The snowfall covered a large part of northern China, including
the cities of Beijing and Tianjin. In Huairou County, to the north
of Beijing, there was 10 cm of snow by 2 p.m., according to Chen
Dagang of the Forecast Department of Beijing's Meteorology Station.
</P>
<P>
Snowfalls in Beijing in recent years were usually 2 to 3
mm. Today's heavy snowfall is quite rare, Chen says.
</P>
<P>
Some local agronomists say that the snow will help wheat and
other winter crops.
</P>
<P>
Many of Beijing's citizens went out with cameras, and children
were at their happiest, throwing snowballs.
</P>
<P>
But, the snow caused a lot of problems for motorists and
traffic conditions got worse. All expressways linking Beijing with
other cities have been closed and more policemen have been
deployed to help keep traffic order.

<HEADLINE> 98 Ethiopian Refugees Return Home from Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Ninety-eight Ethiopian
refugees have been repatriated from Dadaab Camps in northeastern
Kenya by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR), the Ethiopian News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
These returnees were the first batch of over 2,500 Ethiopian
refugees willing to return to the areas of their origin.
</P>
<P>
The first 98 were airlifted from Dadaab to the border town of
Moyale in an operation expected to run for the next five weeks.
</P>
<P>
The report said that boarding the Buffalo aircraft chartered
by the UNHCR, the refugees, many of them traveling by air for the
first time, expressed joy that they were finally able to return
home.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival at the small airstrip in Moyale, the refugees
boarded trucks organized to take them to the border, some 10
kilometers away, where they were cleared by Ethiopian customs and
immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, inside Ethiopia, the refugees each
received food for nine-month use, including cereals and oil, as
well as a small cash grant to assist them to make their way home
from Moyale and to start a new life after many years of exile.
</P>
<P>
Over 69,000 Ethiopian refugees have been repatriated from
Kenya by the UNHCR since late 1992, according to UNHCR office
here.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the National
Assembly Ilahie Bukhsh Soomro has stressed the need to enhance
interaction between Pakistan and Bangladesh in the fields of trade
and commerce.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Bangladesh's new High Commissioner Masum
Ahmed Chowdhry here Saturday, Soomro said trade and commercial
interaction between Pakistan and Bangladesh should be given a
boost as both have substantial consumer markets for items and raw
material produced by them.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Speaker and Parliamentarian Conference of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to be
held in Bangladesh early next year will be a good opportunity for
the regional countries to discuss legislative procedures as well
as bilateral and multi-lateral issues.
</P>
<P>
Soomro assured the new High Commissioner of complete
cooperation and assistance from the National Assembly Secretariat
during his tenure in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Chowdhry said on the occasion that the Bangladesh government
and people are grateful to the people and government of Pakistan
for their moral and material support during the recent floods in
Bangladesh which were the worst during the current century.
</P>
<P>
He apprised Soomro of the progress made by his country in the
fields of education, women empowerment and population control.

NEW DELHI, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Switzerland
President Flavio Cotti Saturday reiterated his country's stance
vis-a-vis the nuclear tests conducted by India in May this year.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland opposed Indian nuclear tests. Following India's
nuclear tests Switzerland has almost frozen its capital flow to
India. It has decided that no new projects and no licence
agreements with the government of India would be approved until
further notice and has cut funding for 1998 and 1999 by Swiss
francs three million and applications for export of dual-use goods
are being dealt with in strictest conformity with regulations
concerning export limitations.
</P>
<P>
"Switzerland has been demanding the elimination of weapons of
mass destruction, including those of the five nuclear powers, and
the dialogue with India is on in this sense," Cotti said in
response to a query at a luncheon meeting hosted by Confederation
of Indian Industry (CII) in honor of his visit in Mumbai.

<HEADLINE> Security Beefed Up in Swaziland After Bomb Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Swazi security forces
were out in force in capital Mbabane Saturday morning following a
bomb explosion Friday afternoon, South African Press Association
(SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The blast, which went off at the offices of Deputy Prime
Minister Arthur Khoza, killed one security guard and seriously
injured two other men. Khoza was not at the offices at the time.
</P>
<P>
Blue uniformed Swazi police Saturday patrolled the capital's
streets in groups. Official vehicles blocked the road leading to
Khoza's offices while blast investigators were still combing the
rubble for clues, said SAPA.
</P>
<P>
The explosion provoked an angry response from the Swazis.
</P>
<P>
Mbabane-based newspapers Saturday called for the immediate
apprehension of "these bombing animals", while residents said the
attack served only to unite people across political lines.
</P>
<P>
"There's a definite feeling here that outside forces are using
young, inexperienced activist hotheads to promote their own
agenda," said SAPA.
</P>
<P>
The explosion came hours after the new Swazi cabinet was sworn
in by King Mswati III.
</P>
<P>
The blast was the second in four weeks.
</P>
<P>
On October 28, a bomb went off at a bridge linking Matsapa
International Airport and Mbabane. The explosion happened two
hours after King Mswati's motorcade passed the bridge on its way
from the airport to the royal palace.
</P>
<P>
According to South Africa's Saturday Star newspaper, Friday's
explosion was a sign of mounting pressures from opposition groups
to force the monarchy to allow multi-party democracy.
</P>
<P>
Political parties have been banned in the tiny landlocked
kingdom since 1973.
</P>
<P>
Swazi police Wednesday detained the leader of the Swaziland
Federation of Trade Unions, Jan Sithole, for interrogation about
the October 28 bombing.  They also raided the home of Mario
Masuku, leader of the People's United Democratic Movement and
confiscated documents.
</P>
<P>
Both organizations had called for a boycott of the non-party
general elections in late October.

<HEADLINE> Angola Vows to Capture UNITA Leader: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government and the
breakaway UNITA Renovation Commission have vowed to capture Jonas
Savimbi, the rebel movement leader, either in Angola or any other
country he would seek refuge in.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here Friday, Angolan Minister
without Portfolio and Head of the Government Delegation to the
Joint Commission Faustine Mudeka and head of the UNITA Renovation
Commission, Eugene Munavakola, vowed to capture Savimbi because
he has contravened the peace accord signed here in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Saturday quoted the visiting Angolan
officials as saying that Savimbi has no support from the majority
of the Angolan people.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government and the breakaway group of the National
Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) have declared
UNITA President Savimbi a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
Mudeka said that the Angolan government has tried by all means
to bring Savimbi to the negotiation table so that the Lusaka
Peace Accord could be implemented but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan official said that the Angolan people are
interested in developing their country but impeded by Savimbi's
forces.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Fraud squad detectives are
investigating the transfers of a number of Australian players to
Portsmouth Football Club while it was under the control of the
former England manager Terry Venables.
</P>
<P>
The Independent reported on Saturday that police in the
southern English county of Hampshire are examining allegations of
"bad business practice" involving the purchase of players last
year.
</P>
<P>
The report said five players are believed to be involved. They
include Robert Enes from Sydney United, Hamilton Thorpe from
Western Adelaide, Craig Foster from Fairfield Marconi and
Australian John Aloisi, who joined from the Italian club
Cremonesi. All four joined Portsmouth in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Venables, who bought Portsmouth for one pound in August 1996
when the club was in crisis, has declined to comment. His
spokesman said "He is not aware of any situation requiring any
investigation in any event."
</P>
<P>
News of the Portsmouth inquiry follows the decision taken on
Tuesday by English first division club Crystal Palace, where
Venables is now coach, to ask the Football Association to
investigate a shortfall in the payment for the transfer of two
Chinese internationals.
</P>
<P>
Palace paid 1.35 million pounds (about 2.27 million U.S.
dollars)in August for Fan Zhiyi and Sun Jihai. But the Chinese
football association is reported to expect 900,000 pounds (1.51
million U.S.dollars).
</P>
<P>
Venables has said he played no part in the Chinese transfers.
</P>
<P>
Palace said Friday it was "committed to the highest standards o
 f corporate governance". Portsmouth Football Club declined to
comment on the police inquiry.

<HEADLINE> US Mediator Plans 3rd Mission to Horn of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. mediator Anthony
Lake will visit Ethiopia and Eritrea soon on his third mission to
help seek a peaceful resolution to the Ethio-Eritrean border
dispute, a report reaching here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lake, former U.S. National Security Adviser, is now consulting
with U.S. government officials and the United Nations before he
resumes discussions in Addis Ababa and Asmara, U.S. State
Department spokesman James Rubin was quoted by the report as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that both Ethiopia and Eritrea are
anticipating the mission's return in pursuit of a peaceful
resolution to the border dispute between them.
</P>
<P>
Lake left Addis Ababa for Washington only last Sunday after
his second mission of the mediation in the border dispute between
Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
His second mission followed the summit meeting sponsored by
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in Ouagadougou, Burkina
Faso, which failed to reach agreement on the OAU peaceful
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Lake's initiative is in support of
the OAU proposal which calls for the withdrawal of Eritrean
forces from Badme to their positions before May 12, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Despite diplomatic efforts for a peaceful resolution to the
over six-month Ethio-Eritrean border dispute, there have been
reportedly several small-scale clashes along the border, most of
them involving exchanges of artillery and small-arms fire.
</P>
<P>
Lake came to the Horn of Africa in October this year for his
first mission on mediation of the border crisis.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Foreign Interference in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Saturday rejected any
foreign interference in Iraq after the United States announced
readiness to support Iran's efforts to topple Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
"Any foreign interference in Iraq is illegal," the commander
of the naval forces of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps
(IRGC), Ali Akbar Ahmadian, said here at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question from Xinhua correspondent about
Washingtons' statement, Ahmadian said that the fate of Iraq should
be determined by the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said on Friday
that a U.S. campaign to drive Saddam from power will include
tacit support of Iranian efforts to oust the Iraqi dictator.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to complain about any effort Iran makes to
assist Shiites or others suffering under Saddam's rule," Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
Iran has accused Baghdad of suppressing the Iraqi Shiite
Muslims, who make up the majority of the country's population,
and supported Iraqi opposition to fight against the government of
President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Following the easing of the recent standoff between Baghdad and
the United Nations over arms inspection, U.S. President Bill
Clinton announced last weekend to support Saddam's foes to
intensify Washington's efforts to topple the Iraqi leader.
</P>
<P>
However, Rubin clarified that Washington will not work with
Tehran "in any shape or form or soliciting support" from
Iranians.
</P>
<P>
In a response to Rubin's remarks, Ahmadian stated that Iran
believes that the Iraqi sovereignty and territorial integrity
should be respected.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian commander also termed the U.S. military presence
in the Persian Gulf as the main source of tensions in the region.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the U.S. has its military presence in the region,
we will continue to see tensions in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly accused the U.S. of mounting its military
forces to the Gulf and stressed that the regional countries
should solve the regional issues by themselves.

<HEADLINE> HK's Crime Rate Remains Low: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong ranks among the
world's safest cities with its crime rate lower than those in
Tokyo, London and other metropolitan cities in the United States
and Canada, Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the overall crime rate for 1997 was the lowest in the
past 24 years. For the first ten months this year, though there
was a slight increase of 0.4 percent in the overall crime rate,
the figure was still on the low side," Tung told 1998 Fight Crime
Conference held Saturday at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
Delivering an opening speech to the conference, the chief
executive said: "To combat crime is a major task of the Government
of the Special Administrative Region (SAR)."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that his government will continue to upgrade the
service of Hong Kong's "clean, highly professional and
well-equipped" police force through the introduction of advanced
information technology, deployment of more front-line officers to
newly developed areas as well as streamlining of crime reporting
procedures.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government will continue to give full support to
the work of district fight crime committees to enhance the
awareness of the public of their responsibility in crime fighting,
Tung added.
</P>
<P>
The previous conference was held in 1996.

Iran has accused Baghdad of suppressing the Iraqi Shiite
Muslims, who make up the majority of the country's population,
and supported Iraqi opposition to fight against the government
of President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Following the easing of the recent standoff between Baghdad and
the United Nations over arms inspection, U.S. President Bill
Clinton announced last weekend to support Saddam's foes to
intensify Washington's efforts to topple the Iraqi leader.
</P>
<P>
However, Rubin clarified that Washington will not work with
Tehran "in any shape or form or soliciting support" from
Iranians.
</P>
<P>
In a response to Rubin's remarks, Ahmadian stated that Iran
believes that the Iraqi sovereignty and territorial integrity
should be respected.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian commander also termed the U.S. military presence
in the Persian Gulf as the main source of tensions in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the U.S. has its military presence in the
region, we will continue to see tensions in the region," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly accused the U.S. of mounting its
military forces to the Gulf and stressed that the regional
countries should solve the regional issues by themselves.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Hails Sino-WHO Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that China would continue to honor its commitment
and perform its obligations and render an active support to the
World Health Organization (WHO) and join the WHO to promote the
health undertaking in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader made the remarks while meeting with Gro
Brundtland, visiting director-general of WHO.
</P>
<P>
He called Brundtland an old friend of China, who has helped
increase Sino-Norwegian cooperation and exchanges in the fields of
politics, economy, culture, energy and environmental protection
when she was Norwegian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his belief that the Sino-WHO cooperation would
yield more fruits during Brundtland's term of office.
</P>
<P>
Since China signed a memorandum of understanding on health-care
technology cooperation with WHO in 1978, the two sides have
increase cooperation, which has helped improve China's medical
science in general and health-care management, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
As a result, such cooperation has helped China to use large
amount of funds and introduce suitable technologies, train needed
professionals, and promote information exchanges between China and
other countries in the medical area, he added.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that the Chinese government values very
much its cooperation with WHO.
</P>
<P>
Brundtland said that it is not accidental for her to choose
China to make her first official visit after assuming the WHO
position. That is because that China, with the largest population
in the world, has scored great achievements in the past two decades
in medial and health-care fields.
</P>
<P>
She noted that if the health of one quarter of the world's
population can be improved through WHO-China cooperation, it is a
great contribution to the world health-care cause.
</P>
<P>
To this end, she will work hard to combine WHO's global
strategy with China's actual conditions and increase cooperation
with China to control smoking and AIDS, as well as in promoting
people's health.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Price Falls On U.S. Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Wheat futures fell Friday on
the Chicago Board of Trade as the current U.S. inventory is at the
highest level in eight years, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Wheat for December delivery plunged 5.5 cents to 2.855 U.S. dollar
a bushel.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts say the sharp falling of wheat price reflected the
expectations that three African countries that recently received wheat
donated by the U.S. government were reselling much of it to Egypt, one
of the largest U.S. wheat buyers.
</P>
<P>
Wheat exports to date are 11 percent below year-ago levels as a
global economic crisis makes it more difficult to purchase American
wheat, a dollar-based commodity that becomes more expensive every time
the currency strengthens against others.
</P>
<P>
There are speculations that U.S. farmers and their counterparts in
Australia, Canada, Europe and elsewhere likely will drastically cut
production in 1999.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Philippines Economy Likely to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Although the APEC meeting
painted a fine picture for the Philippines among three other Asia
economies, and the IMF approved the country's growth target of 1
percent for 1998, senior government officials are seeing a
possible mild economic recession in the country this year.
</P>
<P>
The likely recession was due to a drastic fall in manufacturing
output and bad weather which pummeled agriculture, Felipe Medalla,
economic planning secretary and current director-general of the
National Economic Development Authority, said in a statement on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The upbeat tone of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
meeting and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) seemed to be
arising from Philippines' performance in investment and export,
which were considered twin engines to power the economy on rise.
</P>
<P>
When the financial flu swept through Asia, most of the
economies in the region suffered from currency depreciation, stock
market plunge and economic slowdown or even recession. But, boost
of investment and export in the Philippines had worked to turn
around most of these sufferings. This had been considered as signs
of economic recovery in the country.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of Philippine peso against the U.S. dollar
broke the psychological barrier of 40 on November 3, Now it
strengthened further to a nearly five-month high of 39.40. For
most of the last week, the currency kept below 40 against the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Government officials and traders attributed the rebound of the
currency and the rally of stock markets to the increased dollar
remittances by Filipino workers overseas, the IMF's loan
disbursement of 280 million U.S. dollars, the fund's loan of 1.34
billion U.S. dollars expected to be arriving by December 15, and
further loans from the IMF, the World Bank, the Asia Development
Bank, and the Japanese banks.
</P>
<P>
On the export side, statistics released last week showed that
the country posted its fourth consecutive month's trade surplus of
332 million U.S. dollars in September from a deficit of 619
million U.S. dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
For the first three quarters of this year, exports grew by 18.9
percent against declines registered by other countries in
Southeast Asia. For 1997, the Philippines' export growth was five
times of the region's average.
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of their two weeks of review, visiting IMF
officials agreed that the economy will keep its Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) growth at the level of 1 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
With these assessments, many government officials and analysts
believed the economy could be the sole country posting growth
among its neighbors this year.
</P>
<P>
But the surprises tumble of the manufacturing output and the
anticipated fall of farm production appeared to outweigh the gains
of investment and export. And the economic pick-up remains
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
The National Statistic Office said last Wednesday that the
manufacturing sector's output plunged by 17 percent in August from
a year earlier, and the value of the production was down by 7.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Weak demand and rising costs were seen as major contributors to
the fall, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Agriculture said last Thursday that the
country's agriculture production as of September contracted by
5.79 percent on a yearly basis, burdened by huge crop losses
caused by the extended EL Nino-induced drought.
</P>
<P>
The output of the agricultural sector amounts to 20 percent of
the Philippines' GDP and about 30-40 percent of the country's
population rely on this sector.
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking at a year-on-year GDP growth for the third quarter
of about minus 0.4 percent," Medalla said.
</P>
<P>
For the full year, he said, "my assessment is that we will have
a very small, close to zero (GDP) growth, based on pick-up in the
manufacturing sector in the fourth quarter."
</P>
<P>
"However, if the manufacturing sector continues to do as badly
in the fourth quarter as in the third quarter on a year-on-year
basis, then we may have to see a negative GDP growth," Medalla
said.
</P>
<P>
That would make the Philippines the eighth recession casualty
in Asia. The other seven are Japan, Indonesia, South Korea,
Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Although the Philippines is seen well on the track to recovery,
all these ups and downs indicate that the road to recovery might
be long and rocky.

<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Heavy snow fell in Beijing
with big feathery flakes starting from this morning, and the whole
city has been covered by this winter's first snow in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The snow covers a large area of northern China including
Beijing and Tianjin. The snowfall in Huairou County in northern
Beijing has reached 11 mm, and the snow on the ground has been 10
cm deep by 2 p.m., according to Chen Dagang of the Forecast

</P>
<P>
"Each snowfall in Beijing in recent years is usually 2 to 3 mm,
and today's heavy snow is very rare," said Zhao.
</P>
<P>
Agronomists say the snow is quite beneficial to wheat and other
winter crops.
</P>
<P>
Many residents of Beijing went out with cameras. And
kids are the happiest, playing snowballs outdoor.
</P>
<P>
However, the snowfall has caused great inconvenience to
travelers. Beijing's Capital International Airport has been closed

an airport official.
</P>
<P>
She said that 56 flights to Beijing have flown to other cities
around Beijing or returned. And the flights due to arrive in
Beijing this afternoon were delayed.
</P>

All the expressways linking up Beijing with other cities have
been closed too, and more policemen have been deployed to help
keep traffic order.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Urges DPRK to Stop "Paramilitary Actions" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Defense Ministry
Saturday appealed to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
to halt "paramilitary actions" against South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"We call on the North again to stop immediately all armed
provocations and warn strictly against such activities," said the
ministry in a statement on a DPRK vessel infiltration into South
Korean waters.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff Friday morning issued a full
alert against possible infiltration of DPRK special agents along the
northwestern coast after an unidentified vessel, which was caught by
South Korean military radars at 1:45 a.m. Friday, disappeared in South
Korean waters.
</P>
<P>
A joint military-police-intelligence investigation team, which
looked into the suspected DPRK vessel, has confirmed it as 10-ton
class vessel which carries five people and maneuvers with facility in
shallow waters, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the DPRK vessel left its base in
Buldangpo, five kilometers north of the Demilitarized Zone around
11:00 p.m. Thursday and entered into South Korean waters.
</P>
<P>
After being briefed the case, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
told a press conference that "there is no need to react too
sensitively or too panic. We need to adhere to our basic policy of
maintaining national security while facilitating inter-Korean
reconsiliation."
</P>
<P>
However, Kim said his government was to respond accordingly after
obtaining more details.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Saturday Kim would discuss the vessel issue
with U.S. President Bill Clinton, who arrived here Friday evening for
a two-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Talks for Transitional Body Back on Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Negotiations have been
put back on track for a multi-party interim political authority
(IPA) to be launched to prepare Lesotho for new elections within
18 months, South Africa's Saturday Star newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held in Pretoria Friday between the government
of South Africa and the three major opposition parties in
Lesotho: The Basotho National Party, Basutholand Congress Party
and Marematlou Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted sources close to the talks as saying that
there was no longer anything standing in the way of the
establishment of the IPA.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties earlier this week suspended talks with
the Lesotho government until the government withdrew arrests and
other security measures taken against their supporters for
involvement in a de facto coup in September.
</P>
<P>
A regional delegation led by South African Safety and Security
Minister Sydney Mufamadi put compromise proposals to the Lesotho
government earlier this week, and to the opposition parties
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Lesotho government's position had been that it could not
grant amnesty to the mutineers and other coup participants
because they were law breakers.
</P>
<P>
But it is understood that the South African government has
urged Maseru to show leniency, said Saturday Star.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted sources as saying both sides agreed that the
IPA was the correct forum to address security concerns.

<HEADLINE> Remains of Former Philippine Army Chief Allowed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Saturday authorized the return to the Philippines of the
remains of former Armed Forces chief of staff Fabian Ver.
</P>
<P>
In a television interview, Estrada said that when Ver was still
alive, he had approved his request to return home, based on the
recommendation of the intelligence community that the former
military officer, who died in Thailand Saturday morning, is no
longer a security threat.
</P>
<P>
He said he has ordered Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon to
allow the return of Ver's three children to the country as well.
</P>
<P>
"He can return. I have consulted with our intelligence
community and they have determined that he is not a security
threat," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I also instructed Secretary Siazon to provide his relatives
the travel documents to return to the Philippines," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, he will still consult with the top brass of
the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) whether or not to give
Ver military honors, or to allow his burial at the Libingan ng Mga
Bayani, a cemetery for the country's heroes.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Siazon said he has authorized Charge d'Affaires
Leslie Gatan of the Philippine embassy in Thailand to facilitate
the return of Ver's remains to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said the Philippine embassy there told him that it is
arranging the chartering of private plane to bring home the former
chief of staff's remains.
</P>
<P>
He added that he similarly authorized the concerned Philippine
embassies to allow Ver's sons Irwin, Wyrlo and Rexor to return.
</P>
<P>
Ver's sons were all in the AFP before they fled with their
father in 1986 at the height of the "People's Power" revolution,
which toppled President Ferdinand Marcos.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Urged to Clarify Suspicions of Nuclear Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and United States
Saturday jointly appealed to the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) to give international inspectors access to suspected
nuclear weapons facilities on its soil.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and
his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton at a joint press conference after
their summit Saturday morning here.
</P>
<P>
After a two-day visit to the DPRK, U.S. special envoy for
Korean Affairs Charles Kartman Thursday said there is evidence
that DPRK is constructing an underground facility in Kumchangni
for nuclear-related activities.
</P>
<P>
Under the Geneva Agreement signed in 1994, the DPRK is obliged
to freeze all its nuclear programs in return for receiving two
light-water reactors and heavy feul oil.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also demanded that the DPRK stop long-range
missile development projects which alledgedly pose serious threat
to the security and peace in Northeast Asia and the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, the two leaders agreed that their nations should
continue "engagement policy" toward the DPRK to help the country
to be more open- and reform-minded on a basis of closer security
alliance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they discussed economic and trade issues.
</P>
<P>
President Kim, who returned here Friday after a 10-day trip to
China and Malaysia, praised the role of the United States and
other economic heavyweights like Japan and China in helping Asian
nations restore their economies.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders expressed to cooperate against the economic
turmoil plaguing the world and to continue supporting sustained
restructuring of ailing economies in the nations gripped by
financial troubles.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton, who arrived here for a two-day visit, will
return to Washington via Guam next Monday. South Korea is the last
leg of Clinton's Asian tour, which has taken him to Japan.

<HEADLINE> Action Urged in Tackling Problems Facing Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean National
Economic Consultative Forum (NECF) has appealed all stakeholders
in the national economy to take urgent action to resolve the
country's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
The participants reached general consensus at the two-day
meeting of the NECF which ended in Harare Friday that all
stakeholders had not been pro-active in dealing with present
macro-economic problems, the daily Herald reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The government, business and labor acknowledged that the
country was facing an economic, social and political crisis.
</P>
<P>
This was evidenced by high inflation, the way the budget
deficit was being financed, the depreciation of the Zimbabwean
Dollar, low exports and declining confidence.
</P>
<P>
It was in view of all these factors that the NECF meeting
adopted a 39-point summary to redress the situation.
</P>
<P>
Among other measures, it called for action by all stakeholders
in the spirit of smart partnership to build, develop and grow
confidence in themselves, the country and the future.
</P>
<P>
It recommended that the government must cut and restructure
spending in favor of capital building, and that it must assist
small farmers to improve food security.
</P>
<P>
Economic officials were urged to inform the nation about
economic developments pro-actively.
</P>
<P>
Businesses were urged to export goods and services, acquire
new technology, invest in research and development, and develop
management and technical skills.
</P>
<P>
Labor must desist from confrontation and exercise restraint on
wage and salary increments, while finding a lasting formula for
the income levels to productivity and company performances, and
balancing this with new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint press conference at the end of the meeting,
Zimbabwean Minister of Finance Herbert Murerwa said that the
meeting was a success and that some of its recommendations would
be implemented by the government.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Improves Banking System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines is pursuing several measures to ensure the soundness
of the country's banking system and propel the country out of the
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the presidential palace here Saturday,
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said that these measures
include a further increase in capital ranging from 20 percent to
60 percent over 1998 minimum levels to be completed by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
The bank is also taking measures to solve the problem of bad
loans, which account for 10.5 percent of the total loans of the
commercial banks as of August this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that the government's financial support to
the banking system has been primarily in the form of
fully-collateralized emergency loans provided to stabilize banks
when runs occur due to panic.
</P>
<P>
"Even before the onset of the Asian crisis," Singson said, "the
central bank already adopted some defensive measure to protect the
system, which include a 20-percent limit on real estate lending to
loan portfolio, reduction of allowable real estate collateral
valuation from 70 percent to 60 percent and a 30-percent liquidity
requirement on foreign assets."
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, the country's banking system today has
one of the highest capital adequacy ratios in the region, at over
17 percent of risk assets as of June 1998.
</P>
<P>
Current banking problems in the Philippines are relatively
smaller than in other Asian countries, Singson said.

<HEADLINE> Nights in Northwestern China Province Are No Longer Dark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The people of northwest China's
Qinghai province can now enjoy more night life thanks to solar
energy and wind power, which have become the main sources of the
energy that powers people's daily lives.
</P>
<P>
The people of Gonghe County can now go to dance halls and
tourists can go to an entertainment center to sing folk songs or
enjoy folk dances with Tibetan people.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai is one of China's four large pastoral areas and many
people here are engaged in animal husbandry. Their mobility and
scattered lives on the plateau made it difficult to develop
electric power, and butter lamps and candles were quite common in
herdsmen's houses.
</P>
<P>
It used to be a terrible experience to walk on the open plateau
at night, but things have changed. People here now own electric
appliances and can enjoy listening to music, watching TV at home,
or singing Karaoke and dancing elsewhere. They now enjoy nightlife
like urban people.
</P>
<P>
Since a research institute was established in 1987, it has set
up seven solar energy power stations in the province and the one
million yuan (12,000 U.S. dollars) yearly funds allocated by the
provincial government have been used to encourage people to buy
solar energy and wind power generators, and to help 8,000
households solve their electricity problems.

<P>
KUNMING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- A new type of stock
cooperative based on share apportionment in line with the elements
of production such as land, capital, labor and technology has emerged
in rural areas throughout southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The stock cooperative was the brainchild of a group of young
Yunnan farmers.
</P>
<P>
Three young farmers in Jiangchuan County, including Pu Shunfen,
solicited the help of the local government and raised 90,000 yuan
(about 11,000 U.S. dollars) in 1996 to contact land-use rights for 10
hillside hectares for a 33-year period.
</P>
<P>
The Jiangchuan County Youth Sparkle Pilot Base emerged as the
first stock cooperative.
</P>
<P>
A short two years later, the cooperative's earning hit 178,000
yuan. The cooperative has taken full advantage of science and
technology to develop cultivation and animal husbandry operations
and currently grain, tobacco and pigs.
</P>
<P>
Other parties witnessed the cooperative's success and have
since followed suit by investing in diverse ventures related to
land, capital, labor and technology. Various areas have introduced
related ventures as a major means of promoting local economic
development.
</P>
<P>
New stock cooperative organizations have mushroomed in rural
areas throughout the province, with some 50 related ventures
already established or in the development stage.
</P>
<P>
Six young farmers in Gushan Village adopted the stock
cooperation concept to establish a flower and vegetable production
base. The young entrepreneurs currently market their products in
Guangdong Province and Hong Kong, with earning for this year alone
expected to hit 120,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Agronomists note that related economic organizations offer a
new solution to the industrialization and modernization of
agriculture based on stablizing the household contract
responsibility system. The new form also provides the possibility
for combining family and collective management.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan Governor Li Jiating has instructed related government
departments to study the emerging phenomenon in order to improve
the method and promote related ventures in other areas.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan Youth League plans to increase support to ensure the
sound development of stock cooperative organizations, according to
Director Luo Yingguang.

<HEADLINE> Investment Growth Benefits Southeast Coastal Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Southeast China's coastal
province of Fujian
has benefited greatly from the central government's policy to
increase investments in infrastructure in order to offset the
impact of the financial crisis engulfing Asia.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Governor Zhu Yayan attributed over 45 percent of the
province's gross domestic product (GDP) in the first nine months
of the year to investment growth.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that province's GDP grew 10.8 percent to 215
billion yuan in the first nine months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Fujian's total investments for the first
nine months hit 41.4 billion yuan, up 31.4 percent on the 1997
period. Fujian's increase in investments led all provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 percent of the investment went for infrastructure
projects, with the remained directed to areas such as agriculture
and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Investment growth enabled Fujian to complete seven key projects
this year, including a highway section, a power plant and a water
supply facility.
</P>
<P>
The increased scale of investments also promoted price hikes
for steel, cement and lumber.

<HEADLINE> China Taps Yellow River Delta Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Yellow River Delta, one of
China's three major river deltas, is rapidly emerging as a
regional center for the energy and chemical industries, as well as
a major center for agriculture and fisheries.
</P>
<P>
Economists attending a recent Yellow River Delta investment
conference held in the Chinese capital noted that the delta's
economic upsurge has lagged behind in the Yangtze River Delta and
Shanghai, as well as the Pearl River Delta and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, they pointed out that the Yellow River Delta has
significantly greater natural resources and potential.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the Yellow River Delta has 350,000
hectares of land readily suited for development, with the river,
China's second longest, creating an additional 2,000 hectares
annually.
</P>
<P>
The region has either constructed or upgraded expressways,
railways and ports in an attempt to attract more investment. Every
Highway or expressway stretching 55.6 km.is found on every 100
square kilometer of land area.
</P>
<P>
The delta has attracted overseas investments totaling 240
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from some 60 large companies and financial
groups from throughout the world attended the conference, which
listed 50 local projects related to construction, petrochemicals
agricultural development and pharmaceuticals for investors to
choose.

<HEADLINE> Changing Tastes of Chinese Film-goers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The recent showing of the
American movie "Deep Impact" demonstrates that such
disaster-themed western films are becoming less attractive
to Chinese audience than they used to be.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China started to import ten top American movies
produced by such prestigious Hollywood film giants as 20th Century
Fox and Warner Brothers.
</P>
<P>
Many of them, such as "Cyclone" and "Dantes Peak," were warmly
received by Chinese audience.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many American films came to China just several
months after their first screening in the United States, but some of
these still failed at Chinese box offices because Chinese audience
would now rather see foreign movies at the same time they are
showing in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
This situation would have been unimaginable twenty years ago
when Chinese people liked all foreign movies, whether newly
released or outdated.
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s and 70s, Chinese audience had a choice of only a
few dozen films from socialist countries such as Vietnam and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea. These films were shown
repeatedly at Chinese cinemas during those decades.
</P>
<P>
China began to import films from western countries after the
launching of the reform and opening-up policies in the late
1970s. When Chinese first saw such films as the French "Zero" and
the American "Superman" and "Kramer vs. Kramer," they were already
ten years old in their countries of origin. But with interesting
plots and western-style acting they were extremely popular among
Chinese audience.

<HEADLINE> Changing Tastes of Chinese Film-goers (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As time goes by, the taste of the Chinese audience is becoming
more particular. People now have the chance to enjoy a lot of good
foreign films, and domestic or foreign-made dull films won't
satisfy them any longer.
</P>
<P>
In the mid 1990s, Chinese film companies faced keen
competition, and audience interest began to play a major factor in
the decision-making process of film producers.
</P>
<P>
One Chinese film called "Days without Hero" was about a PLA (
Chinese People's Liberation Army) soldier devoting his life to
helping others, It focuses on the life of ordinary people and won
wide applause from local audience. At the same time, the film
made money.
</P>
<P>
From this film's success, many film companies in China set up a
new system to provide favorable creation and production conditions
for a new round of development in the country's own film industry.
</P>
<P>
These efforts have led to an abundance of outstanding movies
such as "Time to Remember," "Yellow Land," "Farewell, My
Concubine," and "Raise the Red Lantern," all of which made Chinese
audience more aware of their own filmmakers, and began to give
them a real choice among foreign and domestic films.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar electric power
authorities and a Chinese company have reached an agreement on the
implementation of two hydroelectric power projects in the central
part of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed Friday between the state-run Myanmar
Electric Power Enterprise (MEPE) and the China International Trust
and Investment Corporation Technology Co. Ltd. (CITIC), with the
presence of Second Secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and
Development Council Lieutenant-General Tin Oo, Minister of
Electric Power Major-General Tin Htut and Chinese Ambassador to
Myanmar Lian Dong.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, worth about 52 million U.S. dollars, the
two sides will implement the Mone Creek Reservoir Hydroelectric
Power Project on the Mone creek in Sedoktara township, Magway
division, and the Thaphanseik Reservoir Hydroelectric Power
Project on Mu river near Thaphanseik village west of Thityabin,
Kanbalu township, Sagaing division.
</P>
<P>
The first project could generate 330 million kilowatt-hours
(KWHs) per year, and the second 117 million KWHs annually on
completion.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the MEPE and the Yunnan Machinery and
Equipment Import and Export Corporation (YMEC) of China signed a
second contract worth 10 million dollars on the implementation of
the Paunglaung Hydroelectric Power Project (PHPP) in Pyinmana,
central Mandalay division of the country.
</P>
<P>
The PHPP's first 160-million-dollar contract was signed here
early last month. The project would have an installed capacity of
280 megawatts, accounting for 28 percent of Myanmar's existing
installed capacity.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, the YMEC has been cooperating with Myanmar in
building hydroelectric power stations and has exported to the
country complete sets of related equipment for 17 small and medium
power stations, which make up 94.4 percent of the country's
hydroelectric power projects.

<HEADLINE> Repatriation of Myanmar Refugees in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The repatriation of Myanmar
refugees staying in Bangladesh will resume next Wednesday, a
Foreign Ministry source told Xinhua on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 refugees would be repatriated in the first phase, out
of the more than 1,000 Rohingya refugees who have volunteered to
return to their homeland ending their five-year camping life in
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation of the refugees to Myanmar stalled in July
1997 reportedly as a result of the refugees' refusal to return,
and to date about 21,000 Rohingyas are still staying in two camps
in Cox's Bazar, southeastern Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
A report in Saturday's edition of The Independent newspaper
quoted the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) as
saying that all measures have been taken to ensure the smooth
repatriation and relevant UN bodies in Myanmar are ready to
receive and rehabilitate them.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 21,000 refugees in the transit camps, the Myanmar
authorities have so far cleared the names of 7,000 with the rest
awaiting clearance, and the Bangladesh government has submitted a
fresh list of about more than 12,000 refugees for clearance from
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Yangon early this month, Bangladesh Foreign
Minister Abdus Samad Azad discussed the issue of refugees with
Myanmar officials, and the Myanmar authorities agreed to resume
the repatriation process.
</P>
<P>
More than 250,000 Rohingyas crossed Bangladesh border in 1991,
and about 230,000 of them have been repatriated under a memorandum
of understanding between Bangladesh and Myanmar, mediated by the
UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 of the refugees are reportedly political refugees, who
are wanted in Myanmar on different charges, The Independent
newspaper report said.

<HEADLINE> Union, NBA Owners Talk Making Little Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sides had spent almost nine hours speaking face to face,
30 minutes more than their session on October 28. Negotiators for
NBA owners and players returned to the bargaining table this
morning, one day after commissioner David Stern said that
progress must be made to avoid a cancellation of the entire
season.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a televised interview, Stern also revealed there
are about 10 NBA teams who would be better off financially by not
playing the season. He added that he is "very unhappy" with the
lockout, which is in its 143rd day.
</P>
<P>
At lunchtime, union president Patrick Ewing stood outside the
conference room and said to a league official: "Let's get back in
there. I want to play."
</P>
<P>
The players made a change to their earlier proposal for a
possible escrow tax on player salaries in years 4, 5 and 6 of a
seven-year deal.
</P>
<P>
The owners later make a counterproposal that included the
change, a union spokesman said, and the players came back with
yet another offer before the sides broke for dinner.
</P>
<P>
The talks were expected to continue late into the night. "If
we don't make a deal at some point, the season will cancel
itself, "Stern said. "We're up against the calendar deadline."
</P>
<P>
NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik said as he arrived in the
morning. "I don't really have any reason to think we'll make any
progress."

WELLINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- More than a quarter of New
Zealand adults seeing a family doctor suffered a diagnosable
mental disorder in the past six months, a Wellington-based
newspaper quoted a report prepared by the National Health
Committee of New Zealand as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report, Guidelines for Assessing and Treating Anxiety, aims
to make primary health care professionals more familiar with
anxiety disorders and their treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion quoted John Bushnell, who chaired the report's
working party, as saying that one of four primary care patients
had a psychological component to their illness, though general
practitioners failed to recognize that in about half of them.
</P>
<P>
It is important that health professionals are familiar with the
 symptoms and treatments of psychological disorders so people can
get the right treatment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bushnell added that anxiety disorders are prevalent and can
be disabling. Though some anxiety is normal, too much anxiety for
too long can disrupt people's lives.
</P>
<P>
Symptoms can include fear and worry, a racing heart, muscle
tension, dizziness and shortness of breath, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It can disrupt people's working and social life," Bushnell
said.

recently by what it called ethnic Albanian terrorists. The
committee said the attacks were aimed at halting the peace process
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The committee met on Friday in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo,
to discuss the political and security situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a statement following the meeting, they said the attacks
were launched in the strife-torn province to sabotage the
normalization process of the situation there, Tanjug news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
According to information from the Pristina Press Center, armed
groups of ethnic Albanians assaulted Serb policemen early Friday
morning, killing two and seriously injuring three.
</P>
<P>
The committee also criticized, in its statement, some
international organizations and major powers for not condemning
the terrorist activities in Kosovo, thus lending support directly
and indirectly to the attempts and actions by the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
In Belgrade, two main ruling coalition parties, the Socialist
Party of Serbia (SPS) and the Serbia Radical Party, fiercely
condemned the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) for interfering in the internal affairs of
Yugoslavia on the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
The SPS criticized NATO in a statement on Friday for "trying to
confuse terrorism activities by ethnic Albanian separatist bandits
with the legitimate actions of the Yugoslav police and military
forces."
</P>
<P>
It said the activities by "the Kosovar Albanian bandits" were
to blame for the tension in Kosovo, not the actions by the
Yugoslav security forces.
</P>
<P>
In his statement on Thursday, the Serbia Radical Party Chairman
Vojislav Ssesselj accused the United States of attempting to set
up hurdles in the dialogue on the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
The Americans are not trying to seek solutions to the Kosovo
problems, but their motives are to blackmail, threaten and
pressure Serbia, he said.
</P>
<P>
He further pointed out that the ultimate purpose of Washington
was to deploy troops in the neighboring countries of Macedonia and
Yugoslavia to serve the needs of the eastward expansion of NATO.

<HEADLINE> India to Extend Tax Holiday for Power Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Union government
plans to extend a 10-year tax holiday to mega-power projects in a
bid to enhance power development in the country, official sources
said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Promoters of all mega-power projects would be given the same
tax holiday. Under the new mega-power policy, promoters are
allowed a 10-year tax holiday which can be availed of during the
first 15 years after the project is commissioned.
</P>
<P>
At present, independent power producers can avail of a total
tax holiday of five years and a 70-percent tax holiday for another
five years.
</P>
<P>
The new incentive measure would be incorporated in the Union
budget and the policy notification for mega-power projects would
be issued soon.
</P>
<P>
The promoters of non mega-power projects, however, would
continue to pay customs duties as applicable. The waiver of
customs duties or levies is only for mega-power projects, the same
sources said.

COLOMBO, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's number one foreign
exchange earner, the textile and garment industry, earned 1.71
billion U.S. dollars in the first 10 months of this year, a 21
percent increase over the same period last year, the official

During the past three years, the government has taken a series
of measures to strengthen the textile and garment industry.
</P>
<P>
As a result of attractive incentives offered by the government,
50 more garment factories are set up in different parts of the

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Leather Goods Exports to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 21 (Xinhua) -- A weak baht and Thailand's
growing reputation for quality have resulted in a banner year for
exports of leather bags and travel accessories, according to The
Thai Leather Goods Association.
</P>
<P>
Export value is expected to reach 20 billion baht (540 million
U.S. dollars) this year, an increase of 67 percent over last year,
Association President Sunanta Wuthisakul was quoted Saturday by
the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
But as exchange rates stabilize and the world economy slows,
export growth of 15 percent to 20 percent next year would be
considered healthy, she added.
</P>
<P>
Relatively few barriers exist for exporting Thai leather goods,
so the local industry has been able to focus on other areas such
as design and brand-name creation and promotion.
</P>
<P>
The industry has received government support to bring Italian
experts to Thailand to help develop designs and recommend sources
of raw materials, which are sometimes scarce.
</P>
<P>
Leather goods with Thai brand names are increasing in Asia and
the Middle East, and are accepted as market leaders in ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations), Sunanta said.
</P>
<P>
More brand-name products will be promoted in the Middle East to
give opportunities to new exporters, she said.
</P>
<P>
China is another interesting market though there is a strong
competition from local producers.
</P>
<P>
The local industry intends to make Thai leather fashion goods
the leaders in Asia within five years, Sunanta said.

NANNING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The normalization of
Sino-Vietnamese relations since 1990 has sparked booming
cross-border trade and provided an excellent business opportunity
for Guangxi businessman Zhong Zhicai.
</P>
<P>
Zhong operates a wholesale drink business near the Pingxiang
Friendship Pass between south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region and Viet Nam.
</P>
<P>
The wholesale places daily orders with breweries throughout the
region and sends delivery trucks to numerous border areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhong has been selling beer for nearly a decade and has sold
over 100,000 cases of beer to Vietnamese businesses annually.
</P>
<P>
Local residents point to Zhong as a millionaire and the
wealthiest resident in Pinxiang's Kafeng Village.
</P>
<P>
The wealthy entrepreneur Zhong is only of 2,160 local residents
who have amassed substantial wealth from border trade, according
to statistics released by the village committee.
</P>
<P>
Kafeng, located at the foot of Friendship Pass, is separated
from Viet Nam by mountains and rivers.
</P>

The booming border trade has raised the per capita income for
local villagers to 2,310 yuan, significantly higher than the

<HEADLINE> China Needs Time to Ban Leaded Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- China needs time to increase
the use of unleaded fuel as a prerequisite to the implementation
of rigorous emission control regulations, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"The automotive industry needs time for the production and
installation of catalytic converters, while it will also take time
for the petrochemical sector to develop and manufacture
high-quality fuels," said Zhang Suixin, chief representative of
the Volkswagen Group's Beijing office.
</P>
<P>
He recommended that Beijing, which will next year become the
first city in China to enforce vehicle emission standards
comparable to European Union nations, should review the
difficulties and give enterprises leeway to prepare for the
upgrading.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission (SDPC) is drafting a
regulation on management of the safety, emissions and economy of
automobiles based on automotive industry policy. It is expected to
be submitted for legislative approval at the beginning of next
year.
</P>
<P>
Chen Guoming, director of Sinopec's technology supervision
department, said: "Don't try to equip vehicles with three-way
catalytic converters too quickly, because leaded fuel can't be
abolished over night across China."
</P>
<P>
Gas stations selling unleaded fuel have been set up in 22
cities throughout China. However, spurred by the huge demand from
millions of farming vehicles, leaded fuel is still widely used in
vast rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of gas stations were established and are being
operated by individuals, and companies affiliated with armies and
government autorities, causing disorder in the market,
authoritative sources said.
</P>
<P>
Rampant smuggling and the proliferation of small refinery
plants have brought an influx of refined oil products of poor
quality.
</P>
<P>
If the pollutants and harmful substances "couldn't be removed
from oil during the process of refining," the installation of
electronic fuel injection devices and catalytic converters would
be "meaningless" as "unqualified fuel can destroy them," said Li
Gang, deputy chief of the SPDC's machinery division.

<HEADLINE> Philippines May Downscale 1999 Expenditure Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government would
downscale its expenditure program for 1999 if it fails to secure
foreign financing to fund the additional outlay, Finance Secretary
Edgardo Espiritu said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The secretary told a press conference that the government would
definitely not source funds domestically just to meet the higher
budget deficit allowance given by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
</P>
<P>
The IMF has allowed the government to incur a budget deficit of
68.4 billion pesos (1.7 billion U.S. dollars) for 1999 to
stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
But the government would have to incur additional borrowing to
finance the deficit.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said that if the government has to source fund
domestically, interest rates based on the treasury bill could go
up.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to borrow locally," he said.
</P>
<P>
Government sources said that the 68.4-billion-peso budget
deficit would help the country achieve a growth target of between
2 and 2.5 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The IMF warned the Philippines that incurring a lower budget
deficit means a lower growth rate and a backward step for the
country next year.
</P>
<P>
However, Espiritu said that he would prefer lower growth with
lower debt.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto's Wealth Probe Must End by 2000: Legislators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The three main factions in
Indonesia's House of Representatives (DPR) have agreed that an
official investigation into the wealth of former president
Soeharto must be launched immediately and concluded before the
turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
According to the Indonesian Observer Saturday, the ruling
Golkar (Functional Group), the Armed Forces (ABRI) and the United
Development Party (PPP) said the government need not wait for a
special law to probe Soeharto's riches.
</P>
<P>
The fourth House faction, the government-backed Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI), had no comment.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Golkar faction Andi Mattalatta said President
B.J. Habibie's administration must be able to finish the wealth
probe before it gets replaced by a more legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
The next plenary meeting of the People's Consultative Assembly
(MPR), which will comprise new legislators, is scheduled to take
place in December 1999 to elect new president and vice president.
</P>
<P>
Mattalatta said the wealth probe should commence immediately
because existing laws on corruption in the criminal code are
sufficient for justice to be served.
</P>
<P>
Aisyah Amini of the PPP faction endorsed the argument, saying
the government will be able to refer to existing laws when
conducting the wealth probe.
</P>
<P>
"It depends on the intensive steps taken by the government. The
House will only monitor its actions," Amini added.
</P>
<P>
Acmad Roestandi of the ABRI faction likewise demanded a quick
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after attending a prayer session Friday,
House Speaker Harmoko said he had already called on the government
to launch the wealth probe.
</P>
<P>
"As House Speaker, I have said the investigation must not
proceed slowly," he said, adding the House must issue a new law as
the legal basis for a wealth probe.
</P>
<P>
Habibie is facing mounting public pressure to force Soeharto
and his family to account for the fortune they allegedly amassed
through corruption over the past 32 years.
</P>
<P>
Habibie has already launched an investigation into Soeharto's
wealth. An official at the Attorney General's Office Friday said
Soeharto has 2.3 million U.S. dollars in 72 domestic banks. Some
estimates have put Soeharto's wealth at 40 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto has denied having any money stashed overseas.
</P>
<P>
Critics claim the government and the Attorney General's Office
are deliberately stalling efforts to recover the Soeharto fortune.
Thousands of students Thursday marched in Central Jakarta,
demanding that Soeharto be put on trial for alleged corruption and
power abuse.
</P>
<P>
The fight against corruption in Indonesia should begin by
bringing "the big fish" to court, said Mar'ie Muhammad, chairman
of the Indonesian Society for Transparency, Friday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rome Court Revokes Ocalan's Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A Rome court Friday revoked the
arrest of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan but suggested that
he remain in Rome under surveillance until the deadline for a
possible extradition passes.
</P>
<P>
The decision to revoke the international arrest warrant issued
by Turkey, which holds Ocalan responsible for thousands of deaths
in his movement's 14-year struggle for autonomy, unleashed more
anti-Italian feelings in Ankara. Premier Mesut Yilma threatened
his country's "eternal hostility."
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK),
was arrested by Italian police as he arrived at Rome airport on
November 12.
</P>
<P>
The decision to overturn the Turkish arrest warrant means
Ocalan cannot now be extradited to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He is waiting for a commission at the Italian Interior Ministry
to rule on his application for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
The Rome Court of Appeals said it rejected Turkey's arrest
warrant because of the death penalty which Ocalan would face if he
were tried there. The Italian constitution forbids extradition to
countries where capital punishment is possible.
</P>
<P>
The 49-year old Kurdish rebel leader cannot be released however
because of another international arrest warrant against him, which
the court upheld. The second warrant was issued in 1990 by
Germany, where Ocalan is wanted for murder and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
But because Ocalan is unlikely to flee Italy, it was decided
that neither imprisonment nor house arrest were necessary. The
court converted the original arrest into obligatory residence in
Rome. Ocalan will have to report to police daily.
</P>
<P>
Bonn, which according to practice now has a month to present an
extradition request, has indicated it will not pursue the matter.
</P>
<P>
With about a million Kurds living within its borders, it fears
violent protests if Ocalan were to be taken there for trial.
</P>
<P>
"If Germany doesn't' request extradition, in 30 days Ocalan
will be a free man, without even the obligation to stay at home, "
Justice Minister Oliviero Diliberto said.

<HEADLINE> North China City Exhibition On Overseas Investment's Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 21 (Xinhua) -- North China port city of
Tianjin will hold an exhibition of the achievements of overseas
investment for the past two decades, in Beijing from November 27
to December 1.
</P>
<P>
It will use the exhibits to provide general information about
the successful use of overseas investment in this largest city in
northern China.
</P>
<P>
A city government official said that Tianjin used 21 billion
U.S. dollars of overseas investment and approved over 12,000
overseas-funded enterprises from 1978 to the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the large amount of overseas investment, it has
maintained its double-digit growth for 6 consecutive years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin's overseas-funded enterprises had a total output value
of 77 billion yuan and 3.1 billion U.S. dollars worth of exports
in 1997, accounting for 43.5 percent and 62.5 percent of the
city's totals, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin has attracted investment from 104 countries and
regions, with Japan, the United States, and Europe accounting for
over 35 percent of the investment. The overseas-funded
enterprises employed a total of 300,000 local people.
</P>
<P>
The project to improve the city's rundown houses has attracted
about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars. Half the overseas investment in
Tianjin has gone to the Binhai New Area, where construction work
began in 1994. The area had a GDP of 38.2 billion yuan in 1997,
accounting for 30.8 percent of the city's total.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is expected to
post a 0.4 percent year-on-year contraction in gross domestic
product (GDP) in the third quarter of this year and a near zero
growth for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking at a year-on-year GDP growth for the third quarter
of about minus 0.4 percent," the Malaya newspaper Saturday quoted
Felipe Medalla, secretary of socio-economic planning, as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that for the full year the country will have "a very
small, close to zero growth" based on a pick-up in the
manufacturing sector in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
"But of course, GNP (gross national product), which factors in
the remittances of our overseas workers, will continue to be
positive," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has targeted a 1 percent GDP growth for this
year.
</P>
<P>
The economy posted a year-on-year GDP growth of 0.2 percent in
the first half of the year despite a 1.2 percent decline in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Two successive quarterly declines in GDP technically constitute
a recession.

"It is probable that some OAS member countries will present
their plans at the meeting to be held in Washington on December 10

<HEADLINE> Doctors Correct Spina Bifida Through Womb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Surgeons at Children's
Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania
corrected spina bifida in a 23-week-old fetus in the womb, making
the baby to be born with normal leg movements.
</P>
<P>
According to Friday's Washington Post, spina bifida affects one
in 2,000 live births. Because of a lack of bone and skin over the
spine, the nerves of the spinal cord are exposed and can be
damaged. Many children born with the condition are paraplegic and
also suffer from hydrocephalus.
</P>
<P>
However, studies on sheep showed that if the condition is
detected early and corrected in the womb before the nerves are
damaged, the leg functions can be saved.
</P>
<P>
Scott Adzick and his colleagues said an ultrasound scan and the
mother's abnormal blood test showed that the 20-week-old fetus had
the condition.
</P>
<P>
They operated through the mother's womb, using general
anesthesia three weeks later. Seven weeks after the operation,
the mother gave birth to a boy by Caesarean section.
</P>
<P>
The infant's leg movements were normal at birth and he was
developing well at six months, the newspaper said.

CARACAS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan crude closed the
week at an average of 9.18 U. S. dollars per barrel, 70 U.S. cents
down from last the average of last week, the Venezuelan Energy and
Mines Ministry said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The average price for November is 9.86 dollars per barrel, less
than the 11.01 dollars for the year's average, and far from the
15.50 dollars estimated by the government for 1998, and from the
16.32 dollar average for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesmen said the oil market weakness can be
attributed to the excess supply and the big inventories
accumulated by the main consumers.
</P>
<P>
Oil accounts for 70 percent of the Venezuelan exports and
provides 50 percent of its national budget income.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela has expected some 19 billion dollars from its 1998
oil sales, but that will be reduced to 12 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Hopes OPEC Production Cut Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia wants the OPEC
(Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) oil production
cut period agreed upon in Vienna in June this year to be extended
until the end of 1999 to let the world oil price stabilize at a
satisfactory level.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see the period in which OPEC oil production
is cut by 30,000 barrels a day extended and applied by other OPEC
member countries," Mines and Energy Minister Kuntoro Mangkusubroto
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kuntoro made the statement in view of an OPEC meeting to be
held on November 25 in Vienna, according to Antara News Agency
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under the June OPEC agreement, Indonesia's oil production quota
was set at 1.28 million barrels per day, whereas in its state
budget, the country's oil production capacity was assumed to be
1.52 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
According to Kuntoro, Indonesia's stance on the duration of the
OPEC oil production cut was based on the findings of a study on
Indonesia's capacity to supply oil to the world market, including
the volume of crude petroleum in the hands of traders.
</P>
<P>
"So, our stance is in accordance with the state budget and
quite realistic. This means that we appreciate the anticipation
that the price of world crude oil will next year average 17 U.S.
dollars per barrel and increase by only 0.50 U.S. dollar per
barrel during the next two to three years," he said.
</P>
<P>
About the world oil price which had lately shown a declining
tendency, Kuntoro said he was optimistic that it would improve. He
cited the fact that the present average price level of 11 to 12
dollars per barrel was still about 40 percent higher than its
level in June.
</P>
<P>
Asked how Indonesia would react if OPEC member countries
proposed a further oil production quota cut, Kuntoro replied that
it would depend on the arguments for such a proposal.

Speaking to reporters in Ankara, Turkish Foreign Ministry
spokesman Necati Utkan said that the ruling made by the Italian
court was hard to understand, according to the Anatolia News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was freed early Friday but was asked to remain in
Rome. The Italian court, which made the decision, said that Italy
cannot extradite a criminal to a country which permits death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, the point that worries us most is that the court
made this decision at the encouragement of the Italian
government," Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested by the Italian police last week after
arriving in Rome from Russia. Police said the PKK leader held a

"Unfortunately, both sides continue to commit acts that violate
the cease-fire and harm the prospects for peace," said Albright.
</P>
<P>
She urged the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) refrain from
reprisals and efforts to intimidate, but its provocations do not
justify failures by the Serb government to meet its obligations.
</P>

Meanwhile, Albright complained that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic is violating ceasefire agreement. (US-Albright-Kosovo)

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Paper Exports to Increase This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's paper exports are
expected to jump to 4.4 million tons this year from 1.5 million
tons in 1997, newspapers reported Saturday quoting a top executive
at a local paper operation.
</P>
<P>
Chief executive operating officer of publicly-listed PT Tjiwi
Kimia Suresh Kilan said here Friday that the surge in exports
would help compensate for this year's 1.6 million ton drop in
domestic demands due to the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
He projected that this year the total production capacity of
the country's paper industry would reach 10.3 million tons coming
from 73 mills.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that the country's pulp and paper industry
would have a turnover of 5.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, which
represent 5.7 percent of the total gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
He added that the total export value of the pulp and paper
industry would reach 3 billion U.S. dollars, or 7 percent of the
country's 43 billion U.S. dollars non-oil and gas export revenue.

<HEADLINE> China's "Reform Cradle" County Aiming High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, November 21 (Xinhua) -- For most Chinese people, it is
still a dream to own a private car, but for Gao Yunlian, a
40-year-old former beggar, it has been a reality for a couple of
years.
</P>
<P>
Fengyang County, in east China's Anhui Province, where Gao
lives, used to be one of the poorest counties in the country and
was known as home to thousands of farmer-turned beggars.
</P>
<P>
Gao, the farmer-turned entrepreneur, owns a cement plant, with
a capital of 120 million yuan, which generated more than 100
million yuan in sales each year, with pretax profits reaching 1.5
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
"It is the reform that has brought us the opportunities to
become well-off," Gao said.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1978, the ruling Chinese Communist Party's 11th
Central Committee was holding the landmark Third Plenary Session
to launch the reform and opening-up policy. Coincidentally, 18
poverty-stricken farmers in Xiaogang Village in Fengyang county
signed a secret agreement at the risk of their lives.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, they divided the then People's
Commune-owned farmlands into small pieces for each family to work
on them independently, an act that was seen as "capitalist" and
might lead to severe punishment at the time.
</P>
<P>
The bold move lifted the Xiaogang farmers out of starvation as
the village harvested 61,500 kg of grain in 1979, compared with a
mere 10,000 kg in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The practice later developed into the "household contract
responsibility system" with remuneration linked to output, and
was widely spread in Fengyang and then nationwide, setting pace
for the country's rural reform.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, Fengyang has seen a rapid growth in
economy, with the yearly per capita income for local farmers
increasing some 21 times to reach 2,050 yuan in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"That means we have solved the problem of food and clothing,"
said Li Yaocai, secretary of the County Party Committee, "but we
still lag behind many other parts of the country, especially the
coastal provinces where people have benefited much from a
market-oriented economy."
</P>
<P>
He attributed this to the county's excessive dependence on grain
production since the late 1970s. "We should emancipate our mind
once again as what we did in 1978," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the county government initiated a new round of reform
to focus on the development of the private sector, township- and
village-based businesses, and the industrialization of
agriculture, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
So far, Fengyang has seen about 8,700 private businesses
registered, and paid over 50 million yuan in taxes in 1997,
accounting for nearly 60 percent of the county's total tax
revenues, he added.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that one fourth of local farmers have
been employed by local businesses.
</P>
<P>
Fengyang has also been open to overseas investors, with six
such projects approved so far, involving a pledged investment of
100 million U.S. dollars.

XINING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Since April this year, the
forestry police of northwest China's Qinghai Province has
discovered four instances of illegal falcon hunting involving 10
foreigners and has expelled those foreign hunters from the

<HEADLINE> FIA: EC Cannot Rule on Formula One Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The FIA issued a statement saying its agreement with
Ecclestone was simply an "acknowledgment" of which groups owned
which media rights to Formula One auto racing.
</P>
<P>
The statement came in response to a British newspaper report
which said the group's president, Max Mosley, had indicated the a
greement might be rendered null and void by Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of law (the agreement) is merely an
acknowledgment as to who owns what. It has no effect on trade or
competition," Moseley said in the statement on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ecclestone is trying to raise up to 2.0 billion U.S. dollars
via a bond issue secured on Formula One television rights.
Speculation this week has mounted that investors might be
reluctant to buy the bond until a Commission investigation into
concerns about anti-competitive practices by Formula One was
completed.
</P>
<P>
The Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, has
said results of its probe were unlikely to be completed before
year end.
</P>
<P>
The FIA statement on Friday said Ecclestone's company held all
the rights to exploit Formula One because of long-standing
arrangements with race promoters and ownership of historical
property rights, as well as historical arrangements with the
teams and the FIA.
</P>
<P>
"In four jurisdictions, certain other parties such as the
national motorsports federation may own some of the rights, but
in such cases, Formula One Administration has been granted the
relevant rights to exploit Formula One through arrangements which
vary according to the relevant local laws," it said.
</P>
<P>
"All these federations are members of the FIA General
Assembly, which last month voted unanimously in favor of the FIA
Acknowledgment Agreement," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> McManaman Frustrated by Real Transfer Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local reports said on the day that the 26-year-old became a
free agent in the summer under the Bosman ruling and his advisor
Colin Gordon has claimed that 14 clubs are interested in securing
his services.
</P>
<P>
European Cup holders Real have been reported as saying they
are close to tying up a deal but McManaman said that he hoped to
agree a new deal with his hometown club.
</P>
<P>
"I am getting frustrated by the things that are being said by
Real Madrid," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At this stage I am still talking with Liverpool and if it can
be worked out that will be great, but nothing has changed in the
last few weeks in our negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"Liverpool have told me they haven't been approached by anyone
and that is the only way I will find out if a club really is
interested."
</P>
<P>
McManaman can sign a pre-contract agreement with another club
from January 1 that will commit him to a summer move but he would
not discuss on Friday whether he will start the New Year by
handing his French boss Gerard Houllier another headache.
</P>
<P>
"Things can change on January 1 but we are in November and
that is a long way away." said McManaman.
</P>
<P>
Houllier, who took over in sole charge at Liverpool last week
and watched the club lose 3-1 at home to Leeds, has redoubled his
efforts to reach a deal with the player.
</P>
<P>
However the Liverpool Daily Echo reported that the Reds were no
w willing to accept a cut price fee of 2 million pounds ($3.32
million) rather than let McManaman go free.
</P>
<P>
It said that chief executive Rick Parry had met the Real
president and was told by Sanz that the side had been approached
by McManaman's representatives but do not plan to make an
immediate move for the player.

LONDON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's First
Minister David Trimble said Friday Sinn Fein will not be allowed
onto the power sharing executive until the IRA starts to surrender

He told the Irish Association for Cultural, Economic and Social

wing of the Irish Republican Army, would not be able to take its
seats in the Northern Ireland assembly, according to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
"So long as no start has been made toward the decommissioning
of all the terrorist arsenals, a constant-implied threat remains,"
he said.

According to the Northern Ireland peace agreement, all the

<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz said here Friday night the Nuclear Safety Act was at
its final stages of preparation to block export of nuclear
technology to any third country.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has been working on such an act for quite a long time
and this would be put before the Federal Cabinet shortly, Aziz
told reporters at Islamabad airport upon his arrival from a
three-day visit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Nuclear Safety Act is expected to be tabled before the
Parliament within two months, said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
All the nuclear powers have such laws to check export of
nuclear technology and avoid "accidental use of nuclear weapons,"
Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
This act envisages both administrative steps and other measures
to stop export of nuclear technology, he added.
</P>
<P>
Aziz termed his three-day visit to Japan "on the whole as
successful," in view of the Japanese support to resumption of
multilateral aid to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese government has decided to support the IMF
(International Monetary Fund) package along loans from
multilateral development banks," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
"We also held discussions with the Japanese on the restoration
of their bilateral aid to Pakistan," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Opens Climate Research Station on Nauru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Department of
Energy(DOE) said here Friday that it opened its second long-term
climate research station on Nauru in the Central Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
This facility will collect information needed to better
understand climate change, focusing on the way the sun's energy is
transmitted, absorbed and reflected in the tropics and on the role
of clouds in heating and cooling the atmosphere, said a DOE Press
Release.
</P>
<P>
In line with DOE's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement(ARM)
program, three such stations will be built, the first one has been
operating on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea since October 1996,
and the third one will be established on Kiritimati Island in
2000.
</P>
<P>
The instruments installed on Nauru are housed in customized sea
containers, designed to provide long-term, basic climatological
observations. Each facility operates semi-autonomously and has an
integrated set of instruments that measure surface radiation
balance, surface meteorology, cloud properties, and limited
atmospheric properties.
</P>
<P>
In his congratulation, U.S. Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson
said that "Climate change is an important priority for the Clonton
administration."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Opposes Butler's Requests for Weapons Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Friday opposed
chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler's requests for handing
out its secret documents of biological and chemical programs.
</P>
<P>
In two letters replying to Butler, Executive Chairman of the
United Nations Special Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, Iraq said the trend of discussions in
the United Nations Security Council was to proceed first with a
promised comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with the
obligations under relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Butler's requests for access to the archives of a
number of government departments, Iraq said U.N. teams has
conducted long searches of many of them but found nothing contrary
to its declarations.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the request you made at this time, which is of a
general nature, seems to be provocative rather than professional,"
the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding to the documents requested by Butler in his letter to
Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz early this week, Iraq said
the alleged documents did not exist.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced to resume full and complete cooperation with the
United Nations last Saturday, and the U.N. arms inspectors
returned to Iraq on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Smell of Gunpowder in EU-U.S. Banana Trade War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The tit-for-tat dispute
triggered by a new banana regime between the European Union (EU)
and the United States has generated a stronger smell of gunpowder
as the European Union firmly rejected any U.S. threats and made it
clear Friday that the EU is ready to meet the challenge in an
accelerated World Trade Organization dispute settlement panel on
this case.
</P>
<P>
Vice President of the European Commission Leon Brittan said,
"My message to the United States is a simple one: use the WTO
system, but do not expect us to bend it to suit a timetable that
you are seeking to impose by means of illegal unilateral action."
</P>
<P>
On November 10, Washington issued a five-page list of EU export
products worth 1.38 billion ECU (about 1.52 billion U.S. dollars)
which could be targeted if the dispute is not resolved next month.
The U.S. action means imposition of 100 percent duties on a range
of EU export products unless the EU changes its mind on banana
import policy.
</P>
<P>
In an immediate response to the U.S. threats, European
Commission President Jacques Santer insists that the EU has made
changes in accordance with last year's WTO ruling, and claims the
U.S. should appeal to the WTO once more if it still has grievance.
Santer appealed to U.S. President Bill Clinton to give his "urgent
personal attention" to the implications of the sanctions planned,
but the U.S. president has so far not replied to the EU head's
letter of November 10.
</P>
<P>
Following a WTO ruling, the EU has made a series of changes to
its banana regime including licensing arrangements, which will
enter into force on January 1, 1999. According to a EU list, quota
allocations are given to all substantial banana suppliers to the
EU: Ecuador (26.17 percent), Costa Rica (25.61 percent), Colombia
(23.03 percent) and Panama (15.76 percent).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. said it has the right to impose the sanctions as it
said the EU has failed to meet the demands of the WTO's dispute
panel on the EU's banana regime, which Washington won last year.
</P>
<P>
"You cannot enter the court room pointing a pistol at the other
side. We are in as much of a hurry as you are to settle this. Just
drop the pistol and we can get on with it," Brittan said Friday on
behalf of the 15-state EU.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the matter deals with various interests on different
parts of the world. The EU's banana import policy is actually
designed to protect producers in the former Caribbean colonies of
Britain and France. Therefore, the U.S. sanction list appeared to
target the products of France, Britain, Spain and Portugal, the
main defenders of the current banana regime, which offers
preferential access to the poor banana producers in the Carribean.
</P>
<P>
The EU says it is the world's largest banana market: its 4
million tons of imports are estimated to be worth 4.5 billion ECU
(about 4.95 billion U.S. dollars) a year at the retail level.
Meanwhile, U.S. multinationals like Chiquita and Dole which
control the Latin American banana crop already have three-quarters
of the EU market.
</P>
<P>
So it is not surprising that the U.S. sanction is prompted, as
many suspect, by domestic political pressures particularly
following big contribution to the Democratic Party by Chiquita. It
was reported that the Clinton administration lodged its complaint
with the WTO last year just 24 hours after Chiquita decided to
donate 500,000 U.S. dollars to Democratic Party funds. Honduras,
Guatemala and Ecuador, the three central American banana
producers, also reportedly joined the action.
</P>
<P>
This time, the EU also regrets the tone of the most recent U.S.
statements which hardly suggests a wish to reach an amicable
settlement in accordance with international rules, as Brittan said
Friday in Brussels, the capital of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU head said that if the United States now wishes
to take WTO dispute settlement procedures against the new EU
banana regime, the EU welcomes this and urges them to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
"We have already responded positively to a request from
Ecuador. We remain ready to cooperate with the U.S. in
accelerating a panel provided that they make clear that they are
abandoning the unilateral route and respect the rules and
procedures of the WTO. They cannot impose an arbitrary deadline
plucked out of the air and determined by their timetable for
illegal unilateral action," Brittan said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the EU has made clear for some months that it is
prepared to participate in the settlement mechanism on the new
regime and, as Brittan said, the EU offered this to the United
States on September 21 this year, but the U.S. declined the offer.
</P>
<P>
The EU, Brittan said, has agreed to early consultations next
Monday with Ecuador, which, unlike the U.S., is a major producer
and exporter of banana to the EU.
</P>
<P>
On November 11, WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero said the
two powers must work out a solution. "Both partners have a
responsibility to settle the issue. They can and must work it
out," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The WTO head said the best solution would be for both sides to
accept the jurisdiction of a WTO compliance panel, which could
give a ruling within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU believes the argument has also focused on the
WTO itself, which appears to have a legal void on how to enforce
its own rulings.
</P>
<P>
Now, the U.S. sanctions, if imposed, would take effect on
February 1 next year, but if the EU requests the arbitration at
the WTO, the sanctions could be delayed until March 3, 1999. "If
Europe fails to comply with the ruling, we will enforce our laws,"
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said.
</P>
<P>
The EU holds that its new regime conforms with WTO rules, but
said that if a panel found otherwise, the EU would comply with its
judgement. "And in that case, until we had satisfied the WTO that
we had complied with the judgement, the United States would be
entitled to seek WTO-authorized retaliatory measures. There is no
risk of an endless loop of litigation," Brittan said.
</P>
<P>
Stances on both sides are tough. Ironically, just before the
banana trade war broke out again on November 10, Washington and
Brussels had apparently made their trade ties closer by
reconfirming business support for the so-called Transatlantic
Economic Partnership and for the WTO multilateral system of
dispute settlement.
</P>
<P>
Trade war and trade cooperation seem the two faces of one coin.
The EU-U.S. trade war will be expected to show its different ways,
even including talks, since the EU and the U.S. have made efforts
in preparation for a new round of the WTO's multilateral trade
negotiations in 2000, which is known here as Millennium Round.

LONDON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- All of Europe's stock markets
closed sharply higher Friday, adding billions to the value of top
companies for the second day in a row in a climate of increasing
optimism both in Europe and in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
London, Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam and Madrid gained 2.0-2.5
percent as investors sought to squeeze better year-end returns
from surplus cash.
</P>
<P>
After a slow start, the FTSE 100 Index of top shares ended the
day up 111.3 at 5,717.5 with banks amongst the top gainers.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Dax powered ahead Friday with the electronically
traded Xetra Dax closed up 105.74 points, or 2.20 percent at
4,911.43 points.
</P>
<P>
"We are going up, that is quite clear... with the dollar
supporting and hopes of more European interest rate cuts after the

<P>
Mounting confidence and a view that fallout from the Asia
crisis was limited helped the Paris bourse join in with the
international rally.
</P>
<P>
The Cac 40 index closed up 2.59 percent at 3,802.70 points. "I
think at some stage there could be quite a mighty correction but
there's still a lot of money floating about," said one market
maker.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends to Extend Iraq's Oil-for- Food Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Friday recommended to extend Iraq's "oil-for-food"
program for another period of six months.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan said the program
should be renewed so that Iraq would be permitted to sell oil
worth of 5.25 billion U.S. dollars to purchase food, medicine and
other humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
Annan also suggested that the new phase of the program would
also allow Iraq to spend a specific amount of the oil revenues to
upgrade its pipeline and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
The current phase of the program expires on Wednesday and the
Security Council is expected to review Annan's recommendation on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq has rejected Annan's recommendation. Iraq sent a
letter to the Security Council this afternoon, saying that it only
agreed to extend the program for two months.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program began to implement in December,
1996, which is an exception to stringent trade sanctions imposed
by the U.N. after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. It allowed
Iraq to sell oil worth of 2 billion U.S. dollars every six month.
Due to the continuing deterioration of the humanitarian crisis,
the Security Council adopted a resolution in February, allowing
Iraq to sell 5.25 billion dollars worth of oil every six months.
