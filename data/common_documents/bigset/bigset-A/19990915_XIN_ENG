<HEADLINE> U.S. Imported Oil Helps Trade Deficit to New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit jumped
to a new record of 80.7 billion dollars in the second quarter
because of a huge rise in imports including a big increase in the
nation's imported oil, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The department reported that the deficit in the U.S. current
account soared 17.5 percent in the April-June quarter, above the
first quarter imbalance of 68.7 billion dollars, which had also
been a record.
</P>
<P>
Through the first half of this year, the current account was
running at an annual rate of 299 billion dollars, far surpassing
the imbalance for all of 1998 of 220.6 billion dollars, the
biggest deficit in history.
</P>
<P>
The widening U.S. trade deficit reflects the impact of the
Asian financial crisis, which cut sharply into U.S. export sales
of farm products and manufactured goods and also increased
competition from cheaper-priced imports.
</P>
<P>
The big rise in the current account deficit in the second
quarter was led by a 14 percent increase in the deficit in goods,
which climbed to 84.6 billion dollars in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
U.S. goods exports increased 0.9 percent with manufactured
goods and farm exports both showing increases. However, this small
improvement was swamped by a 4.9 percent rise in imports, led by a
sharp increase in world petroleum prices.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. service sector still had a surplus, covering such
things as airlines fares and insurance sales, but it declined to
19.6 billion dollars in the second quarter, down from 20.2 billion
dollars in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The deficit in investment earnings edged up to 4.4 billion
dollars in the second quarter, from 4.3 billion dollars in the
first three months of the year, while a category that includes
U.S. foreign aid rose to a deficit of 11.3 billion dollars in the
second quarter, up from 10.3 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Environmental Meeting Begins In Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Environmental Journalists,
activists and experts from some 30 countries gathering in Comilla,
about 200 km southeast of Dhaka began a four-day conference
Tuesday focusing on a wide range of conservation concerns.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the conference, being held under the joint
auspices of the Asia-Pacific Forum of Environmental Journalists
(AFEJ), Commonwealth Environmental Journalists Association (CEJA)
and Forum of Environmental Journalists of Bangladesh (FEJB), is
"Water and Environment: Role of the media."
</P>
<P>
AZM Enayetullah Khan, a veteran Bangladeshi journalist and
Editor-in-Chief of the weekly Holiday, said media in Bangladesh
has been highlighting the environmental issues not only for
purpose of dissemination of information, but also as an active
agent in awareness.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the media also has a significant rule in
highlighting the civic concerns of the flood action plan
pertaining to the local population and their voiced needs.
</P>
<P>
Mahfuz Anam, who won the Green Pen Award 1999, said one of the
challenges of present-day newsmen is creating awareness about
environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
Anam, Editor of The Daily Star of Bangladesh, noted that the
media can play a great rule in protecting the country's
environment, adding that the newsmen will have to change their
mindset to perform their social responsibilities.

<HEADLINE> Feature: U.N. Bell Rings for World Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The autumn morning
sunlights are caressing the Peace Bell Pavilion in the complex of
the United Nations headquarters in New York. Standing in the
breeze on the front lawn, 10 boys and girls are playing violin for
peace and friendship.
</P>
<P>
The blue U.N. flag and national colors of 185 member states are
flying high against the white clouds and blue sky in the sunny
morning of the 1999 International Peace Day, which falls on
September 14. The audience, representing different cultures and
varying countries, applauded the performance.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan rang the Peace Bell at 10:00
a.m. EST, and the bell sang in a universal language -- peace for
the world, peace for mankind.
</P>
<P>
"Each year, as we ring the Peace Bell, we reflect on the
meaning of peace and reaffirm our commitment to work in
partnership with others in pursuit of this universal objective,"
Annan said at the brief ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"Today the ringing of the Peace Bell coincides with the
launching by UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization) of the International Year for the
Culture of Peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Why a culture of peace?" he said. "Because war, violence
poverty and prejudice are the daily experience of millions upon
millions of people throughout the world."
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, we have come to realize that it is not enough
to send peacekeeping forces to separate warring parties," he
said. "It is not enough to engage in peace-building efforts, after
armed conflicts have taken place. It is not enough to conduct
preventive diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
"All of this is essential work, but we must also act at a
deeper level. We need, in short, a culture of peace," he said.
"Let us all join in working for a culture of peace," and "let the
message of this Peace Bell be heard far and wide today and
throughout the year."
</P>
<P>
The Peace Bell rang one day after the 53rd General Assembly
session adopted a resolution on "the Declaration and Program of
Action on a Culture of Peace," which says, "A culture of peace is
a set of values, attitudes, traditions and modes of behavior and
ways of life."
</P>
<P>
The president of the Security Council, Arnold Peter van Walsum
of the Netherlands, also delivered a speech at the ceremony.
"Finding peaceful solutions to conflicts is not something that
comes naturally," he said. "In a large number of countries, for a
large number of people, peace is not the norm. War and destruction
are all these people have ever known."
</P>
<P>
"Peace for them is only a word," he said. "Their reality is
violence, injustice, violations of human rights. They have no idea
that peace feels, looks and sounds like."
</P>
<P>
For this year, peace becomes much more precious for the world
after the United States led NATO in the 78-day air strikes on
Yugoslavia, a sovereign member of the U.N. family.
</P>
<P>
Under the Charter, the U.N. Security Council has the primary
responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security in the
world at large. However, NATO, without the authorization of the
Security Council, waged the unilateral air strikes on the Balkan
country, undermining the principle of the Charter and the
authority of the 15-nation Council.
</P>
<P>
The violin players are of the Chinese, Japanese, Spanish and
Korean origins, with the youngest of them at the age of six. The
youngest player is only six. That is, she is 10 years junior of
the oldest in the musical group.
</P>
<P>
The ring of the Peace Bell also coincides with the opening of
the 54th General Assembly session, during which 39 heads of state
and 25 heads of government, among others, are expected to take the
floor at the general debate, slated for September 20, to voice
their various stance on what role the U.N. will play in the next
century.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Most Quebecers Opposed to Separation Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The latest poll shows that 68.2
percent of the surveyed 1,014 Quebecers are opposed to a third
separation oriented referendum, Canada's National Post daily reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing the results released Monday by the polling firm Sondagen,
the newspaper also said that 59 percent of the respondents surveyed
between August 27 and September 8 hold that Lucien Bouchard, the
Quebec premier, will fail to assemble what he termed as "winning
conditions" for the next referendum.
</P>
<P>
Bouchard was reported to prepare for the referendum by the end of
his government's mandate, which could go until November 2003, but with
a promise not to hold one without "winning conditions."
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien Monday said he was ready for
the referendum just hours before flying to Japan to join Bouchard and
other Canadian provincial premiers on a week-long trade mission.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that they will listen to the people of Quebec and not
have a referendum," the prime minister said, adding that "for me,
I will be ready," the newspaper quoted him as saying.

<HEADLINE> Simitis, Clerides Discuss Cyprus Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis discussed here Tuesday with visiting Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides the latest developments in efforts to settle the
protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The two men also examined defense cooperation between the two
countries in the framework of the joint defense pact.
</P>
<P>
Both sides reached a consensus that the Greek Cypriot side,
which is ready for talks with the aim of seeking a solution to the
Cyprus issue, wanted to restart its dialogue with the Turkish
Cypriots without preconditions in the framework of the U.N.
decisions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after their talks, Simitis said that Greece and the
international community placed great weight on the position to be
taken by the Turkish side, expecting it to show that it respected
the international community and its decisions.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this element would play a definitive role in
ensuring Turkey's accession towards the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
On his part, Clerides, who arrived here Monday, said that his
talks with Simitis resulted in unanimous conclusions as to how to
deal with the issue of beginning and duration of the talks on the
Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.

BANGKOK, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet Tuesday
approved a marketing strategy for the promotion of international
conferences in Thailand, according to a Government House press

</P>
<P>
The strategy, proposed by the Tourism Authority of Thailand

international conferences and exhibitions at home other than
abroad.
</P>
<P>
TAT hopes the agencies concerned can hold international
conferences in provincial areas.
</P>
<P>
It also encourages the private sector to hold conferences and

<HEADLINE> Israel, PNA Discuss "Safe Passage" Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli-Palestinan Joint
Committee on Safe Passage on Tuesday committed to strike a deal on
the opening of the "safe passage" linking the Gaza Strip and West
Bank by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting held in Tel Aviv Tuesday afternoon, the committee
discussed in detail about the opening of the safe passage linking
Gaza and Hebron, but members from the two sides are still at odds
over some relevant issues such as car registrations, Israel's
stoppage of suspects and security inspection by the Israeli
security forces, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
The Radio quoted Israeli officials as saying that the
committee could solve all those differences soon and the safe
passage could be opened by next month as stipulated by the Sharm
El Sheikh peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The peace deal, which was signed by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak last Sunday in Egypt,
stipulates the safe passage linking Gaza and Hebron should be
opened by October 1.
</P>
<P>
Hebron is a Palestinian-controlled city in the south of the
West Bank. About 130,000 Palestinians are living in the city.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace deal, Israel and Palestine launched their
final-status talks at Erez checkpoint Monday evening. The deal
asks the two sides to reach a statement of principles on
final-status talks in five months and a final-status accord by
September 13, 2000.
</P>
<P>
During the final-status talks, the two sides have to solve
such most thorny issues as the status of Jerusalem, borders, the
future of the Jewish settlements on the occupied land in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip and the fate of over 3 million Palestinian
refugees as stipulated by the Oslo Accord signed six years ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and the U.S. signed
here Tuesday a new extradition treaty and initialled a Mutual
Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT).
</P>
<P>
The two treaties were signed by Cyprus Justice and Public
Order Minister Nicos Koshis and U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Donald
Bandler, the Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
For years, Cyprus and the U.S. have been applying a treaty of
extradition which was concluded in 1931 between the U.K. and the
U.S. and then extended to Cyprus, which was then under British
colonial rule, said the Cyprus minister.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Cyprus and the U.S. enjoy a long history of
close cooperation in law enforcement, said Bandler.
</P>
<P>
"This cooperation embraces the area of mutual assistance in
areas such as money laundering and drug enforcement and extends
to daily interactions between local police and security personnel
in embassies," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two documents will provide a framework for further
"cooperation in law enforcement matters" between the two
countries, said the Ambassador.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Urges Africa to Consolidate Fragile Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting officials of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Tuesday
urged African leaders to make efforts to consolidate fragile peace
on the continent so as to pave the way for the solution of refugee
problems.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, UNHCR assistant high
commissioner Soren Jessen-Petersen said that peace settlement in
regional conflicts in Africa is of great importance to solve
refugee problems.
</P>
<P>
On the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone,
Jessen-Peterson said, "we believe the big challenge for the
international community is now to seize opportunity to let fragile
peace settlement linger on. "
</P>
<P>
"Without political solutions, without resources to support
these solutions, we'll be moving from one bad operation to
another," Jessen- Petersen said.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR official said he held talks with officials of the
Addis Ababa- based UN Economic Commission for Africa and the
Organization of African Unity, with all sides agree that African
countries should make use of peace settlement of conflicts to
solve refugee problems.
</P>
<P>
Albert-Alain Peters, UNHCR director for Africa bureau, also
appealed to African countries to create appropriate living
conditions for the returnees.
</P>
<P>
He said refugees can be active members of society. "They
should be allowed to work."
</P>
<P>
"If they are not working... they will certainly turn to other
activities, probably military activities which are not going to do
any good to the countries concerned, Peters said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Approves Measures to Help Laos Overcome Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet Tuesday
approved measures to help Laos alleviate the impact of the
economic crisis by promoting imports from that country and
increasing investment there.
</P>
<P>
A Government House press release said the Thai cabinet approved
a new trade policy toward its northern neighbor at its weekly
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, the Finance Ministry is urged to reduce
import duty on 23 agricultural goods from Laos.
</P>
<P>
Import duty on some 39 other items of agricultural products and
raw materials from Laos will also be reduced as part of the
efforts to increase Laos' exports to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also asked the Commerce Ministry to undertake the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) trade and
investment project under the economic framework with Cambodia,
Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos.
</P>
<P>
A Thai delegation will travel to the four countries to study
trade and investment opportunities, and the result of the study
will be used by Thai and foreign private sectors for helping make
decisions on investment in these countries.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Thai Industries and Thai Chamber of Commerce
were also requested to encourage their members to invest in Laos.
</P>
<P>
The Transport and Communications Ministry of Thailand was also
urged to enforce the agreement on Thai-Lao Road transportation.
</P>
<P>
Thai businessmen were even encouraged to trade in kip, the Lao
currency, especially in border trade.
</P>
<P>
Separated from Laos only by the Mekong river, Thailand is the
largest trading partner of the landlocked country, taking more
than 80 percent of the latter's total foreign trade volume.
</P>
<P>
Since Laos' trade was greatly dependent on Thailand, it was
seriously affected by the financial crisis, which hit Thailand in
mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
The kip has devalued by about 90 percent to about 240 kips to
the baht, or about 9,120 kips to the U.S. dollar.

<P>
LAGOS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Minister of State for
Defense Dupe Adelaja expressed her country's reluctance to
shoulder the bulk of the West African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG)
and said pacts will be signed on quota for each members'
contributions.
</P>
<P>
Adelaja made these remarks in capital Abuja on Monday in
meeting with Togolese Defense Minister Tijani Assani, the local
newspaper Vanguard reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
She said that Nigeria and Togo would soon sign a defense pact
and an arrangement was being worked out to ensure that not only
Nigeria would continue to shoulder the responsibility of ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is contributing 80 percent of the ECOMOG forces.
</P>
<P>
Adelaja explained that the pacts to be signed with Togo and
other West African countries were designed to ensure that "one
person's problem is the problem of the others and you cannot do
that except there is an agreement."
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian official noted that the pacts being proposed with
other countries in the sub-region would bring about a quota system

"If it is eventually signed, we can rely on one another if

as if Nigeria is the only one in charge.

<HEADLINE> S. African President Rejects Parliament Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki Tuesday rejected speculation that a decision to base
his office in Pretoria during parliamentary sessions signaled a
move for parliament from Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
"It would be quite incorrect to link the manner in which the
president has to operate as an implication of any sort for the
site of parliament," South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted
him as telling reporters in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
"The only point being made is that because the president is not
expected to be sitting in parliament, obviously we will spend the
bulk of our time here (in Pretoria)."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said any decision to move parliament would be taken by
the legislature itself.
</P>
<P>
Plans were being made to put the matter on parliament's agenda.
Also up for discussion was how the president should be required to
interact with parliament.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the decision to spend most of his time in Pretoria
did not mean a down-scaling of his Cape Town office.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki will still have to fly to Cape Town regularly for cabinet
meetings when parliament is in session because all cabinet
ministers are members of parliament.
</P>
<P>
On the ongoing public service wage dispute, he said the
government was eager for the matter to be resolved, but stressed
that public finances were stretched.
</P>
<P>
"Discussions will continue, but there are constraints," Mbeki
said. "We are not going to print money to meet all the demands
being made.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we should address any particular item of
expenditure as if it was the only item of expenditure."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki expressed satisfaction with the performance of his
government in the first 100 days since it came into power.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy. I think everybody is responding with the
sense of urgency that is required."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki was speaking after bestowing the Order of Good Hope on
outgoing Egyptian ambassador Moushira Khattab for her contribution
to promoting bilateral relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Khattab, who is to take up the post of deputy foreign minister
in her country, expressed Egypt's confidence that South Africa
would go from strength to strength under Mbeki's leadership.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki also received credentials from Canadian high commissioner
Lucy Edwards and ambassador Alladin Villacorte from the
Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Involvement Intensifies Fighting in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He said a breakaway faction from the SNF under the support of
Ethiopian troops invaded on Monday Garbaharrey town, the regional
capital of Gedo in southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman blasted the Ethiopians for massacring civilians
in the town during their invasion, adding the whole town has been
destroyed by the Ethiopian's heavy artillery bombs.
</P>
<P>
He also accused the Ethiopians for detaining five clan
chieftains including Nabaddon Hussein Dualeh and Nabaddon Abdi
Hersih.
</P>
<P>
The military movements by Ethiopia or its allied factions have
been increasing, especially in Southern Somalia since last year
when Hussein Aidid brought in hundreds of Oromo Ethnic Ethiopians
for training and launching attacks against the regime of Meles
Zenawi of Addis Ababa, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian troops have been controlling several towns and
villages in Gedo, Bay and Bakol regions since last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Garbaharrey town, Ethiopian forces were also seen in
the town of Dinsor of Bay region which has been the only way now
linking Mogadishu to Baidoa following its fall into the hands of
the Ethiopian backed RRA militiamen in June this year, he added.
</P>
<P>
The SNF breakaway forces attacked Garbaharrey town and chased
away their rival side loyal to General Omar Hajji Massaleh allied
with Aidid, according to spokesman for the SNF breakaway faction
Abdi Dahir Hassan, who contacted the journalists on the VHF radio
in Garbaharrey town.
</P>
<P>
He said the forces loyal to Ahmed Sheikh Buraleh have taken
control of the town after a fierce fighting which lasted for three
hours, adding that the town is now calm under their control.
</P>
<P>
At least 11 people were killed and more than 16 others from
both sides were wounded including civilians and women, local media
reported, adding that the heavy shelling and the exchange of the
gunfire for control of the town could well be heard in a distance
of more than 10 Kilometers away. Hundreds of people have fled the
town towards Bardera and the surrounding villages.

<HEADLINE> Athens Quake Death Toll Climbs to 127 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from last
Tuesday's earthquake in northwestern Athens rose to 127 Tuesday,
with the Ricomex factory in Menidi being the only site at which
rescue work is still under way.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake registering 5.9 on the Richter scale occurred
last Tuesday afternoon in the Mount Parnitha region, some 20
kilometers northwest of Athens.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 2,000 people have been injured and some
60,000 others left homeless in the earthquake, which is estimated
to cost Greece more than 200 billion drachams (about 666 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Greek government has expressed its satisfaction with the
relief efforts and a total of 20,000 tents with a capacity of
120,000 people have been set up.
</P>
<P>
The tremor's aftereffects would have no impact on Greece's
course towards the European economic and monetary union (EMU), and
the European Union (EU) support would be significant and help
handle the problem, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas
said Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Italy Suspends Aid Program to Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 14 (Xinhua) - Italy suspended the 22 million
U.S. dollar commodity aid to Zimbabwe on Tuesday citing lack of
transparency in the awarding of tenders for projects under the
bilateral program.
</P>
<P>
The Italian embassy to Zimbabwe said in a statement "following
a legal action started in Italy, a careful review of all the
procedures followed for awarding the tender for the projects was
undertaken and brought to light several serious mistakes with
regard to guarantees and transparency."
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the agreement, which was signed in 1996,
had already started in the public sector investment projects and
was mainly funding the electrification of 250 rural schools and
250 rural clinics using solar power. Some of the money was used
to develop the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The embassy said efforts had been made since April to rescue
the projects by mending the legal mistakes but this did not
succeed.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, every suggestion and warning has been ignored
and, therefore, in observance of its political and legal
responsibilities concerning the possible waste of public funds,
the government of Italy has been forced to suspend the aid," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
This is the same aid under which the Tokwe Murkosi dam, the
largest inland water body for Zimbabwe, was being built. The
project has now been halted due to financial shortages caused by
the legal action in Italy.

<HEADLINE> Special Rapporteur on Use of Mercenaries Visiting Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. special
rapporteur on the question of the use of mercenaries, Enrique
Bernales Ballkesteros, is visiting Cuba this week, U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said the visit was made at an invitation from the
government of that country.
</P>
<P>
During the mission, set to last from 12 to 18 September 1999,
the special rapporteur intends to collect first-hand information
to evaluate allegations of mercenaries' activities against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
In previous reports to the U.N. General Assembly and the
Commission on Human Rights, the special rapporteur drew attention
and reproduced communications received from the government of Cuba
in which reference was made to mercenary attacks on that country
"from the earliest days following the victory of the revolution.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the special rapporteur intends to explore
more deeply the causes and effects of the existence of mercenary
practices and their increasing linkage with acts of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Commission on Human Rights created the post
of special rapporteur on the question of the use of mercenaries in
1987. Bernales Ballkesteros, a political scientist, a lawyer and
former Peruvian senator, has served as special rapporteur since
his appointment then.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Seek Better Deal at IMF: Finance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa would
attend next week's annual meeting of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the World Bank in Washington to try and secure a
better deal for small developing countries, Finance Minister
Trevor Manuel said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Issues would include how to enhance the HIPC (highly indebted
poor countries) debt relief initiative, and gold sales, he told a
media briefing in Cape Town, according to South African Press
Association.
</P>
<P>
The annual meeting is scheduled for September 25 to 30.
</P>
<P>
Manuel said the gold issue was "somewhat more calm", as the IMF
sought to find an alternative to selling gold on the open market.
</P>
<P>
Of the 41 mostly African countries designated as HIPCs, 30
produce gold.
</P>
<P>
Gold has come under pressure from speculators ever since the
IMF announced it was planning to sell about 10 million ounces to
help relieve debt owed by the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
An IMF document mistakenly made public last week said the
fund's governing committee would discuss a proposal to revalue 10
million ounces of its gold reserves to the metal's market price,
from its current book value of about 47 U.S. dollars an ounce.
</P>
<P>
This would allow the IMF to release about 1.1 billion U.S.
dollars to fund debt relief for poor countries.
</P>
<P>
Manuel said South Africa would want to see some sort of
commitment from the G7 group of industrialised nations.
</P>
<P>
"We need to develop a mechanism that takes account of the needs
of all countries, particularly gold producing, and a mechanism
that will be focused on financial support."
</P>
<P>
The IMF efforts to find an alternative had to be encouraged, he
stressed
</P>
<P>
On HIPC, Manuel said: "We must continue to bat for a
consciousness about the needs of small, poor countries."
</P>
<P>
A significant improvement in the HIPC initiative was necessary,
he said, adding that "if we can get a few more African countries
on to the list of beneficiaries now, then we'll be doing well."
</P>
<P>
Manuel said the countries that had to benefit were Zambia,
Tanzania and, hopefully, even Malawi.
</P>
<P>
"The G7 countries who committed themselves in Cologne, in
faith, to put money in the HIPC is all very good, but I don't
think we need faith alone.
</P>
<P>
"We need a few dollars in that HIPC fund and I think there
needs to be some pressure," Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
In the IMF's 1998/99 annual report, it again pleaded for the G7
 countries to find funds to support the HIPC debt relief
initiative.

<HEADLINE> Barak Opposes Return of Palestinian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 14 (Xinhua) -- As the Israeli-Palestinian
final status talks are underway, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
Tuesday reiterated that Israel would never allow the return of
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Barak made the remarks in a cabinet meeting one day after
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and Abu Mazen, deputy to
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, formally
launched talks for a final peace settlement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Palestinian refugees, together with others lying
in the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict such as the
Palestinian statehood and the status of Jerusalem, is to be
tackled in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forced to flee
their homes when the Jewish state was proclaimed in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, more than 3 million refugees and their descendants
are scattered in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as well as
neighboring Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Israel opposes the return of the refugees for fear that it will
cause a major impact on the character of the Jewish state, which
has a population of 6 million.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said as recent as Sunday, however, that the Palestinian
refugees have the right to return to the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you honestly that there is no home for the
Palestinians except Palestine...The right of refugees to return
to their homeland is our conviction and one which we will never
compromise," he told an Arab League meeting in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Despite the tremendous difficulty surrounding all the issues
in the final status talks, Israel and the Palestinians have set an
ambitious goal to reach a framework on the talks by February next
year and achieve a permanent peace treaty by September, one year
after the start of the talks.
</P>
<P>
But it seems that Barak is also unsure whether the two sides
can resolve all their disputes rooted in decades of conflict
within a year. In the cabinet meeting, he described three
scenarios for the result of the talks: a comprehensive peace, a
long-term interim agreement, or a total collapse.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that Barak is seeking to postpone the
two thorniest issues - Jerusalem and refugees - till after the
one-year deadline for long-term discussion.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon told the Foreign Press Association
recently that these two issues could not be resolved in less than
five or ten years.
</P>
<P>
If the reported idea of Barak turned to a reality, then the
targeted peace accord next September would be an incomplete
permanent agreement. It would still have the nature of an interim
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Barak said in a radio interview earlier this week that if the
two sides did not agree on an outline by February, they might have
to forgo a final peace accord and instead - by mutual consent -
negotiate long-term interim agreements on most issues.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have balked at Barak's suggestion, urging
him to seize the opportunity in order to reach a permanent peace
within a year.
</P>
<P>
In the cabinet meeting, Levy said Abu Mazen is positive on the
prospect of the peace talks and has showed a desire for a
permanent peace, Israel Radio reported.

<P>
"Why a Culture of Peace?" he said. "Because war, violence,
poverty and prejudice are the daily experience of millions upon
millions of people throughout our world."
</P>
<P>
The president of the Security Council, Arnold Peter van Walsum
of the Netherlands, told an audience representing various
countries at the ceremony, "In a large number of countries, for a
large number of people, peace is not the norm. War and destruction
are all these people have ever known."
</P>
<P>
"Peace for them is only a word," he said. "Their reality is
violence, injustice, violations of human rights. They have no idea
what peace feels, looks and sounds like."
</P>
<P>
For this year, peace has become even more precious after the
U.S.-led NATO sidelined the Security Council by waging 78-day air
strikes on Yugoslavia, a sovereign member of the U.N. family.
</P>
<P>
On November 20, 1997, the General Assembly adopted a
resolution, proclaiming the year 2000 as the International Year
for the Culture of Peace. The U.N. system as a whole has since
been preparing for its celebration, led by UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 has become an essential and necessary landmark
for all humanity, ushering in not only a new century, but also a
new millennium. Therefore, the international community, taking
stock of the achievements and failures of the past, must seize the
unique opportunity offered by the year 2000 to the work of
building the future for the whole mankind.
</P>
<P>
However, if the world, with the support from the United Nations
which has the primary responsibility for maintenance of the global
peace, wishes to build the future, the international community
must take immediate and concreted action, making peace and
non-violence part of daily life for all human beings.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO's constitution says, "Since wars begin in the minds of
men, it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be
constructed."
</P>
<P>
UNESCO's Culture of Peace project aims to promote values,
attitudes and behaviors in people so that they will seek peaceful
solution to problems.
</P>
<P>
In fact, a culture of peace is a set of values, attitudes,
traditional and models of behavior and ways of life, based on such
policies as the action under the U.N. Charter, the full respect
for the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity and
political independence of States and non-intervention in matters
which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any
State, efforts to meet the developmental and environmental needs
of present and future generations.
</P>
<P>
Progress in the fuller development of a culture of peace comes
about through values, attitudes, modes of behavior and ways of
life conducive to the promotion of peace among individuals, groups
and nations.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, it is very important to promote peaceful
settlement of conflicts, mutual respect and understanding and
international cooperation, and it is very important to comply with
international obligations under the U.N. Charter and international
law, and to enable people at all levels to develop skills of
dialogue, negotiation, consensus-building and peaceful resolution
of differences.
</P>
<P>
The Culture of Peace involves individuals, community leaders,
media, governments, and non-governmental organizations. In short,
people from different walks of life and people from different
countries can contribute to the promotion of peace and security in
the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Peace and development are the main theme of the current era, as
the two are the shared hopes and aspirations of mankind. In
reality, people may speak different languages for peace, but the
world must bear one thing in mind: the function of the United
Nations is irreplaceable, and the purpose of the United Nations
and the principles of international law are still the guidelines
for any action in the world to seek peace.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Food Aid to Reach Angola's Province in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Some 3,000 tons of food aid
are expected to reach Angola's northern province of Malanje in
September, the United Nations Humanitarian Assistance Coordination
Unit said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In Malanje, one of the provinces which has been experiencing
the most fierce civil war, the displaced people are suffering
hunger.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. humanitarian unit said in a document that the number
of canteens for the displaced and the communitarian infantile
program in Malanje has increased from 74 to 93, benefiting about
6,600 people.
</P>
<P>
The assistance activities continue to be realized under
increasing risk and pressure in limited areas of the southern
African country which has suffered over 25 years of civil
conflicts, it added.
</P>
<P>
However, the humanitarian situation in Angola continues to
worry the local authorities, with the lack of access to the
population in need, the scarcity of fuel and security as the
principal constraints.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency also revealed that the enormous afflux of
displaced people maintains in most parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Rebel Tries to Press Talks Upon Angolan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Angolan rebel leader Jonas
Savimbi is trying to force the government to accept his political
exigences for negotiation through a series of terrorist activities
around the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The "banditry and extremist actions" conducted by the rebels
are aimed at pressing talks upon the government, said National
Assembly of Angola (ANA) Tuesday in a document.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi has threatened to create "spectacular" events in
Luanda, with the principal transport network, power and water
systems as their main targets, if the government refuses to
restart negotiation with him, according to the latest weekly
newspaper Angolense.
</P>
<P>
Rebels led by Savimbi have been put in a passive position in
recent months because the government has improved its capacity of
defense and began withdrawing some of the Angolan troops from the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), local analysts observed.
</P>
<P>
Due to the difficult situation, the rebel leader recently made
four interviews in less than three weeks with the British
Broadcasting Company (BBC), suggesting a restart of negotiation
with the government, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But Angolan government, which has lost faith in words of
Savimbi, refused to re-open negotiation with him. Angolan
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has obtained in mid-August
support from the member countries of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) for depriving Savimbi of the status
as a negotiator.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the ruling People's Liberation Movement of
Angola Joao Lourenco said last week that Savimbi had fallen into
"affliction" and had to beg pardon, but he promised that the
government would not listen to his "supplications".
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the government troops recovered an important
fortress, Cuvango, in the south-central Huila Province; meanwhile,
assaults by the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) on villages in the Bengo Province, neighboring the
capital city of Luanda, were frustrated.
</P>
<P>
The document said that the Angolan government has made great
efforts to end the conflict through pacific and democratic way,
citing the example of the elections in 1992, which showed the
government's "good faith" to seek a just and equilibrated
solution.
</P>
<P>
UNITA lost the 1992 elections to the incumbent Angolan
government, but Savimbi refused to accept the results of the
elections.
</P>
<P>
"Notwithstanding the arduous and unquestionable efforts made by
the Angolan government, the incessant diplomatic efforts and
mediations by the international community, Savimbi continues to
resort to armed forces through subversive actions," said the
parliament in the document.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, UNITA rebels scattered into small groups and
hid in rural areas. They have been trying to avoid face-to-face
confrontation with the government troops, which has been
reinforced by the return of the troops from DRC and the civilian
defence organized by regional governments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rebels launched a series of warlike actions against
civilians, including ambushments on civil vehicles on highways,
mining the principal roads with access to fields and assaulting
villages and small towns all around the country.
</P>
<P>
It is also reported that the ambushments on vehicles in the
province of Malanje has killed more than 30 and injured over 100
in the recent two months.
</P>
<P>
Although the Angolan President refused to negotiate with
Savimbi, he told the Angolan people that he will seek a solution
"as soon as possible" for ending the suffering of the people.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Cyprus (BoC)
Group Tuesday announced it gained after-tax profits of 22.5
million Cyprus pounds (45 million U.S. dollars) for the first half
of 1999, up by 50.3 percent compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Group Chairman Solon Triantafyllides told a press conference
that the Board of the Group, which is the island's largest
financial institution, has approved an interim dividend of 8.0
percent.
</P>
<P>
Triantafyllides attributed the increase to BoC's "very good
performance" in Cyprus and the good results of the Group's
associated companies operating in insurance and investment
sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said the Group has been working for BoC's listing on the
Athens Stock Exchange early next year.
</P>
<P>
He said the Group and the Greek authorities have reached an
agreement on the percentage of capital that has to be issued in
Greece prior to the BoC share trading on the Athens Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The deal will be presented to the Extraordinary General Meeting
of the Group for approval on October 13, he noted.
</P>
<P>
With 16 branches in operation in Greece, BoC will open a
"substantial number of branches" in Greece in the next two to
three years.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Reluctant to Shoulder Bulk of ECOMOG Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Minister of State for
Defense Dupe Adelaja expressed her country's reluctance to
shoulder the bulk of the West African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG)
and said pacts will be signed on quota for each members'
contributions.
</P>
<P>
Adelaja made these remarks in capital Abuja on Monday in
meeting with Togolese Defense Minister Tijani Assani, the local
newspaper Vanguard reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
She said that Nigeria and Togo would soon sign a defense pact
and an arrangement was being worked out to ensure that not only
Nigeria would continue to shoulder the responsibility of ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is contributing 80 percent of the ECOMOG forces.
</P>
<P>
Adelaja explained that the pacts to be signed with Togo and
other West African countries were designed to ensure that "one
person's problem is the problem of the others and you cannot do
that except there is an agreement."
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian official noted that the pacts being proposed with
other countries in the sub-region would bring about a quota system
on the number of ECOMOG troops.
</P>
<P>
"If it is eventually signed, we can rely on one another if
there is crisis within the sub-region," she said.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, she added, there are ECOMOG troops, but it seems
as if Nigeria is the only one in charge.
</P>
<P>
Adelaja noted that "when we have this type of agreement, then
you can have proper contribution from other countries."

<HEADLINE> EU Offers Aid For Turkish Education Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Tuesday that it is allocating 100 million euros (105 million U.S.
dollars) for a project to assist Turkey under a European Union
(EU) program.
</P>
<P>
This is the biggest contribution by the European bloc so far in
its financial cooperation with Turkey, the EU's executive branch
said. The aim is to facilitate the extension of primary education
from five to eight years by means of sectoral aid to be provided
over a six-year period, it added.
</P>
<P>
The project will assist the Turkish Ministry of National
Education in the qualitative reform of initial and vocational
training, "ensuring a positive spin-off for the country as a
whole," the commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The reform is to be implemented in 12 of the most
disadvantaged provinces to achieve a quantitative and qualitative
improvement in education for girls and women in particular," it
said.
</P>
<P>
"Local multidisciplinary education centers will be opened for
sections of the population excluded from basic education --
children, young people and adults -- in cities with a high level
of immigration, mainly Istanbul," the European Commission said.
</P>
<P>
The EU's 15 foreign ministers met their Turkish counterpart,
Ismail Cem, Monday in Brussels to talk about comprehensive aid for
Turkey's economic reform and reconstruction after the earthquake
disaster, as well as prospects for Turkey's EU membership in the
future, warming up the tepid EU-Turkish ties to a high point
following an earthquake prompted thaw of the relations between
Turkey and Greece.

HARARE, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Entrepreneurs from south
African countries will meet in Harare on September 20-21,
discussing new challenges and opportunities faced by small and
medium-sized enterprises associated with globalization and
increased market competition.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Small Enterprise Promotion Advisory Council Chairman

to fully integrate into a regional trading block, said Chidzomba,
who is the organizer of the conference,.
</P>
<P>
The major handicap for the small and medium-sized enterprises
has been lack of markets, Chidzomba noted.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Play Part in East Timor Peacekeeping: Alatas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N.-sanctioned
multinational force will cooperate with Indonesia in keeping peace
in East Timor, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas Tuesday said, ruling
out the imminent withdrawal of the Indonesian army.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian troops "are not withdrawing yet, but there will
be cooperation between the multinational and the Indonesian
forces," the minister said, emerging from his talks with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Australia is the most prepared contributor of troops to
restoring peace and security in East Timor. Alatas said he and
Downer talked about when their troops would go to East Timor, what
other countries would be among the first batch of the force and
the implications between a multinational force and a U.N.
peace-keeping one in terms of funding.
</P>
<P>
"But of course the command and the leadership on the ground
will be with the multinational force, with the Indonesian forces
probably playing an advisory or liaison role," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a timetable and we are going to withdraw in a matter
of weeks, let us keep the timetable, let us honor the
international agreement," he said, referring to the May 5
agreement between Indonesia, Portugal and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The pact provides for Indonesia to be responsible for law and
order in East Timor during the ballot on its future and its
transition to independence.
</P>
<P>
The August 30 referendum did see the majority of voters showing
preference to independence. In this case the U.N. peace-keeping
mission is mandated to enter into the territory only after the
transition period ends.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing a situation which was not of our making, which
was a very difficult and complicated one and we are trying to
overcome with the help of the United Nations... you can continue
to accuse us of many things, but if you don't accept the
situation, you cann't find the answer to the situation," Alatas
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia would like to see the international troops to
land on East Timor as soon as possible, but how soon would depend
on contributing countries and U.N. regulations.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council was working on a draft resolution forming
the basis for the multinational action.
</P>
<P>
Violence has taken place since the result of the U.N. brokered
ballot was announced on September 4, which ended Indonesia's rule
since 1976 after the withdrawal of former colonial ruler Portugal.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 14 (Xinhua)-- Over 20,000 residents in
 Tanzania's northwestern Kagera Region are facing acute food
shortage following a prolonged drought that lasted for four years
in a row.
</P>
<P>
Anatoli Amani, Chairman of the ruling Revolutionary Party of
Tanzania (CCM) branch in the region, told journalists in the
regional capital Tuesday that the situation is very pathetic as
some of the residents survive on a single meal per day.
</P>
<P>
Amani said he paid an eight-day visit to some parts of the
region recently, finding a large tract of banana plantation had
dried up.
</P>
<P>
The drought has also badly affected coffee farms, he added.
</P>
<P>
Karagwe district is one of the big producers of grain and
coffee in Tanzania but the drought has forced people to suffer
from hunger, he said.
</P>
<P>
The regional party leader appealed to individuals, parastatal
organizations and private companies to urgently transport food to
aid the drought affected areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 600,000 people in north Tanzania's
Shinyanga Region are reportedly facing an acute food shortage
caused by a prolonged drought.
</P>
<P>
The Shinyanga Regional Commissioner, Tumainiel Kiwelu, said
that 2.53 million inhabitants there require 553,000 tons of grain
to live comfortably for one year. However, the available food
only amounts to 395,000 tons at present.

Iraq poses a threat to its neighboring countries and Iraqi
government should be responsible for the sufferings of its people.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency, Hamdoun said

<HEADLINE> Argentine Official Criticizes IMF Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENAS AIRES, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's vice
secretary of finance, Miguel Kiguel, considered as "pessimistic"
the forecast by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of an
economic growth of 1 percent for the country in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
For some reason, the forecast by the IMF was discordant with
the favorable objective factors, such as a more favorable
international climate, said Kiguel in an interview published
Tuesday by the newspaper "El Cronista."
</P>
<P>
"The IMF is taking a very conservative stance" and "has little
respect" for the capacity of the gross domestic product (GDP) of
Argentina, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The GDP of the country would grow by 3.5 percent over the next
year, due to the provision of a higher dynamism in Brazil,
Paraguay and Uruguay, Argentina's partners in the Mercosur, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Kiguel also denied that the elections on October 24, in which
Carlos Menem will be replaced as president, would have adverse
repercussions on the economy.
</P>
<P>
The GDP of Argentina contracted by 4.9 percent in the second
quarter of this year, compared with the same period in 1998, due
to the recession which was worsened by the contraction of the
Brazilian economy, confirmed Kiguel.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Argentine government said it estimated its
budget deficit next year at 4.5 billion U.S. dollars, a target
below this year's likely shortfall.

LONDON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. mediator George Mitchell
intensified his efforts to push forward the Northern Ireland peace
process by meeting rival political party delegations Tuesday in
the province.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who returned to the Northern Ireland province of
Belfast Monday, was in the second week of a major review of the
Good Friday accord signed in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
The review has stalled because of disputes between pro-British
unionists and Sinn Fein republicans over guerrilla disarmament and
plans for a coalition provincial government.
</P>
<P>
Mo Mowlam, Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary, said all the
parties involved in Mitchell's latest initiative wanted to make
progress. She insisted that the embattled Good Friday peace accord
offered the only way forward.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Sets Precondition for Withdrawal from Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We would pull out of Congo if all the parties who signed the
agreement honor it," the president told reporters at the State
House.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that "the prospects of the DRC peace process
are good."
</P>
<P>
However, the president noted that if Uganda could not beat the
deadline, it was the Goma faction to blame as the faction has
delayed in signing the peace accord reached in Zambian capital
Lusaka on July 10 by the six countries directly involved in the
DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
When asked what Uganda, as a country, benefited from its
military presence in the vast central African country, Museveni
said that the presence of the Uganda People's Defense Forces
there has contributed greatly to the improved security within the
east African country by weakening, in particular, the activities
of the Allied Democratic Forces(ADF), a rebel group in western
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorist activities with the backing of the rebel group have
been going down in the capital city and terrorists have been
arrested," he added.
</P>
<P>
Uganda will also benefit the relative stability in the region,
he further explained. Apart from security concerns, Uganda is
concerned about economy, development and solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Uganda began to deploy its forces in the eastern part of the
DRC soon after a rebellion erupted in the latter in early August
last year.
</P>
<P>
Kampala said that its military presence in the third largest
African country is to protect the safety of its western border by
pushing and killing the ADF rebels.
</P>
<P>
Under the Lusaka agreement signed by all the parties concerned,
all foreign forces should pull out of the troubled DRC within 180
days after the official endorsement of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Both the Goma and Kisangani factions of the main rebel group,
the Congolese Rally for Democracy, did not ink the pact because of
their internal wrangling until the end of last month.

(GA) Tuesday afternoon opened its 54th session at the United
Nations headquarters in New York, the first GA which is about to
straddle two millennia.
</P>
<P>
Didier Opertti, who was president of the just-concluded 53rd
session and head of the delegation of Uruguay, declared the
opening of the 54th GA session.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Jin Yongjian,
under-secretary-general, were present at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Theo-Ben Gurirab, Namibian foreign minister, was elected
president of the 54th GA session.
</P>
<P>
In his acceptance speech, the new president said, "There are
present and future challenges that face us as we enter the coming
age." They are globalization, sustainable development and the
protection of environment, regional war, the ever-deteriorating
refugee crisis, gender equality, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and the
future of children in a globalized community.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first ever General Assembly to straddle two
millennia," he said. "The aspiration, hopes and expectations of
the world's peoples are high as they anticipate the future."
</P>
<P>
"They yearn for a world that is peaceful, humane and prosperous
for all," he said. "Without the U.N., such an inclusive world led
by inspiring leaders cannot come about."
</P>
<P>
The new president also called on all member states to "pay
their contributions on time and without preconditions."
</P>
<P>
"Without adequate resources, the U.N. cannot perform
effectively," he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the largest debtor is the United States, who owed
the United Nations 1.6 billion U.S. dollars in arrears. Under the
U.N. Charter it will automatically lose its vote at the General
Assembly next year if it fails to pay at least 350 million U.S.
dollars by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly is the main deliberative organ. It is
composed of representatives of all member states, each of which
has one vote.
</P>
<P>
The GA regular session usually begins each year in September.
At the start of each regular session, the Assembly elects a new
president, 21 vice-presidents and the chairpersons of its six main
committees.

<HEADLINE> Turco-Greek Rapprochement Out of Control: Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem said here on Tuesday that the rapprochement process
between Turkey and Greece following the quakes in the two Aegean
countries has gone out of his control.
</P>
<P>
Cem made the remarks at a press conference after returning from
a meeting of the European Union (EU) foreign ministers in
Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
"I did not want the rapprochement to proceed in front of
political clients. I wanted it to be silent and calm." Cem said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern that any adverse development in bilateral
relations could now lead to serious disappointment in relations
between the two states.
</P>
<P>
Cem said he and his Greek counterpart Yorgo Papandreou agreed
in June to mend fences and start low-level dialog on cooperation
in six years.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece have immediately improved bilateral ties
after the two neighboring countries were hit by strong quakes
separately.
</P>
<P>
After a 7.4-magnitude earthquake hit western Turkey on August
17, Greece sent a strong rescue team to help Turkey extricate
survivors trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings in western
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Later, Turkey was the first country to send its 20-member
rescue team to help Greece rescue the Greeks trapped in the debris
after a 5.9-magnitude quake hit Athens on September 8.
</P>
<P>
"Now (following the earthquakes) mayors, football teams are
exchanging visits, newspapers in the two countries are running
headlines in Turkish and Greek...I lost ability to control it,"
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"Of course this spirit of solidarity is positive. There is an
outbreak of friendship and expectations. I hope it will continue
in the same way. Otherwise it can become very unfortunate."
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), have long been at odds over the limits of
air space, sovereignty over some Aegean islands and the Cyprus
issue.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Commander in Congo Not Replaced: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"He (Kazini) is not replaced. Instead, he is reinforced," the
president told a press conference here in the evening.
</P>
<P>
According to some press reports, the probe report concerning
the Ugandan- Rwandan clashes in northern DRC town of Kisangani
recommended that military chiefs of both Uganda and Rwanda in the
DRC should be replaced.
</P>
<P>
Their relations are not cordial and there have been bases of
misunderstanding between them, the newspaper reports alleged.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's military command is studying the probe report and
Museveni said that Uganda would make its decision later.
</P>
<P>
During the August 14-17 clashes, 38 Ugandan troops died and
more Rwandan soldiers were allegedly killed in the shoot-out
between the two traditional allies.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have been accusing each other of sparking the
exchange of fire in the third largest city of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that Kazini would be replaced as
President Museveni is asking army reshuffles in the wake of the
probe report.

<HEADLINE> Present Climate for Turkey's Candidacy for EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem said here Tuesday that the present climate for
Turkey's candidacy for the European Union (EU) membership is
"very positive."
</P>
<P>
Cem made the remarks at a press conference after his return
from a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"A positive development is possible. but I do not want to talk
about big outcomes," Cem said in an apparent reference to the
widely-expected declaration of Turkey's candidacy at the EU summit
scheduled to be held in December in Helsinki, Finland.
</P>
<P>
He said "there is a better climate of understanding" in the
Brussels meeting, during which he was invited to make a speech on
Turkey's eagerness to join the European club.
</P>
<P>
On the reported opposition of Sweden and Denmark to Turkey's
candidacy, Cem said the two countries had not conveyed any such
position officially to Ankara, adding that he would visit Sweden
and Denmark in late November.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Sweden opposes the Turkish candidacy,
citing its human rights record.
</P>
<P>
However, the Turkish foreign minister said "what we will
definitely oppose is any condition for our candidacy."
</P>
<P>
During the summit in Luxembourg in December 1997, the EU
decided to invite Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Slovenia and Cyprus to start accession talks in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
Five other nations -- Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and
Slovakia -- were put on a slower negotiating track by the
15-nation union. And Turkey, a 34-year applicant, was left
completely in the cold.
</P>
<P>
The result of the summit was disappointing for Turkey, but "it
was not an obsession for Turkey and we will not treat it as an
event that will have an impact on the course of Turkey," said Cem
at that time.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Colombian Interior
Minister Nestor Martinez on Tuesday said the proposal of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) was not viable for
the exchange of the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The FARC, the largest guerrilla group in Colombia, are
demanding that their proposal is subjected to a referendum, so as
to receive constitutional recognition.
</P>
<P>
Martinez told the press that the proposal for the exchange of
prisoners is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
the FARC are offering to release around 450 soldiers and
police, in exchange for 480 imprisoned guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Colombian Attorney General Jaime Bernal wants the FARC to make
the proposal for the exchange of prisoners through dialogue with
the government.
</P>
<P>
The government and the FARC began peace talks on January 7, but
they have been suspended since mid-July, due to the refusal of the
FARC to accept an international commission of verification for the
distention zone.

"But I am not interested in idea of United States of Africa,"

<HEADLINE> IFC Increases Investments in Emerging Markets in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) increased commitment of its own resources for
lending and investing in emerging markets to 2.8 billion U.S.
dollars in the 1999 fiscal year ending June 30 from the 2.7
billion dollars a year earlier, the IFC announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In its 1999 annual report released Tuesday, the IFC said that
disbursements in FY99 were 2.1 billion dollars, similar to the
FY98 level.
</P>
<P>
The IFC said that it also mobilized 800 million dollars in
syndicated loans to projects in developing countries in FY99,
lower than the 2.4 billion dollars in FY98. IFC also disbursed 1.2
billion dollars on behalf of financial institutions participating
in its syndicated loans.
</P>
<P>
"The year-over-year decline in syndicated loans reflects the
difficult world financing environment which led many commercial
banks to cut back their exposure to developing countries," said
the IFC, part of the World Bank Group.
</P>
<P>
"IFC plays a key countercyclical role in times of uncertainty"
in emerging markets, said Peter Woicke, IFC Executive Vice
President and a managing director of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"In FY99, IFC's Asian strategy was directed at rehabilitating
and consolidating the financial and corporate sectors of those
economies hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis," the
annual report said.
</P>
<P>
While aiding the crisis economies was a priority, IFC continued
to assist the transition economies, particularly China and
Vietnam, in developing their market systems, said IFC.
</P>
<P>
IFC earned 249 million dollars in fiscal year 1999, above the
246 million dollars earned in fiscal year 1998 but below the
record net income of 432 million dollars achieved in FY97.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Reluctant to Shoulder Bulk of ECOMOG Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Minister of State for
Defense Dupe Adelaja expressed her country's reluctance to
shoulder the bulk of the West African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG)
and said pacts will be signed on quota for each members'
contributions.
</P>
<P>
Adelaja made these remarks in capital Abuja on Monday in
meeting with Togolese Defense Minister Tijani Assani, the local
newspaper Vanguard reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
She said that Nigeria and Togo would soon sign a defense pact
and an arrangement was being worked out to ensure that not only
Nigeria would continue to shoulder the responsibility of ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is contributing 80 percent of the ECOMOG forces.
</P>
<P>
Adelaja explained that the pacts to be signed with Togo and
other West African countries were designed to ensure that "one
person's problem is the problem of the others and you cannot do
that except there is an agreement."
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian official noted that the pacts being proposed with
other countries in the sub-region would bring about a quota system
on the number of ECOMOG troops.
</P>
<P>
"If it is eventually signed, we can rely on one another if
there is crisis within the sub-region," she said.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, she added, there are ECOMOG troops, but it seems
as if Nigeria is the only one in charge.
</P>
<P>
Adelaja noted that "when we have this type of agreement, then
you can have proper contribution from other countries."

<HEADLINE> Putin Against State of Emergency in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
said Tuesday that "no emergency situation should be invoked" in
Russia despite the recent spate of terrorist bombings and the war
in Daghestan.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the current instrument of law is adequate, but
it should be properly used," Putin told journalists at the end of
a session of the State Duma, or lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda in the session of the Duma was the recent
blasts that hit Moscow, the latest of which occurred Monday
morning, killing 118 residents in an eight-story apartment
building. Thirteen of the victims were children and 13 fragments
of human are yet to be identified.
</P>
<P>
"A struggle for the integrity of the Russian state is under
way," Putin said, adding that in such a struggle Russia has
"little choice, but need a positive result," the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The blast Monday was the third to hit the capital since August
31, when a bomb went off in an underground shopping mall near the
Kremlin, killing one person and wounding dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
The second explosion happened just seconds to midnight
Wednesday, ripping apart a nine-story apartment building.
Ninety-four people were killed in that blast.
</P>
<P>
In Daghestan, a car bomb exploded in front of a five-story
military housing complex on September 4, killing 64 people.
</P>
<P>
Although authorities have not established the final causes of
the blasts, many believe they were staged by those with ties with
Islamic militants fighting federal troops in Daghestan, a southern
republic bordering the breakaway Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Putin said the terrorist acts in Moscow and Daghestan "a
reaction of impotence and malice by the forces that received a
real befitting, adequate answer."
</P>
<P>
"It's time to stop talking about a state of emergency and
return the past positive practice of house committees," Putin
said.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently reacting to mounting rumors that the Kremlin
is contemplating emergency rule in the country so as to cancel the
upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Almost all those likely to win those elections, including
powerful Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and former Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, are considered not friendly with the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Security has been beefed up in the wake of the deadly blasts
and a large-scale anti-terrorist campaign involving interior
units will start in the country on Wednesday, Deputy Interior
Minister Igor Zubov said Tuesday in an interview on the ORT
television channel.
</P>
<P>
Total check of basements, attics and other premises in Moscow
houses and reinforced patrolling of the city streets will
continue, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent terrorist attacks were masterminded in
Chechnya. The leadership in Chechnya has denied any connections
with the bombings.
</P>
<P>
During the Monday afternoon Duma session, Putin said Chechnya
had actually evolved into a "huge terrorist camp."
</P>
<P>
"If the Chechen authorities cannot control the situation and
are not asking the federal authorities for assistance, this means
that the situation suits them," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But this cannot suit us," Putin said. Therefore, a
comprehensive plan for settling the political situation in
Chechnya must be worked out, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said such a plan must envision, among other things, the
introduction of a "rigorous quarantine" regime all along the
administrative border with Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government's Y2K Work 97 Percent Done, White </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government has
completed 97 percent of Year 2000 fixes on its most important
computer systems at a cost of 8.34 billion U.S. dollars, the White
House budget office reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In its latest quarterly report on federal preparations, the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) said the Pentagon, despite a
mammoth effort, may suffer some problems caused by the Y2K coding
glitch that could boggle computers.
</P>
<P>
Nine of the 24 Cabinet departments and key agencies supplying
federal services have not yet wrapped up Y2K work, OMB said. They
were the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy,
Health and Human Services, Justice, Treasury and Transportation,
as well as the Agency for International Development.
</P>
<P>
These nine had a combined total of 217 "mission critical"
systems that were not Y2K compliant as of August 13, down form the
410 reported non-compliant in June, said OMB, which oversees
management of federal government.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department runs by far the largest number of
federal systems requiring work to be ready for the date change,
169, as of June 30. Of these, 141 were being fixed, including 53
classified as secret; 18 were to be replaced; and 10 were to be
retired by year end, OMB said.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department, which estimates it will spend 3.6
billion dollars fixing Y2K problems, has been carrying out "the
largest, most complex testing in history" to pinpoint Y2K
problems, the budget office said.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Y2K glitch could prevent some computers from
distinguishing 2000 from 1900 because of old shortcuts that
recorded the year with tow digits only. Unless fixed, this could
disrupt everything from radar to telecommunications to tank
display panels.

<HEADLINE> International Arms Fair Starts in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- One of the world's most famous
arms fair, Defense System and Equipment International(DSEI),
opened on Tuesday here in London.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 arms manufacturers from Britain, the United
States, Western Europe and Russia laid out their wares at the
fair, which was opened by British Defense Secretary George
Robertson.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech to the conference and exhibition held in
Surry, south London, Robertson denied helping to arm the
aggressors of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Under heavy pressure from both domestic and international
sides, British government had been forced to rethink its position
on arms sale to Indonesia, while Jakarta had to turn down an offer
to visit this international arms fair held currently in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Britain is one of the world's leading arms
exporters with 9,000 firms involved in defense equipment
manufacturing that provides 355,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Amnesty International has complained that Britain's willingness
to do business with countries that had a poor human rights record
was undermining Britain's ethical foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, several groups of people held demonstrations
outside the compound where the DSEI exhibition and conference
were held, in which thousands of businessmen were negotiating
their arms sales.
</P>
<P>
They held placards and shouted slogans to protest against arms
proliferation, especially against British arms sales to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition was scheduled to end on Friday. A series of
conferences on "the challenge of warfare", technology, "theater
ballistic missile defense" and other issues are also planned to be
held during the period.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Rely on Itself in Fighting AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) has urged the African countries to ensure that
adequate resources are allocated to the prevention of AIDS in
their budgets.
</P>
<P>
The African governments should not rely on support from donor
countries as far as the fight against AIDS in concerned, OAU
representative Mahamat Habib Doutoum said in Lusaka Tuesday at the
on-going 11th International Conference on AIDS and STDS (sexually
transmitted diseases) in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Doutoum said that donor countries would only be compelled to
assist if the African governments themselves start committing
enough resources to AIDS prevention in their budgets.
</P>
<P>
It is time that African governments start taking AIDS as a real
 challenge and develop strategies aimed at combating the disease,
the OAU official noted.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need for governments to improve working
conditions for their health workers as the fight against AIDS goes
on.
</P>
<P>
Focus should be on women as AIDS awareness campaigns are
carried out because they are more vulnerable to the disease, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Panama Issues 150 Million Dollars Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Panamanian government
authorized the issuing of 150 million dollars Treasury Bonds as a
measure to fill the empty state coffers, said the Official Gazette
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Bonds, which were originally approved by the
previous government of Ernesto Perez Balllardes, will be brought up
by the Social Security Agency (CSS) by way of the National Bank of
Panama (BNP) for a 12 year-term.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate to be paid by the BNP is 8.5 percent, more
than double the normal payment of below 5 percent, and also higher
than that paid by the private banking sector in both Panama and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to financial analysts, the Treasury Bonds will be
snapped up, as much for their high interest rates, as for their
exemption from tax.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 14 (Xinhua) - British Prime Minister Tony
Blair appealed to union leaders Tuesday to join him for a second
term in office, but warned them to expect no favors.
</P>
<P>
Blair told the Trade Unions Congress (TUC) annual conference in
his keynote speech that Labor would be making tough decisions on
spending and many union demands would be turned down.
</P>
<P>
But he appealed for unions to keep supporting Labor and spoke
passionately about the importance of winning further terms of
office to make sure that 21st century was "a progressive century,
not a Conservative century".
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also insisted that most union members
appreciated the improvements the government had made for ordinary
people. These gains would be lost if the Tories returned to power,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair admitted to listening to the concerns of industry, but he
said that most union members did not regard this as a "betrayal".
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he would continue to encourage workers and
bosses to co-operate to achieve a modern and successful economy in
Britain.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Rejects Angola's Appeal for Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad Tuesday rejected with contempt an
appeal by his Angolan counterpart for sanctions against South
Africa, state television reported.
</P>
<P>
Angolan deputy foreign minister, George Chicoty, said last
Friday that South Africa and several other countries should be
penalized for not doing enough to stop violations of U.N. embargo
against the rebels of the National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
In response, Pahad said Chicoty's statement was "very
surprising" and needed to be dealt with contempt, noting that
South Africa was abiding by all U.N. resolutions on the UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The South African deputy foreign minister said that his
government had always been in touch with the Angolan government
and had investigated all allegations of embargo violations.
</P>
<P>
Pahad also denied Chicoty's claim that relations between South
Africa and Angola has deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that there were South Africans outside the
 government structures who were involved in violations of UNITA
embargo. He said the government would track them down.

<HEADLINE> Starving Rwandans Need 1,500 Tons of Food Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP),
 in conjunction with the Rwandan National Food Committee, is
planning to supply more than 1,500 tons of food to hunger-stricken
Rwandans, the Rwanda News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Coordinator of the committee, Innocent Rwakazina, said Tuesday
that northeastern Umutara and Kibungo, and southwestern Gikongoro
are the prefectures most hit by starvation.
</P>
<P>
"In Umutara, out of ten communes, eight are seriously stricken
by hunger," Rwakazina was quoted as saying. He said that his
committee will supply 550 tons of food to 7,000 families in the
prefecture.
</P>
<P>
In Kibungo prefecture, 8,500 families from five communes along
the banks of Kagera River will get 668 tons, said the food relief
official.
</P>
<P>
"The Umutara and Kibungo prefectures are known for their
aridity and scarce water resources," Rwakazina pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other regions in Rwanda, Umutara and Kibungo prefectures
have very few water resources and the underground water in those
areas is very shallow.
</P>
<P>
According to Bruno Mwanafunzi, Director of Water Resources in
the Rwandan Ministry of Public Works and Energy, the situation in
the northeastern region was exacerbated by an unusual drought that
hit the area during the prolonged dry season.
</P>
<P>
In the southwestern Gikongoro prefecture, 360 tones of food
will be given to 4,500 families in communes seriously affected by
hunger, Rwakazina said.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike the northeastern region, Gikongoro prefecture has got a
low food production due to very poor and old soils which are
acidic in nature," he added.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that in conjunction with the WFP, the Rwandan
National Food Committee will also provide 400 tons of cereals to
each prefecture where projects aimed at increasing food production
are implemented.
</P>
<P>
According to the food relief official, each family will get 50
kilograms of cereals, 25 kg of nutritious flour and 3.6 kg of
cooking oil.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Prices Stable at Kenya's Nairobi Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the price drop at the international markets, the
Nairobi exchange was steady, but there would be likely a supply
shortage of coffee in coming weeks, sources with the exchange
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nairobi Coffee Exchange, prices for T grade
coffee sold at 76 to 86 U.S. dollars per bag (50 kilograms)
Tuesday compared with 72 to 86 dollars last week while TT grade
at 85 to 94 dollars as against 72 to 86 dollars per bag in the
previous week.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported that in recent months, there had been
disputes between coffee farmers and their cooperative societies
leaders over the issues of society management and where their
coffee to be milled in the major coffee-growing area in the
country's Central Province.
</P>
<P>
As a result, their disputes had almost halted the harvesting of
coffee beans and processing at factories before delivered to the
coffee board.
</P>
<P>
Due to the scant supply, there will be no auction on September
28, but the auction will resume on October 5, the coffee exchange
said.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that to encourage coffee farmers to increase
production, the Coffee Board of Kenya has recently set aside 20
million shillings (some three million U.S. dollars) for provision
of coffee seedlings to farmers throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is one of Kenya's major foreign exchange earners. The
coffee production in the east African country grew to a level of
140,000 tons in mid-1980s, but declined to only 40,000 tons in
1998.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Develops New Anti-Crime Computer System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Crime in South Africa
could be reduced by 30 percent in three years if a new computer
system lives up to its promises, state television reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The sophisticated investigating system will provide and link
information on criminals countrywide, reducing the amount of time
spent tracking them down, said the South African Broadcasting
Corporation (SABC) television.
</P>
<P>
MTN, a major cellular phone supplier, has contributed 1.5
million rand (250,000 U.S. dollars) to the development of the
system.
</P>
<P>
The system drew experiences of the South African police, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation of the United States and the
Scotland Yard of Britain, the television said.
</P>
<P>
The new system works on the theory that killers and rapists
work close to their home. Experts claim that in 97 out of 100
cases, the center of the circle of offenses is the criminal's
home.
</P>
<P>
With the help of other evidence such as profiles, the criminal
could be tracked down in minutes instead of months, according to
the tv report.
</P>
<P>
An Analysis finds that if delivered, the system could reduce
police work load by 40 percent.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 14 (xinhua) -- The U.N. Mission in
East Timor (UNAMET) relocated its 120 staff and 1424 East Timorese
from its compound in the capital of Dili to Darwin, Australia
Monday night, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The East Timorese had been forced to seek refuge at the
compound.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations saw the relocation necessary as the compound
was overcrowded and untenable with poor sanitary conditions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the UNAMET has kept 12
international personnel as its core staff to cope with
humanitarian affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said the relocated people will take a rest in Darwin and
will return to East Timor once law and order are restored to allow
them to continue their work following the August 30 ballot, which
showed overwhelming preference to independence in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who met Foreign Ministers of Indonesia, Portugal and
Australia here Tuesday, hoped that it should be possible to have
some elements of multinational force on the ground by the weekend
at the latest.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council was meeting Tuesday to discuss the details
of the U.N. authorized multinational force mandated to restore
peace and security in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
A draft resolution is expected to be adopted soon, forming the
framework of the multinational action.

<HEADLINE> (rpt)Indonesia to Play Part in East Timor Peacekeeping: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N.-sanctioned
multi-national force will cooperate with Indonesia in keeping
peace in East Timor, said Foreign Minister Ali Alatas Tuesday,
ruling out the imminent withdrawal of the Indonesian army.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian troops "are not withdrawing yet, but there will
be cooperation between the multi-national and the Indonesian
forces", said the Minister, emerging from his talks with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Australia is the most-prepared contributor of troops to
restoring peace and security in East Timor. Alatas said he and
Downer talked about when their troops would go to East Timor, what
other countries would be among the first batch of the force and
the implications between a multi-national force and a U.N.
peace-keeping one in terms of funding.
</P>
<P>
"But of course the command and the leadership on the ground
will be with the multi-national force, with the Indonesian forces
probably playing an advisory or liaison role etc," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a timetable and we are going to withdraw in a matter
of weeks, let us keep the timetable, let us honor the
international agreement," said he, referring to the May 5
agreement between Indonesia, Portugal and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The pact provides for Indonesia to be responsible for law and
order in East Timor during the ballot on its future and its
transition to independence.
</P>
<P>
The August 30 referendum did see the majority of voters showing
preference to independence. In this case the U.N. peace-keeping
mission is mandated to enter into the territory only after the
transition period ends.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing a situation which was not of our making, which
was a very difficult and complicated one and we are trying to
overcome with the help of the United Nations...you can continue to
accuse us of many things, but if you don't accept the situation,
you cann't find the answer to the situation," Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia would like to see the international troops to
land on East Timor as soon as possible, but how soon would depend
on contributing countries and U.N. regulations.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council was working on a draft resolution forming
the basis for the multi-national action.
</P>
<P>
Violence has taken place in East Timor since the result of the
U.N. brokered ballot was announced on September 4, which ended
Indonesia's rule since 1976 after the withdrawal of former
colonial ruler Portugal from the territory.

LISBON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Portugal and Mali, who at
present preside over the Economic Community of Western African
States (CEDEAO), on Tuesday signed an agreement of cooperation
between the two countries and showed interest in strengthening
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed in Lisbon, by the secretary of state
for Foreign Relations and Cooperation from Portugal, Luis Amado,
and the Foreign Minister for Mali, Modibo Sidibe.
</P>
<P>
In statements to the press, Luis Amado explained that the
dialogue between the two countries over the last two months, due
to the crisis in Guinea Bissau, created confidence and interest in
developing these relations.
</P>
<P>
According to the secretary of state, the Portuguese cooperation
with Africa, which is concentrated mainly in the African Countries
with Portuguese as the Official Language (PALOP), should be
diversified.
</P>
<P>
Modibo Sidibe said that the development of his country not only
needed bilateral cooperation, but also multilateral, especially
between the European Union and the CEDEAO.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Guinea Bissau, whose conflict was mediated by
CEDEAO, Sidibe said that it was necessary to continue the efforts,
so that the elections may be held, for the consolidation of all
the results gained so far.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Tuesday began a closed late afternoon session to discuss
the latest situation in Kosovo, the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan issued
a statement through his spokesman, voicing his concern at the
worsening humanitarian situation in Yugoslavia due to a blighted
economy and other causes and calling upon donors to give a hand.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that in addition to half a million refugees
and internally displaced persons from previous Balkan conflicts,
an estimated 200,000 people had been displaced from Kosovo to
other parts of the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement failed to refer to NATO's 79-day
unilateral bombing of the sovereign and independent country, which
has dealt a severe blow to the economy of the nation.
</P>
<P>
There was a real threat of rising food price and dwindling drug
supply, coupled with plummeting household income due partly to a
dramatic increase in unemployment, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Winter electricity supplies were projected to be 30 percent to
50 percent below requirements, threatening to deprive the urban
poor of heating, running water, health care and the capacity to
freeze and cook food.
</P>
<P>
In light of the "increasingly disturbing situation," Annan said
in the statement that he had asked the U.N. emergency relief
coordinator to lead efforts to mobilize resources to meet these
needs.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general strongly urges donors to give prompt and
generous support to this strictly humanitarian operation," the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Italian Car Industry in Good Shape, Says Fiat Auto Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Fiat Auto Chief Roberto Testore
denied Tuesday that the Italian car industry was in bad shape and
in need of new government incentives to boost it back to its 1998
level.
</P>
<P>
A recent report said that Italy recorded an 8 percent drop in
new car sales in August over the same month in 1998, compared to a
28 percent slump in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian news agency Ansa, Testore, who was present
at Frankfurt's international car salon, said the Italian car
industry "is doing well," reporting that between 2.2 and 2.3
million new cars were expected to be sold by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the results are different from 1998, when there
were still incentives," he said, referring to the boom in car
sales last year, fueled by government incentives until July 1998
to trade in old lead-fueled cars for new environment-friendly
ones.
</P>
<P>
"In any case, we are still above what we consider the threshold
of 2 to 2.1 million car sales," Testore said.
</P>
<P>
"In the year 2000, however, we expect sales to be slightly down
to about 2.1 million cars," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released Tuesday by the European
association of automakers, ACEA, new car sales in Italy fell 11.2
percent in August - traditionally a holiday month - compared to
July, against a 17.1 percent increase in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
But ACEA said that while the European Union registered 28
percent fewer new cars in August over the same month in 1998,
sales in Italy only dropped 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question on hopes that the government will
reintroduce car incentives, the Fiat official said these "could be
useful if they help reduce the number of older cars on the roads."

<HEADLINE> Explosion Renders Downtown Toronto Out of Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A transformer explosion
rendered the downtown core of Toronto out of power Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A Canadian press report from Toronto said that the accident
happened around 3 p.m. after routine maintenance at a key hydro
station.
</P>
<P>
The country's highest CN Tower was hit by the blackout, with
the elevators inside the tower of 553.33 meters coming to a sudden
stop. Backup generators were put into operation within minutes,
but no new visitors were admitted, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The power interruption also affected several major broadcasters
including City-TV, which went off the air only to resume
broadcasting shortly after newscasters operated from its outside
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters were called in to attend to the explosion induced
fire at the power station, where no casualties or injuries have
been reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Toronto Hydro as saying it would likely be a
couple of hours before power could be restored to the area.

<HEADLINE> John Lennon Guitar Sold for 155,000 Pounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The guitar that John Lennon
was playing on the day he met Paul McCartney was sold for 155,000
pounds (249,200 U.S. dollars) on Tuesday night, auctioneers
Sotheby's said.
</P>
<P>
Lennon, the creator of Beatles, bought the acoustic Gallotone
Champion instrument for 10 pounds (16 dollars) about a month
before meeting McCartney at a Liverpool church fete on July 6,
1957.
</P>
<P>
The guitar was the earliest Beatles-related guitar to come on
to auction market. It was bought by a New York investment fund
manager, who bid by telephone and declined to be named.
</P>
<P>
The final figure exceeded the expectations of Sotheby's, which
had estimated the guitar would fetch up to 100,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
On the neck of the guitar is a plaque which recalls what Lennon
was once told by his Aunt Mimi: "Remember, you'll never earn your
living by it."

SOFIA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Crvena Zvezda of Yugoslavia
lost to Montpelier of France 0-1 in a first-round, first-leg match
of the UEFA Pro Cup Tournament at Sofia's Georgi Asparouhov
Stadium on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The only goal came from Patrice Loko six minutes into the first
half. Dejan Ilic of Crvena Zvezda was sent off in the 57th minute.
</P>
<P>
The fixture took place in Sofia because UEFA banned Serbian
teams from hosting European club tournament matches in Yugoslavia
for the poor transportation services caused by damaged
infrastructure in the country as a result of the U.S.-led NATO
bombing. Crvena Zvezda chose the alternative venue.
</P>
<P>
The match was watched by a crowd of 11,000 including some 2,000
Yugoslavian fans, and was policed by some 300 uniformed officers.
The Serbian and the French fans were separated in different

LONDON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Manchester
United had a sluggish start on the opening night of Champions
League first group phase when they were held to a 0-0 draw by
Croatia Zagreb on Tuesday
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dynamo Kiev had a shock home defeat and Barcelona
gained a hard-fought victory with a late goal.
</P>
<P>
Lazio, ambitious to add the European Cup to the Cup Winners'
Cup trophy they won last season, were held to a 1-1 draw by Bayer
Leverkusen in Germany, while Arsenal's Nigerian striker Nwankwo
Kanu wasted a chance to give his side an opening victory when his
late penalty was saved by Fiorentina's Italian international
keeper Francesco Toldo.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United, fielding some unfamiliar names in a
makeshift side after injury and ineligibility ravaged Alex
Ferguson's squad, were held to a 0-0 draw at Old Trafford by
Croatia Zagreb in group D.
</P>
<P>
In the same group Olympique Marseille, back in the competition
for the first time since winning it in 1993, cruised to a 2-0 win
over Sturm Graz of Austria with goals from Robert Pires and
Fabrizio Ravanelli.
</P>
<P>
There was a major upset in Kiev where Maribor Teatanic of
Slovenia upset last year's semi-finalists Dynamo 1-0, with a goal
from Ante Simundza 16 minutes from the end of their Group A match.
</P>
<P>
Lazio's draw in Leverkusen came in the same section. Both
goals came in the opening spell with Oliver Neuville scoring for
the Germans after 14 minutes and Sinisa Mihajlovic equalising with
a blistering free kick four minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona left it late to win their Group B match in Stockholm
with headers from Abelardo Fernandez at the 86th minute and Dani
Garcia, deep into injury time, giving the Catalans victory after
Nebosja Novakovic's goal at the 73rd minute put AIK ahead.
</P>
<P>
With Fiorentina and Arsenal drawing in Florence, Barcelona go
to the top of what looks to be the toughest group in the
competition.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian champions Rosenborg Trondheim had no worries beating
Boavista 3-0 in Portugal with Jan Derek Sorensen (8), Orjan Berg (
43) and Roar Strand (73) securing an easy Group C victory.

<HEADLINE> Cole Could Face Legal Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United striker Andy
Cole and the club could face legal action over Cole's horror
tackle on one of Australia's brightest prospects.
</P>
<P>
Australian club Carlton may sue over Cole's challenge on their
star player Simon Colosimo during the July friendly against
Socceroos in Sydney which left the defender needing a knee
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Carlton have instructed Melbourne law firm Slater and Gordon to
handle any compensation claim and proceedings could start within a
month.
</P>
<P>
When the law firm first took on the case, principal Peter
Gordon claimed the law recognized compensation claims between
sporting organizations.
</P>
<P>
Carlton director Lou Sticca revealed the law firm had been
studying what had happened and would decide how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
"We put the matter in the hands of Slater and Gordon and at the
end of the day we will be guided by their legal advice," said
Sticca.
</P>
<P>
Tour promoters, Rivkin Entertainment, and Soccer Australia
could also be cited in any claim for compensation.
</P>
<P>
Colosimo was regarded as one of Australia's best young players
and was tipped for a move to Europe before Cole's tackle sidelined

<HEADLINE> Taliban Asks for UN Recognition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling
Taliban Tuesday asked the United Nations to recognize its
administration.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, the Taliban's
number-two leader Mulla Mohammad Rabbani said he "regretted" that
the U.N. understanding of events in Afghanistan was "not based on
reality."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has failed to "differentiate between the
true and legitimate representatives of this nation and the false
representatives," said the letter officially released here.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban leader claimed that they had protected the
country's integrity and "the United Nations, aware of this
reality, should therefore adopt a fair, just and honest decision
towards this nation."
</P>
<P>
The deposed government headed by Burhanuddin Rabbani is still
widely known as the legitimate ruler of Afghanistan and only
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates recognize the
Taliban's rule over the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Mulla Rabbani also rejected a recent U.N. report on human
rights in Afghanistan, saying the militia has committed no human
rights violations in the "95 percent" of the country it controls.
</P>
<P>
Radhika Coomaraswamy, the U.N. special rapporteur on violence
against women, last week toured Afghanistan and lashed out at the
Taliban for "widespread, systematic and officially sanctioned"
discrimination against women.

</P>
<P>
-- After a decade of steady decline in Australia's forces, the

unleashed by the East Timor crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Argentine cabinet on
Tuesday presented a draft national budget for year 2000 to the
congress, which forecasts a 3.5 percent growth rate of gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jorge Rodriguez said in a statement that the

The budget forecasts a financial deficit of 5.311 billion
dollars or 17.8 percent of the GDP, with income totaling 42.864
billion dollars and global spending 48.175 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
It also estimates the current account deficit to be 13.11
billion dollars, and income from direct foreign investment and

<HEADLINE> Australia Faces Funding Black Hole in Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Australia's role in a
peacekeeping mission in East Timor will significantly upset the
country's budget, the Financial Review reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted senior government sources as saying the cost
of the peacekeeping force of 4,500 soldiers could be as high as
325 million U.S. dollars while the estimated cost per refugee in
Australia was 1,950 U.S. dollars per person per month.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government promised to send 4,500 soldiers to
East Timor, composing the biggest part of a multinational
peacekeeping force which will be commanded by Australia's Major
General Peter Cosgrove.
</P>
<P>
So far 2,523 East Timor refugees have been evacuated to
Australia, with more expected, and they would take the additional
cost to at least 23.4 million U.S. dollars a year not including
airlift charges, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Australia seemed to be pursuing a "leading role"
in the region. "We are responding to our moral and regional
responsibilities. We will face considerable challenges and
strains," Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Quoting government sources, the Financial Review said the
demands of Australia's "new strategic role in the region" would
create a funding freeze in education, health and other spending
ministries.
</P>
<P>
There is a looming funding black hole in defense over the next
decade, with the defense forces looking to upgrade or replace the
F-111s, the FA-18s and some of the older destroyers, the paper
estimated.

<HEADLINE> Thirteen Colombian Farmers Killed by Rival Paramilitary Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- At least 13 farmers
were shot dead by rival paramilitary groups Monday evening in the
provinces of Cordoba and Cauca, Colombia, authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A group of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)
took five farm workers from their dwellings in Cordoba and shot
them, accusing them of being collaborators of the Auto-defence
Units of Colombia (AUC), a rival paramilitary group, said Franklin
de la Vega, secretary of the province.
</P>
<P>
In a revenging shooting spree, members of AUC killed eight
farmers in the south-east province of Cauca, in the same day with
the same excuse, local police said.

<HEADLINE> Irvine to Get Top Cat Treatment from Jaguar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Formula One driver Eddie
Irvine will get top-cat treatment by Jaguar next season instead of
the track dogsbody role he had rejected at Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
Hopeful of winning this year's world championship, Irvine will
drive for Jaguar Racing in 2000 as one of the worst kept secrets
in the Formula One paddock was finally confirmed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The promise came from Jackie Stewart whose young team was
renamed after one of the most glamorous of car marques following
their buy-out by Ford earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Three-time champion Stewart believes Irvine will flourish next
season when he will be released from the four-year shackles he was
under at Ferrari who wanted him to remain as Michael Schumacher's
number two.
</P>
<P>
"I think Eddie has suffered considerably by being under the
leadership, if you could call it that, of Schumacher," said
Stewart, who will continue as chairman and chief executive of
Jaguar Racing.
</P>
<P>
"At Ferrari there was one man that they worked for and that was
Schumacher. If they had time for anything else that was Eddie
only second.
</P>
<P>
"He could not take that any more. He had to have a space of
his own and he has justified it and I think we have got a very,
very good man in the team.
</P>
<P>
"He is very fit, very strong-minded. To have been able to put
up with what he has had to put up with he had to have tremendous
stability in his mind.
</P>
<P>
"That is a great strength for a racing driver and I think he is
going to do very well for the Jaguar Racing team," he added.
</P>
<P>
Irvine, despite an apparent lack of support from Ferrari, is
still a serious contender for the drivers' crown with just three
races left after moving level with reigning champion Mika Hakkinen
in Italy last weekend.

<HEADLINE> S. Africans Takes Athletics Medals at All Africa Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Athletics gave South
Africa a lift in the medals tally as they pulled off a seven-medal
haul of four golds, two silvers and a bronze on the opening day of
the track and field action in the All Africa Games here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Burger Lambrechts led a 1-2-3 South African sweep in the shot
put with a 19.50 meters performance. Janus Robberts claimed the
silver with 19.16m, with Karel Potgieter touching down at 18.9m
for the bronze.
</P>
<P>
Other gold medals were captured by hammer thrower Chris Haremse,
javelin specialist Liezel Roux and Rika Erasmus, an upset winner
in the women's pole vault.
</P>
<P>
Hezekiel Sepeng, silver medalist at last month's world
championships in Seville and a favorite for the 800m gold here
against a powerful field of Kenyans, raced in pain to qualify for
the semi-finals on Wednesday after arriving earlier in the day
from Europe.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's Assefa Mezgebu, fourth at the world championships,
sprinted to gold on a winning time of 28 minutes 12.15 seconds in
men's 10,000m.
</P>
<P>
Egypt narrowly edged out South Africa in the final medal count
at the Games men's gymnastic competition on Tuesday, by a score
total of 20 to 19.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's under-23 soccer team reached the semi-finals when they
thrashed Mauritius in their last group match Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Zambians finished second to Cameroon, held to a 1-1 tie by
Cote d'Ivoire on Tuesday, in Group Two and they will meet Group
One leaders South Africa in the semi-finals later in the week.
Cameroon will meet Group One runners-up Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Samir scored a late equalizer for Egypt to snatch a 2-2
draw against Kenya in one of the most exciting All Africa Games
men's field hockey matches Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyans dominated play for a large part of the game and
caught the ill-disciplined Egyptians off-guard with their
impressive play.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's women's team, however, lost 3-2 to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The South African men's tennis team moved inexorably towards
the gold medal at Ellis Park on Tuesday with a 3-0 win over
Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
The top seeds now face Namibia in Thursday's semi-finals and
that is one tie the South Africans are not going to lose for a win
there will guarantee them at least the silver. Second seeds Cote
d'Ivoire and number three Mauritius will meet in the other semi-
final fixture.
</P>
<P>
The South African women's team will play their semi-finals tie
Wednesday against Zimbabwe while in the other half, second seeds
Madagascar take on Algeria.
</P>
<P>
South Africa emerged as unbeaten champions of the All Africa
Games netball in Soweto near Johannesburg and claimed the gold
medal after beating Malawi 74-35 in the final match of the

<HEADLINE> Argentine Official Criticizes IMF Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's Vice
Secretary of Finance Miguel Kiguel considered as "pessimistic" the
forecasts by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of an economic
growth of 1 percent for the country in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
For some reason, the forecast by the IMF is not in accord with
some favorable objective factors, such as a more favorable
international climate, said Kiguel in an interview published on
Tuesday by the newspaper "El Cronista."
</P>
<P>
"The IMF is taking a very conservative stance" and "has little
respect" for the capacity of the gross domestic product (GDP) of
Argentina, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Kiguel said that the GDP of the country would grow by 3.5
percent over the next year, due to the provisions of a stronger
impetus from Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, Argentina's partners in
the South American Common Market.
</P>
<P>
Kiguel also denied that the elections on October 24, in which
president Carlos Menem will be replaced, would have adverse
repercussions on the economy.
</P>
<P>
The GDP of Argentina contracted by 4.9 percent in the second
quarter of this year, compared with the same period in 1998, due
to the recession which was worsened by the contraction of the
Brazilian economy, confirmed Kiguel.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, The Argentine government said it estimated its
budget deficit next year at 4.5 billion dollars, a target below
this year's likely shortfall.

LONDON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Andrei Medvedev
suffered a major blow on Tuesday when he lost in the first round
of the Bournemouth Open men's tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
The fourth seed, a finalist in this year's French Open, was
beaten by Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden 6-2, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev led 5-2 in the second set and 5-3 in the tie-break,
only to founder against his opponent's huge forehands and his own
temperamental frailties.
</P>
<P>
He was awarded a code violation warning for hitting a ball out
of the stadium just before the end.
</P>
<P>
Another seed, defending champion Felix Mantilla, also went out.
</P>
<P>
The top 20-ranked Spaniard won the first two games and then
unaccountably lost nine on the trot to go down 6-2, 6-3 to Kenneth
Carlsen of Denmark, who is ranked at 86 in the world.
</P>
<P>
Top seed Thomas Enqvist progressed 7-5, 6-1 against Swedish
compatriot Nicklas Kulti, godfather to his child. "It's always
difficult to play your best friend. We both found it difficult to
get pumped up," said Enqvist.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Education is
to launch a nationwide retraining program for improving
professional skills of 10 million of primary and middle school
teachers.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reported that the professional skills of
the Chinese primary and middle school teachers and nearly 1
million school masters are expected to be upgraded in the next
five years by implementation of the retraining program.
</P>
<P>
The central government will allocated 130 million yuan (16
million U.S. dollars) over the next two years to fund the
retaining project, according to the ministry's Teacher Training
Department.
</P>
<P>
Lu Fuyuan, vice-minister of Education, said all primary and
middle school teachers are expected to receive additional
professional training.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a national conference on retraining
primary and middle school teachers and headmasters opened in
Shanghai yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The training is expected to encourage teachers to create more
efficient teaching methods and to help them develop respect for
their students' personalities and mentalities in the classrooms.
</P>
<P>
The retraining program will focus on computer-aided and other
modern teaching skills, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Teachers and headmasters who are found unqualified after
receiving retraining will be dismissed from their posts.
</P>
<P>
China has 700,000 primary and middle schools which are attended
by 200 million students.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Greek Deputy Foreign
Minister Yiannos Kranidiotis and five other persons were killed
late Tuesday in a plane accident over Romania.
</P>
<P>
Their plane hit heavy turbulence and went into a steep dive,
Romanian Transport Minister Traian Basescu said.
</P>
<P>
Kranidiotis, 51, and his son Nikos, 23, were on their way to a
meeting in Bucharest with a Balkan cooperation group.
</P>
<P>
Five others aboard were hospitalized, while another two were
not injured. The dead and injured included journalists.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred shortly after the plane entered Romanian
airspace near Giurgiu, about 60 kilometers southeast of Bucharest.
The plane was preparing to land in Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
Basescu said the pilot lost control of the plane at 21,000 feet
and the plane plummeted thousands of feet before he could
straighten it out. The plane managed to land at Otopeni
international airport.
</P>
<P>
Romanian television reports said Kranidiotis and the others
possibly suffocated or suffered heart attacks after their aircraft
suddenly depressurized as it rapidly lost altitude.

<HEADLINE> Issel Reclaims Nuggets' Coaching Reins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Dan Issel, who spent the
past 18 months trying to piece together a competitive roster as
general manager of the Denver Nuggets, on Tuesday signed a three-
year deal to serve as coach for the second time, replacing Mike D'
Antoni.
</P>
<P>
New billionaire owner Donald Sturm, who bought the team in late
July, offered Issel the coaching position. The Hall of Famer
admitted it was difficult to fire D'Antoni, whom he hired before
the lockout-shortened 1999 season, but pointed out the urgency of
rebuilding the Nuggets into the contender.
</P>
<P>
"If this wasn't day when I had to part company with a good
friend, it would be a happy day for me," Issel said. "I think the
reason I accepted is because we're trying to do what is best for
the Denver Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
"Being here for a shortened season didn't give Mike the biggest
opportunity, but we don't have a long opportunity to turn this
team around. We want to bring stability to the situation. We
have completely revamped the roster in the last year and a half,
we have some players who are going to have an impact."
</P>
<P>
The urgency to make the Nuggets -- who have won 25 games over
the last two seasons -- competitive grew with the team moving into
the new Pepis Center this season. Sturm led a group of local
investors who bought the Nuggets, the NHL's Colrado Avalanche and
the Pepsi Center -- which replaces McNichols Arena -- for 461
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But Issel insisted Sturm did not force him into accepting the
coaching position, saying, "He was supportive, he gave me the
contract but left the final decision to me. With a two- or three-
year window to get the contract to respectability, we feel this is
the right choice."
</P>
<P>
Issel, 50, coached the Nuggets for two-plus seasons, compiling
a 96-102 record before resigning 34 games into the 1994-95
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Since Issel stepped down as coach midway through the 1994-95
season, the Nuggets have floundered. The franchise hit a low
point in the 1997-98 season, when Denver went 11-71 and nearly
matched the all-time record for NBA futility set by the
Philadelphia 76ers in 1972-73.
</P>
<P>
Issel is one of the four players whose numbers have been
retired by the Nuggets. His name became synonymous with the
franchise during his playing days from 1975-85. When Issel retired
in 1985, he left as Denver's all-time leading scorer and rebounder.

<HEADLINE> China Initiates Safety Inspection for Its 50th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- China is making great efforts
to ensure safety during the upcoming celebration of its 50th
founding anniversary, and has begun a week-long safety inspection
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"It is a serious political task to ensure the celebrations -- a
monumental event for Beijing and the whole country -- proceed
smoothly and safely," Shi Wanpeng, vice-minister of the State
Economic and Trade Commission (SETC), was quoted by Wednesday's
China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
The SETC, in cooperation with the ministries of construction
and railways, the Civil Aviation Administration of China and the
State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision, initiated the
inspection yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The inspection group will examine Beijing's main facilities in
civil aviation, chemical industry, subway system, power supply,
construction and metallurgical sectors to help remove any "hidden
dangers", Shi said.
</P>
<P>
To stem the rise of casualties in traffic, industrial, fire,
swimming, gas and food poisoning accidents, Beijing has
strengthened safety supervision on production, eliminated safety
loopholes, and ordered enterprises to implement State laws and
regulations on work safety to the letter, according to the Beijing
Bureau of Labor and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
Since Beijing will host grand parades, exhibitions, fireworks
displays and art performances, fire control is among the top
concerns for the municipal government.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Fire Control Bureau will deploy more than 2,000
fire control policemen and 54 fire engines during the celebration,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"We should ensure that during the celebrations, there will be
no fires in the Tian'anmen Square, no fires in the celebration
park tours or large exhibition venues, and no big fires in the
whole city," director of the bureau Liu Ruixiang said.

<HEADLINE> Facts and Figures on China's Standing in the World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Editor's note: The People's Republic of China celebrates its
50th founding anniversary this year and Xinhua will release 10
stories on key facts and figures on the nation's economic and
social development over the last half century. This is the first.
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The 50 years since the
founding of the People's Republic of China has seen remarkable
improvements in China's international status. The following facts
and figures indicate this:
</P>
<P>
China's GDP in 1998 was 7.955 trillion yuan, nearly 30 times
that of 1952 in real terms.
</P>
<P>
From 1952 to 1998, China's GDP increased at an annual rate of 7.
7 percent, compared to 3.3 percent for the world economy as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
According to World bank estimates, China's economy ranked
seventh in the world in 1997, after the United States, Japan,
Germany, France, Britain and Italy.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, China led the world in grain, meat, cotton,
peanut, rapeseed, fruit, steel, coal, cement, fertilizer, an TV
production.
</P>
<P>
That same year, China's cotton cloth, chemical fiber, and
electricity output was second in the world, tea, soy bean, and
sugar cane production came third, sugar came fourth, and crude oil
was fifth.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China's foreign trade was worth 323.9 billion U.S.
dollars, nearly 16 times the 1978 figure, and 11th in the world.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, China's foreign reserves were worth 145
billion U.S. dollars, putting it in second place in the world for
the third consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, China had approved 324,000 overseas-funded
projects, worth 573.2 billion U.S. dollars of overseas investment,

</P>
<P>
In 1998, food expenditures accounted for 53 and 45 percent of

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Senior Shuttlers Not Allowed to Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PBSI executive director Karsono said that men's singles veteran
Hariyanto Arbi and men's doubles specialist Rexy Mainaky should
not leave the center because they were still in top form. "Both
players are still in the world's top rankings. We must not let
them go. They should be made to feel a part of the center,"
Karsono said.
</P>
<P>
Arbi, the 1993 world champion, has planned to move to Singapore,
and Mainaky has received an offer to coach England next month.
</P>
<P>
Both players expressed disappointment over some PBSI officials'
unfair treatment toward them. The officials urged both veterans
to leave the center as they had not shown any outstanding
performances recently.
</P>
<P>
But Arbi had a reversal of fortune by winning the Singapore
Open and Mainaky had the same by winning the Indonesia Open with
partner Ricky Subagja. The pair won the 1996 Olympic Games in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Karsono said Arbi had told Arisanto, an official of the Central
Java branch of PBSI, that he had canceled his plan to move to
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"Arbi has assured me that five Indonesian men's singles --
Hendrawan, Taufik Hidayat, Budi Santoso, Marlev Mainaky and Arbi
himself -- have a chance to bring home the Olympic gold medal," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I think Mainaky still has a chance to retain his gold medal
with Subagja. Indonesia still needs them," he added.
</P>
<P>
Karsono expressed worry that both players' plan to move could
inspire other athletes to use the training center only as a
stepping stone to move to another country.
</P>
<P>
"If that happens in the future, we won't have top players
anymore because they will have moved on to other countries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Karsono said he would meet the secretary-general, officials in
charge of athlete development and athletes to discuss and solve
the problem.
</P>
<P>
and, Arie Sudewo, chairman of the National Sports Council (KONI)
, said he would meet PBSI officials to discuss the issue. "I
think PBSI athlete development officials must intensify their
efforts to make shuttlers feel appreciated. It is regrettable if
those players want to move, but that's their right," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Investment, Trade With Vietnam Down in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's trade with the United
States and U.S. investment in Vietnam both slipped in the first
eight months of 1999, said the latest issue of Vietnam Investment
Review.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's export volume to the United States from the beginning
of the year to the end of August totaled just 250 million U.S.
dollars, according to Vietnam's customs statistics.
</P>
<P>
Several new products, namely cinnamon, handicrafts, tea, fruit
and vegetables, finally broke into the U.S. market but their value
totaled a paltry 5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the same time export earnings to the United States from key
export goods such as crude oil, rice and coffee nose-dived.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of this year, rice volume was just
3.3 percent of last year's total and coffee exports plummeted 70
percent. And what is more, Vietnam exported no crude oil to the
United States in the eight months.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Vietnamese exports to the U.S. market were worth a
record 468.6 million dollars while, over the same period, U.S.
investors broke into the top 10 countries in terms of foreign
investment in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the first eight months of the year, just six
projects with an investment capital of 53 million dollars were
licensed for U.S. investors.
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast, 16 projects worth 92.3 million dollars were
licensed last year while 16 projects worth 277 million dollars
were licensed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Based on the latest trade statistics, Vietnam Investment Review
said, Vietnamese economists suggested that Vietnam would struggle
to reach last year's record trade haul.

<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Editor's note: This year marks
the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of
China. Xinhua News Agency is releasing about 50 stories on Chinese
men and women, young and old, illustrating the changes that have
taken place in China over the past half century. These people will
describe their own experiences and how they fit into the changes
in the motherland.
</P>
<P>
An employment agency in Dalian, northeast China's Liaoning
Province, headed by 45-year-old Qi Xiuyu, has helped over 10,000
laid-off workers get back on the job since it opened early this
year.
</P>
<P>
"I thought I had been in a dream when President Jiang Zemin
shook hands with me," said Qi, recalling her meeting several
months ago with the top Chinese leader, who congratulated her on
her extraordinary performance.
</P>
<P>
Qi had endeavored on her own to find suitable jobs for over 15,
000 unemployed before the service center was officially set up by
the Dalian Labor Bureau.
</P>
<P>
"Qi is just like an older sister, and she is really kind and
helpful," said 41-year-old Zhao Shulan with gratitude. Qi tried
dozens of times to find a job for Zhao.
</P>
<P>
"Great changes have taken place in the labor market. It was
rare for laid-off workers to go to the market when it was set up
in 1992, as most of them were used to being assigned jobs by the
government," Qi said.
</P>
<P>
Now, dozens of staff members in the agency assist an average
170 people daily, and sometimes as many as 300. Qi has to get up
at 6 a.m. every day to review the registration forms from the
previous day and arrange interviews for the applicants.

<HEADLINE> Australians Help Design New City Section in Southwestern Chinese Municipality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- An Australian company has
joined Chongqing, a metropolis in southwest China, to design its
northern section, an area called Jiangbei.
</P>
<P>
A contract recently signed between the Asia-Pacific Designing
Group (APDG) and the municipal government of Chongqing gives the
Australians three months to submit initial designs for the modern
spot, which is expected to be the center of the city in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
According to the government plan, Jiangbei will be the
administrative, cultural, information and traffic heart of
Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the municipal government published its open tender
on the Internet and it soon received dozens of bidders. The
Australian firm won the bidding in almost one year.
</P>
<P>
Construction of Jiangbei should take 15-20 years to complete at
the cost of some 100 billion yuan (12 billion US dollars). The
city government hopes the new town will be comparable to the
Pudong New Area in Shanghai, the largest economic powerhouse in
China.

<P>
In spite of the heavy workload, Qi is really proud of her job.
Whenever she hears the words like "Thanks a lot, Qi," from the
applicants, she feels truly rewarded. In order to find a most
suitable job for everyone who registers with the agency, she needs
to get a clear idea of what the applicant really wants by using
well-honed interviewing skills, she said.
</P>
<P>
But situations don't always work out. Some laid-off workers
blame Qi instead of themselves for not finding a suitable job.
Once a man even cursed her when he did not pass the job interview.
"I don't blame them, because I know that they are distressed and
in a bad mood when they don't get the job," Qi said.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 unemployed applied for over 4,600 job vacancies
last month. But often many don't get hired, as some aren't
qualified and others don't want to do some of the humbler
occupations, such as sanitation worker.
</P>
<P>
Qi explained that some people will have to have more training,
while others ought to think in more practical terms.
</P>
<P>
"I try to find as many job opportunities as possible by various
means. And sometimes I do not even have time for lunch," she said.
"I can't let them down when they turn to me for help."
</P>
<P>
Qi never shows off the service awards she has received. "I am
just a common person, and what I have done is just to try my best
to help people in difficulty."
</P>
<P>
Qi, born in a worker's family with seven kids, has been a
village doctor, a worker in a leather factory, and an accountant.
Her apartment is filled with plants and books, which, she said,
help ease her mind after a stressful day at work.

<HEADLINE> East China Province to Woo Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, September 15 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province
will make more efforts to improve the investment environment and
attract more overseas investment needed for the coastal province's
economic take-off, said acting governor Xi Jinping.
</P>
<P>
So far Fujian has established economic and trade ties with over
100 countries and regions and overseas investors have put 27
billion U.S. dollars worth of investment into the province, said
Xi in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the acting governor said, his province will proceed
from local conditions to develop its economy and keep opening up
to increase its comprehensive strength in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Fujian needs to continue using Deng Xiaoping Theory as its
guideline and to increase efforts to improve macro-economic
controls and agriculture, speed up reforms, and adjust the
economic structure, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xi said that the province has been working on a scientific
development program to which greater attention will be given and
more advanced technology will be used to improve the performance
of enterprises and develop pillar industries in the early years of
the next century.
</P>
<P>
Fujian has witnessed earth-shaking changes since China began
its reforms and opening up in 1978. Its improved infrastructure
has made the province particularly popular with overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
The rural areas are the best place to see the great changes.
The number of poverty-stricken people in the province fell from 2.
42 million in the mid-80s to 101,900 in 1997. There has been an
improvement in the province's standard of living and production
conditions, with electricity available in almost all rural
households, phone service in 83 percent of the villages, and tap
water in 95.2 percent of the rural households.
</P>
<P>
The governor says that his province will continue its effort at
advancing agriculture and poverty-relief work in rural areas, and
at providing comfortable lives for all rural people.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Set Up Committee to Monitor Fund Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has decided to
appoint a committee with wide powers to examine whether funds made
available through the budget and foreign loans and grants are used
without waste and corruption, the official Daily News reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government has made this decision because about half of the
funds allocated for national development under the previous
governments from 1977 to 1994 had drained away through waste and
corruption, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The committee, to be appointed by President Chandrika
Kumaratunga, will examine whether funds allocated for national
development have been properly used and whether estimates are in
order and completed works are up to the expected standard and
conform to the plans, a cabinet minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the president made a nationwide public appeal
a few weeks ago for informing her directly if any form of
corruption or irregularities have taken place in the course of
development programs that are being implemented.
</P>
<P>
Persons found guilty by the committee, whether they are
politicians or officials who have defrauded funds allocated for
national development, will be punished, the minister added.

<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 6,000 construction
projects in Beijing have passed an inspection conducted by the
Beijing Municipal Construction Committee and the Beijing Municipal
Planning Committee.
</P>
<P>
The review conducted by the two committees ran from May to
August. During the period, they checked quality of 6,534
construction projects which are either completed or being built,
in three phases.
</P>
<P>
The results show that 20 percent of the approved projects are
of good quality. All are in line with their original design and
state regulations.
</P>
<P>
Among the inspected projects, 3,187 are completed and 3,347 are
underway. Forty bridges and roads were also checked.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, China passed a law on inviting and submitting
tenders to ensure construction quality and promote fair
competition.
</P>
<P>
The new law will take effect on January 1, 2000. It is meant to
improve openness and fairness in project bidding and equipment
purchasing, and also to reduce spending and improve construction
quality.

Aware of the ever-increasing dangers of environmental pollution,
people in China ranging from top party leaders to ordinary

Just weeks after the catastrophic flooding along the Yangtze

locked away logging tools and vehicles and even destroyed roads
accessing the forested regions. A million loggers were turned into
a nationwide force to plant trees.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, China allocated 10 billion yuan (1.2
billion US dollars) to combat the pollution along Huaihe River and
several billion yuan to clean up Taihu Lake in east China.
</P>
<P>
China has long been engaged in prevention and control of soil
erosion. The annual Tree Planting Festival, initiated at the
recommendation of the late leader Deng Xiaoping, and the massive
"Northern Afforestation Project," which has been underway for 21
consecutive years, have created a green belt across the full width
of China's arid northern territory, bringing enormous benefits to
150 million people in the region.
</P>
<P>
China has also worked ceaselessly for city environmental
protection. Now 70 percent of the motor vehicles in big cities
meet the emissions standards stipulated in the laws and
regulations. The use of leaded gasoline is now prohibited in more
than 20 cities in the country, and a nationwide ban will take
effect on January 1, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Knight: Revised Schedule Close to Original </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Sydney 2000 Olympics
organizers have felt relieved as their original athletics programs
have been barely changed.
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) has asked
for a day's break between the semi-finals and finals of any event
of 400 meters or longer and a two-day break for races of 3,000
meters or more.
</P>
<P>
This would require major alterations to the schedule which was
the last thing on the mind of the organizers.
</P>
<P>
Olympics Minister Michael Knight said on Wednesday that
International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch
informed him from Lausanne that IAAF chief Primo Nebiolo had
signed off on a slightly revised schedule for track and field
events of 400 meters or longer.
</P>
<P>
"None of those huge changes they were proposing are going to
happen," Knight said. "I've been told the revised program is much
closer to what we originally had. We are relieved and delighted."

<HEADLINE> Environmental Protection Vital to China's Sustainable Development ( 3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In tune with the public mood, legislation on environmental
protection has accelerated. Since 1979, a total of 43
environmental protection-related laws have been enacted.
</P>
<P>
The input for environmental protection has also increased
considerably over the past years. In 1998, the government's
financial allocation for environmental protection reached more
than 80 billion (9.6 billion US dollars), exceeding one percent of
the GDP for the first time. In the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (
1996-2000), budgetary spending for the same purpose will reach 450
billion yuan (54 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
China also values foreign capital for its environmental
protection drive. By the end of last year, China had successfully
drawn more than 3 billion US dollars of overseas investment and
signed cooperative contracts with 25 countries in the field of
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
It has become China's basic state policy to save natural
resources, protect the environment and realize sustainable
development. The National Ecological Environment Development Plan,
released by the State Council recently, once again demonstrates
that environmental protection has become a vital strategic step
for China in the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Museum of Stone Tablets Reopens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A museum containing a vast
array of stone tablets and carvings has reopened in this capital
city of northwest China's Shaanxi Province after a 10-month
renovation.
</P>
<P>
The remodeled design, covering an area of more than 900 square
meters, includes 97 exhibits, 19 of which were shown to visitors
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Among the exhibits are seven state-listed art treasures, such
as a stone horse carved in relief which was placed in the tomb of
Li Shimin, Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty (618-907 a.d.), and
a jade carving of Lao Zi, founder of the Taoism in China, during
the Spring and Autumn and Warning States period (770 b.c.-221 b.c.)
.
</P>
<P>
"This is the largest collection of high-grade indoor stone
carvings so far found in China. Many exhibits hold an important
position in the China's sculpture history," said a Chinese expert.
</P>
<P>
The original facility, built in the early 1960s, has received
more than 10 million visitors over the past 30 years.

<HEADLINE> Ignorance of Y2K Problem Revealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only 63 percent of those polled in a recent survey conducted by
the Horizon Market Research Corp. in 11 major cities could provide
a clear definition of the dangerous bug.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,500 residents from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou,
Chengdu and other cities took part in the survey.
</P>
<P>
About 8.4 percent of those polled said they had some rough idea
of the cause and potentially harmful effects of the problem, but
could not specify.
</P>
<P>
Other people came up with surprising explanations for the Y2K
problem that ranged from worms, viruses and fossils to corrupt
officials.
</P>
<P>
People with access to computers were better informed about the
millennium bug, the survey found. Out of all personal computer
owners who participated in the survey, more than 86 percent could
give a clear account of the problem as well as safety precaution
measures, displaying much higher than average Y2K knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Residents in the more developed southeastern coasts tend to
show greater interest in and understanding of the Y2K problem than
those in the inland cities, according to the survey. More than 77
percent of the respondents in Guangzhou could identify the cause
of the millennium bug, but the figure dropped to below 60 percent
in Zhengzhou of Henan Province and Wuhan of Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug, or the Year 2000 (Y2K) Problem threatens to
cause computer program failures and system breakdown from the
first day of next year when computer chips will not be able to
differentiate between the year 2000 with 1900.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the indifference of many residents towards the Y2K
problem, State departments are gearing up efforts to take safety
precautions.
</P>
<P>
To date, thorough checks have been carried out on computing
systems in key sectors including banking, securities, civil
aviation and power sectors, as well as the global system for
mobile communications networks to ensure that all the systems will
be Y2K-compliant.

<P>
HOHHOT, September 15 (Xinhua)-- A museum filled with
petroglyphs, or stone pictures, carved by local ethnic herdsmen
will open on October 1 at Baotou, in north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 petroglyphs are on display, depicting vividly the
life of local ethnic herding people living in different periods in
Chinese history. The museum is said to be the first of its kind in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Local experts said the herdsmen made the carvings as a way of
recording their lives and the activities of animals.
</P>
<P>
Some 30,000 stone pictures have been discovered in the
autonomous region. In recent years human activities and natural
wear and tear have endangered the pictures, Mayor Niu Yuru said.
</P>
<P>
Petroglyphs have been spotted extensively in northern,
northwestern and southwestern parts of China, especially in Inner
Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
The museum is part of the local government's effort to protect
the rare cultural relics, the mayor said.

<HEADLINE> One More Power Plant Goes Into Operation in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Ahlone Combined Cycle Power
Plant of the state-run Myanmar Electric Power Enterprise (MEPE)
was commissioned in the western Ahlone township of the capital
Tuesday, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The power plant with a capacity of 54 megawatts uses recycled
waste from three nearby 33-megawatt gas-fired turbines of the
Ahlone power station to generate 350 million kilowatt-hours of
electricity annually.
</P>
<P>
The plant is one of the two combined-cycle power plants
installed with the cooperation of the Marubeni Corporation of
Japan under a contract reached between the MEPE and the Japanese
company in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
The plant was installed at a cost of 27.71 million U.S. dollars
plus 649.77 million kyats (2.16 million dollars) and was completed
in July this year, three months ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
The other plant, the Hlawga plant in Mingaladon township in the
capital started operation in May this year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Minister of Electric Power Major-General Tin Htut said
while inaugurating the Ahlone plant that the country's power
consumption at present is 750 megawatts, up 127 percent from
1988's 330 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
He said plans are under way to implement more power projects in
view of the rising power demand in the country.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Launches Campaign to Promote Brown Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Public Health Ministry of
Thailand has launched a campaign urging health officials to
consume brown rice to set an example for the general public, The
Nation reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Health Minister Kamronna Lamphun was quoted as saying
brown rice had been consumed by Thais for many generations but was
later ignored as the country developed.
</P>
<P>
He said brown rice, with its nutritional richness, would
promote a healthy diet while at the same time saving energy.
</P>
<P>
Unlike white rice, which must be polished three times, brown
rice is polished just once to take off the husk.
</P>
<P>
Chatree Sumethavanit, deputy secretary-general of the ministry,
was also quoted as saying the ministry had given brown rice to
patients in some hospitals it controls.
</P>
<P>
He said the lifestyle of high consumption of fat, protein and
sugar with less fiber had put people at the risk of such illnesses
as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and cancer.
</P>
<P>
Brown rice contains a higher level of vitamins and minerals
than white rice, thus not only promoting efficient functioning of
the body but also helping prevent diseases such as colon cancer
and high blood pressure, Chatree said.

<HEADLINE> ADB Predicts 5-Percent GDP Growth for Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) has predicted a 5-percent gross domestic product (GDP)
growth for Sri Lanka in 1999 against 5.3 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said in its latest report "Asian Development Outlook"
that Sri Lanka's GDP growth was about 3.8 percent in real terms
during the first half of this year, against 5.3 percent in the
whole of 1998, due to slow growth in all sectors except mining and
quarrying.
</P>
<P>
However, Sri Lanka's GDP growth will pick up to 5 percent this
year because the private- and public-sector initiatives are likely
to be realized in the second half.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's central bank has forecast that GDP will grow by
about 4 percent in 1999 against 4.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said Sri Lanka has made concerted efforts for
developing the local debt market by introducing longer-term
marketable instruments including bond issues.
</P>
<P>
Revenue performance during the first half of 1999 improved,
particularly income tax, national security levy and excise duties,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Revenue is expected to recover to around 17.7 percent of GDP in
1999 from 17.3 percent the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The better management of public expenditure is expected to
contain the expenditure at 18 percent of GDP. The monitoring and
control of defense expenditure has also been strengthened.
</P>
<P>
The report added that an overall balance of payment surplus of
90 million U.S. dollars is expected due to foreign long-term
private and official capital inflows.

<HEADLINE> Thai Juvenile Court Sees Surge of Drug Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 38,400 young people
in Thailand were found guilty of drug charges and sent to
correctional institutes by the Central Juvenile and Family Court
last year, The Bangkok Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the youngsters came from communities and families
involved in drugs and were tempted by friends to try and finally
became drug addicts, the newspaper quoted Chief Justice Sompol
Sattayapithan as saying.
</P>
<P>
Those who became involved in the drug trade were mostly pushed
into it by their parents who knew the Central Juvenile and Family
Court rarely sentenced young people to jail, the chief justice
said.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, addicted young people were usually sent to serve
time at rehabilitation centers and those found guilty of dealing
in drugs went to observation and protection centers.
</P>
<P>
Most of these young people resumed using or dealing in drugs
upon returning to the same old environment which was conducive to
illegal activities, Sompol said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a total of 38,472 youngsters, 35,181 boys and 3,291
girls, were found guilty of drug charges, mostly involving
methamphetamines.
</P>
<P>
Sompol said the Central Juvenile and Family Court could not
find new places, jobs or schools for youngsters released from
observation centers because of limited funds.
</P>
<P>
In the case of repeat offenders, the court had no policy to
increase penalties because, according to the chief justice, this
was not the way to solve the problem.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. Officials Hail Jiang-Clinton Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to the
United States Li Zhaoxing Tuesday spoke highly of the meeting
between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and his U.S. counterpart
Bill Clinton in Auckland, New Zealand, on September 11.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is "positive, constructive, useful and very
significant," Li told a conference here on U.S.-China Relations on
the Eve of the 21st Century, sponsored by the Center for Strategic
and International Studies.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador expressed his hope that after the summit,
the two countries would overcome their setbacks and difficulties
and bring their important relationship back to a normal and sound
track.
</P>
<P>
Li said after Lee Teng-hui's "state-to-state" fallacy, the
relationship between China and the U.S. faced "the most dangerous
challenge."
</P>
<P>
He described it as a "positive thing" that just on the
following day after Lee pronounced this fallacy, Clinton had a
telephone call with Jiang, during which he reaffirmed America's
policy of recognizing only one China and the U.S. commitment to
the principles enshrined in the three joint communiques between
China and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
"We believe and hope that America will honor its commitment.
And on such principled basis our relationship can be assured of
having a sound and smooth-going development and continuous
improvement," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Democratic Senator Max Baucus
described the summit as "successful and responsible" and "an
important step towards substantive dialogs on issues of importance
to both sides."
</P>
<P>
"No unrealistic promises were made and (there is) no hyperbole
of the nature of the relationship," said Baucus.
</P>
<P>
David Dreier, a Republican Representative of House from
California, also said it is a "positive sign" for improvement of
America-China relations.
</P>
<P>
Dreier hoped that the two countries would soon strike a deal on
China's accession to the World Trade Organization after the
successful meeting between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Susan Shirk, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of
state on East Asian and Pacific affairs, said the meeting between
the two presidents has established a foundation for renewed
progress in the bilateral relationship.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides were determined to get back on track and make
progress," she said.

BANGKOK, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's life insurance
industry is reviving with its total premium in the first seven
months of this year growing 5.59 percent to 33.82 billion baht
(890 million U.S. dollars), The Nation reported Wednesday.

<P>
Prayuth Sangchan, director of the Thai Life Assurance
Association, was quoted as saying consumers were more interested
in buying life insurance policies now that their purchasing power
was stronger than it was last year.

Ordinary coverage had a lion's share of earnings in the sector,
accounting for 83.19 percent, which translates into 28.13 billion
baht (740 million dollars) or a 6.97-percent increase when
compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Industry insurance made up 12.33 percent of the total earning
at 4.17 billion baht (109 million dollars), up by 1.58 percent,
followed by group insurance at 4.47 percent of the total.

<HEADLINE> Thai Consumer Confidence Low Despite Recovery Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Despite forecast of an
economic recovery by various agencies, Thai consumers are still
reluctant to spend their money, a report from the Center for
Economic and Business Forecasting of the Thai Chamber of Commerce
University said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, which is available Wednesday, the
consumer confidence index measured by the forecasting center stood
at 67.4 points in August, down from 70.3 points in July.
</P>
<P>
The report said that while economic figures, particularly in
the manufacturing sector, indicated a gradual recovery, the income
levels remained static.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the index for employment prospects was down to 58.6
points from 61.2 and the index measuring the expected income in
the future stood at 78.1 compared with 83.2 a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The index has a full scale of 200 points, providing a snapshot
view of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Declining indicators, which measured the consumers' confidence
in the country's economy, reflect uncertainty about economic
recovery, center director Thanavath Phonvichai said in the report.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the drop in the consumer confidence index mainly
to a sharp rise in oil prices coupled with the weakened baht.
</P>
<P>
Local worries about the stability of the financial sector also
dampened the sentiment, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Politicians Express Support for One-China Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President
George Bush and other prominent figures Tuesday expressed their
support for the one-China policy, urging the authorities in Taiwan
not to attempt to change the formula.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing to the United
States, Bush said he would continue to support the one-China
policy and the principles adopted in the three joint Sino-U.S.
communiques, which China believes enshrine guiding principles for
Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Bush made the remarks at a time when the situation across the
Taiwan Straits grew tense after Taiwan's Lee Tenghui pronounced
the "special state-to-state relations" between Taiwan and the
Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Zbigniew Brzezinski, former presidential
national security advisor, told a conference on Sino-U.S.
relations at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (
CSIS) that the "two states" statement has its "political and geo-
political meaning."
</P>
<P>
"That formula is nothing less than an attempt to legitimate the
permanent division of China, to create a situation in which the
formula of one-China masking the reality of the existing division
while retaining formally the notion of single state is changed
into a formula in which there are separate states," he said.
</P>
<P>
"For the Chinese, to accept this formula would be to acquiesce
in the division of China," Brzezinski noted. "I do not believe
that we have the right to demand that."
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the demand by a group of U.S. politicians to
request the U.S. to "defend Taiwan." "It is an assault on the
formula that has maintained the stability of the American-Chinese
relations for more than a quarter of century."
</P>
<P>
"It goes beyond the Taiwan Relations Act formulated by Congress
on a bipartisan basis," Brzezinski added. "The Taiwan Act does not
constitute an automatic, unconditional commitment to defend Taiwan
no matter what the Taiwanese themselves decided to do."
</P>
<P>
Brzezinski also believes that the U.S. administration should
make it clear to the authorities in Taiwan that "sudden and
objectively provocative initiatives are not viewed with favor by
the United States."
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the CSIS meeting, Senator Max Baucus called
for no change of the relationship across the straits, which has
served the interests of Taiwan, the Chinese mainland and the
United States for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The one-China policy has served the People's Republic of China,
including Taiwan, the United States and the world very well for
over a quarter of a century, he said.

<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Kehui, Taiwan-born Vice-
Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) today urged that cross-
Straits negotiations begin as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, also chairman of the Central Committee of the Taiwan
Democratic Self-government League said, "I love Taiwan, I love
inland areas and I will love more a powerful and reunified
motherland."
</P>
<P>
The 71-year-old told Xinhua that he hoped the Taiwan
authorities would miss no opportunity to respond to President
Jiang Zemin's call for talks at an early date.
</P>
<P>
He said he will continue to lead the Taiwan Democratic Self-
government League in pushing forward cross-Straits exchanges and
the early realization of direct exchanges of mail delivery, trade
and shipping services.
</P>
<P>
Zhang was born in Changhua, Taiwan, and left in 1948 to study
at the Xiamen University in east China'sm Fujian Province.

Thirty-one years later, he was re-united with his parents and
other family members in Tokyo, Japan. His overjoyed mother
prepared dumplings made of glutinous rice wrapped in bamboo, all
ingredients from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In 1988 Zhang's younger brothers and sisters accompanied their
parents on a trip to inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan authorities did not allow him to return to Taiwan when
his mother died in 1992 because of his "special identity." However,
he was permitted to go to Taiwan for his father's funeral in 1993
after the Taiwan authorities succumbed to a strongly negative
public reaction.
</P>
<P>
Zhang joined the army after graduation from university, and
after the founding of New China in 1949, he was promoted from a
grassroots official in Fujian to vice-chairman of the CPPCC
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the biggest tragedy for the Chinese nation is
the separation of Taiwan and inland areas. "The tragedy should be
ended in our generation," he said.

LHASA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to increase

Autonomous Region has started testing modern methods of government
purchases in Shannan Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
A number of musical instruments costing 300,000 yuan (about 36,

<P>
Tendering documents were sent to 10 suppliers, five of which

<P>
After its pilot purchase in Shannan, the government procurement
system, via open tendering and bidding, is expected to be adopted

<HEADLINE> Australian Aircraft Ready for Food Drops to E.Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Australian aircraft are
ready to begin food drops to starving refugees in East Timor but
final details have yet to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
"At this stage we don't know when they are going to happen," a
government source said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There are a few issues still to be decided, including flight
approvals from Indonesia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing everything we can to prepare for the drops as
soon as possible and as safely as possible," he added.
</P>
<P>
The source said security was an obvious concern for the
flights, as was the mountainous terrain and the risk that food may
not reach those in need.
</P>
<P>
It was hoped that the food drops could start Thursday following
Indonesia's in-principle permission for drops in the mountains of
East Timor, where tens of thousands of displaced people have taken
refuge, some reportedly surviving on roots and leaves.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government aid coordination group AusAID has
stockpiled tons of food and medical supplies in a 1,500
square-meter warehouse leased near Darwin airport in northern
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard said Tuesday discussions were
proceeding between the government and AusAID on how the drops
could be conducted.
</P>
<P>
Further talks are also continuing between the United Nations
and Indonesian officials to determine flight clearances.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Authorizes Force for East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council early Wednesday morning unanimously adopted a resolution
authorizing the establishment of a multi-national force to restore
peace and security in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Citing Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter which allows the use of
force, the council "determined that the present situation in East
Timor constitutes a threat to peace and security", according to
the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The council welcomes the expressed commitment of Indonesia to
cooperate with the multinational force in all aspects of the
implementation of its mandate and looks forward to close
coordination between the force and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The force under a unified command structure is mandated also to
protect and support the U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) in
carrying out its tasks following the August 30 referendum which
showed preference of East Timor's independence over its special
autonomy within Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The council agrees that the force should collectively be
deployed in East Timor until replaced as soon as possible by a U.N.
peace-keeping operation. Its expenses will be borne by the
participating states.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was endorsed after two days of intensified
consultations of the 15 Security Council members on the details of
the plan.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan who met with Foreign
Ministers of Indonesia, Portugal and Australia Tuesday, said he
hopes that an advance contingent could be on the ground in East
Timor by the weekend "at the latest".
</P>
<P>
Since the result of East Timor ballot was announced on
September 4, violence has taken place in the former Portuguese
colony which was integrated by Indonesia in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer wrote to Annan
Tuesday that Australia would accept the leadership of the
multinational force, as requested by Annan and it is prepared to "
make a substantial contribution" to the force.

<HEADLINE> China's First Large-Scale Hydropower Station Left Behind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Though squeezed out of China
's top 50 power stations, the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station, the
country's first large-scale power plant built by Chinese, is still
the pride of the local people.
</P>
<P>
"As the first landmark in hydropower development in New China,
it has played and is still playing a major role in fueling the
local economy," said Yu Zhiqun, the station's director.
</P>
<P>
The station was built in the 1950s, when the country suffered a
severe shortage of electricity, on the Xin'an River in the western
part of Zhejiang Province in east China.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few decades, the station, with 662,500 kilowatts
in installed capacity, has generated 60.2 billion kwh of
electricity and impounded 146 flood peaks, while acting as an
example for hydropower development, station management, and
resettlement of people in reservoir areas.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it formed a huge reservoir with 1,078 islands, which
is part of a golden tourist route linking Hangzhou, provincial
capital of Zhejiang, and Mount Huangshan in neighboring Anhui
Province.
</P>
<P>
The reservoir, now called Qiandao Lake, hosts millions of
domestic and overseas tourists annually.
</P>
<P>
An upgrading project was launched in October 1997 to
computerize the power station's equipment and raise its installed
capacity to 810,000 kw by the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
However, it will be left further behind anyway, as a series of
new power stations are being built including the Ertan Hydro-
electric Power Station, which will have six generating units each
with a capacity of 550,000 kw, and the mammoth Three Gorges
hydropower project which will have a total installed capacity of
20.9 million kw and a projected yearly production of more than 100
billion kwh of electricity.
</P>
<P>
"But we'll always be proud of the Xin'anjiang Hydropower
Station because it has laid a foundation for New China's power
industry," Yu said.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Symposium on Industrial Restructuring in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province, which used to be China's industrial heartland, is
hosting a three-day international symposium on its industrial
transformation and restructuring in this capital city.
</P>
<P>
About 100 government and provincial officials, economists, and
entrepreneurs as well as representatives from several European
countries are attending the meeting, which began on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The symposium will discuss problems and solutions during
Liaoning's industrial transition period, and analyze the systems
of European countries to seek better trade cooperation between
Liaoning and Europe.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement to the symposium, Vice Minister of
Science and Technology Xu Guanhua said that Liaoning Province was
China's earliest heavy-industry base and has contributed a great
deal to the country and the world.
</P>
<P>
But now Liaoning must learn from the experiences of other
provinces and developed countries as it goes through industrial
transformation and restructuring, he said.
</P>
<P>
A representative from the Euro-China Cooperation and
Development Center said that European countries are concerned
about the province's industrial restructuring and are willing to
work with their Chinese counterparts to find solutions and the
proper path.
</P>
<P>
The symposium is jointly organized by China's Ministry of
Science and Technology, the Development Research Center of the
State Council, the Liaoning Provincial government, and the Euro-
China Cooperation and Development Center.

<HEADLINE> Exhibition of Golden Age of Chinese Archaeology Opens in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Golden Age of Chinese
Archaeology, a landmark exhibition of the most important
archeological discoveries of China in the last 50 years, opened at
the National Gallery of Art in Washington Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Present at the opening ceremony were over 500 people, including
Chinese Ambassador to the United States Li Zhaoxing, Director
General of State Administration of Cultural Heritage of China
Zhang Wenbin, U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley, high-
ranking officials of the U.S. Department of State and Department
of Treasury as well as some U.S. Congressmen.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will provide people with a unique opportunity to
see masterpieces dating from 5000 B.C. to the 10th century A.D. (
the Neolithic through the feudal Song dynasty).
</P>
<P>
Over 230 pieces of works on show were excavated from various
archaeological sites since the founding of the People's Republic
of China in 1949, including almost 100 objects unearthed in the
1980s and 1990s alone. Many were found in tombs and were probably
created for use during the lifetime of the deceased as well as for
the afterlife. Representing the earliest and best of each category,
many have never been exhibited before in the United States or
outside China.
</P>
<P>
The Golden Age of Chinese Archaeology is a sequel to the
exhibition of Chinese archaeological finds at the National Gallery
of Art in 1974. The current exhibition, which covers a great range
of ancient Chinese cultures, shows that Chinese civilization and
art did not originate at a specific time or place, as previously
believed, but developed from the interaction and assimilation
among various cultures that flourished concurrently all over China.
</P>
<P>
At the dinner to mark the opening of the exhibition, Chinese
Ambassador Li said the exhibition will promote the understanding
between the peoples of China and the United States and enhance the
friendship of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Robert Smith, president and trustee of the National Gallery of
Art, said that the discipline of archaeology reveals to the
American people the history and the spirit of a people. "The
exquisite works we have seen tonight bear witness to the very
ancient and brilliant civilization of China, and enlarge greatly
our understanding of both the history and the spirit of the
Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
The fact that these beautiful objects have all been found,
preserved and studied since the founding of the People's Republic
of China in 1949 is a remarkable achievement, justifying the title
"The Golden Age of Chinese Archaeology," and marking this great
exhibition a most fitting celebration of the cultural heritage of
the People's Republic of China, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which will end on January 2, 2000, was jointly
sponsored by the State Administration of Cultural Heritage of
China, the National Gallery of Art and the Nelson-Atkins Museum of
Art in Kansas City of the United States.
</P>
<P>
After its showing at the National Gallery of Art, the
exhibition will be on display in Houston from February 13 through
May 7, 2000, and in San Francisco from June 17 through September
11, 2000.

which comprises the Continental Group, Dutch airline KLM, Italy's
Alitalia, Kenya Airways, KLM U.K. and Eurowings.
</P>
<P>
The Wings operates a combined fleet of more than 1,000 aircraft
carrying 165 million passengers between some 60 destinations.
</P>
<P>
The eight-year agreement between Northwest and CY will link
Cyprus to U.S. destinations while allowing the American airline
access to CY's extensive routes into the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"This is not only an important day for Cyprus Airways but it is
also an important one for Northwest Airlines as we now enter into
this very extensive partnership with CY," said Douglas Birdsall,
senior vice president of alliances at Northwest.
</P>
<P>
"Despite being the fourth largest in the world, Northwest has
heretofore not had a significant presence in the eastern
Mediterranean. Our partnership with CY will provide us with more
extensive travel opportunities to a major region in the world," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Northwest has a fleet of 419 aircraft and operates more than
1,700 flights a day to 150 destinations, carrying some 50 million
passengers and accruing revenues of 9 billion U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Northwest is the first American carrier that has chosen to
have its code used on services to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
CY has an extensive route network into the Middle East,
despite its small fleet of 12 Airbuses. The fact that the fleet is
one of the youngest in the world is a determining factor for
Northwest, Birdsall said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also includes cooperation on promoting holiday
packages in the U.S. and Cyprus, a frequent flyer program, common
advertising and cargo handling.

<HEADLINE> Booming Postal Sector Amid China's Economic Growth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- China's rapid economic
growth has upgraded the country's postal facilities to a level
that now matches any country in the world, said Thomas Leavey,
general director of the International Bureau of the Universal
Postal Union (UPU).
</P>
<P>
China's postal sector has grown at an average rate of nearly
nine percent in recent years, far above the world average of three
percent.
</P>
<P>
Xia Lixin of the State Post Bureau (SPB) said this sector has
never before been more challenged.
</P>
<P>
One veteran postman, Gong Benyu, has been in the postal service
for 26 years in the city of Linjiang in northeast China's Jilin
Province and has walked 220,000 kilometers delivering letters.
</P>
<P>
However, with telephones and other modern telecommunications
facilities now widely used, traditional mail service is undergoing
a sharp decline these days. In 1998, ordinary mail service
accounted for only ten percent of the total postal earnings in
China.
</P>
<P>
As Xia put it, the ever-increasing demands of customers can
only be met by innovations in the postal service.
</P>
<P>
China's Express Mail Service (EMS) reported earnings of 20,000
yuan when first introduced in 1980. This figure rose swiftly to
exceed 3.1 billion yuan in 1998, equal to that of ordinary mail
service.

Ma Ye, a man from Qinghai Province in the northwest who is
doing business in Beijing, told Xinhua that it took more than one
month for a parcel to travel from Qinghai to Beijing a couple of
dozen years ago.
</P>
<P>
Now, it only takes one day to deliver his sample commodities
from Guangzhou to Beijing via EMS, and the journey from Lhasa to
Beijing takes three days. "It is worthwhile to pay the fee," he
said, "it saves me so much time, which is dearer to me."
</P>
<P>
At present, the postal savings service, philately, EMS, and
newspaper and periodical distribution account for 86 percent of
China's postal earnings.
</P>
<P>
In addition, postal bureaus in major cities have been linked to
the Internet, which will bring faster and more efficient services
to customers.
</P>
<P>
Some tens of billions of yuan are being poured into developing
a modern postal service network across the country each year.
</P>
<P>
China's capital Beijing now provides around-the-clock services
for customers via Internet, and self-service post offices,
according to Xia Lixin.
</P>
<P>
"The promising economic growth has brought about huge potential
in China's postal market," said Leavey, adding that it will become
the world's largest market in the next century.
</P>
<P>
The UPU made China the host country for its 22nd Congress, and
has selected the country to chair the Council of Administration (
CA) of the UPU for the next five-year term, thanks to China's
important status in the international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
Leavey also expects a more important role for China in
international postal service as the country becomes stronger in
terms of its economy and international standing.

<HEADLINE> Western Pacific Polio-Free: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Western Pacific region is
virtually "poliomyelitis-free" as no new cases have been reported
since March 1997, a top official of the World Health Organization
(WHO) said Wednesday in Manila.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, Dr. Shigeru Omi, WHO Western Pacific
regional director, said credit goes to the high quality
surveillance of WHO member states, including the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"The quality of surveillance has been maintained at the highest
level throughout the region and the transmission of wild polio
virus has finally been interrupted," Omi said.
</P>
<P>
He noted, however, "this will not yet be the end of the story
of poliomyelitis eradication."
</P>
<P>
Omi said the region has to "maintain surveillance for acute
flaccid paralysis (AFP) until global certification, in order to
guard against re-introduction of imported wild polio virus."
</P>
<P>
The last polio case in the region was a 15-month-old Cambodian
girl, identified on March 19, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The WHO launched the polio eradication initiative in 1988, with
a resolve to abolish it by year 2000.
</P>
<P>
WHO's partners in the program include the United Nations
Children's Fund, the governments of Australia, Japan, South Korea,
the United States and some non-governmental organizations.

<HEADLINE> North China City Boosts Mobile Telecommunications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Tianjin Municipality in
north China set up a mobile telecom bureau as part of its ongoing
reform of the port city's telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
Li Yue, head of the bureau, said there are over 700,000 mobile
phones in the city, or 8.2 per hundred, three percent more than
the country's average.
</P>
<P>
The capacity of the mobile phone network in the city has
increased to 1.1 million from 1,500 in 1989, and has established
cooperative relationships with over 300 cities and areas in the
country, and some 50 companies in 33 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The mobile telecom system has now expanded its services in
diverting calls and sending and receiving short information in
English and Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the city was among the first to have introduced
competition into the telecom industry, and now both the Tianjin
Mobile Telecom Bureau and the Tianjin Branch of China Unicom are
engaged in the sector.
</P>
<P>
He added that China has in the past few months divided the
telecom and post services, and plans to separate the telecom
industry into four parts: a fixed network, mobile telecom,
wireless paging, and satellite telecom, to inspire further
development in this field.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there were over 25 million mobile phones
in the country by the end of last year, and this figure is
expected to exceed 40 million next year, with the demand for this
year at about 15 million. The three top mobile phone dealers in
the Chinese market are Motorola, Nokia, and Ericsson.

<P>
NAIROBI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is committed to give
investors a safe and secure environment to make initial
investments and continue ploughing back profits for expansion,
Kenyan Minister of Finance Chris Okemo has said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the need to maintain an open and pragmatic approach
to investors, Kenya joined the Multilateral Investments Guarantee
Agency, the People daily newspaper Wednesday quoted the minister
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Okemo made the remarks during a recent signing of an agreement
here on the promotion and protection of investments between Kenya,
Britain and Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
He noted that to support investment, his government is taking
major reforms to restructure the economy and reduce involvement
of the public sector in those activities and services which the
private sector can provide better.
</P>
<P>
"We are now focusing on improved governance including reforms
in the procurement process, accounting and financial management
among other measures," the minister said, adding that in so doing
Kenya may call upon its development partners for both technical
and financial support.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment in the next millennium would be the
driving force for high and sustainable growth in the country,
which must be complemented by local savings, the minister added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The first Asia-Europe Science
and Technology Minister's Meeting will be held here between on
October 14 and 15 for joint efforts to trigger overall scientific
cooperation among Asian and European countries, the Ministry of
Science and Technology announced here today.
</P>
<P>
"A wide range of subjects are expected to be discussed at the
meeting. They include cooperation principles, mechanisms, and
priority areas," said Wang Shaoqi, director of the international
cooperation department of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
He added that the meeting will also discuss a series of
subjects on the sustainable economic and social development of the
participating countries, ranging from agro-technology to basic
research.
</P>
<P>
China has taken part in two preparatory meetings in Beijing and
Brussels, respectively, where the procedures, subjects and
documents for the meeting were established.
</P>
<P>
The European Union and more than 20 countries will send
delegations led by their science ministers to the meeting, Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
At the second Asia-Europe Leader's Meeting held in London in
April 1998, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji called on participant
countries to take concrete measures to strengthen their scientific
cooperation and hold a science minister's meeting in due time.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu said at that time that China would like to host the
gathering in 1999, and this idea was widely accepted by the Asia-
Europe countries, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out that the meeting will further tap Asia-Europe
cooperation potential, extend exchange channels, and set up an
effective cooperation mechanism to "create a positive impact on
Asia-Europe scientific cooperation in the 21st century."

front of political clients. I wanted it to be silent and calm."
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- The debates within the European Union (EU) concerning
Turkey's candidacy are gaining motive following the visit of
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem to Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"A positive development is possible. But I do not want to talk
about big outcomes," Cem said in an apparent reference to the
widely-expected declaration of Turkey's candidacy at the EU
summit scheduled to be held in Helsinki, Finland, in December.

JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Syria is sparing no expense in developing a new
longer-range, surface-to-surface missile that will put all of
Israel in range, Israeli sources said.
</P>
<P>
The new missile, a derivative of Scud C, is expected to be
ready in six months to a year. Once deployed, the missiles could
be tipped with non-conventional warheads and would be able to
strike at Israel from deep inside Syrian territory.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Shas leader Eli Yishai met late Tuesday night with Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and top education and financial officials in
an effort to reach an agreement on transferring funds to Shas's
deficit-ridden school system, but the all day negotiations had
failed to resolve the situation.
</P>
<P>
The main obstacle was the demand by Education Ministry and
treasury officials that Shas agrees to implement a radical reform
plan, including the closing of small untenable classes.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak has reportedly held talks with Abu Mazen, Palestinian
National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat's deputy, on the final
status negotiations. The prime minister's office has swiftly
denied the reports.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- A survey in Shas showed that 85 percent of Shas supporters
wanted Ariel Deri, the former party leader who was convicted of
corruption and bribe-taking, to return to the leadership.
</P>
<P>
Deri resigned from his post after the May election to pave way
for the party to join the coalition of Barak. But Shas has been at
odds with educational and financial ministries for the last few
days over the government funding of Shas school system.

LUSAKA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Illegal sex practices among
Zambians have been blamed for the rapid spreading of HIV/AIDS,
Zambian newspaper, The Post, reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Over 80 percent of the married men in Zambia are involved in
extra- marital sexual affairs, the paper quoted a study carried
out by the Department of Mass Communication as saying.
</P>
<P>
The study revealed most of the married men questioned in a wide
survey were maintaining more than one or more sexual partners
besides their wives.
</P>
<P>
The study was on the common practices among Zambians that had
brought about the spread of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
It showed that polygamous marriages had also played a role in
spreading HIV/AIDS, with wives questioned saying sometimes the
epidemic was being brought into the family by the new wife.
</P>
<P>
The study noted that the inheritance of wives by the dead
husband's brother put them at risk of contracting diseases.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu May Face Bribery Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police are opening
an investigation of former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on
suspicions that he received bribes and misused public funds,
Israel's media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A senior police source told Israel News Agency (Itim) Tuesday
night that both Netanyahu and his wife Sara will have to be
interrogated to hear their explanations regarding the charges.
</P>
<P>
The case broke Tuesday when local Hebrew paper Yediot Aharonot
ran a promotion of its own investigation into Netanyahu's dealings.
</P>
<P>
According to the daily, Netanyahu received various domestic
maintenance and home renovation services from Avner Amedi, a
58-year-old Jerusalem businessman who owns a maintenance company.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Amedi's company supplied Netanyahus with
a variety of services during his term as prime minister, but Amedi
neither requested nor received any payment for the services, which
carried out not only at the prime minister's office, but at the
couple's home and their official residence.
</P>
<P>
According to the story, when Netanyahu lost the May election,
Amedi presented the Prime Minister's Office a bill for 440,000
Shekels (about 100,000 U.S. dollars). The Treasury authorized
payment to him only 12,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report said Netanyahu claimed he never asked Amedi to carry
out work for him.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Amedi on Tuesday on suspicion of having bribed
Netanyahu and the Tel Aviv Magistrate Court remanded him for two
days.

CANBERRA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Australia has more than 19
million hectares of land waiting to play host to plantations and
farm forestry, the country's chief commodities forecaster
Wednesday said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics
(ABARE) has identified parts of Western Australia, Tasmania and
the Green Triangle region of South Australia and Victoria as
suitable for plantations.
</P>
<P>
"The total land suitable for plantation development in all the
regions covered in this study is estimated at just over 19 million
hectares," the ABARE said.
</P>
<P>
Developing plantations could provide thousands more jobs
throughout Australia, the bureau said in the report on the Forest
Plantations on Cleared Agricultural Land in Australia.
</P>
<P>
ABARE acting executive director Vivek Tulpule said the report
showed the significant economic potential of plantations and farm
forestry.
</P>
<P>
He said the aim of the study was to raise the profile of
plantations by providing data to governments, industry and
landowners interested in developing plantations.
</P>
<P>
Australia already has 1.2 million hectares of plantations.

<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- With approval from the People
's Bank of China, the China Export and Import Bank (Eximbank)
successfully issued three billion yuan (about 360 million U.S.
dollars) in two-year financial bonds through public bidding over
the past several days.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time this year Eximbank has issued policy
financial bonds through public bidding, with the latest at a
tendered interest rate of 2.91 percent.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Eximbank said the new issue carries a fixed
interest rate to be paid annually, and the principal will be
repaid when it becomes due.
</P>
<P>
He said that since its founding five years ago, Eximbank has
established an effective risk-preventing mechanism in extending
loans, and that the quality of the bank's credit assets remains
high, and the principal and interest of mature financial bonds
have all been paid, ensuring the rights and interests of creditors.
</P>
<P>
Since October 1998, Eximbank has issued financial bonds through
public bidding on four occasions, effectively cutting fund-raising
costs for the bank.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that most of the bank's loans will be
granted in the second half of this year, and that to ensure the
sufficient supply of credit capital, Eximbank will issue
additional financial bonds before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Eximbank will launch a wider variety of
financial bonds with different terms to cater to the needs of
different investors, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Continues to Ban Pyramid Schemes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A notice released recently by
the Public Security Office under China's Ministry of Public
Security asked police at all levels in China to continue the
prohibition of pyramid schemes.
</P>
<P>
All public security sections should keep a close watch on all
kinds of pyramid-type sales, including disguised forms, while
making their daily rounds, the notice said.
</P>
<P>
They should work with departments of Industry and Commerce to
fight against pyramid sales and ban them to prevent their revival.
Sever punishment should be imposed on those engaging in fraudulent
and superstitious activities, and criminal responsibility should
be defined in these cases, according to the notice.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Public Security said that
pyramid sales were abolished by the "Notice on Prohibition of
Pyramid Sales" released by the State Council last April.
</P>
<P>
"However," said the official, "these schemes in disguised forms,
such as sales promotions and sales in chain stores have recently
appeared in some areas. And they seem to be spreading."
</P>
<P>
These schemes not only cheat many people, causing them to
suffer losses, but also affect social order and stability, he
added.

here today."

<P>
"We look forward to working with regional and other countries
to build a genuinely multinational force that will, as an interim
measure, help bring the United Nations' mandated tripartite
process back on track until such time as a United Nations
peacekeeping operation can be deployed," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Australia is working with other contributors to ensure the
earliest possible arrival of the force," he added.
</P>
<P>
Before the U.N. Security Council mandated the multinational
force Wednesday, Downer told journalists the initial deployments
of an Australian-led force could be on the ground by the weekend.

<P>
JINAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
found the fossilized remains of a mammoth elephant dating back one
million years at the bottom of a river in Zhucheng City of
Shandong Province, east China.
</P>

They estimate that the elephant lived during the period between
2.6 million and one million years ago.
</P>
<P>
The giant creature belongs to a class of ancient elephant that
appeared on earth three million years ago, and disappeared 10,000
years ago. The fossils of such elephants were first discovered in
India.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Host MENA Meeting If Peace Prevails: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is ready to host an
international conference next year to discuss Middle East economic
cooperation, the country's foreign minister has said in remarks
published on the Egyptian Gazette newspaper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a possibility for Egypt to host the conference
next year after the revival of the Palestinian, Syrian and
Lebanese peace tracks," Amr Moussa told reporters Tuesday on the
fringes of an economic meeting in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Moussa was referring to the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
Economic Conference aimed at boosting Arab-Israeli cooperation.
The annual conference kicked off in 1994 in Morocco. It was not
held in 1998 and 1999 due to the deadlock in the Middle East peace
process triggered by the hardline policy of former Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, meanwhile, conditioned the conference on progress of
the Arab-Israeli peace talks. "If there is no peace (in the Middle
East) there will be no (MENA) conference," he said.
</P>
<P>
"That's why Egypt was not interested in hosting or attending
the conference over the past three years," the foreign minister
was quoted as saying by the English-language newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Egypt alongside a number of Arab countries boycotted the 1997
session in the Qatari capital of Doha to protest the intransigence
of Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
After the new Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, took office
in early July, optimism prevails for the peace process. Israel has
begun carrying out the revised Wye peace accord signed early this
month. The Palestinians and Israel started the final status talks
on Monday to discuss thorny issues including Jerusalem,
Palestinian statehood and the refugee issue.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Syria and Israel have been stalled for
more than three years due to disputes over the Golan Heights
captured by Israel from Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. The
two sides have expressed readiness to resume talks.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Explores Markets in Middle East, Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has reported progress
in its efforts to explore markets in the Middle East and Africa.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Ministry of Trade expects the country's 1999 exports
to the Middle East and Africa to soar to 500 million U.S. dollars
from some 350 million dollars last year, the business newspaper
The Saigon Times Daily said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Southwest Asia and Africa Department of Vietnam's
Ministry of Trade Vu Thi Them said Vietnam could achieve this
target due to increasing food and engine shipments to the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's exports to Africa were usually through aid programs,
she said. The 1999 export sales to this market would probably be
at most a meager 30 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government recently permitted the Ministry of
Trade to open representative offices in Dubai of the United Arab
Emirates and South Africa to promote trade.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is also planning to ask the government for
permission to open representative offices in Senegal and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
She said the ministry is finalizing the required procedures to
enable the two offices to commence operation early next year.

<HEADLINE> Adapt or Perish, Gulf Family Businesses Told </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Family businesses in the
Gulf have been advised to adapt to the changes that will be
brought about by the World Trade Organization (WTO) regulations,
or else face severe competition because of the soon-to-emerge new
global economic order.
</P>
<P>
"If you are adaptive, you will survive. If not, Gulf businesses
will not be able to stand on their feet," Mishal Hamed Kanoo,
deputy chairman of the Dubai-based Kanoo Group, was quoted by the
Gulf News daily as saying on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Forget the idea that the government will protect you," Kanoo
said. He added that Gulf businesses should not take it for granted
that foreign companies would sign cooperative contracts with them
in their favor.
</P>
<P>
Gulf businesses must "think of a partnership where both parties
benefit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kanoo estimated that in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), between
75 to 85 percent of economy is controlled by family enterprises,
which are protected by the government.
</P>
<P>
Besides reducing dependence on protection from government, as
ways to adapt to WTO regulations, Kanoo suggested the ushering in
of top-level management practices.
</P>
<P>
"Get the best management techniques and also pay for it. In
addition, change the way you run your business," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Gulf businesses should learn to add value
to their economies rather than gain from the system.
</P>
<P>
Except Oman and Saudi Arabia, all the Gulf Cooperation Council
states, namely the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain, are members of
the WTO, with family enterprises likely to control business worth
over 300 billion U.S. dollars, Kanno said.
</P>
<P>
Family businesses are the main generators of gross domestic
product (GDP) in most Gulf economies and also the main providers
of employment," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard Wednesday welcomed the United Nations Security Council
authorization of an multinational force in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"It is an historic resolution, it is a major hurdle cleared,"
he told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
"Australia has accepted leadership of the multinational force,"
he said. "The speed with which the Security Council has acted is
very impressive."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council Wednesday authorized an multinational
force to move into East Timor to restore peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Howard said Australia wanted to see the multinational force in
East Timor as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He expected cooperation between the multinational force and the
Indonesian military as Australia took the leadership role.
</P>
<P>
He also believed that "there will be ... a very significant
element of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
participation."
</P>
<P>
Australia did not intend to have joint exercises with
contributing nations such as the United States before deployment
into East Timor, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he hoped the food drops to East Timor would commence
as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We're keen to make food drops: It remains our hope that we can
make them in the next day or two depending upon the sort of
assurances and clearances we get," he said.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he would travel to northern Australian city of
Darwin to see off the Australian troops whenever they leave for
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Leader Kim Beazley would also be asked to
participate in the farewell, he added.

<HEADLINE> China's Insurance Market In Better Order (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- China has seen much better
order in its insurance agent market, thanks to a six-month
rectification campaign, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission
(CIRC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
CIRC chairman Ma Yongwei told a meeting here that the watchdog
commission implemented a review of all part-time agents' licenses,
71,000 of which were applied for, but only 59,000 were granted
renewals.
</P>
<P>
The CIRC carried out a full investigation into the illegal
activities of overseas insurance intermediaries and their
representatives in China.
</P>
<P>
According to its estimate, these firms earned more than 400
million yuan (about 48.3 million U.S. dollars) from illegal
businesses in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Two overseas firms, the Sedgwick Insurance &AMP; Risk Management
Consultants (China) Ltd. and the Jardine Insurance Brokers Limited
paid a high price for their illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
Sedgwick was closed for three months, while Jardine's Beijing
representative office was closed permanently.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland's Parliament Rejects Proposed Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- In a major setback for
AIDS control in Swaziland, the House of Assembly has thrown out
the proposed Public Health Bill on the pretext that further
consultation is needed, Business Day newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The legislation was 10 years in the making and resulted from
extensive consultation with doctors, nurses, hospital
administrators and even traditional healers, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Privately, some members of parliament admitted they were
personally put off by the bill's proposal that the immediate
families of AIDS sufferers be notified that they have contracted
the fatal disease.
</P>
<P>
Health and Social Welfare Minister Phetsile Dlamini said
because AIDS patients did not divulge their condition to anyone,
sexual partners are put at risk and families waste money seeking
treatment for the undisclosed malady.
</P>
<P>
In rejecting the legislation, members of parliament appeared to
be displaying a national phobia of acknowledging the AIDS disease,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Though a study by the United Nations estimates one-third of
Swazis are infected with the HIV virus that leads to AIDS, the
Health Ministry put the figure at 22.5 percent and only less than
a dozen people have publicly admitted their condition.

During the rectification campaign, more than 800 people were
punished for rule violations, and eight will be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
A number of other companies were also penalized for breaking
regulatory rules.
</P>
<P>
All the individual agents were ordered to sign new agency
contracts with their insurance firms.
</P>
<P>
The watchdog commission also unified the prices of all
intermediate businesses.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma Yongwei, the campaign has resulted in a
remarkable decrease in illegal activities and a major improvement
in the insurance market.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that the rectification of the market will be
a long and painstaking job and that measures must be taken to
prevent a recurrence of illegal activities after the campaign.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that in the next stage, the commission will
investigate the 70,000-odd rural insurance agents, who will also
be re-registered.
</P>
<P>
The chairman disclosed that they are working on a package of
new measures to promote the development of insurance in China,
including the intermediary sector.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China's insurance intermediary sector is still
underdeveloped and cannot satisfy market needs, Ma said the CIRC
will grant licenses to a number of specialized intermediary
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of specialized intermediaries will help
optimize the distribution of resources, improve the efficiency of
the insurance market, and serve the insured better, he added.

<HEADLINE> China's Longest Expressway Operational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A 650-km-long expressway in
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region opened to traffic
today, running from the famous tourist city of Guilin to the port
city of Beihai.
</P>
<P>
With a total investment of 10.6 billion yuan, the expressway,
the longest in the country, crosses eight cities and l0 counties
and has four to six two-way lanes with a width of 15-21 meters,
and speed limits of 80-120 kmh.
</P>
<P>
The Guilin-Beihai expressway was started in 1993, and is 300 km
longer than the Shenyang-Dalian Expressway in Liaoning Province,
and the Jinan-Qingdao Expressway in Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Huang Zhendong, the Minister of Communications, said that this
expressway will help both social and economic development in the
heavily populated region.
</P>
<P>
The Guilin-Liuzhou section of the expressway was completed in
May last year, and it can handle 4,000 to 5,000 vehicles per day.
Every year, this section takes about 600,000 passengers to tourism
sites and economic zones in Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
The expressway will cut the trip from Guilin to Beihai to 6
hours, and is expected to increase the region's GDP by 4 billion
yuan annually, Huang said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Accepts Australia Leadership in Peacekeeping Force to E.Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Defense
Forces (TNI) said Wednesday it can accept Australia leading the
multinational force to East Timor if it is the decision of the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"If God is willing, TNI and all the Indonesian people will
accept the (U.N.) decision because Indonesia should put themselves
as part of the international community," TNI spokesman Maj. Gen.
Sudrajat said here.
</P>
<P>
In New York, the U.N. Security Council Wednesday morning
unanimously adopted a resolution authorizing the establishment of
a multinational force to restore peace and security in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The force under a unified command structure is mandated to
protect and support the U.N. Assistance Mission in East Timor
(UNAMET) in carrying out its tasks after the August 30 direct
ballot which showed preference of East Timor's independence over
its special autonomy within Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he hopes that an advance
contingent could be on the ground in East Timor by the weekend "at
the latest."
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the decision, Australian Prime Minister John Howard
Wednesday said his country has accepted leadership of the
multinational force.
</P>
<P>
Since the result of the East Timor ballot was announced on
September 4, violence has taken place in the former Portuguese
colony which was integrated by Indonesia in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the Information Task Force of the East Timor
Military Emergency Region Lt. Col. Willem Wednesday said the
condition in East Timor, particularly in Dili, the capital, now
was much better and safer compared to that before the martial law
was declared on September 7.
</P>
<P>
However, the Antara News Agency Wednesday reported from Dili
that gunfire was still being heard, particularly at night, and
arson still occurred.

<P>
COLOMBO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- At least 21 Tamil rebels
were killed Tuesday in separate clashes in the Northern Province
of Sri Lanka, a military spokesman here said Wednesday.
</P>

The spokesman said government troops conducted a limited
operation with the objective of destroying identified terrorist
positions Tuesday morning in general area Paranthan.
</P>
<P>
During the confrontation, two armor tanks were slightly damaged
due to rebel mortar fire. According to reports of the troops, at
least 11 Tamil rebels were killed and more than 30 others were
seriously injured in this operation, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day in east of Kandavalai, the spokesman said
troops observed a group of rebels and a double cab moving from
north to south and directed artillery fire. The troops confirmed
that four rebels were killed and the double cab was destroyed by
artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
Government troops operating ahead of defenses confronted a
group of Tamil rebels, killing five rebel cadres around 5:00 p.m.
Tuesday in general area Oddusuddan, said the spokesman, adding
that Tuesday afternoon in south of Pallamadu, troops operating
ahead of defenses killed one rebel.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting a war against the
government for a separate Tamil state in the north and south of
the island country since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Stocks Fall Sharply </HEADLINE>

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Attorney-General to Appeal Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Attorney-General's
Office intends to appeal to the Supreme Court against the
effective six-month jail term imposed on the three Americans
which it said had trivialized the seriousness of the crime.
</P>
<P>
The daily Herald reported on Wednesday that the three Americans
were arrested on March 7 this year at the Harare International
Airport and convicted for illegal possession of weapons and
attempting to take them on board an aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The Attorney-General Patrick Chinamasa said in a statement on
Tuesday the sentence handed down by High Court judge Justice Adam
on Monday " induces a sense of shock and outrage in the minds of
all right-thinking people".
</P>
<P>
He said the three Americans -- Garry Blanchard, Joseph
Pettijohn and John Dixon -- were convicted of offences which were
treated as serious by all civilized countries worldwide, including
the United States, which was in the forefront of fighting
terrorism and gun running.
</P>
<P>
"By imposing sentences which do not match the seriousness of
the offences, Judge Adam has in effect trivialized crimes of
unlawful possession of arms and has seriously erred in doing so,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Mere unlawful transiting of firearms through the
territory of Zimbabwe is in itself a serious and gross violation
of the sovereign and security interests of Zimbabwe."

<HEADLINE> Israel Discovers Y2K Bug Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli computer
amateur has found a solution to the Year 2000 computer problem
(Y2K) that is applicable to all databases, a local newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Sapir 2000 program, developed by Ben-Etzion Yaron, head of
Manpower and Payroll Department in Hebrew University, compresses
four digits for the years in the 21st century into two symbols by
using special algorithms, so the code for any year in the 21st
century will not be the same as the year 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The program makes it possible to analyze computer programs
written in COBOL, the programmers of which used two digits for
years in the 20th century instead of four needed to differentiate
between them and those in the 21st century because of the
limitation of space.
</P>
<P>
The programmers thought the programs, which were written in
the 1970s and 80s, would be abandoned by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Chaos will be expected worldwide if the bug is not fixed by
next January. So far, the world has invested billions of dollars
to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Yaron's invention can even identify errors in other programs
that have been already revamped to get rid of the Y2K bug and make
corrections. The Y2K bugs it can not cope with are those in
computer components embedded in equipment, for instance, medical
devices, the Jerusalem Post said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the time needed by Sapir 2000 to fix the
Y2K bug is 15 percent to 20 percent of the time other solutions
need, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Yaron has applied for patents for his new program in the United
States. The product will be initially marketed and distributed in
Israel and, if all goes well, will be sold worldwide, mainly via
the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Try On-line Pagers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua)-- Chinese people now can read e-
mail wherever they are and whenever they like with their pagers
rather than with expensive palmtop computers.
</P>
<P>
 With a technique called "on-line pager," paging stations can
transform e-mail into wireless signals that can be received by
pagers, and users can enjoy this service by applying to paging
stations for e-mail boxes.
</P>
<P>
 On-line pagers, originally developed in the United States,
were introduced to China by Internet service providers and paging
stations a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
 Cyber Netology Corp., a Chinese Internet service provider in
Beijing, launched a two-way grovel e-mail paging system (ESP)
based on this technique and fit for Chinese paging stations.
</P>
<P>
 On-line paging also will meet the needs of overseas Chinese
and their folks at home, said Yan Baomin, executive vice president
of Cyber Netology Corp.
</P>
<P>
 "Chinese students abroad, for example, are used to e-mail,
however, their parents at home may not have the access to Internet,
" he added. "On-line pagers offer Chinese an easier way to use the
Internet, since pagers are much more popular here."
</P>
<P>
 On-line paging brings a new opportunity for the development
of Chinese paging stations, which have been competing with mobile
telephone services, said Yan.
</P>
<P>
 Statistics show that the country has 1,763 paging stations
now, with pager users totaling 72.68 million.
</P>
<P>
 According to Yan, 50 paging stations in 21 Chinese cities
including Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an, and Harbin, offer on-line
paging service, and China Unicom, the country's telecommunications
giant, also adopted ESP in July.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia, IMF to Talk over Loans: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian government
representatives are due to meet officials of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington on September 23 to discuss
granting credit to Ethiopia, the Reporter newspaper said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted experts as saying that Ethiopia has met IMF's
 requirements on economic reform, adding if the IMF criterion is
only economical, the IMF is expected to release the promised aid
package.
</P>
<P>
However, the unidentified experts said if the IMF may come up
with a political criterion as it did before under a pressure from
the United States, it may not grant Ethiopia the loan.
</P>
<P>
A press release by the IMF board of directors on August 17 said
that Ethiopia has shown a seven percent economic growth so far
this year despite the short of rainfall, a decline in the price of
coffee on international markets and the country's conflict with
Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is the third largest coffee producer in Africa. It has
been at war with Eritrea over border dispute since May last year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Police Round Up Over 100,000 Escaped Criminal Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Public
Security announced here today that police departments across in
the country have rounded up over 100,000 escaped criminal suspects
in the latest nationwide campaign which began on July 1.
</P>
<P>
An official with the ministry said they include over 10,000
people who surrendered to police under great pressure.
</P>
<P>
He said the campaign has been playing a positive role in
ensuring social stability and safety during celebrations for the
upcoming 50th anniversary of the People's Republic and the return
of Macao.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a smooth campaign, the ministry has established an
information network to provide detailed information about suspects,
directly to police units at various levels.
</P>
<P>
More than 80,000 criminal suspects now captured were in the
nationwide fugitive network's files, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the ministry offers rewards to policemen
capturing escapees on the ministry's most-wanted list, as well as
to citizens who provide tips or help round up the escapees during
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The public security bureau of Shenzhen in south China awarded
10,000 yuan on April 18 to two ordinary citizens who helped
capture a fugitive homicide suspect.
</P>
<P>
"This was the first time a public security bureau gave such a
large reward to citizens who voluntarily helped catch a major
fugitive since the beginning of the ongoing nationwide campaign
against fugitives," the officer stressed.

<HEADLINE> Model of Japanese Tank Found in NE China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A museum in the city of
Fushun in Liaoning Province, northeast China, announced today that
it has discovered a model of a Japanese tank built in 1932, when
Japan occupied northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The model tank, 21.2 cm long, 9.5 cm wide, and 10.9 cm high, is
believed to have been a souvenir to mark the first anniversary of
the "Sept. 18 Incident," the beginning of a four-month-long
aggressive action by Japanese troops to occupy the entire
northeast of China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese characters carved on the model indicate that it was
made to mark the incident by the "South Manchu Railway Company"
run by the Japanese aggressors.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Living "One Country, Two Systems" Great Experience (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- "My family always consider
Hong Kong our home, and we have lived here very comfortably," said
Frank Martin, president of the American Chamber of Commerce (
AmCham) in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Martin is one of the 40,000 or so Americans with a long-
established and prominent presence in Hong Kong, who make Hong
Kong their "home away from home".
</P>
<P>
From an American's perspective, Hong Kong's return to the
mainland has been very positive, and politically, little change
has occurred so far in Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Living 'One Country, Two Systems' is really great experience,"
Martin told Xinhua in an exclusive interview just two weeks before
October 1, China's National Day, when a variety of activities will
be held throughout the country to celebrate the 50th anniversary
of the founding of New China.
</P>
<P>
"I have already received dozens of invitations to different
kinds of receptions, meetings and gatherings in Hong Kong," Martin
said.
</P>
<P>
"To me, the most impressive events that have taken place in the
country in the past half century were Nixon's visit to China in
early 1970s and Deng Xiaoping's decision to establish the open-up
policy in 1978," Martin said.
</P>
<P>
"It was these and the subsequent events that led to closer Sino-
U.S. relations and resulted in more foreign investment in China
and more trade with China, which in turn promoted a spectacular
economic growth and improved the standard of living for millions
of people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"During my first visit to China in 1980, I, as a guest of the
Bank of China, toured several places. I was amused that I could
not use my normal passport," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
"But dramatic changes have occurred in China since then," he
said, adding that China's fast economic growth has established the
country as an important economic force in the world.
</P>
<P>
Martin travels between Hong Kong and China's mainland at least
six times each year. "Every time I could find something new to me,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
In China, he met many Chinese leaders, including Premier Zhu
Rongji and Vice-Premier Li Lanqing, and many others.
</P>
<P>
He described the Chinese leaders as "extraordinarily capable".
"They have done the most difficult job in the world," he said. He
expressed the belief that the Chinese leaders are able to lead the
Chinese people to overcome any difficulties and obstacles in the
way in the future and to lead an even stronger country into the
new millennium.
</P>
<P>
"China so far remains an attractive location for foreign
investment, especially for the investment from the United States,"
he said, mentioning that 75 percent of AmCham member companies now
have operations in China which is about 20 percent more than five
years ago.

<P>
Among the member companies that do not have a presence in China,
43 percent intend to make an investment in the market over the
next three years and 78 percent of the companies that already have
operations in China claim they will increase their investment in
the next three years, he explained.
</P>
<P>
"So I am very anxious about the resumption of negotiations over
the WTO," Martin said. "I believe that the resumption of Sino-U.S.
talks on China's entry to the WTO will be good both to China and
to the United States. It is not just an issue about imports and
exports, but also about the foreign investment."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his strong support for China's entry into the
World Trade Organization. "To facilitate this process, Congress
should pass legislation that will enable the United States to
extend permanent normal trade relations status once China
negotiates a commercially acceptable accession protocol," he
stated.
</P>
<P>
Martin, 58, was appointed president of the AmCham in Hong Kong
in December 1990. He and his wife Noriko have been residents in
Hong Kong since 1976.
</P>
<P>
Martin is very proud of his two children who received 13 years'
education in Hong Kong, from kindergarten to high school. Now, the
Martins are permanent residents of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is so attractive to the outside world because it is
not only an international business and finance hub, but also a
multiple-lingual and multiple-cultural metropolis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning the economic crisis, Martin said it had great
impacts on the economy and foreign investment in Hong Kong and
China's mainland. It takes time for the economies of Hong Kong,
China's mainland and the rest of Asia to recover or to improve, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it will rebound, but it is a very gradual
process," he explained. However, a recent survey conducted among
members of the AmCham shows that everyone is satisfied with the
handover since it happened.
</P>
<P>
He is an active participant in local community service and has
served on board of numerous non-profit organization, including
Hong Kong International School Board of Management and Hong Kong
Inland Revenue Review Board.
</P>
<P>
Martin said more than 190 U.S. companies have regional
headquarters in Hong Kong, while 285 others have regional offices.
That represents about 20 percent of all international companies
with a regional office or headquarters in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The AmCham in Hong Kong is the biggest outside of America and
represents the business interests of more than 1,000 companies and
2,600 members.
</P>
<P>
"American businesses are confident in the long-term prospects
of Hong Kong and have decided to continue their investment here,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> China Becomes World's Building Materials Giant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- China has become one of the
world's largest building materials producers after 50 years of
development, with annual outputs of cement, sheet glass, ceramic
tiles, and sanitary wares ranking first in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Administration of Buildings Material
Industry, China produced 530 million tons of cement in 1998, and
has been the world's largest cement producer for 13 years running.
The country produced only 660,000 tons in 1949 when New China was
founded, ranking 26th in the world at that time.
</P>
<P>
The total output value of China's building materials sector
reached 347 billion yuan in 1998, ranking fifth among the country'
s various industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
China's building materials sector registered an average annual
growth rate of 13.1 percent between 1952 and 1997, 1.5 percentage
points higher than that of the nation's industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
There now are 61,000 building materials enterprises in China,
with total assets topping 533.1 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
With the founding of New China, especially after the country
adopted the reform and opening-up policy, the building materials
sector maintained a favorable growth momentum.
</P>
<P>
China's building materials enterprises were mostly publicly or
collectively owned before 1978, and since then Sino-foreign joint
ventures, solely foreign-funded ventures and private enterprises
have developed rapidly. Some of them are even engaged in trans-
regional, trans-regional and inter-trade operations.
</P>
<P>
To date the 4,500-strong foreign-funded building materials
enterprises in the country have used a total foreign investment of
seven billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
China's building materials industry has developed ties more
than 130 countries and regions in the fields of trade, labor
service, contracted construction projects, and technology services.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the country's import and export
value of building materials totaled 2.04 billion U.S. dollars in
the first half of this year, including 1.2 billion U.S. dollars of
exports. The total foreign trade value of the industry grew at an
average annual rate of 18 percent between 1979 and 1997.

ISLAMABAD, September 15 (Xinhua) -- At least eight persons were
killed and more than a dozen injured in Taliban's air raids on
opposition-held Taloqan city in northern Afghanistan, opposition
sources said.
</P>
<P>
They said Taliban jets struck the city, capital of Takhar
province, in retaliation of the recent success of opposition
troops in capturing a number of mountain posts in Khanabad
district of Takhar province from the Islamic militia.
</P>

There was no independent confirmation of the claim so far.

<HEADLINE> S. African Men Held in Angola Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Hugs, kisses and tears
marked the return to South Africa of four men who were detained in
an Angolan jail for 20 months, The Star newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Family and friends of the four, who gathered at Lanseria
Airport in Johannesburg, could not contain their joy when they saw
the men emerging from the private plane that brought them back
from Angola late Tuesday night, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Marnix van der Eecken, 48, Gert Allen, 49, Marthines Steyn, 26,
and Rudie Swanepoel, 20, were detained in Angola on January 20
last year, after their supply flight carrying building materials
to northern Angola was forced to land by the Angolan Air Force.
</P>
<P>
The four were detained for five months after their arrest under
a blanket provision of the State Security Act, namely that they
had endangered the security of the Angolan State by entering the
country without a visa.
</P>
<P>
At some stage they were accused of bringing arms into Angola,
probably for the benefit of rebel National union for Total
Independence of Angola.
</P>
<P>
After being found guilty, Van der Eecken and Steyn were each
sentenced to eight years' imprisonment while Allen and Swanepoel
were each sentenced to two years' imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The men were acquitted on September 3 after an appeal and were
accommodated locally before returning home on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The men, all dressed casually and looking neat, said they had
been well looked after in recent weeks -- a far cry to the early
days of their detention.

<HEADLINE> Rain Falls in China Rally After Shakedown </HEADLINE>

<P>
HUAIROU, Beijing, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Drivers may find the
China Rally rougher than they thought as a mild rain fell on the
course following the shakedown in the Wednesday's morning in the
northeast county in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The China Rally, the 11th stage of the World Rallying
Championships, will set off on Friday morning, with just less than
40 hours left for the organisers to examine the road and conduct
repair if necessary.
</P>
<P>
All the top racers in the rally claimed a rough road condition
in the three-day race during the morning's shakedown.
</P>
<P>
"The stage is very rough," said Mitsubishi's Tommi Makinen,
leader of the drivers competition. "And the road is very narrow."
</P>
<P>
"The road is so rough that we can find stones everywhere," said
Toyota's racer Didier Auriol, who is trailing Makinen by 10 points
at second on the drivers standings. "It's very easy to pull away
on every corner."
</P>
<P>
"Some stages are quiet nice, but some are rough and twisty. It'
s very difficult to do with the car," Auriol added.
</P>
<P>
Approximate 250-meter road in the first-day leg had been
damaged by flooding about a week before, and some repair was
conducted to make the road passable.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Donates Rice, Medicines to S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
donated 5, 000 bags of rice and some consignment of medicines to
former combatants of the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
and the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Acting High Commissioner in Sierra leone Tony
Chikezie announced the donation during a coordinating meeting on
the take-off of the disarmament exercise under the Lome peace
agreement signed in July, according to a Nigerian Tribune report
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the envoy as saying that the consignment is
expected to arrive in Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, this
week, adding that the gesture is a further demonstration of
Nigeria's sincere interest in the peace process in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Chikezie expressed the hope that the items would assist the
rank and file of the disarming combatants as they demonstrated
their commitments to the peace process in the west African
country.
</P>
<P>
The RUF/AFRC delegation leader S.Y. Rogers was quoted as saying
that his movement no longer considered the West African
peace-keeping force of ECOMOG as an antagonistic force, rather it
accepted its roles in providing security to ensure the success of
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Nigerian government has halted the withdrawal of
 its troops from strife-torn Sierra leone to ensure ECOMOG troops
to initiate the process of disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration of rebel soldiers in line with the Lome peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
A statement from ECOMOG headquarters in Sierra Leone said that
the AFRC loyalists had promised to ensure a halt to all hostage
taking or ceasefire violation along the highways in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Troops loyal to the AFRC led by Major Johnny Paul Koromah had
in July posed an obstacle on the peace process by seizing ECOMOG
soldiers, United Nations staff and aid workers.

<HEADLINE> Young Judokas Stand up in Chinese City Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAN'AN, SHAANXI, China, Setpember 15 (Xinhua) -- The judo
competitions in the fourth Chinese City Games were concluded here
on Wednesday with a promosing prospect of a string of young
athletes.
</P>
<P>
National champion Li Shufang was beaten by budding star Yang
Shujun in the women's 63kg class with clear upperhands, while 15-
year-old Wang Haixia also dethroned another national champion Qing
Dongya in the women's 70kg category.
</P>
<P>
"Those are the good players with great potentials, produced in
the City Games, which was being conceived as the cradle for the
youngesters under the age of 20," said assistant judge Xia
Shuangxi.
</P>
<P>
"The men players have also impressed me the most with their
active participation as the majority of the winners triumphed in
ippon," said Xia.
</P>
<P>
"The players' active attitude was mainly due to the fact that
the Chinese Judo Association issued new rules to punish those
passive participants by reducing the time period from 20 seconds
to five seconds," explained the official.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the traditional judo powers were prevented from
dominating in the four-day national competitions as Shenyang of
Liaoning province only claimed four out of the 16 gold medals at
stake, and Inner Mongolia failed to reap a single gold.
</P>
<P>
"However, our players still need to improve their basic
techniques, with the ones on the floor in particular, as most of
them resorted to quick victories, seldom the case in the world
arena," said the assistant judge.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, against the full-fledged development of the
smaller classes, "those heavy players in both the men's and women'
s competitions are clearly lack of skills and strength",
requesting further researches from the concerned authorities, said
the official.

<P>
XI'AN, China, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Two women world record-
holders were beaten in the shooting competitions here on Wednesday
in the fourth Chinese City Games.
</P>
<P>
Ren Jie and Wang Xian, world record-holders in the air pistol
and the 3x20 sports rifle events respectively, were defeated in
their specialities by two teenagers.
</P>
<P>
Fei Fengji, a 17-year-old lassie from Shanghai, scored 482.9
points to beat Ren Jie by 0.1 point, becoming the sole double
champion in the shooting competition which is to be concluded on
Thursday, following her victory in the 25m sports pistol on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ren Jie only ranked second with 482.8 points, lagging far
behind her own world mark of 493.5 points last year.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xian from Hangzhou scored 10.6 points less than her world
mark of 689.7 points in the 3x20 sports rifle, which was
eventually won by her national teammate Zhang Shaotan in 684.7
points.
</P>
<P>
"I have played to my best, but the weather condition was not
good enough with poor visibility this morning, which was the main
reason for my failure," said Wang Xian.
</P>
<P>
In the preliminaries, Shi Jia and Li Lin, the two teenagers
from Shanghai and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, broke the 10-
year-old national junior mark by 580 and 578 points respectively.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Provide Anti-flood Aid to Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Wednesday that the Japanese government has approved
assistance for a 4-billion-peso (100-million-U.S.-dollar) dike
project that will protect Metro Manila from floods.
</P>
<P>
The president said in a radio program that Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi informed him of the approval of the Japanese
aid during their meeting in the 7th Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation leaders' informal summit in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he received reports on the plight of thousands of
Metro Manila residents, particularly students and workers, caused
by flooding last Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The president also said he does not intend to replace Gregorio
Vigilar as the public works secretary, who had been severely
criticized in the wake of the floods that submerged the low-lying
areas of Metro Manila and the nearby provinces.
</P>
<P>
"Secretary Vigilar has performed well," he said. "The
inundation was not due to his fault."
</P>
<P>
The Metro Manila inundation, in the president's view, was
caused mainly by clogging of the drainage system due to the
implementation of various infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said his administration, which is now in its second
year, has been tackling the decades-old problem of flooding in
Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said Estrada
had instructed Secretary Vigilar to coordinate with the Metro
Manila Development Authority to make sure that flooding in the
metropolis is under control.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Plans on Pay Rise for Public Servants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Government is to
consider raising wages for the public servants as a step towards
tackling corruption,

the Vanguard, a major Nigerian newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
President Olusegun Obasanjo made the government's intention in
a message sent through his aid Tuesday to the opening of a seminar
on the Anti-Corruption Bill organized by the Nigeria Labor
Congress (NLC) in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said in the message that "corruption has become a
necessity to certain categories of workers in our country who
cannot be expected to survive and provide the basic necessities of
life for their dependants on the wages and salaries which they are
currently paid".
</P>
<P>
The president also identified corruption as one of the factors
hindering the much-desired foreign investment in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"Without such investment, we will find it difficult to reduce
significantly the present level of unemployment in our country. It
is therefore in the collective interest of our work force that no
effort be spared in the war against corruption," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Export Liquefied Natural Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is expected to export
liquefied natural gas early next month as a 3.8
billion-U.S.-dollar-gas plant has begun production recently.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of Nigeria LNG Limited confirmed Wednesday that the
first consignment of the liquefied natural gas will leave its
factory in Bonny, a town in Niger Delta for Europe in October.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, one of the world's leading oil producers, is thought
to have the tenth-largest gas reserves in the world. But in the
past decades the gas emitted in Nigeria's oil fields is usually
flared off, causing enormous revenue loses and environment
problems.
</P>
<P>
The test run of the plant, virtually a city with 18,000
employees, commenced from midnight last Sunday, which was
described by the spokesman as "a landmark in Nigerian economic
history."

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The new European Commission
led by Romano Prodi was confirmed Wednesday afternoon at a
European Parliament meeting.
</P>
<P>
The new 20-member European executive team is due to take office
Thursday for its five-year term. About three-quarters of the 626-
seat assembly said they back the new Commission after president-
designate Prodi, the former Italian prime minister, promised "very,
very severe" measures against any Commissioners implicated in
criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's voting brought to an end six months of stagnation
following the corruption scandal in which the entire Commission
had to resign on March 16, badly shaking confidence in European
institutions.
</P>
<P>
"I am determined to transform the Commission into a modern,
efficient administration which has learnt the lessons of recent
experience and put its house in order," Prodi told the members of
the parliament on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the European Parliament to exercise
new powers to vote on the appointment of a new Commission.

<HEADLINE> Active Fiscal Policy Viable for Next Year:Vice-Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- China will surely continue to
carry out an active fiscal policy next year because expanding
domestic demand is a long-term governmental plan, Vice-Minister in
charge of the State Development Planning Commission (SDPC) Li
Rongrong said here today.
</P>
<P>
Li told a press conference held by the Press Office under the
State Council today that continuously increasing investment in
construction of basic infrastructures will add at least one
percentage point to economic growth this year.
</P>
<P>
China issued an additional 60 billion yuan of treasury bonds
this month to fund infrastructure projects and technological
development.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the investment made by the central government will
activate 200 billion yuan of investment by banks, local
governments, and enterprises in a chain reaction this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that most infrastructure projects will take three years
to complete, and so the government will continue to carry out an
active fiscal policy next year in order to guarantee the
completion of these projects.
</P>
<P>
Li said that compared to government investment in
infrastructures last year, the spending of the treasury bond money
will be focused on technological upgrading of state-owned
enterprises and the commercialization of hi-tech products.
</P>
<P>
He said that government investment in these two areas will
trigger 66.5 billion yuan of additional investment in
technological upgrading, and 21.3 billion yuan of additional
investment in localization of key industrial equipment and the
commercialization of hi-tech products.
</P>
<P>
Most of this money will be spent on purchasing new equipment
and technology, thus stimulating production in the manufacturing
and metallurgical industries.
</P>
<P>
"This year's government investment will have an even more far-
reaching impact on the economy than that of last year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that such investment will take time to affect the
economy, he said the growth-promoting power of this year's fiscal
policy will be strongly felt over the next year.
</P>
<P>
Since the enterprises involved are the most healthy state-owned
enterprises and technological companies with the greatest market
potential, they will contribute greatly to economic growth by
carrying out these projects.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific Timeshare Conference Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific Timeshare
Conference hosted by U.S. Resort Condominium International (RCI)
opened here today, with more than 200 representatives from around
the world attending the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Timesharing is the practice of taking a resort accommodation
unit such as an apartment, hotel room or condominium and dividing
its use rights into weekly segments. The use rights are then sold
to a consumer for a finite period of time such as 20, 30, or 40 or
more years through a membership marketing program.
</P>
<P>
Timesharing is one of the fastest-growing segments of the
travel and tourism industry, enjoyed by 4.5 million people
worldwide and with an annual turnover of approximately 6.5 billion
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
David Clifton, group managing director of RCI Asia-Pacific Pte
Ltd., said that China is a country rich in history, tradition, and
culture, and its beautiful scenery, delicious food and friendly
people add to its charms.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that more foreign tourists will
come to China for sightseeing and vacations as a result of the
constantly improving tourist services.
</P>
<P>
There are currently 14 RCI-affiliated resorts in China's key
gateway cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai, with more in the
pipeline. RCI has also sent many people to China through timeshare
exchanges, boosting the number of tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that from January to July this year, China
has received more than 40 million overseas tourists, a jump of 15.
13 percent over the same period last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia has, in principle,
agreed to cancel 80 percent of the 35 billion rubles (about 5.8
million U.S. dollars) it lent to Ethiopia for arms purchasing when
Mengistu Haile-Mariam was in power.
</P>
<P>
The 67 percent of the remaining 20 percent may also be reduced
through the Paris club, the Reporter newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources was quoted as saying that the debt relief was
stalled because Russia wanted Ethiopia to pay its debt on the
currency exchange rate when the money was given while Ethiopia
intended to pay its debt with the current exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Mengistu, who took Ethiopian power in February 1977, was
overthrown in May 1991.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Thursday's edition of the
People's Daily will issue an editorial titled "Troublemaker of the
International Community."
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that Lee Teng-hui received universal
criticism after he made his "two-states" remarks, and his name has
become a synonym for "troublemaker."
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that Lee makes trouble for the peace and
stability in the Asia-Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
It says the "two-states" remarks destroys the basis for cross-
Straits talks and endangers the basis for the peaceful
reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The editorial points out that Asia-Pacific countries are
closely observing the development of the situation, and Lee has
become the most dangerous factor for the peace and stability in
the region.
</P>
<P>
It says Lee's act is closely connected with the present
regional and world situation.
</P>
<P>
It says the U.S.-led NATO launched air attacks on Yugoslavia by
flaunting the banner that "human rights are more important than
sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
This situation caused Lee to believe that the time was ripe for
destroying the "one China" policy and advocating his "two-states"
concept.
</P>
<P>
Lee believes that so long as cross-Straits relations become
state-to-state relations, foreign powers will intervene in the
name of "stopping an invasion" in case of military conflict, the
editorial says. more

<HEADLINE> Exhibition on Chinese History Staged in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A large scale exhibition
featuring Chinese people's endeavors for national strength and
prosperity in the past century was staged in Hong Kong Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Rise of Modern China: A Century of Self-Determination,
" the nine-section exhibition displays more than 200 historical
photographs, most of which have never been shown in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It also highlights 180 significant historical objects,
including the microscopic lens used by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, forerunner
of Chinese revolution, when he was a medical student, the banner
used by the Beijing University students during the May 4th
Movement in 1919, and the loudspeaker used by the late Chinese
leader Mao Zedong to proclaim the founding of the People's
Republic of China at Tian'anmen.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Ronald Leung Ding-bong,
chairman of the Provisional Urban Council (PUC), said the Council
pursued an active program of promoting Chinese history and culture.
</P>
<P>
"The exhibition has been timed to tie in with the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China," he
said. "Now that Hong Kong has returned to our motherland for over
two years, it is important that the people of Hong Kong, the
younger generation in particular, should acquire better knowledge
and understanding of the transformation that China had undergone
in the last hundred years."
</P>
<P>
Leung said: "Hong Kong played a part in many of the events
which took place in China in the last hundred years."
</P>
<P>
"All the historical events demonstrate that Hong Kong is an
inalienable part of China's historical development. To understand
Hong Kong we must place it in the context of Chinese history," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Jointly presented by the Provisional Urban Council and the
National Museum of Modern Chinese History, the exhibition will run
through November 21 at the Special Exhibition Gallery of the Hong
Kong Museum of History.
</P>
<P>
Officiating at the opening ceremony were Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR);
Jiang Enzhu, director of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch; Sun
Jiazheng, minister of culture of the People's Republic of China;
and Ma Yuzhen, commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of
the People's Republic of China in the HKSAR.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Command to Review  Kisangani Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, September 15 (Xinhua) --The High Command of Uganda
People's Defense Forces (UPDF) will meet on Wednesday to review
the report of investigation into the fierce clashes between the
troops of Uganda and Rwanda in Kisangani, the third largest city
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The report presented at the weekend by Army Commander Jeje
Odongo was initially dismissed as shallow and compromised, the New
Vision newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
President Yoweri Museveni told reporters Tuesday evening that
the report did not cover certain areas it was supposed to cover.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the clashes to the lack of a joint
military and civilian leadership, and respective support of rival
factions of the main rebel group by the two countries. It added
both sides were preparing for an attack, however, the UPDF High
Command denied that the Ugandan troops ever prepared for an
attack.
</P>
<P>
A break-down in communication between the Ugandan and Rwandan
troops was blamed for the start of the clashes, said the report,
which also blamed the two sides for breaking the loose ceasefire
agreement signed on August 15.
</P>
<P>
The four-day clashes,from August 14-17, claimed 38 Ugandan
soldiers. Some sources put the casualty at hundreds.

<HEADLINE> Angola Sells Foreign Currency to Save Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Angolan National Bank (BKA)
has undertaken "an important intervention" in the exchange market
to help its fast-devaluating national currency readjusted kwanza.
</P>
<P>
This is the first intervention in the exchange market since
June 3 when the country started the system of floating rate,
official newspaper Jornal de Angola reported here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted BNA as saying that the national bank sold
Tuesday a massive volume of foreign currency with an aim to save
the poor exchange rate of readjusted kwanza.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the floating rate in June, the readjusted
kwanza has devaluated by a large margin, with 7.2 million
readjusted kwanzas equivalent to one U.S. dollar on Wednesday,
worth only one tenth of its value on June 2 when it was officially
priced at 1:710,000 in exchange for U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The national currency devaluated by 24% in two days since
Monday when the exchange rate in readjusted kwanza against U.S.
dollar was 1:5,800,000 (one dollar for 5,800,000 readjusted
kwanzas).
</P>
<P>
"BNA put a big part of the financial means, which are necessary
for covering the demand for foreign currency in the market, at the
disposal of commercial banks," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quoted BNA as saying that the bank will take
other measures to "maintain the control over the evolution of the
exchange rate".
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government gave up on June 3 the fixed rate of
exchange, in a bid to curb inflation and strike the illegal
currency exchange market. But the impasse in the battle-field and
the deteriorating economic situation prevented the policy from
working, according to the paper.

BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Inter-party contacts between
the Communist Party of China (CPC) and political parties worldwide
witnessed remarkable progress during the past five decades since
the founding of new China in 1949, and China's ruling party is
making active efforts to build a favorable environment for the

</P>
<P>
Currently, the CPC has contacts with 340 political parties,
including both ruling and opposition parties, in 140 countries.
Exchanges are more frequent between the CPC and major political
parties in China's neighbors. Even in countries which have not
established diplomatic ties with China, the CPC has made reliable
friends in political circles, preparing for the eventual
normalization of state-to-state relations.
</P>
<P>
Ideologial differences are no longer barriers to forming
friendly cooperation between the CPC and other parties.

<HEADLINE> CPC Inter-Party Contacts See Remarkable Progress in 50 Years (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the eve of the birth of the People's Republic, an iron-
curtain fell between the socialist and capitalist countries, and
it was the socialist countries who first recognized New China.
Communist parties and progressive forces followed suit, breaking
the embargo and sanctions of the West by extending their friendly
hands to the newborn state.
</P>
<P>
In 1956 the CPC held its Eighth National Congress, and
representatives from 56 foreign Communist parties were present at
the CPC's invitation, creating an unprecedented situation for CPC'
s external contacts.
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing years, the CPC sustained the heated theoretical
debate inside the international Communist movement, during which
the CPC stood firm against chauvinism in an effort to safeguard
the independence and self-reliance of both China and the CPC.
</P>
<P>
The Party itself also went down the winding path in the decade-
long "cultural revolution," during which the CPC's external
contacts retrogressed.
</P>
<P>
China in the late 1970s initiated the reform and opening-up
drive by shifting its focus to economic construction. China's
diplomatic work also concentrated efforts on seeking a favorable
international environment for massive construction. In line with
such a historic change, the CPC's external contacts department
also changed its guidelines away from choosing friends merely on
the basis of ideology, thus injecting impetus to CPC's external
work.
</P>
<P>
This change marked the beginning of a new era.
</P>
<P>
The CPC's external contacts in the following years expanded
from Communist parties to national or democratic parties, and from
socialist parties to right-wing conservative parties.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the early 1990s, the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe
bloc dissolved, and the African continent saw wave after wave of
multi-party transformation. All these earthshaking events brought
profound changes to the structure of political parties all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
The CPC in this period maintained its adherence to the four
principles guiding inter-party exchanges, namely, independence,
complete equality, mutual respect, and non-interference in each
other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to its open-mindedness, the CPC's attitude won
recognition and the appreciation of political parties worldwide,
creating another peak of its external contacts.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC, announced at the
15th CPC National Congress in 1997 that the CPC was willing to
develop new types of inter-party relations of exchange and
cooperation with all the political parties of various countries
which are ready to have contacts with the CPC with a view to
promoting relations between countries.

Deng Xiaoping's ideas on inter-party relations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the CPC has been and will be focused on
serving the development strategy of the State and the Party in its
external work. The work, which is an integral part of overall
Chinese diplomacy, is aimed at creating a more favorable
international peace environment for the reform and opening-up and
modernization construction, he pointed out, adding that external
exchanges after the 15th CPC National Congress were enriched
thanks to such guidelines.
</P>
<P>
To improve the Party building and the development of the State,
the CPC added new content, including the exchange of experience in
party and state management, into its contacts with foreign parties,
injecting more substantial content into the exchanges.
</P>
<P>
As a new millennium approaches, it is believed that the CPC
will score more achievements thanks to the solid foundation laid

<HEADLINE> Organizers of Moscow Blasts Hide in Chechnya: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
said here Wednesday that the organizers of the explosions of
residential buildings in Moscow that killed more than 200 people
were hiding in Chechnya, a breakaway Russian republic.
</P>
<P>
"It's absolutely clear that the terrorists are hiding in the
Chechen territory and are being supported by extremist forces in
Chechnya," Putin told journalists after meeting with visiting
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to ask the republic's leadership to hand over the
criminals," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Several people who prepared the terrorist acts were detained
and their role is being determined," he said. "A search was
announced for a number of individuals whom we consider contractors,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Ahern arrived here Tuesday on a three-day official visit. The
two countries signed two agreements on their cooperation in
fighting crime and drug trafficking Wednesday, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Putin said law enforcement bodies and police located a storage
of several tons of explosives, which might have been used in
future terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Sweep checks of markets and premises continue in Moscow, and
control over non-residents of the city was stepped up, the
Interfax news agency quoted Putin as saying.
</P>
<P>
In addition, "a series of prevention measures unnoticeable for
the general public are being implemented," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow was rocked by three explosions since August 31, when a
bomb went off in an underground shopping mall near the Kremlin,
killing one person and injuring dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
The second explosion happened just seconds to midnight
Wednesday, ripping apart a nine-storey apartment building in
southeast Moscow. Ninety-four people were killed in that blast.
</P>
<P>
The latest blast occurred Monday morning, killing 118 residents
in an eight-storey apartment building. Thirteen of the victims
were children and 13 fragments of human are yet to be identified.
</P>
<P>
In Daghestan, a car bomb exploded in front of a five-storey
military housing complex on September 4, killing 64 people.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday afternoon, a man telephoned the Itar-Tass news
agency, saying that a so-called Daghestan Liberation Army staged
the blasts in retaliation against Russian assaults on Islamic
rebels in Daghestan and Chechnya.

LIMA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measuring 6 on the

<HEADLINE> "Underground Treasure House" Found in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
found a large "underground treasure house" some 20 kilometers
north of the ancient city of Xi'an, capital of northwest China's
Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Excavation efforts in the past decade showed that the large
underground treasure house is actually the cemetery of Liu Qi, the
fourth emperor of the Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-24), which has
four gates.
</P>
<P>
In 1990 when a highway leading to the Xianyang International
Airport was being built, a group of archeologists accidentally
found hundreds of colored pottery figurines in the southern part
of the Liu Qi cemetery.
</P>
<P>
Continued excavation efforts led to the discovery of 90 burying
pits within the emperor's cemetery,
</P>
<P>
In the eastern side of the cemetery are 28 burying pits
containing colored terra-cotta infantrymen, cavalrymen, chariots,
horses, weapons, sheep, dogs pigs, and articles for daily use.
</P>
<P>
The 21 pits in both northern and western sides of the cemetery
contain large numbers of various weapons, chariots and daily
necessities. Excavations will continue to determine what is in the
20 pits in the southern side of the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
Among the more than 1,000 50-60-cm high beautifully-shaped
pottery figurines unearthed from these pits are the earliest
valiant and brave cavalry women found in China, according to
archeologists.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 10,000 various attendant tombs have been
found in a 3.5-square-kilometer attendant cemetery at the eastern
part of the Liu Qi cemetery, the largest that has been found among
the tombs of the emperors of the Western Han Dynasty, said a
Chinese archeologist.

<HEADLINE> Situation Worsens in Southern Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The stability in southern
Somalia is further worsening as the armed confrontations between
the warring sides supporting Hussein Mohamed Aidid and those of
the Ethiopian backed factions are escalating and drawing close to
the capital.
</P>
<P>
At least five people were killed and more than eight others
wounded in the fighting between the militiamen of the Rahanwein
Resistance Army (RRA) accompanied by the Digil Salvation Army
(DSA) on one side and Aidid's forces on the other in Aw-Koreh
village, about 5 Kilometers southwest of the lucrative airport of
Ballidogleh Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to the VHF radios in the area, more than seven battle
wagons and nearly 100 heavily armed infantry militiamen from
Aidid's side were involved in the clashes, while the RRA and DSA
fighters posed stiff resistance against the attack led by the
commander of Ballidogleh airport, Abdukarim Farabadan.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the attack is not stated officially. However,
according to independent sources, the militiamen of Aidid
stationed at Ballidogleh airport, 90 kilometers south of the
capital, have launched the attack. The sources said the attack was
prompted after the RRA and DSA fighters started establishing a new
strong militia base at Aw-Koreh village.
</P>
<P>
The new base is seen as a serious threat to the operations of
the only tarmac airport run by Hussein Aidid's militiamen.
According to the sources, the attack has later on spread to
several other villages in the area.
</P>
<P>
Malaq Mohamed Jobanoh Yarow, one of the traditional leaders in
the area, fled to Mogadishu and met the journalists Wednesday,
accusing Aidid's forces led by the commander of Ballidogleh
airport for committing crimes of killing, torturing, abducting,
raping and displacing people in Lower Shabelle region.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinleh, spokesman for RRA, has claimed that
his men have killed 11 militiamen and wounded 15 others from the
side of Aidid during the confrontation and seized two battle
wagons.
</P>
<P>
This confrontation is said to be an extension of the war for
control of Qoryoley town between the two sides. Hussein Aidid's
militiamen still remain in control of Qoryoley town, and the two
sides are now in defensive positions outside the town.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, encouraging reports from the southern port town of
Kismaio, 500 kilometers south of the capital, indicate that sweep
operations in disarming the outlawed militiamen is continuing by
the Jubba Valley Alliance forces, who captured the town from
General Morgan early June this year. According to officials from
the alliance, the plan is meant to create a peaceful environment
for both the commercial and humanitarian activities throughout the
region.
</P>
<P>
However, at least four people were killed Tuesday in the center
of the town during a disarmament operation by the alliance forces.
Eyewitnesses in the town said the exchange of fire started when
about 150 policemen mandated for the disarmament operation tried
to collect weapons from a food store.

<HEADLINE> Montreal School Board Under Language "Criminal" Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- An English-language school
board in Montreal has been under what the local television calls "
criminal" charge for failing to put bilingual messages on all its
answering machines.
</P>
<P>
The French-language agency in Quebec Tuesday ordered the board
of 65 schools to fix up machines for both languages, as required
under the Charter of the French Language adopted in 1977.
</P>
<P>
The agency said all recorded messages must be in both French
and English for anyone who wants to reach a teacher or a school
janitor, local media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The French recording of a school does not have to be
predominant but it must be at least equivalent to the English one,
the agency was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Language disputes occasionally occur between the French and
English speaking communities in Quebec, where 82 percent of its 7.
28 million population communicate in French.
</P>
<P>
Many schools of the board are still using the same single-
language recording since long before 1977.
</P>
<P>
Institutions serving an English-majority population are
required to have bilingual signs or internal communications under
the charter in Quebec.
</P>
<P>
Recently, a language policewoman was reportedly driven out of
an English speaking community while trying to photo a shop without
bilingual signs.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The House on Monday night approved a bipartisan bill to
overhaul the nation's scandal-scarred campaign finance laws by
cutting off the flow of unregulated contributions to political
parties and curbing attack ads by advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.N. Security Council reached broad agreement on a
resolution to send a peacekeeping force to East Timor. Earlier,
the United Nations had secretly evacuated its besieged
headquarters in the East Timorese capital of Dili.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- With Colombia's Government buckling under the pressure of
guerrilla attacks, a thriving drug trade and the worst economy in
decades, the Clinton Administration is putting together a major
new effort to prop up the country's democracy that will include
hundreds of millions of dollars in economic and military aid.
</P>
<P>
-- New York State is opening a new legal front in its fight
against pollution drifting from coal-burning power plants in
upwind states with an announcement on Tuesday that it intends to
sue 17 power plants to force them to clean up.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street journal:
</P>
<P>
-- August retail sales in the United States rose 1.2% from July
and 9.1% from a year ago. A survey of small-business confidence
shows 16% of companies raised prices while 13% lowered them. At
the meantime, the current-account deficit for the April-June
period widened to 80.7 billion U.S. dollars, driving the broadest
gauge of the trade deficit to another record.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian police and soldiers tightened security in Moscow as
the death toll climbed to 118 from Monday's bomb attack on an
apartment building. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin accused Chechen
terrorists of responsibility for the explosion.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Passes Bill to Curb Finance Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives passed a bill late Tuesday night to curb the
influence of money in political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which was approved on a 252-177 vote, moves to the
Senate with an uncertain fate while Republican opponents are
threatening to obstruct it with a filibuster as they did last year.
</P>
<P>
The House passed the bill on a similar 252-179 vote last year.
</P>
<P>
The bill would ban soft money donations from corporations,
labor unions and individuals, which go to political parties rather
than individual candidates and are always used by parties to
bolster candidates.
</P>
<P>
Unlike hard money donations, soft money donations are unlimited
in size and are unregulated by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the bill would impose limits on certain types of
political advertising.
</P>
<P>
Supporters said the bill is crucial to restore public
confidence in the political process while opponents complained it
restricts the constitutional rights of free speech.
</P>
<P>
The House Republican leadership backed efforts to derail the
measure or rework it, and concluded the bill could leave
Republican candidates vulnerable to attacks by the labor.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Rejects Ethiopia's Territorial Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea rejected Wednesday
Ethiopia's demand for disputed territory by saying that its
demand "is a contradiction and violation" of the fundamental
tenets of the Framework Agreement set by the Organization of
African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Responding to a statement issued by Ethiopia Tuesday, Eritrean
 Presidential advisor Yemane Gebremeskel said "the implication is
clear that Ethiopia wants to legitimize Eritrean territory it has
incorporated in its illegal map, thus circumventing demarcation."
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian stated on Tuesday that the Ethiopian government could
 not agree to the peace package "unless it receives firm
guarantees that its territories will be returned".
</P>
<P>
Yemane said in a news release available here Wednesday that
Ethiopia's assertion "is certainly not compatible the major tenet
of the Framework Agreement and all subsequent documents" of the
OAU.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Naked Student "Surfs" Tar on S. African Highway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A Welsh student brought
traffic on the busy N1 highway outside Cape Town to a halt Monday
when he fell naked from a minibus, South African Press Association
(SAPA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to SAPA, the student has been making good progress in
hospital after undergoing surgery on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old student, who does not want to be identified,
and a group of fellow students visited the Stellenbosch wine
route. On their way back, they were in a "rather jolly mood", an
eyewitness was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It appeared as if the students were playing some kind of game
in which they had to get rid off their clothes. The Welsh student
joined in the fun and in the spirit of things, decided to give
passing motorists a "moonie" (puts his pants down and show his
backside).
</P>
<P>
He pressed his bare backside against the emergency window, but
apparently pushed too hard and landed up in the middle lane of the
N1 highway.
</P>
<P>
Motorists had to swerve and brake to avoid the naked student
who was " surfing" behind the minibus on his naked backside, SAPA
said.
</P>
<P>
He lost a lot of skin on his buttocks and back. The road had to
be closed for the emergency helicopter to land, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Two fellow students, in the final year of their medicine
course, had to get dressed first before they could give
professional attention to their wounded friend.

<HEADLINE> More Canadian Teenage Students Use Drugs: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Health Canada survey found 44 percent of boys and 41
percent of girls in Grade 10 used the two kinds of drugs three or
more times last year, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said it is an "alarm" increase since 1994, when
30 percent of boys and 27 percent of girls were reported to be
drug users.
</P>
<P>
The survey will be officially released next month in a report
of Trends in the Health of Canadian Youth as part of a World
Health Organization project.
</P>
<P>
The survey has also registered a large number of students
smoking, getting "really drunk" and cutting class.
</P>
<P>
At least twice in their lives, 43 percent of 15-year-old
Canadian boys and 42 percent of girls have been "really drunk,"
while more than 90 percent have tried alcohol.
</P>
<P>
Skipping class has emerged as another major problem in Canadian
schools, where 22 percent of boys had skipped three or more
classes by Grade 10 and 20 percent of girl students skipped at
least three, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper urged public attention to the "disturbing
behavior that affects school performance for students between
Grade 6 and Grade 10."

People's Republic of China, which falls on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Li visited the Millennium Altar, which is being built between
the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution and China
Central Television Station in western Beijing. The 4.5-hectare

civilization and traditions and the spirit of unity, independence,
and peace, will be completed by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Li was then accompanied by city leaders in a visit to the 43-
kilometer canal that runs from Yuyuantan Park to Kuming Lake in
the Summer Palace, which opened to small boats at the end of July.
</P>
<P>
Li said he was concerned about sewage treatment along the river
and offered advice on how to develop tourism along Beijing's
canals.
</P>
<P>
Li then went to east Forth Ring Road and talked about the
highway construction in the city.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Li visited some new roads like Ping'an Avenue,
Naoshikou Street, and Caishikou Street, where widening has done a
great deal to help relieve Beijing's traffic jam pressures.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Go Ahead With Massive Arms Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government would go ahead with its controversial massive
arms-for-investment deal, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There is no basis for allegations that ruling African National
Congress (ANC) parliamentarians have received kickbacks from rival
bidders aimed at influencing the arms acquisition process, Defense
Minister Patrick Lekota was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He was reacting to Pan Africanist Congress parliamentarian
Patricia de Lille's announcement in the house last week that she
had received a document purportedly from disgruntled ANC
parliamentarians implicating several senior ANC members in
corruption.
</P>
<P>
De Lille had called for a commission of inquiry to investigate
into the controversial deal.
</P>
<P>
Lekota criticized De Lille for not making the source of the
document public, despite requests from various government
quarters.
</P>
<P>
He said he had approached Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town
Njongonkulu Ndungane to prevail on De Lille to make the names
public.
</P>
<P>
Lekota accused De Lille of wanting to raise her profile "at the
expense of using the SANDF (South African National Defense Force)
as a football".
</P>
<P>
The deal, which is worth 24 billion rands (4 billion U.S.
dollars), includes submarines, corvettes, maritime patrol
helicopters, light utility helicopters, fighter trainer planes and
fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
Companies from Sweden, Britain, Germany and Italy were named as
 preferred suppliers of the equipment last November.

NICOSIA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Leaders in Cyprus Wednesday
expressed "shock and sadness" for the unexpected death of Greece's
Alternate Foreign Minister Yiannos Kranidiotis and paid tribute to
his contribution to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Cyrus-born 52-year-old minister and five other people,
including his 23-year-old son, were killed when their aircraft
plunged from a high altitude before landing at the Bucharest
airport in Romania.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides said Kranidiotis' unexpected
death was "a national tragedy" at a crucial time for Cyprus and
has left "a void because he knew the Cyprus issue very well and as
a Cypriot he had a special interest in Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
And he extended condolences to Kranidiotis' family.
</P>
<P>
While describing Kranidiotis' death as "an unexpected tragedy,"
Cyprus Parliament Speaker Spyros Kyprianou said that the late
Greek minister was always involved in solving the Cyprus issue and
in the island's cause of accession to the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Political parties here have also expressed "shock and deep
sorrow" for the death of Kranidiotis.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has declared a three-day mourning period with flags

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji has said that there needs to be a greater effort in
restructuring State-owned enterprises and promoting grain
marketing reform.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark when he made a study tour of north China's
Hebei Province September 12 to 15.
</P>
<P>
He said that, over the past several months, the restructuring
of State-owned enterprises has gone well and that the enterprises
have had marked improvements in returns, and a large number of
them are out of or getting out of the economic mess.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that there has been a favorable turn in the
restructuring and development of State-owned enterprises, he said,
and this has increased people's confidence in the management and
it shows that the Party's restructuring policies are correct and
that the macro-economic measures since last year have been
successful.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, there is still a formidable task in solving
the State-owned enterprise problems and promoting the healthy
development of all enterprises.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin recently presided over a series of
meetings on this issue.

<P>
However, he added, people should be conscious of the fact that
the reforms have gone somewhat unevenly and that there are still
contradictions and problems to be solved, and he pointed out that,
in some places, the government policy of purchasing as much grain
as farmers want to sell has not been fully implemented, while in
other places, government-run grain enterprises offer much lower
prices to farmers.
</P>
<P>
Purchasing as much grain as farmers want to sell is significant,
he emphasized, because it is only in this way that farmers'
interests can be protected when supply exceeds demand.
</P>
<P>
The State's policy on grain marketing reform needs to be
implemented, he went on to stress, especially the policy of buying
as much as farmers want to sell, and it needs to be done for
farmers' sake and for the development of the economy, even if the
State has to provide more subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The premier also said that the restructuring of agriculture and
grain production needs to be speeded up, he concluded.

The 4th Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee is
also expected to make decisions on major enterprise restructuring
and development issues, but to have a breakthrough in this, there
needs to be a greater effort in three areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
First, emphasis should be put on strengthening management and
focus on costs, finances, and quality.
</P>
<P>
Second, enterprises should be market-oriented to increase
technological renovation and development and improve product
structure and product quality.
</P>
<P>
Third, there should be an effort in establishing a more
flexible income distribution system to encourage managers and
staff to work more enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
The premier also attended a State Council meeting on grain for
senior officials from the provinces of Hebei, Jilin, Helongjiang,
Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, and Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Party and government departmental efforts, the
reforms in the country's grain marketing system have achieved good
results, Zhu said, and this smooth progress has helped avoid big
fluctuations in grain prices and helped keep up farmers'
enthusiasm.

decades have attracted the attention of the world. Xinhua began
issuing stories on the country's economy on August 17. This is the

</P>
<P>
There are 66,000 km. of Chinese railway lines and the figure is
expected to grow to more than 70,000 km. in just a few years,
according to Minister of Railways Fu Zhihuan.
</P>
<P>
The country now ranks first in Asia in total length of railway
lines, but, when that figure is divided by the number of people in
Chgina, it is 5 centimeters, the length of a cigarette, Fu told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In addition to that, the railway system is somewhat
unreasonable, because most railways are in coastal areas in the
East, so the Southwest will be given priority in new construction,
he explains.
</P>
<P>
That region includes Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces,
the Guangxi Zhuang and Tibet autonomous regions, and the municipal
area of Chongqing, or 26 percent of China's land. It is rich in

Ten more railway lines are being built and work started this
year on four more in the region and analysts predict that by 2002,
the rail transport capacity in southern China will double.
</P>
<P>
Fu also said that, in addition to the new railway lines, the
entire railway sector needs to be restructured to allow it to
compete with airlines and roads. From 1988 to 1998, the number of
domestic air passengers increased 196 percent and road travel went
up 75 percent. Railways, however, had 20 percent negative growth.
</P>
<P>
The first thing to do is to increase the speed of trains. The
technological renovation drives of 1997 and 1998 brought the
average speed of passenger trains up from 80 km. per hour to 140-
160 kmph on experimental lines.

DALIAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Dalian, the coastal city in
China's Liaoning Province, today began construction work on three
industrial parks for people who have studied abroad and returned
to start their own businesses or do research.
</P>
<P>
The parks, which cover an area totaling 40,000 square meters,

construction is another move by the city government to attract
overseas students. They will be provided with favorable tax,
housing, and other policies to assist them.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech industrial park has already attracted a number of
scholars and students from the United States, Japan, Germany and
Canada who have set up 13 enterprises in electronic information,
biological engineering, and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
According to a Ministry of Education official, in 1996, the

<HEADLINE> Poll: Palestinians Oppose Jerusalem as Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The overwhelming majority
of the Palestinians oppose any solution in the final status talks
which would recognize Jerusalem as the "unified capital" of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The opinion was expressed by 93.7 percent of the Palestinians
in a poll conducted by the Jerusalem-based Jerusalem Media and
Communication Center (JMCC) prior to last month's signing of the
Sharm El Sheikh memo, a revised version of the Wye interim accord.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted among 1,200 Palestinians in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, said the majority of the Palestinians believe that
Jerusalem would constitute the final obstacle to the signing of
a lasting Palestinian-Israeli peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Some 48.9 percent of those surveyed said Jerusalem must be the
capital of Palestine while 6.7 percent said the city should become
an international city and 5.1 percent said it should remain
unified as the capitals of two states.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed 44.5 percent of the Palestinians thought the
"attention and care on Jerusalem" taken by the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) was "not enough," while 33.3 percent
believed the PNA gave "due attention and care" to the city.
</P>
<P>
The new deal signed by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in Egypt stipulates that the two
sides should reach a framework of the final-status talks by next
February and a comprehensive lasting peace treaty by September,
2000.
</P>
<P>
Besides the status of Jerusalem, other thorny issues the two
sides have to face in future talks include the nature and borders
of the Palestinian entity, the fate of over 3 million Palestinian
refugees and the future of the Jewish settlement in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the performance of the PNA, 58.9 percent of the
Palestinians said "good" or "very good" while 34.3 percent said
"bad," the poll said.

<HEADLINE> European Parliament Endorses New EU Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Parliament
Wednesday formally endorsed the new European Commission led by
Romano Prodi, according to reports from Strasbourg, where the
parliament is located.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament deputies voted 404 in favor, 153
against and 37 abstaining to give investiture to the new executive
body of the European Union (EU), which will serve from January 22,
2000 to January 22, 2005.
</P>
<P>
This result helped the EU out of an institutional crisis
beginning six months ago when the outgoing EU commission led by
Jacques Santer resigned en masse because of charges of
administrative irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Prodi and his 19 commissioners will be sworn in at the European
Court of Justice in Luxembourg Friday and will hold their first
formal session in Brussels later that day.
</P>
<P>
A majority of Euro-deputies, including the Christian-Democrats
and their right wing allies, Socialists, Liberals and Greens,
voted in favor, while neo-Communists, Eurosceptics and extreme-
right groups voted against.
</P>
<P>
Some deputies from the British Conservative Party and the
German Christian Democrats had tried to persuade Prodi to replace
the commissioner Philippe Busquin, who is in charge of research,
from the Belgian Socialist Party, alleging he should be
responsible for the food contamination scandals.
</P>
<P>
Prodi rejected their demand but promised to make "profound and
severe examinations."

SHANGHAI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A final part of the Shanghai

</P>
<P>
The 64-kilometer viaduct system cost some 18.2 billion yuan (

government in the early 1990s in response to the increasing number
of traffic jams in the city, especially in the downtown area.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Rise 0.3 Percent in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer prices rose
0.3 percent in August as energy costs surged for a second
consecutive month, the Labor Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In both August and July, energy was the big force pushing
prices upward. For August, two-thirds of the total price increase
was attributed to a 2.7 percent jump in energy costs. Food costs
edged up a small 0.2 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
If excluding the volatile energy and food categories, prices
were up just 0.1 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
This performance of the "core" rate of inflation was even
better than economists' expectations and will provide ammunition
for those arguing there is no need for the Federal Reserve to
boost interest rates for a third time.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, consumer prices have been rising at an annual
rate of 2.6 percent, compared with a gain of just 1.6 percent for
all of 1998. However, all of the increase reflects higher energy
costs, which have rebounded this year after a steep plunge in 1998
that reflected slumping global demand in the wake of steep
recessions in many nations hit by a global currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The August's 2.7 percent jump in energy costs was even bigger
than July's 2.1 percent increase. Gasoline prices advanced 5.6
percent last month and are up 25.1 percent at an annual rate so
far this year.
</P>
<P>
The 0.2 percent rise in food prices in August matched the
modest July increase. Clothing prices fell by 0.3 percent, the
fourth consecutive drop.
</P>
<P>
Airline fares fell by 2.7 percent in August after having posted
a sharp 6.5 percent increase in July.

<HEADLINE> Governor of Bank of Italy Calls For Labor Flexibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Italian central bank's
Governor Antonio Fazio said Wednesday that Italy could achieve
solid growth if the labor market was made more flexible, taxes
were reduced and the public administration was streamlined.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inauguration of a new branch of Bank of Italy,
the central bank, on the outskirts of Rome, Fazio agreed with
analysts that the economy appeared to be picking up again.
</P>
<P>
But he said swift and decisive action was needed to make sure
the recovery gained strength and led to sturdy and constant growth
in coming years.
</P>
<P>
"In Europe and Italy the signs of recovery seen in recent
months are being confirmed," he said. "In order to set off
sustained growth favoring a stable increase in employment, we must
act in a prompt and coordinated way."
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the central banker said, the government needed to
demonstrate with concrete actions that it intended to create the
right conditions for businesses to invest.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Fazio said, a new wage policy was necessary in order
to allow a more flexible use of labor and capital and a closer
correlation between salaries, output and company profits.
</P>
<P>
Lastly, there was still a mound of red-tape standing in the way
of business initiative, he said.
</P>
<P>
What was needed was "a radical streamlining of rules and
procedures, allowing a relationship between citizens, companies
and public bodies which is conducive to economic activity," he
said.

<HEADLINE> S'pore to Develop ICT Industry as Key Growth Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Singapore official
has said his country will make the Information and Communications
Technology (ICT) as the key driver in its Digital Economy and
develop the industry as the key growth sector in Singapore's
economy and society with an aim to transform the city-state into a
"dynamic and vibrant ICT capital."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Chief Information Officer Forum Dinner Held by
the Business Week, Singapore Minister of State for Communications
&AMP; Information Technology and Trade &AMP; Industry Lim Swee Say said
ICT will be the "key driver in the Digital Economy and Information
Society of the future."
</P>
<P>
"We want to develop the ICT sector as the key growth sector in
Singapore's economy," Lim said.
</P>
<P>
Lim said that as a result of its three-phased sustained efforts
over a 20-year period, Singapore has become one of the most
computerized nations in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said Singapore began laying foundation in ICT in 1981 and
progressed through three "developmental stages" -- from the
National Computerization Program of 1981 to 1985, through the
National Information Technology Plan of 1986 to 1990 and to the
1992-launched IT2000 Masterplan under which Singapore promoted the
export of IT products and services.
</P>
<P>
Lim said Singapore's vision in IT2000 is to transform Singapore
into an "Intelligent Island."
</P>
<P>
The three objectives contained in the ICT21 Master Plan are to
develop the ICT industry as the key growth sector in Singapore's
economy, to actively exploit ICT in every major sector of the
economy and to use ICT to enhance the quality of life and standard
of living of Singaporeans in an Information Society.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a finding in a study on Singapore's digital economy
conducted by the National University of Singapore, Lim said
Singapore's digital economy generated about 90 billion Singapore
dollars (54 billion U.S. dollars) in revenue in 1996 and this
encompassed areas like IT goods manufacturing, IT services, IT
wholesale and retail, Telecommunications, media, content services,
business services and research.
</P>
<P>
The average annual growth rate of the digital economy between
1986 and 1996 was 19 percent and the contribution of the digital
economy to Singapore's GDP was estimated at 16 percent in 1996, a
steady rise from 11 percent in 1986, he added.

LHASA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Garry Nehl, the deputy speaker
of the House of Representatives of Australia's Federal Parliament,
said here today that he was surprised at the great changes in the
Tibet Autonomous Region of China.
</P>
<P>
Garry made the remarks during a meeting with Li Liguo, the
deputy secretary of the Communist Party of China's Tibet
Autonomous Region Committee.
</P>
<P>
This is Garry's second visit to Tibet since 1992. He said he
was deeply impressed by the new buildings, schools, hospitals, and
shops he saw over the past four days.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the number of schools in the region went from 3,
000 to over 4,200 in the past seven years, and that 81.3 percent
of school-age children are attending school.
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy of Tibetans also went from 35 years 40 years
ago to 65 years today because of the improved health care, Li said.
However, people in the region lack iodine and suffer from diseases
caused by iodine deficiencies, so aid from the Australia and the
rest of the international community is welcome.

<HEADLINE> Incendiary Device Explodes in N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- An incendiary device exploded
in the doorway of a furniture shop in Northern Ireland Wednesday,
causing no injures.
</P>
<P>
Police said the blast occurred at 11:25 a.m. (1025 GMT) in
Ballycastle, County Antrim. Two other devices have also been
found.
</P>
<P>
The man who owns the Xplorus store, Frank McCahan, said he had
no idea why his premises was targeted and believed the device was
pushed through the letter box.
</P>
<P>
He said the main concern was for people living in an upstairs
flat.
</P>
<P>
He said there was no one in the shop when the fire started, but
other shop owners spotted smoke coming out of the doorway.
</P>
<P>
They called the fire brigade who managed to put the flames out,
and there was only smoke damage to the property.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police said another device was found outside a shop
in Ann Street in the town.
</P>
<P>
A third incendiary was later discovered at a Credit Union
premises in Castle Street in nearby Ballymoney. It was removed
into the street.
</P>
<P>
No warnings were given about any of the devices, according to
the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
</P>
<P>
The police have asked all shopkeepers in both towns to check
their premises.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland First Minister David Trimble said it was too
early to know who was responsible and he was not going to jump to
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously there is concern about any attack, any development
of that nature is not going to encourage confidence in the (peace)
process," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it reinforced his party's concern "about whether the
paramilitaries are really committed to progress and really
committed to implementing the agreement in the way we would like
to."

<HEADLINE> Manila Gives More Incentives to Multinational Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate
Wednesday passed a bill which seeks to give additional incentives
to multinational companies and create a sound economic climate in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The bill, providing tax exemption for regional headquarters
(RHQ) and regional operating headquarters (ROHQ) of multinational
companies, is one of the 25 priority measures certified urgent by
the Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
An RHQ is defined as a foreign business whose purpose is to act
as an administrative branch of a multinational company engaged in
international trade.
</P>
<P>
Meantime, ROHQs, which are allowed to engage in
income-generating activities such as general administration and
planning, business coordination and development, training and
other qualifying services, are required a minimum paid-in capital
of 200,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Ramon Magsaysay, chair of the Senate committee on trade and
commerce, said in his sponsorship speech that the RHQ is a foreign
investor's way of "testing the waters" to find out if a specific
country is a viable investment site.
</P>
<P>
"The presence of regional headquarters sends a signal that the
base country is stable and competitive, with a corps of quality
workforce and facilities," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, exempt from tax and customs duties is
the importation by RHQs and ROHQs of equipment and materials not
available locally for conferences and training.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, they may also import motor vehicles but these
will be subjected to duties and taxes, Magsaysay explained.
</P>
<P>
The bill also extends the validity of multiple entry special
visas granted to foreign personnel to three years.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Philippines is host to 610 RHQs. Hong Kong has
2,100, Malaysia close to 1,000 and Singapore 2,500.
