<HEADLINE> Arafat Urges Clinton to Help Protect Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat is urging U.S. President Bill Clinton to help protect
Mideast peace and said that he hoped 1999 will be "the year of the
independent Palestinian state" with east Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had a meeting scheduled with Clinton Monday in advance
of an international donors' conference, which Clinton opened.
</P>
<P>
Together, they are reviewing implementation of the
land-for-security agreement between Israel and the Palestinian
Authority that Clinton hammered through in October in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Clinton plans to visit Israel, the West Bank and Gaza December
12-15. He will address the Palestinian National Council and
oversee implementation of a critical element of the peace accord
with Israel reached in October.
</P>
<P>
The council, meeting in Gaza on December 14, is due to reaffirm
the revocation of clauses in the Palestine Liberation
Organization's charter calling for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
Monay's aid conference at the State Department is expected to
boost U.S. aid to the Palestinians beyond the 500 million dollars
delivered over the past five years and to get other wealthy
countries to kick in more as well.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader roused the crowd by declaring: "I hope
that this (coming) year will be the year of the independent
Palestinian state.... We say that holy Jerusalem is going to be
its capital."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley said he hoped Monay's
conference, being attended by officials from more than 40
countries, will stimulate the private sector to increase
investment in Palestinian areas.

<HEADLINE> Bayi to Meet Strong Challenge for Defending CBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Bayi Rockets, who are to
seek for their fifth consecutive championship of the Chinese
Basketball Association (CBA), will meet strongest challenge from
both the old and new rivals in the 1998-99 season from December 2
7 to May 2.
</P>
<P>
"It's tougher and tougher for us to defend the title, " said
Wang Fei, coach of the army-based Rockets, who also coaches the
national team for the upcoming Asian Games in Bangkok, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"Our opponents have signed players from the United States or
European countries this season. They get some best ever
foreigners, I think. We have to be careful on our way to defend
the title," Wang added.
</P>
<P>
The Liaoning Hunters, the runner-ups at last two seasons, and
the Shandong Flaming Bulls remain the biggest threats to the
Rockets' championship bid, while the newcomer Beijing Aoshen also
sets their eyes upon the massive triumph.
</P>
<P>
After final playoff defeats to the Rockets for two consecutive
seasons, the Hunters kept a lower tune for the upcoming season
although they have signed two American players and felt stronger
than before.
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing to say about the final results," coach Wu
Qinglong said. "So long as we manage to play every game well, we
think we could gain a reasonable result."
</P>
<P>
Shandong are expected to be one of the dangerous title
contenders for the Army team, who is not allowed to hire any
foreigner in their roster under the military rules.
</P>
<P>
Shandong, third place finisher last season, played the
competition so long without foreign players but received adequate
supported from Gong Xiaobing, the league's Most Valuable Player
and top scorer last season.
</P>
<P>
The Aoshen, who won the CBA B league this summer and was
promoted to the 12-team CBA A league, is headed by 2.01-meter
forward Ma Jian, who returned two years ago from the United
States, where he was selected into the training camp of the Los
Angles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing newcomer was enforced by the arrival of Liu Tie,
top scorer of the former Air Force which quit the league because
of financial problems, and also by hiring two players from
America.
</P>
<P>
Other participating teams in the new season are the Beijing
Ducks, Shanghai Sharks, Guangdong Tigers, Jiangsu Dragons, Jinan
Army Pegasus, Zhejiang Cyclone, Sichuan Pandas and Jilin
Northeast Tigers, who placed last second in 1995 and dropped to
CBA B league.
</P>
<P>
Jilin, led by star forward Sunjun, returned the premier
competition as replacements after the Air Force withdrew in
September.
</P>
<P>
The Bayi, who only lost three games each season in past two,
also face a new test in the physical constitution. Under a FIBA's
4x12 rule in the new season, a game will be played for 48 minutes
- - four periods with 12 minutes each - - eight minutes longer
than before.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cambodia's Hun Sen Government Formed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's new coalition
government led by sole premier Hun Sen was officially formed and
sworn in on Monday, ending months of crisis and assuring the
return of stability to the country.
</P>
<P>
The new government won a vote of confidence in parliament with
99 votes for, 13 against and three abstentions and one invalid. A
total of 116 out of the 122 parliamentarians participated in the
vote. The opposition Sam Rainsy Party's 10 lawmakers voted against
the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The vote brought legitimacy to the government for the first
time in nearly 17 months after factional fighting broken out in
July last year and toppled then first prime minister Prince
Norodom Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
A 19-page platform read out by Hun Sen expounds the new
government's internal and external policies of "peace, stability,
democracy and development" in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
It states that Cambodia would have friendly relations with all
countries, particularly its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
To reach the country's economic goals "needs contributions both
domestically and internationally in a process of developing the
national economy," the platform said.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, nominated by his Cambodian People's Party (CPP) for
the sole premier, was named new prime minister by King Norodom
Sihanouk on Wednesday night and was appointed to form a new
government.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, who has been prime minister since 1985, will lead a
new coalition government, labeled as an "economic government" by
the CPP, for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
In the new government, the CPP holds 12 ministers among 25
ministries while FUNCINPEC led by Prince Ranariddh gains 11. The
two key ministries of defense and interior still have
co-ministers.
</P>
<P>
SRP President Sam Rainsy said at Monday's Assembly meeting that
his party supports the program FUNCINPEC and the CPP have agreed
upon, although it is incomplete.
</P>
<P>
"But we are not for the government because of un-investigated
election-related complaints and the lack of change between the
last government and the new one," said Sam Rainsy.
</P>
<P>
"As the opposition, the SRP will create a shadow cabinet to
criticize the action of the government and to suggest improvements
and changes in policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The CPP led by Hun Sen won 64 parliamentary seats in the July
26 election, but failed to obtain the required two-thirds to form
a government of its own.
</P>
<P>
FUNCINPEC and the SRP, which won the remainder of the seats,
rejected the outcome of the election unless their complaints were
resolved, a move that led to a political deadlock for nearly four
months.
</P>
<P>
Under the mediation of King Norodom Sihanouk, the CPP and
FUNCINPEC agreed to share power to break the deadlock in a summit
meeting held in the Royal Palace on November 12 and 13.
</P>
<P>
The two parties reached agreement to form a coalition
government, and decided to amend the Constitution to establish a
new Senate. CPP President Chea Sim will chair the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh, on the other hand, was voted in last week as
president of the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed on second premier Hun Sen becoming the sole
prime minister of the new government.
</P>
<P>
The CPP agreed to offer almost half of the portfolios in the
new government to its coalition partner FUNCINPEC, and the SRP is
left in opposition.
</P>
<P>
The new government is the second CPP-FUNCINPEC coalition. The
first one collapsed after last year's factional fighting in which
then first prime minister Prince Ranariddh was ousted.
</P>
<P>
The CPP-led government had hoped to retain power and gain
legitimacy through the July 26 elections, so as to restore the
country's seat in the United Nations and regain the foreign aid
that was lost after violence flared up in July last year. It was
also eager to join the Association of Southeast Asian Nations at
an early date.
</P>
<P>
It was widely believed that with the formation of the new
government, Cambodia's chances of becoming a member of ASEAN are
becoming greater. The regional grouping is to hold a summit
meeting in mid-December in Vietnam.

BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
reiterated here Monday that China will work with the international

economic reconstruction in the Palestinian self-rule area.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy to see that the just cause of the Palestinian
people to regain their legitimate national rights has won more and
more extensive sympathy," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that important progress has been made in the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks and the Palestinian people have
finally realized self-rule on their own territory.
</P>
<P>
He termed a recent peace agreement signed in the United States
between the Palestinians and Israel a victory in the just cause
of the Palestinian people and an important step toward the lofty
goal of establishing an independent Palestinian state.

<P>
ATHENS, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Greece confirmed on Monday that
Athens was in contact with other European Union (EU) countries on
the issue of Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan,
who is currently under house arrest in Italy after his arrival in
Rome several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that the
contacts, which aimed at holding a meeting on the Kurdish problem,
were being carried out at the ministerial level, according to the
semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA).
</P>
<P>
A Rome court has rejected Turkey's demand for the extradition
of Ocalan to Turkey, saying that the Italian constitution forbids
extradition of suspects to a country where they could face the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Later last week, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said that
his country backed Italy to extend political asylum to Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Premier also stated that Athens supported the
recognition of the rights and identity of the Kurds and hoped the
Kurdish problem could be resolved through peaceful means.

Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was among the delegates from

</P>
<P>
"Today our purpose is to send a clear signal that this peace is

Palestinians, good for Israelis, good for the region and the
world, Clinton said in addressing the opening ceremony of the

<P>
SINGAPORE, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Minister for
Foreign Affairs S Jayakumar has ruled out the possibility of
admitting Cambodia into ASEAN before the regional grouping's
summit in Hanoi in December, according to his press secretary.
</P>
<P>
The secretary, who did not identify himself, quoted Jayakumar
as saying in a reply to press queries that he has no plans to
convene any special meeting or emergency meeting of ASEAN foreign
ministers and does not think the Cambodian issue will be the main
focus at the Hanoi summit.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar said it is not practical to convene such a meeting
now because several foreign ministers from the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are traveling abroad and will only
return to their countries just before they are to depart for
Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
"The priority for the Hanoi meeting is for ASEAN to send clear
signal to the world that it will act in unison and show its
resolve to overcome the financial and economic crises," Jayakumar
said, adding: "That is the main challenge for the Hanoi summit."
</P>
<P>
But Jayakumar said he would be consulting with his ASEAN
counterparts on the question of Cambodia's admission Into ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
"As Chairman of the ASEAN Standing Committee, I will be
considering with ASEAN Foreign Ministers in the course of the next
few days," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN had refused to consider Cambodia's admission into ASEAN
until a new government is formed after the general elections in
July this year. A new coalition government in Cambodia was sworn
in Monday.

ULAN BATOR, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Mongolian People's

</P>
<P>
The party's parliament group will only attend meetings which

Mongolian President Nachagyn Bagabandy has turned down several

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Raises Retirement Age of Oil Workers to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
raised the mandatory retirement age of Nigerian oil workers from
55 years to 60 years to pursue a Nigerianization policy in the
oil industry.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum issued by the Special Adviser to the Head of
State on Petroelum Resources, Aret Adams, the government directed
all chief executives of oil companies to begin immediate
implementation of the policy.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government said that the increase in the
retirement age for oil workers was done in the nation's interest,
Daily Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the new development at the weekend, top oil
industry officials commended the government for raising the
retirement age limit, saying that if the retirement age is at age
55, " Nigeria will continuously lose the services of the crop of
its well-trained citizens."
</P>
<P>
The government's decision ended the two-year battle by the oil
workers against what they termed premature disengagement from
service by their employment.
</P>
<P>
The workers stated that while Nigerians were retired at the
age of 55, the companies, mostly foreign owned, brought in
expatriate who were between 60 and 65 years old as replacements.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 30 (Xinhua) -- United States Commerce
Secretary William Daley arrived in Cape Town on Monday afternoon
to begin his four-nation African tour.
</P>
<P>
Intellectual property rights, tax and tariff issues will be on
the agenda when he holds talks with South African Trade and
Industry Minister Alec Erwin on Tuesday, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Daley said the visit was aimed at extending the already strong
trade relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He is leading a 16-member delegation comprising senior
executives from some of America's largest companies.
</P>
<P>
Daley said the companies would be looking at potential
business opportunities in the region.
</P>
<P>
Asked about reports that U.S. companies were worried about
being sidelined in South Africa by their counterparts in the
European Union, which is expected to conclude a trade deal with
South Africa soon, Daley said he believed there was enough
business for everyone.
</P>
<P>
Daley is scheduled to hold talks with Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki and attend a high profile trade and investment conference
in Cape Town, where he will deliver a key-not address.
</P>
<P>
From South Africa, he will travel to Nigeria, Kenya and Cote

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Banana May Have Left Botswana: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 30 (Xinhua) -- There was little chance
that convicted former Zimbabwean president Canaan Banana was
still in Botswana, South African Press Association quoted
Botswanan police as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
"My people have not seen or heard anything of him over the
weekend. I think he has skipped the country. I don't think he is
around," said Botswanan deputy police commissioner Edwin Batshu.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe High Court was informed last Thursday that Banana
had fled to Botswana after he failed to arrive for his court
hearing.
</P>
<P>
He was found guilty in absentia on 11 counts of sodomy,
attempted sodomy and indecent assault.
</P>
<P>
Botswanan police launched a search for Banana after receiving
a warrant for his arrest from the Zimbabwe High Court.
</P>
<P>
Batshu said there was no indication that Banana was being
sheltered by anyone in the country. There were reports last week
that Banana was being sheltered by Botswana Anglican Archbishop
Walter Makhulu and planned to seek asylum.
</P>
<P>
Should Banana be arrested in Botswana, he not only faces
extradition but charges of entering a country illegally. His
passport had been confiscated by Zimbabwean authorities.
</P>
<P>
Homosexual acts are also criminal offenses in Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Banana was president from 1980 to 1987. Charges against him
centered around sexual offenses he committed with members of his
staff during his presidency.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Aid Increase to Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced on Monday his administration plans to boost aid to the
Palestinians by 400 million U.S. dollars while extending its
current assistance program of 100 million U.S. dollars a year for
five more years.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the pledge at the Conference to Support Middle
East Peace and Development when he opened the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was among the delegates from
44 countries and six international organizations, including the
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the United
Nations, attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I promised the continuing support of the United States as we
move ahead in the next phase of the peace process. That phase
begins today with this conference," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"Today our purpose is to send a clear signal that this peace is
more than a piece of paper, that the promise imagined at Oslo can
become a concrete reality; a true peace, a growing peace, good for
Palestinians, good for Israelis, good for the region and the
world, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton appealed for generous contribution. "There has been too
little tangible improvement in the life of the Palestinian
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lasting peace has little chance of taking hold "if it does not
deliver results for ordinary people," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was staging the conference "to send a clear signal
that this peace is more than a piece of paper." Clinton added: "We
must convince those who have invested so much in this process that
it was a sound investment."
</P>
<P>
The increase in U.S. aid, which is subject to congressional
approval, was announced after Clinton met with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Arafat had reaffirmed his pledge to uphold his
side of agreements with Israel and to work with Israel to ensure
security.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. money is designed to spur stepped-up contributions
from more than 40 nations assembled here for a one-day conference
on economic assistance for the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, 2.3 billion U.S. dollars was pledged, "and I
would expect we will do that again," White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said in telling reporters about the boost before Clinton
spoke.
</P>
<P>
The nearly doubling of U.S. aid is based on the notion that
combating poverty in Palestinian-controlled areas will promote
peace agreements with Israel and curb conflict.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, 2.3 billion U.S. dollars was pledged at a
similar conference to assist the Palestinians in the West Bank and
in Gaza. A total of 2.1 billion U.S. dollars was disbursed.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Arafat, addressing a gathering of Arab-Americans in
suburban Virginia, said constant U.S. attention is crucial because
"there are enemies of peace in more than one place."

<HEADLINE> Annan Expresses Support for Peace Process in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday voiced his strong support for the peace
process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the International Day of Solidarity with the
Palestinian People, which is observed annually on November 30,
Annan, who is now in Africa for a visit, said this occasion
provides the international community with an opportunity and an
obligation to refocus its attention on the distressing fact that,
after more than a half century, the issue of Palestine remained
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
"Since taking office, I have made every effort to support the
peace process in the Middle East and to mobilize the resources of
the United Nations family to help create an economic and social
environment favorable to peace," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"When I visited the region earlier this year, I witnessed the
hardship and deprivation caused by decades of conflict, as well as
the yearning on all sides for a peaceful future," Anna continued.
</P>
<P>
"I took the opportunity to appeal to the leaders of all parties
to continue building on the achievements of the peace process, to
make every effort to resume the negotiations in earnest, and to
take the difficult decisions needed to move towards reconciliation
and cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The recent signing of the Wye River Memorandum by Israel and
the Palestine Liberation Organization was a encouraging
development, said Annan, adding that it was hoped that the
agreement would be implemented in all its aspects and would pave
the way for the resumption of negotiations on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief appealed again to the parties not to be swayed
by incidents of violence by elements opposed to the peace process,
but instead, to redouble their efforts in pursuit of a lasting
solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Annan stressed that it was necessary for the parties to address
not only the manifestations, but also the causes of violence, to
restore hope, mutual confidence and a spirit of partnership and to
work together for a future of peace, cooperation and
good-neighbourliness.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the United Nations family would continue to provide
all possible expertise and assistance in humanitarian relief and
economic and social development in order to contribute towards
creating the necessary conditions for peace.

<HEADLINE> Oscar Wilde Remembered with Statue Set up in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- A bronze statue of Oscar Wilde
was unveiled in Adelaide Street in central London on Monday to
remember the famous playwright and author who scandalised
Victorian Britain.
</P>
<P>
The bronze memorial, the first such statue in Britain, is
inscribed with his words: "We are all in the gutter, but some of
us are looking at the stars."
</P>
<P>
Maggi Hambling, the sculptor of the statue, said: "The idea is
that he is rising, talking, laughing, smoking from this
sarcophagus and the passer by, should he or she choose to, can sit
on the sarcophagus and have a conversation with him.
</P>
<P>
Wilde's grandson Merlin Holland was present and great-grandson
Lucian Holland helped actor and comedian Stephen Fry unveil the
West End memorial.
</P>
<P>
Fry, who portrayed Wilde in a recent film, said: "I think it is
wonderful, a wonderful monument for the people of London and of
England.
</P>
<P>
"He is depicted with a cigarette which in his day was a symbol
of a young man's decadence and modernity and which is now a symbol
of political incorrectness.
</P>
<P>
Culture Secretary Chris Smith said: "He wrote like an angel,
challenged prejudice, he took on the establishment and its
perceptions.
</P>
<P>
"It's due to Oscar Wilde in many ways that we today can
celebrate a society that generally appreciates diversity and the
richness of diversity in our community," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wilde, the writer of The Importance Of Being Earnest, died in
1900 in self-imposed exile in France after serving a debilitating
prison sentence for homosexuality offences.

<HEADLINE> ECA Warns of Food Insecurity in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) warned on Monday afternoon
that food insecurity is expected to accelerate substantially in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The warning is made by P.K. Makinwa-Adebusoye, director of ECA
Food Security and Sustainable Development Division (FSSDD), when
she opened a high level expert group meeting on agriculture and
environment here at the United Nations Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
The FSSDD chief noted that sub-Saharan Africa's share of the
world's food insecure population is projected to increase
substantially in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, she said, every 3rd person in sub-Saharan Africa is
likely to be food insecure compared to every 8th person in
Southeast Asia and every 20th person in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Environmental degradation such as soil erosion,
desertification and deforestation is seriously undermining the
very resources on which many African farmers and their families
depend for increasing their agricultural productivity," she
noted, adding "as a result, about 44 percent of Africa's
population live below the poverty line earning an income of about
39 U.S. Dollars per month."
</P>
<P>
According to her analysis, two basic pressures account
generally for the continued deterioration in the quality of life
of the average African.
</P>
<P>
First is the population growth rate which far exceeds that of
per capita food production in most African countries; second is
rapid deterioration of environment caused by soil erosion,
desertification, deforestation and environmentally damaging
agricultural practices which have led to declining land
productivity on the continent.
</P>
<P>
"Food insecurity, rapid population growth and environmental
degradation constitute a very important challenge for public
policy in Africa today," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
There is an emerging consensus on the need to tackle the
inter-linked issues of population, environment and food security
in a holistic and integrated manner so as to alleviate poverty,
attain food security and ensure sustained economic growth and
sustainable economic development, she said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting has drawn representatives from South
Africa, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria and Sierra
leone, World Bank and International organizations. Participants
will deliberate a guide to FSSDD's work program 1998-99 and
proposed work program for 2000-2001 prepared by the FSSDD.

<HEADLINE> Agriculture Expected to Grow by 3.2 Percent in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's agricultural and
the service sectors are expected to grow by 3.2 percent and 4
percent respectively this year while manufacturing and mining are
projected to grow by 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Leonard Tsumba, governor of Zimbabwean Reserve Bank, made the
remarks here Monday in his monetary policy statement for 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that the overall economic performance during
the first half of the year had remained weak as a result of
increased exchange rate volatility, high inflation and soaring
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"On a year-on-year basis, the manufacturing sector contracted
by 0.4 percent over the six months to June. Mining for the
period up to April 1998, declined by seven percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Manufacturing and mining output over the remainder of 1998
will, thus, have to improve significantly if the estimated 2.4
percent overall economic growth is to be attained. This,
however, is unlikely," he said.
</P>
<P>
The external sector continued to be under pressure with
exports projected to fall by nine percent during 1998, aggravated
by low international commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
"These negative factors have been compounded by import demand
which has remained relatively high.
</P>
<P>
"Notwithstanding the fall in imports, the current account
deficit for 1998 will be about 7.4 percent of gross domestic
production," he said, adding that an overall balance of payments
deficit of 346 million U.S. Dollars is anticipated by the end of
1998.

<HEADLINE> Dobson Unveils Social Services Shake-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The British government on
Monday unveiled a tough new system of independent inspectors with
the power to mount spot-checks on children's and elderly people's
homes.
</P>
<P>
Publishing proposals for sweeping changes to social services,
Health Secretary Frank Dobson confirmed that eight new regional
Commissions for Care Standards will be set up to replace the
current system of local authorities inspecting their own homes.
</P>
<P>
The new commissions will have the power to make surprise
inspections on state-run and private residential homes to check on
accommodation, food and hygiene. They will also be able to lay
down demanding performance standards for homes and to close down
those which fail to meet them.
</P>
<P>
Dobson, announcing the changes in the Commons, told MPs the new
system would "create a modern and dependable social services".
</P>
<P>
The government's aim is to provide a social services system for
people that "promotes rather than diminishes their independence".
</P>
<P>
Each regional commission would have a Children's Rights
Officer, to inspect children's services, safeguard children and
"thoroughly investigate" allegations of harm or abuse.
</P>
<P>
Current social services training was not up to scratch, Dobson
said, so he was abolishing the Central Council for Education and
Training in Social Work and replacing it with a General Social
Care Council to regulate everyone involved in social care, not
just social workers.
</P>
<P>
The health secretary's reforms add up to the biggest shake-up
of social services in England and Wales since the system was
created more than 30 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Symposium on AIDS Challenges Held in U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 30 (Xinhua) -- A symposium on AIDS was
convened here on Monday to discuss the global challenges of the
killing disease.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, sponsored by the American Foundation for AIDS
Research, was held on the eve of the World AIDS Day, which falls
on December 1.
</P>
<P>
The symposium mainly focused on the subject "Global Challenges
of the AIDS Epidemic: Perspectives." Present at the discussion
were Great Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, Princess
Chulabhorn of Thailand, and representatives from the World Bank,
and experts from some U.S. institutes and universities.
</P>
<P>
AIDS is the short from for "Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome," which applies only to the advanced stage of HIV
disease.
</P>
<P>
In his message to the World AIDS Day, whose theme this year is
"Be a Force for Change," Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that by
the end of this month, the number of adults and children living
with HIV will exceed 33 million -- 10 percent more than a year
ago. AIDS has already taken 14 million lives.
</P>
<P>
"At least 95 percent of all infections and deaths occur in the
developing world, where the costly new medicines that can help
prolong lives are scarcely available or affordable," said Annan,
who is currently on a visit to Algeria.
</P>
<P>
"There is still no cure" to the epidemic, Annan said, "The
advance of HIV has not been stopped in any country. Even in West
Europe and North America, around 75,000 people were affected last
year," he added.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) decided in January 1988 to
designate December 1 as the World AIDS Day every year in a bid to
promote public awareness on the No.1 killer in the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Governor of Zimbabwean Reserve
Bank, Leonard Tsumba, said Monday that the country's balance of
payments and the exchange rate had continued to be under severe
pressure since April this year.
</P>
<P>
Domestic inflation, at 34.3 percent as of October, remained
unsustainably high, he said. Meanwhile, the Zimbabwean Dollar
was undervalued by more than 50 percent at 37 units to the U.S.
currency.
</P>
<P>
Announcing his monetary policy statement for the year at a
news conference in Harare, Tsumba said there were, however, some
positive trends on the monetary and fiscal fronts with annual
money supply growth declining from 35 percent in December 1997 to
22.6 percent by September this year.
</P>
<P>
The government has approached the donor community for an
additional 300 million U.S. Dollars to finance the country's
payments position.
</P>
<P>
"These initiatives should improve foreign exchange holdings
from the current levels of two months of cash import cover to
three and therefore further stabilise the Zimbabwean Dollar," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Rules out Unconditional Withdrawal From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu Monday ruled out the possibility of pulling
out Israeli troops from south Lebanon without any security
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Netanyahu said that the
first priority of his government on the issue is protecting the
Israeli residents living along the border with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Following the killing of seven Israeli soldiers in south
Lebanon during the last two weeks, the Israeli security cabinet
held a four-hour meeting on Sunday to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told the radio that "I didn't hear a single minister
say we should just tuck our tail and get out."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister stressed that "we have the responsibility
to do the right thing for the state of Israel, not for the next
newscast."
</P>
<P>
He noted that measures will be taken to reduce casualties among
Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said on
Monday that keeping Israeli troops in south Lebanon is the only
option to protect northern Israel from being attacked.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel is making efforts to find a political
solution to the conflict in south Lebanon, but none is attainable
now.
</P>
<P>
However, many Israelis have called for Israeli withdrawal from
south Lebanon as the casualties among Israeli soldiers mounted.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Beilin, Knesset (parliament) member of the opposition
Labor Party, reiterated on Monday his support for a unilateral
withdrawal from south Lebanon.

He called "the security zone" in south Lebanon, set up by
Israel in 1985 to protect its north from cross-border guerrilla
attacks, was a "death trap," criticizing the government for
gambling on soldiers' lives.
</P>
<P>
Several peace groups held demonstrations outside Netanyahu's
office on Sunday, calling on the government to withdraw from south
Lebanon as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
In April, Israel accepted Resolution 425 of the United Nations
Security Council, which calls for Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon. But the Israeli government said that it must get
security guarantees from the Lebanese government first before the
Israeli troops are pulled out.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government insists however that the
U.N. resolution demands an unconditional withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Mark World's AIDS Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Uganda will join the rest of
the world countries Tuesday in marking the World's AIDS Day by
placing focus on young people.
</P>
<P>
Young people are given this attention because they have
special vulnerability to the epidemic, Radio Uganda reported
Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
The first case of AIDS was reportedly found in Uganda in 1982
and now an estimated two million people, mostly the youth, in the
country are HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
Although the government has been trying to reduce the number
of those affected by the fatal killer, it is far from enough to
check the spread of the disease because the AIDS drugs are still
too expensive for average Ugandans.
</P>
<P>
Africa is the continent which suffers most from AIDS. About 70
percent of new infections in the world are in sub-Sahara Africa.
Half of them are young people.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 34 million people in the world are
HIV-positive or AIDS patients. A total of 14 million have died
of AIDS since the pandemic was discovered on earth.
</P>
<P>
Unhealthy sexual behavior and drug addiction are the two main
ways through which young people fall victim to AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Experts: Wind Power Can Meet 10 Percent of World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Wind power could meet about 10
percent of world electricity needs in the next 25 years, energy
experts said while attending a renewable energy sources (RES)
conference which began here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The conference, entitled "Renawable Sources of Energy and their
Application in Greece," is being organized by the Athens
Polytechnic with the aim of promoting clean energy sources and
creating a national strategy for developing large scale projects
in the sector.
</P>
<P>
EU Energy Commissioner Christos Papoutsis said that Greece,
which now employs 3,000 workers in the RES sector, could by the
year 2010 have 30,000-40,000 workers if a commission's white paper
would be implemented along with offering domestic incentives.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed that Greece should adopt use of RES in the
construction of facilities for the Athens 2004 Olympic games
projects.
</P>
<P>
Greek Public Works, Town Planning and Environment
Undersecretary Theodore Kliopanos said that Greece currently
exploited only 3.0 percent of RES, half the European average of
6.0 percent.

<HEADLINE> French President Supports Compensations to Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 30 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Monday said that the time has come for European countries and
others to return to Jews all the properties which were robbed by
Nazis during World War II but failed to go back to their owners.
</P>
<P>
``Today I am thinking about millions of men, women and children
who were victims of the murderous folly of the Nazis and their
accomplices. The question of reparation is now presented with
urgency,'' said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement during a visit to a new museum on Jewish
culture in France which opened in the Marais district of Paris,
where many Jews lived before being deported during the war.
</P>
<P>
Forty-four countries, including France, opened Monday in
Washington a conference on returning the objects of arts and other
properties robbed from the Jews by Nazis.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said last Saturday that the
French government would spend 50 million francs (8 million U.S.
dollars) to establish a foundation in memory of the Holocaust,
which is called ``Le Shoah'' by French Jews.
</P>
<P>
A monument in memory of the Unknwon Jewish Victim of the
Holocaust will be set up in Paris, he said.
</P>
<P>
The French embassy in Tel Aviv Monday rejected accusation by
Israel that French national archives refused to open documents
concerning Jewish properties robbed under the Vichy
collaborationist regime.
</P>
<P>
The embassy said that French national archives have opened all
relevant documents from 1940 to 1944.
</P>
<P>
French banks said that they support the initiative by the
government and will ``continue to cooperate fully '' to meet the
demands from individual Jewish families for compensations.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jospin suggested the creation of an official
body by the banks to deal with requests by individuals, whose
family members suffered from anti-Jewish laws during the Vichy
period.

UNITED NATIONS, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The president of the
53rd General Assembly session, Didier Opertti, Monday called on
the parties to honor the recently-signed Wye River Memorandum, and
pledged the United Nations would step up its efforts to advance
the long-stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The president made the statement on the occasion of the
International Day of Solidarity With the Palestinian People. The
United Nations convened a meeting marking the International Day.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely essential for the agreements to be
scrupulously respected and for the parties to refrain from
engaging in unilateral acts in pursuit of advantage on the
ground," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The signing of the Wye River Menorandum, its subsequent
ratification and gradual implementation, as well as the beginning
of the permanent status talks, show that both parties are
committed to proceed along the road to peace in accordance with
the existing agreements," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Helping the Palestinian people to establish solid foundations
for peace through the mobilization of international assistance for
economic and social development is another task of the
international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations family of organizations, in cooperation
with donor countries and the international community as a whole,
must intensify their efforts in this regard so as to enable the
Palestinian people, who have suffered for so long, to begin
enjoying the fruits of peace," he said.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Denies Reported Discussion on POWs Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait on Monday denied
reported discussions between its Parliament Speaker Ahmed
Al-Sadoun and Secretary General of the Arab League (AL) Esmat
Abdul-Meguid on Iraq's demand for direct negotiations before
releasing Kuwaiti prisoners of war (POWs).
</P>
<P>
"The matter has been denied," Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber
Al-Sabah, first deputy prime minister and foreign minister, told
the Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti newspapers on Monday quoted the correspondent of the
Kuwait Journalists Association, who was accompanying the speaker
to Cairo, as saying the AL chief said Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein demanded last February direct negotiations if Kuwait wants
to see their POWs released.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah said that "when we asked our delegate to the Arab
League Abdulal Al-Qinai who attended the meeting, he denied the
issue was discussed between Dr. Esmat and Ahmed Al-Sadoun."
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, Speaker Ahmed will return home tonight and we will
listen to him about the matter," he continued.
</P>
<P>
After meeting in Cairo with Abdul-Meguid, Ahmed told reporters
that Iraq was still refusing to uncover the fate of more than 600
Kuwaiti POWs and detainees.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait insists that the POWs are still held in Iraqi jails
since 1991 when Iraqi troops were driven out of Kuwait by the
allied forces.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq denied that it holds any Kuwaiti POWs.

<P>
CAIRO, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The coming months will witness a
series of events staged to promote the Romanian-Egyptian ties,
said Romanian ambassador to Egypt Doru Costea on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Middle East News Agency on the eve
of Romania's National Day, which falls on December 1, Doru Costea
said the Romanians are looking forward to Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak's visit to the country next year.
</P>
<P>
Costea expressed satisfaction with the smooth development of
bilateral ties, especially since the signing in 1994 of an
agreement, which he said drew up new political framework for
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In December, the Romanian-Egyptian Cooperation Committee will
hold its first session in Bucharest, capital of Romania, to
discuss economic cooperation, including launch of joint projects,
the Romanian diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Another joint committee for trade cooperation is also to meet
early next year in Bucharest, seeking ways to increase trade
volume, which now stands at 500 million U.S. dollars a year, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Costea described as "successful" the relations
between the private sectors of the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Set Up Task Force to Monitor AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Health Minister
Adem Ibrahim said Monday that a task force will be established
soon to oversee the implementation of AIDS policy.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here to mark this year's World AIDS Day
which falls on Tuesday (December 1), the minister said the
nation's AIDS policy, which was issued last August, greatly
assists efforts to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, to care for
AIDS patients and reduce the epidemic's socio-economic
consequences.
</P>
<P>
The task force will work out a strategy for the implementation
of the policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the deadly disease which surfaced
in Ethiopia 14 years ago is spreading at an alarming rate, and
efforts made to date to contain the spread of the disease have
not produced the desired result.
</P>
<P>
Two to three million people are infected with HIV in Ethiopia
and seven percent of the people within the 15 and 49 age bracket
are carriers, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is one of the countries highly affected by the
epidemic. According to the United Nations Theme Group on
HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS Ethiopia), by the end of 1997, there were
estimated 2.5 million people living with HIV while the overall
adult prevalence of HIV was estimated at 7.4 percent, being 3-7
percent in rural and 15-19 percent in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
This year's World AIDS Day is celebrated to call for increased
attention for the youth, the prime victims of the deadly disease.

HARARE, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) Monday put off mass job stay-aways until further
notice to give room for negotiations on a list of demands
submitted last week, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Harare, both ZCTU President Gibson
Sibanda and Secretary-General Morgan Tsvangirayi, said the
government had responded to its demands this week and asked for
further negotiations to try and resolve the problems of workers.
</P>
<P>
"The government responded in a letter which says they are keen
to hold the discussions on the long list of demands we presented
which they said would need more than one meeting to resolve,"
Sibanda said.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the government response and our commitment to our
request for an urgent negotiating forum, the national executive
committee has decided to give the talks a chance and to test
government sincerity," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Should no progress come from the negotiations, the
general council will have no choice but to implement another
stayaway."
</P>
<P>
Among demands being made by the labor movement are that the
government should reduce public expenditure by downing the size
of cabinet from 55 to 15 and restructure amalgamated ministries.
</P>
<P>
On the presidential decree announced last Saturday banning
mass job stay-aways, the ZCTU said it was consulting its lawyers
to advise on the most appropriate legal action.

It is not only the makers of soft drinks who should take a

help out as they have an indirect responsibility to clean the
environment, she said.
</P>
<P>
A lot of options are currently being discussed with a view of
coming up with certain strategies which will see other uses of
empty plastic bottles, she noted.

TEHRAN, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Deputy Foreign
Minister for Euro-American Affairs Morteza Sarmadi said here
Monday that Iran and the European Union (EU) troika will hold
second round of talks in Vienna, Austria, next month.
</P>
<P>
He said that deputy foreign ministers of Iran and Austria,
Britain and Germany will attend the talks scheduled on December
18, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The first round of talks between Iran and the EU troika was
held in Tehran on July 18.
</P>
<P>
Sarmadi said that an expert meeting between Iran and the EU
will be held in Brussels on December 10 to discuss trade, energy
management and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also touch on issues including campaign
against drug-trafficking and cooperation in refugee-related
matters.
</P>
<P>
The EU started "critical dialogue" with Iran in 1992 in a bid
to influence Iran's stances on the Middle East peace process,
international anti-terrorism and control of weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
After seven rounds of talks, the dialogue was suspended in
April, 1997 after a Berlin court verdict accused Iranian leaders
of being behind a terrorist assassination of Iranian dissidents in
Germany.

In March, the EU decided to resume the talks after the two
sides ended diplomatic rows over the dispute.

<HEADLINE> Potsdam Summit to Enhance German-Franch Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 30 (Xinhua) -- In seeking to reinvigorate and
enhance German-Franch ties, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder opened
his first summit with French leaders on Monday in Potsdam near
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The tow-day meeting was expected to focus on Bonn's upcoming
presidency of the European Union (EU) and German-French
differences over future funding of the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder and members of his cabinet were due to have talks
with French President Jacques Chirac, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
and Franch government ministers.
</P>
<P>
Observers expect the two-day summit to yield plenty of lofty
rhetoric on the continued importance of the Paris-Bonn axis.
</P>
<P>
But on concrete EU issues there was continued public division
just hours before the summit started. Deputy German Foreign
Minister, Guenter Verheugen, said there was no agreement with
Paris over cutting Bonn's annual payments to the EU-15 nation
bloc.
</P>
<P>
Farm aid remained one of the toughest sticking points between
Bonn and Paris, he said also.
</P>
<P>
Germany is by far the EU's biggest paymaster with annual net
contributions reaching some 12.4 billion dollars, compared to just
0.47 billion dollars for France. Both Schroeder and former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl have demanded a rebate from Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said he hoped to reach agreement on reforming the EU
budget, revamping farm subsidies and EU regional aid policies -
the so-called Agenda 2000 package - during the German presidency
of the EU in first semi-annual 1999.
</P>
<P>
Linked to these issues, Schreder and Chirac will seek to hammer
out a joint position at Potsdam for the December 11-12 EU summit
in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
The semi-annual German-French summits, held since the 1960s,
are meant to underscore Bonn and Paris as Europe's motor and the
peaceful relations between them.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Russia Increases Its IMF Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Before the visit by the IMF
Managing Director to Moscow the Russian government has decided to
increase the country's quota in the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, under the decision
Russia's quota has been increased from SDR (special drawing right)
4,313 million to SDR 5,945.3 million.
</P>
<P>
The government's information department said on Monday that the
decision made on November 25 will allow Russia to maintain its
influence on the fund's decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
It said that "The Russian Federation, which is an IMF member,
owns a certain part of the fund's capital, which enables it to
have its own directorate there with deciding voting power. This
allows (Russia) to influence decisions made by the fund."
</P>
<P>
In January 1998, the IMF board of directors decided to review
the members's quotas. Russia's decision was made in order to
retain its position in the fund, the report said.
</P>
<P>
SDRs were introduced in 1970 as a substitute for gold in
international payments. Since then they have become the principle
reserve asset in the international monetary system.
</P>
<P>
Russia officially became the 165th member of the IMF On June
1, 1992, and its quota was 2.91 percent of the fund.
</P>
<P>
Russian Finance Minister Mikhai Zadornov said Monday that the
visit of IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus scheduled for
December 1-2 is very important for continuing talks on Russia's
program for foreign borrowing next year.
</P>
<P>
Zadornov disclosed that the celling for Russia's borrowing
until the end of next year is 10.3 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman: Clinton Unlikely to Appear Before Judiciary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- A White House Spokesman
said Monday President Bill Clinton is not likely to accept an
invitation to testify next week before the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's very likely you'll see the president appear
before that committee," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told
reporters in reference to the invitation the committee extended to
Clinton to answer questions about the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
The House is expected to vote in mid-December on whether to
send articles of impeachment to the Senate. House Republican Whip
Tom DeLay said Sunday on CNN's "Late Edition" that he thought a
majority of 218 would vote to impeach. But there were other
Republicans who said they did not have the votes.
</P>
<P>
The House Judiciary Committee hearings resume Tuesday with
testimony from convicted perjurers, some of whom have served jail
terms. Democrats say it is meaningless because there is no proof
that Clinton perjured himself about his sexual relationship with
Lewinsky and no legal basis for equating perjury with impeachment.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said the president does not belong "in the same
category as any of" the witnesses.
</P>
<P>
"I think that it won't add any new information and can be put
in the category of a stunt," Lockhart said of Tuesday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, a Republican, had planned a more
pivotal hearing for December 8, when Clinton or his
representatives had been invited to testify. But Lockhart said
Clinton doesn't believe the proceedings have been fair.
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the process to date, there's been very little
comfort for those looking for something fair," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Republicans said Clinton missed his chance to admit he lied
about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in his written responses
last week to 81 questions submitted to him by Hyde. The president
stuck to his grand jury assertions that he did not have sexual
relations with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, to me he is an unrepentant perjurer who should lose
his job unless he changes his tone," said Representative Lindsey
Graham, a Republican and Judiciary Committee member.
</P>
<P>
Graham and a committee colleague, Ed Bryant, a Republican, said
on NBC's "Meet The Press" they opposed the less drastic step of
censuring the president while keeping him in office.
</P>
<P>
But Representative Peter King, a Republican, said that while
Clinton's conduct was "reckless, irresponsible and I believe
illegal, I just don't believe it is impeachable." If the House
impeaches rather than censures and sends the issue to the Senate
for trial, "we are going to tie up the country for six months," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Congressional Democrats and White House officials also were
promoting censure or some lesser punishment.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Aid Increase to Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced on Monday his administration plans to boost aid to the
Palestinians by 400 million U.S. dollars while extending its
current assistance program of 100 million U.S. dollars a year for
five more years.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the pledge at the Conference to Support Middle
East Peace and Development when he opened the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was among the delegates from
44 countries and six international organizations, including the
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the United
Nations, attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I promised the continuing support of the United States as we
move ahead in the next phase of the peace process. That phase
begins today with this conference," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"Today our purpose is to send a clear signal that this peace is
more than a piece of paper, that the promise imagined at Oslo can
become a concrete reality; a true peace, a growing peace, good for
Palestinians, good for Israelis, good for the region and the
world, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the conference, Arafat said past pledges had
enabled the Palestinians "to advance the peace process, develop
the economy and proceed forward to realize our independence."
</P>
<P>
But despite "your generous financial assistance," Arafat said
"momentous constraints" have made the suffering of the Palestinian
people unbearable.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli closure policy is the primary and direct cause for
the dangerous decline in the performance of the Palestinian
economy over the past five years," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
The increase in U.S. aid, which is subject to congressional
approval, was announced after Clinton met with Arafat at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Arafat had reaffirmed his pledge to uphold his
side of agreements with Israel and to work with Israel to ensure
security.
</P>
<P>
The two reviewed the results of the Wye accord between Israel
and the Palestinians that provides for an Israeli pullback on the
West Bank and tougher measures against terrorists by the
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
"There have been bumps on the road, to be sure," Clinton said.
"But the agreement is on track, and we must keep it on track."
</P>
<P>
The Wye agreement was signed in Washington on October 23 by the
Israelis and Palestinians under the auspices of the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Ready to Normalize Ties with Neighbors: Aziz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said Monday that Iraq is ready to open a new chapter in
its relations with all Arab states, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in
particular.
</P>
<P>
"For us, we are ready to open a new page with them (Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait), we are ready to normalize relations," Aziz
said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries "have not responded to our
suggestion" on improving relation, and "it is up to them to
consider their position."
</P>
<P>
Iraq is eager to break the isolation in the region and the Arab
world eight years after the Gulf War, sparked by its invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is demanding Iraq release about 600 Kuwaiti prisoners of
war (POWs) it allegedly still holds, while Saudi Arabia regards
Iraq as a security threat.
</P>
<P>
However, Aziz said the Iraqi proposal for improving relations
with neighboring countries was made "at the highest level - by the
president of Iraq and its leadership."
</P>
<P>
He said progress has been made in Iraq's relations with Syria
and Egypt. "These two countries participated in the allied forces
(led by the U.S.) against Iraq in 1991. Now the relations are
improving," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Iraq and Jordan have been maintaining normal trade
and diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
On its relations with Gulf countries, Aziz said Iraq's
relations with them "are improving."
</P>
<P>
On Iraq's relations with Iran, Aziz said that bilateral
relations were improving gradually, "We have taken some positive
steps in normalizing our relations."
</P>
<P>
"As far as Iraq is concerned, the policy is to have normal
relations with all its neighbors without any exception," Aziz
added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Iran, who fought an eight year war in the 1980s, have
tried to open new relations by settling their war-related issues,
such as exchange of remains of those killed during the war and
wrap of POWs.

<HEADLINE> Saddam's Half Brother Returns to Iraq: Aziz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz has disclosed that Barzan al-Tikriti, half brother of
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, was due to arrive in Baghdad
Monday evening, and might have already arrived.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua Monday evening, Aziz said
that al-Tikriti, who headed Iraq's mission to the U.N. in Geneva
for nearly a decade, was an ambassador who was normally being
transferred as he had spent over nine years in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iraqi Foreign Ministry rules, an ambassador
who spends a long term in one post is recalled back to the
ministry, and may later be charged with another mission, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
He said that al-Tikriti was not the only one to be recalled to
Baghdad, adding that he would be assigned to work at the Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Al-tikriti was among 30 Iraqi ambassadors and diplomats
recalled to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
He has denied having contemplated to seek political asylum in
Switzerland, pointing out that circulating rumors that he was a
dissident were mere exaggerations by Western media.
</P>
<P>
Al-Tikriti, whose wife recently died of cancer, had obtained
guarantees before departing Geneva that he could return to
Switzerland to visit his children who would be staying behind.
Six out of his eight children are enrolled in Swiss schools.
</P>
<P>
The half brother of the Iraqi president was previously chief of
Iraqi intelligence. In 1988, he was appointed Iraqi Ambassador to
the U.N. in Geneva.

<P>
SALALAH, OMAN, December 1 (Xinhua) -- With the inauguration of
Raysut port here on Tuesday, Oman added a new container transfer
hub to the Asian-European maritime route which has been booming
over the past years.
</P>
<P>
The port, located outside the Gulf, links up with a port chain
consisting of Holland's Rotterdam, Columbia's Algeciras, Italy's
Gioia Tauro, Yemen's Aden, Sri Lanka's Colombo, and Singapore and
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Favorable located, the port is expected to inject new vitality
into the marine business within the Indian Ocean ring, said Jamal
Aziz, director general of the Directorate General of Ports and
Maritime Affairs of Oman, at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
It will propel the global container transportation business as
well, which has been growing at an annual rate of 6.8 percent in
the past years, he added.
</P>
<P>
Vessels of above 100,000 tons in capacity traveling from the
East to the West or vice versa may dock at the port with six
berths and get their containers transferred to smaller ships
destined for East Africa, other Gulf countries and India.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Denies Speculation on Middle East Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish Foreign Ministry
on Tuesday denied speculation that Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will hold a summit here
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The information about the supposed summit was released by the
Swedish newspaper Expressen, which quoted a source saying the
Foreign Ministry had informed the Stockholm police to prepare for
the upcoming summit.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry sent invitations to Arafat and Albright to
celebrate a secret diplomatic mission carried out in Stockholm in
1988 that contributed to the Middle East peace process, Minister
of Foreign Affairs Anna Lindh said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Palestinians and American Jewish
representatives helped pave the way for more successful talks
later on, Lindh said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is scheduled to arrive in Stockholm for the celebration
on December 7, Lindh said. She also said Albright may not be able
to come because of her busy schedule.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Foreign Ministry's press department chief Annika
Soeder also made similar denials, saying Sweden never said
Netanyahu and Albright would come.
</P>
<P>
Soeder said Sweden had also invited other international
celebrities for the event, but refused to give their names.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will reportedly stay in Stockholm for two days. In
addition to attending the celebration, he will meet with Swedish
Prime Minister Goran Persson and Minister of Foreign Affairs Anna
Lindh to talk about further cooperation between Sweden and
Palestine.

<HEADLINE> Hangzhou Bans Sales of Laundry Detergent With Phosphorus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The government of Hangzhou,
capital of east China's Zhejiang Province, today enforced a ban on
the sale and use of all laundry detergents containing phosphorus
in an attempt to ameliorate the water pollution problem in the
city.
</P>
<P>
Inspectors went to eight major department stores in the city
today and found they all had replaced ordinary laundry detergent
with those without phosphorus.
</P>
<P>
The Hangzhou authorities in charge of environmental protection,
as well as industry and commerce, issued circulars in June and
November announcing the ban.
</P>
<P>
The city's ban on detergent containing phosphorus comes one
month before the national ban on phosphorus in the Taihu Lake
Basin goes into effect.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that Hangzhou has been using 2,000 to 3,000 tons of
laundry detergent containing phosphorus a year, which constitutes
30 to 40 percent of the phosphorus in the city's sewage system.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the upcoming national ban is critical for
controlling water pollution in the Taihu Lake basin.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Expanding the Sino-Brazilian
strategic partnership is not only in the fundamental interest of
the peoples of both countries, but is also of far-reaching
significance for establishing the new international political and
economic order and increasing the overall strength of the
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan made this remark in a

</P>
<P>
On bilateral ties, Tang noted that in recent years China and

</P>
<P>
Tang noted that China and Brazil, as the two largest developing
countries in the eastern and western hemispheres respectively, have
a common responsibility to promote regional development and
the progress of people around the world.
</P>
<P>
With the accelerating of multipolarization in the world, both
sides should continuously add concrete content to their
partnership, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia agreed with Tang. He said that Brazil is ready to keep
bilateral high-level contacts, develop economic and trade ties
with China on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, strengthen
cooperation in world affairs, and expand cultural, scientific
and technological exchanges with China.
</P>
<P>
After their talks, the two ministers signed a complementary
arrangement to the agreement on economic and technological
cooperation to guarantee the quality of imported and exported
products.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, another complementary arrangement to the
agreement was signed by the relevant departments of both countries.

<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese president Jiang Zemin
said today that more overseas investment must be absorbed in order
to promote the national economy and maintain sustained and rapid
growth.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made this remark tonight while he and other Chinese
leaders were visiting an exhibition on China's use of overseas
investment in the two decades of reforms and opening up.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that an important element of Deng Xiaoping Theory is
the use of overseas investment to serve China's socialist
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the great changes brought about by the
reforms and opening up everywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders along with Jiang Zemin at the exhibition

<HEADLINE> Political Economist on Practice, Theory of 20-year Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Today's "People's Daily"
devoted more than half a page to a signed article hailing the
magnificent achievements China has made since the reform and
opening-up which began 20 years ago, and discussed the great
opportunities the country faces for future development.
</P>
<P>
Titled "Second Leap Forward and New Theory," the article was
written by Zheng Bijian, executive vice-president of the Party
School of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, in
commemoration of the convening of the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC
Central Committee, which marks the beginning of a new era in
China's socialist economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Zheng said in his article that the reason China has scored
achievements which are attracting worldwide attention is the
establishment of Deng Xiaoping Theory, the result of a new
combination of Marxism-Leninism and the realities of contemporary
China.
</P>
<P>
Zheng, a well-known political economist, said the CPC achieved
priceless experience during the long revolutionary period, namely
adhering to Marxism and realizing continuous combinations of
Marxism and China's realities in the course of development.
</P>
<P>
Zheng called Mao Zedong Thought, a guideline for China's
new-democratic revolution, the first combination of Marxism
and China's realities.
</P>
<P>
After analyzing the rich content of this new combination of
Marxism and China's realities, Zheng quoted the remarks of
President Jiang Zemin, who called Deng Xiaoping the chief
architect of China's socialist reform and opening drive,
modernization construction, and the founder of Marxism for
contemporary China -- the theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Zheng said Deng Xiaoping Theory, a new theory of the new
combination, adds new scientific content to Marxism and pushes
Marxism into a new era in China.

It would "contribute to peace, stability and cooperation in

Vietnam, as the host of the sixth ASEAN summit scheduled for
December 15-16 in Hanoi, hopes the summit meeting will be attended

<P>
"Today we can say with pride that the CPC is great. We have
stood these three serious tests and created glorious achievements
at the same time," said Zheng in his long article.
</P>
<P>
Extensive examination and three rigorous tests have proved that
Deng Xiaoping Theory, which combines Maxism and contemporary
Chinese practice, truly reflects the objective rules of Chinese
socialist construction.
</P>
<P>
The truth of Deng Theory was gradually acknowledged by the
whole Party beginning at the historic turning point of the Third
Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. This began the
establishment of Deng Xiaoping Theory as a guide, and the theory
was finally included in the Party Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Zheng highly praised Deng for his extraordinary ability to
see hope through periods of difficulties, and turn challenges into
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The new generation of CPC Central Committee leadership has
inherited Deng's Marxist stand, opinions and methods of
observation and analysis.
</P>
<P>
Zheng said to free from old ideas and seek truth from facts are
the basic experience that the Party could stand the three
important tests and realize miraculous achievements.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that many such tests arise from time to time,
such as the southeast Asian financial crisis and the floods that
hit the country in summer this year.
</P>
<P>
Zheng attributed the success of the Chinese people in
weathering these two storms to the guide of Deng Xiaoping Theory,
correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin
at the core, the unity and hard work of the whole nation, and the
achievements of the 20-year reform.

<P>
However, Zheng said, China also faces quite a number of
difficulties due to two major changes in the domestic and
international situations.
</P>
<P>
He referred to "the great historic turn" inside China, the
modernization drive carried out with the reform and opening to the
outside world initiated in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
This cause, unprecedented in the history of mankind, while
creating opportunities for rapid development, also leads to
contradictions such as the increase of laid-off workers and the
reform of government organizations and functions, Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
Internationally, the world is moving rapidly toward
multi-polarization and economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
Revolutions in science and technology are moving faster than
ever and competition between nations is intensifying, Zheng noted.
</P>
<P>
"These new trends will, for better or worse, affect people's
thinking and ideology," he warned.
</P>
<P>
"After the cold war, the ideological confrontation between
western countries and China, as well as other developing
countries, has escalated rather than subsided," he said,
explaining that such confrontation is largely focused on the
issues of human rights, sovereignty rights, development, and
differing political systems, civilizations, and ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
"These will have both positive and negative influences upon us,
and will further complicate our practices," he said.
</P>
<P>
To deal with these difficulties, Zheng said, China needs Deng
Xiaoping Theory, which has proved to be the sharpest ideological
weapons for analysing the overall domestic and international
situations.
</P>
<P>
"With a proper outlook based on Deng Xiaoping Theory, we will
be able to stand all tests, grasp opportunities and open up new
prospects," he said.
</P>
<P>
This outlook is especially needed in handling the current
issues of the financial crisis in southeast Asia and the
restructuring of the national economy and reforming of state-owned
enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zheng said in conclusion that under the leadership
of the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core and
holding high the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, China will be
invincible in its drive toward the next century.

<HEADLINE> Danger of U.S.-British Strike Remains: Aziz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said that the prospect of joint U.S.-British military
strikes against Iraq still exists.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua Monday, Aziz said the
United States committed four "aggressions" against Iraq in 1993
and a further one in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. launched air and cruise missile attacks against Iraq
in 1993 and 1996 in an attempt to force Iraqi compliance and keep
President Saddam Hussein in check.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Iraq was prepared, both psychologically and
practically, to confront another U.S. military "aggression" at any
time.
</P>
<P>
"All the crises provoked by the U.N. Special Commission for
disarming Iraq (UNSCOM) fall under the U.S. anti-Iraq plots," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. plan against Iraq comprised two parts, to
maintain the embargo and to provoke crises. The crises, as he put
it, served the American designs to commit aggression against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the provocation of the documents issue by the Special
Commission chief Richard Butler reflected the wish expressed by
U.S. President Bill Clinton in his November 15 speech, in which he
called for overthrowing Saddam.
</P>
<P>
Butler accused Iraq of concealing secret documents over its
chemical and biological weapons programs, an allegation denied by
Baghdad.

BANGKOK, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's House Speaker Wan
Muhamad Nor Matha has been accused of exploiting a parliament
budget for his political campaign trip to Southern Thailand, the
Thai News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The accusation was raised by Niphon Bunyamanee, a House member
from the ruling Democrat Party, who presented a receipt bearing
Wan Nor's signature withdrawing 20,000 baht (510 U.S. dollars)
from the parliament secretariat to pay for a trip to five southern
provinces during November 20-22.
</P>
<P>
Niphon claimed that during the trip, Wan Nor presided over a
seminar of his opposition-core New Aspiration Party in Nakhon Si
Thammarat Province on November 21.
</P>
<P>
Wan Nor abused taxpayers' money on the trip to attend his
party's seminar, Niphon said, demanding that Wan Nor resign as the
House Speaker.

<P>
ULAN BATOR, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President Nachagyn
Bagabandy urged the ruling coalition on Tuesday to find a new
candidate for premier to end the four month-long political
standoff.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Mongolian National Democratic Party President
Tsakhiya Elbegdorj and Mongolian Social Democratic Party Chairman
Radnaasumberel Gonchigdorj, Bagabandy asked them to nominate a new
candidate based on a ruling by the constitutional court.
</P>
<P>
The court made a ruling last month prohibiting Great Hural
(parliament) member from holding cabinet posts.
</P>
<P>
The candidate must also be approved by the parliament after
confirmation by the president.
</P>
<P>
The president has turned down several nominations made by the
ruling coalition since the government led by Tsakhiya Elbegdorj
was dismissed on July 24.
</P>
<P>
The minority Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) made
a statement recently saying that the unicameral Great Hural should
be dissolved if it fails to appoint a prime minister in the near
future.

<HEADLINE> Portuguese Firm Setting Up Plants in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Golden Sun Group, a Portuguese
corporation, said Tuesday that it has invested millions of U.S.
Dollars to set up a zinc plate plant and a refrigerator assembly
plant in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Antonio de Sousa, chairman of the group, told reporters that
the two projects in Viana Industrial Park in suburban Luanda will
be completed by mid-January next year.
</P>
<P>
The technologies and equipment to be employed by these plants
will be the most sophisticated in Africa, said Sousa.
</P>
<P>
The zinc plant will turn out 3,000 pieces of standardized
plates per day while the other factory will assemble 50
refrigerators of three types daily, said the group chairman.
</P>
<P>
The plants will mostly employ local workers and train them
strictly, he said.
</P>
<P>
After completing the ongoing projects, Sousa noted, his group
will invest in the exploration of diamonds in the provinces of
Lunda-Norte and Lunda-Sul.
</P>
<P>
The group is also interested in setting up flour processing
plants in some part of this southern African country and most of
its 400 staff are local people.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Allied Militiaman Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Israeli allied
South Lebanon Army (SLA) was killed and another wounded in two
separate roadside bombs in south Lebanon Tuesday, the Orient radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Both blasts occurred on roads in Jezzine, an area controlled by
SLA outside the Israeli occupied zone in south Lebanon, the radio
added.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the attacks. It said in a statement that an SLA
member was killed when he stepped down on a roadside bomb it
planted.
</P>
<P>
Another militiaman was wounded at dawn when his car was blown
up by a bomb.
</P>
<P>
The Tuesday assaults are the latest of series of attacks
launched by Lebanese guerrillas against Israeli forces and their
proxy SLA militia.
</P>
<P>
Seven Israeli soldiers were killed over the past two week in
the self-styled security zone Israel set up in 1985 after two
invasions, allegedly to protect its north from cross-border
guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
The mounting death toll, 23 since the start of this year, of
Israeli soldiers rekindled heated debates in Israel over its
continued military presense in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
After an emergency meeting on Sunday, Israeli cabinet said its
troops will not carry out unilateral withdrawal unless Lebanese
government agrees to guarantee security of its north.
</P>
<P>
The demand had been flatly rejected by Beirut in April when
Israel offered to withdraw from south Lebanon in compliance with
the U.N. Resolution 425, adopted about two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its close ally Syria insisted that Israel pull out
unconditionally in line with the U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has been spearheading a guerrilla war trying to oust
the Israeli occupation troops and the SLA.

<P>
MOSCOW, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma, or lower
house of parliament, put forward a draft resolution on the medical
examination of President Boris Yeltsin's health on Tuesday, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The document was put on the Wednesday agenda of the Duma's
session.
</P>
<P>
Duma press service chief Viktor Cheremukhin said that the
document differs substantially from a rejected draft compiled by
Communist Viktor Ilyukhin by the fact that it "has medical rather
than political undertones."
</P>
<P>
Deputies planned to put the new draft resolution to vote at
their plenary meetings on the eve of their departures for
constituencies, the Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Another report cited the first deputy chief of presidential
staff, Oleg Sysuyev, as saying that Yeltsin can be expected to
leave Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital within days.
</P>
<P>
According to Sysuyev, doctors are having difficulty in
persuading Yeltsin not to leave the hospital before he is through
a treatment regimen.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was reportedly taken to the hospital when his
temperature rose to 38.9 degrees Centigrade on November 22, a day
before the visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin to Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president is suffering from pneumonia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 1 (Xinhua) -- German Hoechst AG and French
Rhone-Poulenc announced the combining of their life-science
operations Tuesday as the first step toward the merging of the two
companies.
</P>
<P>
A joint venture operation, whose shares will be equally divided
by the German and French companies, will be set up in mid-1999 to
run the combined life-science operations, according to a statement
of Hoechst AG.
</P>
<P>
Later, the two companies will sell out their remaining
businesses in industrial chemicals before completing their full
merger.
</P>
<P>
Aventis, the new life-science company to be established, will
combine the mother company's pharmaceutical and agricultural
chemical businesses and have an expected annual sales volume of 20
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The new company will be based in Strasbourg led by Hoechst's
Chief Executive Juergen Dormann. The company's deputy chief
executive will be Jean-Rene Fourtou, currently Rhone-Poulenc's
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
Before their final merger, the two companies will remain
separate publicly-listed companies. The name will be changed
once Aventis is launched. The German firm will become Aventis
Hoechst AG, and the French firm, Aventis Rhone-Poulenc SA.
</P>
<P>
The new company will become one of the leading life-science
companies in the world with a top edge in the development and
production of pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals, said
Hoechst AG.
</P>
<P>
Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc say the fusion is expected to result
in annual savings of some 1.17 billion dollars, with about 60
percent of that coming from the pharmaceutical area and 40 percent
from agricultural and other areas."

LONDON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet is expected to leave a London hospital Tuesday where he
is reportedly in poor health and recuperating under police guard.
</P>
<P>
The 83-year-old general no longer needs medical treatment and

Pinochet is being detained by the British government and

Pinochet said earlier that he could not attend court hearings
because of poor health.
</P>
<P>
British police arrested Pinochet in October at a London
hospital, where he had just finished a minor operation, at the
request of two Spanish judges who accused him of being responsible
for the killing and torturing of Spanish citizens during his rule
from 1973 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Upper House of British parliament ruled last Wednesday that
Pinochet should not enjoy diplomatic immunity under British
law. This may means that the old Chilean general is still likely
to be extradited.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Deputy PM on Comprehensive Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz on Monday urged the U.N. to conduct "a objective and
correct" comprehensive review on Iraq's progress on disarmament.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Chinese official Xinhua News
Agency, Aziz said Iraq is fully confident that the review will
prove to the Security Council that Baghdad has complied with
U.N. resolutions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said he has entrusted the U.N. special envoy Praksh Shah
to send a message to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on his
proposed comprehensive review.
</P>
<P>
He said Annan has promised Baghdad that the comprehensive
review will be completed shortly after Iraq resumes cooperation
with the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
dismantling of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is still awaiting Annan's stance regarding the review, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq halted all its cooperation with UNSCOM on October 31 to
demand the comprehensive review that might lead to the removal of
the sanctions. But it backed down the next week to ward off an
imminent possible U.S. attack.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long sought to have the eight-year-old devastating
U.N. sanctions lifted and claimed that Baghdad has got rid of all
banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed on Iraq following its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990 and the Security Council maintains that they will
not be removed unless UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has eradicated
all the banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
But UNSCOM, which is accused by Iraq of serving the U.S. and
trying to prolong the sanctions, has run into several standoffs
with Iraq and holds that Baghdad is playing cat-and-mouse game
with it and has failed to hand over crucial documents about the
banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Aziz criticized Washington and London of hampering
the removal of the sanctions. He said now that Iraq were to carry
out the commitments stipulated in U.N. resolutions, the two
countries could openly say they would not approve of lifting the
embargo. They might resort to the veto power to obstruct the
lifting, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said Washington and London are seeking to change the
Iraqi leadership, that is to say, they will obstruct the lifting
of the embargo because it is one of the U.S.-British political
tools to weaken Iraq.

HONG KONG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Stock Exchange
announced here Tuesday it will open a Growth Enterprise Market
(GEM) next year to attract medium-sized companies to go public in
Hong Kong.

It will have its own separate management and listing rules."
</P>

He said the Exchange hoped to complete drafting of rules and
put governance structure and trading mechanism in place within
eight to 10 months. He expected the new market to be opened in the
fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The target of GEM will be growth companies seeking funds for
development and expansion. "Developing an effective GEM for Hong
Kong, Mainland and Taiwan's medium-sized companies offers valuable
economic benefits, and will secure Hong Kong's position as the
pre-eminent market for such enterprises," Dr Lo said.

decided to reform the structure of the country's administration
for industry and commerce departments.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Brazilian FM Stresses Strengthening Bilateral Trade With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Brazilian foreign
minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia said here on Tuesday that
Brazil-China economic and trade cooperation should be
further developed.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia made the remarks at a seminar attended by both
Brazilian and Chinese businesspeople. Sponsored by the China
Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), the
seminar aims to promote economic cooperation and trade between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that his government and people were
encouraged when Chinese premier Zhu Rongji told him in a meeting
earlier in the day that bilateral economic and trade cooperation
should be expanded.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Zhu's words fulfilled the very purpose of the
mission his entourage, the Brazilian entrepreneurs and himself are
committed to in this visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Although the Asian financial crisis has affected bilateral
trade since last year, it has also created opportunities to expand
trade and economic cooperation between Brazil and China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's main exports to China remain iron ore in sand form and
other raw materials, and trade volume with China has never
surpassed five percent of Brazil's total foreign trade volume,
according to the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
He said Brazil will continue its open trade policy with China
and other friendly nations, and he hopes that a greater number of
finished products rather than just raw materials will begin to
enter the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Chinese statistics show that trade volume between China and
Brazil has multipled since 1993, hitting 2.5 billion U.S. dollars
in 1997, including one billion dollars in exports and 1.5 billion
dollars in imports.
</P>
<P>
The export volume in 1997 marked an increase of 36.8 percent
over the previous year, and imports increased 0.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> WHO Urges Prevention of AIDS Among Youths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Director General of the World
Health Organization (WHO) Gro Harlem Brundtland urged health
services to be more responsive to the needs of youth in preventing
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Brundtland warned in a World AIDS Day message here on Tuesday
that five young people are being infected every minute with the
HIV virus and half of all new infections are now occurring among
youths between the ages of 15-24.
</P>
<P>
The worst affected continent is Africa where about 60 percent
of new infections occur within that age group, she added. In South
Africa, nearly 13 percent of pregnant teenagers aged 15-19 were
found to be HIV positive and 9.5 percent had become infected
before they reached the age of 15.
</P>
<P>
"These statistics are a chilling reminder that we are failing
our young," the WHO chief said. "We in the health sector must take
our share of the responsibility."
</P>
<P>
"Health services must become more youth friendly with staff who
can talk to young people about issues that affect their lives,"
Ms. Brundtland stressed. "Young people can help themselvelves, but
they need accurate information and appropriate treatment. One way
is to provide receptive health services that young people are
comfortable with."
</P>
<P>
WHO said that unfriendly staff, excessive paper work, or the
perceived lack of confidentiality, can deter all young people from
using health services.
</P>
<P>
"When a young person contracts a sexually transmitted disease,
including HIV, they may take weeks, months, or in the case of HIV,
years to seek medical treatment. An unfriendly health facility
which further stigmatizes youth will only make matters worse,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
"Young people are not only the heart of the epidemic, they are
also at the heart of the solution," said the former Norwegian
prime minister. "Investing in young people pays long term
dividends."
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that the behaviors and attitudes people adopt
during adolescence, regarding relations with others, sexuality and
the safe use of substances, would last a lifetime. She added that
these behaviors will also affect the health and well being of all
children in the future.

However, he said some 30 percent of them, mostly hotels, are
running at a loss, due to a lack of knowledge about Xinjiang and

<TEXT>
<P>
Some investors considered that they could enter the Central Asian
market by investing in Xinjiang because Xinjiang shares thousands
of kilometers of border with some countries there. But the
economic recovery process in some Central Asian nations has failed
to meet their expectations.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some investors chose the wrong projects to invest
in because they assumed that Xinjiang had a consumption level
similar to that in China's coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
"Practice has demonstrated that only those enterprises
utilizing the special resources of Xinjiang such as high-quality
Xinjiang cashmere and Xinjiang long-fiber cotton, are able to
enjoy a high rate of success," he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu advised would-be investors to be careful in the selection
of a partner. He said that only those who enjoy good credibility
and have good production capability are appropriate choices, such
as the Xinjiang Economic and Technological Development Zone and
the Xinjiang High-Tech Development Zone.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last October, Xinjiang had approved a total of 998
overseas-funded companies, with actual overseas investment of 330
million U.S. dollars. Investors came from 30 countries including
the United States, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Canada, as well
as China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
They invested mainly in agriculture, water conservation,
petroleum chemistry, telecommunications, transportation and
textiles.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that Xinjiang is prepared to use more overseas
investment by taking advantage of the opportunities created by the
central government's favorable policies for western China.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Enhances Sales Tax to Increase Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The cash-strapped Pakistani
government Tuesday partly implemented its 5.5 billion U.S. dollar
draft deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by revising
the rate of sales tax from 12.5 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rate has been enhanced under the Sales Tax Second Amendment
Ordinance 1998, promulgated by the President of Pakistan with
immediate effect, the Central Board of Revenue (CBR) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Upward revision in sales tax by 2.5 per cent will enable the
CBR to fetch an amount of over 6.5 billion rupees (141 million
dollars) in the remaining seven months of the current fiscal year,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The government agreed to enhance the rate of sales tax from
12.5 percent to 15 percent during the talks with the IMF mission
on an agreement on financial package of 5.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The enhancement in the rate of sales tax will provide cushion
against the shortfall in revenue collection mainly owing to less
collection under customs duty, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Sales tax has been a burning issue and threadbare discussions
were held between the government and the business community time
and again during the first five months of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
An Increase in sales tax was described by the revenue circles
as inevitable, to facilitate the agreement with the IMF for the
restoration of the stalled loan program.

But the domestic currency still managed to close up off its

BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A national exhibition on AIDS

Day.
</P>
<P>
Despite the severe cold weather, some 1,000 visitors came to
the Museum of the Chinese Revolution on the east side of
Tian'anmen Square to see the exhibition, the largest of its kind
ever held in China.
</P>

the exhibition displays the general situation of AIDS in China and
the world as well as information on the spreading and prevention
of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Xu Hua, an authority on AIDS, said mobilizing youngsters to
challenge AIDS is the theme of this year's World AIDS Day, and the
key point of AIDS prevention and control in China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that about 60 percent of Chinese youngsters do
not have sufficient basic AIDS knowledge, and 20 percent have no
idea about how to prevent the disease.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has stipulated that education on AIDS
prevention and control will be required in colleges, secondary

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Begins to Choose New PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The newly elected Lebanese
President Emile Lahoud on Tuesday is set to hold a new round of
consultations with parliament to find a new candidate for prime
minister after outgoing Rafik Hariri refused to remain in his post,
</P>
<P>
There is wide speculation here that the 69-year-old veteran
politician Salim Hoss will be charged with the task of forming a
new government.
</P>
<P>
Hoss presided over three cabinets with two between 1976 and
1980 during President Elias Sarkis' mandate and one during Aimn
Gemayel's term from 1987 to 1990. He also served as education
minister and labor minister from 1985 to 1987 and has sat in
Parliament since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Seen widely as an honest lawmaker, Hoss enjoys support from
professionals and intellectuals around the country. His criticism
of Hariri's economic and social policies has been characterized as
"constructive".
</P>
<P>
Hariri, a billionaire and the architect of Lebanon's post-war
reconstruction, has served as prime minister for six years under a
nine-year mandate of the previous President Elias Hrawi.
</P>
<P>
He unexpectedly rejected Lahoud's nomination as the head of
the new government Friday though he had gained support from the
majority of the parliament in the two-day mandatory consultations
between Lahoud and MPs.
</P>
<P>
Hariri claimed that 31 of parliament's 128 members have
unconstitutionally given the president a free hand to name a
prime minister of his own choice.
</P>
<P>
"This is a precedent-setting violation of the constitution I
am willing not to put up with," he was quoted by unnamed senior
aides as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, observers believed that the outgoing prime minister
had used the constitution as a pretext for disagreements with
Lahoud over the formation of the next government.
</P>
<P>
They said his sudden departure in fact had more to do with
trying to gain greater degree of control over the new cabinet
than with constitutional cosiderations.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud enjoys both popular support and Syrian backing, and is
taking a stronger role in directing the new government. He
declared war in his inaugural November 24 speech on sectarianism,
cronyism and corruption, charges which were often rained down by
opposition parties on Hariri government.
</P>
<P>
Syria, a main power broker with 40,000 troops stationed in
Leabnon, has not commented on the latest devolopments in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's November Trade Surplus Hits 3.7 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's trade surplus hit
3.7 billion U.S. dollars last month, pushing up its gains to 35.9
billion dollars in the past 11 months, compared with a
10.7-billion deficit registered during the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's exports in the first 11 months of this year
dropped 2.6 percent to 120.6 billion dollars while imports plunged
37 percent to 84.7 billion dollars, said the Ministry of Commerce,
Industry and Energy.
</P>
<P>
In order to reach the trade surplus target of 40 billion
dollars for this year, South Korea will have to register an
additional surplus of only 4.1 billion dollars this month.
</P>
<P>
If the current trend continues, the nation is likely to hit the
government-set target as December used to produce the year's
largest trade surplus in the past, said a spokesman of the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
South Korea exports appeared to hit its bottom of 9.7-billion
dollars in August and then rose to 12 billion dollars in November
month by month.
</P>
<P>
Another good sign showed that the daily average export has
gradually risen from 405 million dollars in July to 504 million
dollars last month.
</P>
<P>
"What makes the prospects brighter is that the nation's exports
will gain a further momentum if and when exporters could benefit
from the "new three lows" -- low U.S. dollar, low interest rates
and low raw material prices on international markets from late
this year," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, which borrowed 58 billion dollars from the
International Monetary Fund last December after suffering a
financial crisis late last year, is seeking more trade surplus to
help overcome the current economic woes.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Opposition Leader to Be Questioned on Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korean opposition leader
Lee Hoi-chang will be investigated over his possible involvement
in a plot aimed to create shootouts on the Demilitarized Zone to
help him win the presidential election last December, said
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
The decision to investigate Lee came after the testimony of one
of the plotters Han Sung-ki, who admitted to having reported to
Lee about his overseas meetings with officials from the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), one week before the election.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors said they have secured other documents and
materials, which could testify with suspicions raised by Han's
testimony that Lee, presently president of the Grand National
Party (GNP), was involved in the border shootout plot.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors' investigation showed that it was at the overseas
meetings that the plotters requested the DPRK help create the
phony border shootout.
</P>
<P>
The plotters were indicted last month on charges of violating
the National Security Law of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Monday, Han said in his testimony that he reported to Lee
Hoi-chang's secretary and chauffeur before and after meetings with
DPRK officials.
</P>
<P>
However, Han, a former official of the Jinro Business Group,
said he could not confirm whether his reports reached Lee himself.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said that questioning Lee is inevitable due to the
severity of Han's testimony and it is highly reasonable to believe
that Lee had read the reports submitted by Han.
</P>
<P>
But it has yet to be decided when and how Lee will be
questioned, the prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
Before questioning the opposition leader, prosecutors said they
plan to investigate his secretary and driver.
</P>
<P>
They will also re-subpoenaed Lee Hoi-sung, a young brother of
the GNP leader, and Jinro Group chairman Chang Jin-ho, to whom Han
said he had made phone calls to during his meetings with the DPRK
officials.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States welcomes
the formation of Cambodia's new government, a press release issued
Tuesday by U.S. Information Service in Phnom Penh said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. welcomes the action by Cambodia's National Assembly
on November 30 approving the formation of a coalition government
by the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and FUNCINPEC, the two
parties which won the most votes in the July 26 elections," it
said.
</P>
<P>
In a secret ballot on Monday, Cambodia's Assembly voted 99 to
13 to approve Hun Sen as the sole prime minister for a five-year
term. The same vote also confirmed a 25-ministry government and a
political platform pledging widespread forestry and financial
reform.
</P>
<P>
The press release also commended the important role played by
King Norodom Sihanouk in encouraging the agreement between the two
parties to set up a combined administration.
</P>
<P>
It said U.S. policy has sought to encourage the formation of a
coalition government that reflects genuine power sharing and the
will of the Cambodian electorate. The U.S. strongly supports the
decision by Cambodia's political leadership to move toward
political reconciliation and away from violence.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A total of 285 HIV carriers
have been found in the Chinese capital, official sources said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Public Health
noted today, the 11th International AIDS Day that among the 285
cases, 96 HIV carriers have been diagnosed this year, nearly three
times more than last year.
</P>
<P>
Guo Jiyong, deputy chief of the bureau, noted that 35 medical
and epidemic prevention institutions in Beijing have set up their
own AIDS prevention organizations since the first AIDS case
appeared in China in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Guo said that 105 of the 285 HIV positives are Beijingers, 115
from other provinces, and 65 foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Among the cases uncovered in the past decade, most were
diagnosed in the early stages. And the three main means the
disease was spread include intravenous injections, sexual
intercourse, and mother-to-infant transmission.
</P>
<P>
The carriers are from nearly every walk of life, including
waiters and waitresses, college students, performers,
workers, officials, doctors, businessmen and teachers. More than 80
percent are between the ages of 20 and 40.
</P>
<P>
Guo said that AIDS has become a social problem, and the
Standing Committee of Beijing Municipal People's Congress is now
working to formulate laws on AIDS after two years of preparations
and discussions.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt to Assist Returning Overseas Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Tuesday that it has created a replacement and monitoring center to
provide jobs and livelihood opportunities to Overseas Filipino
Workers (OFWs) who are returning home for good.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Tuesday, Secretary Bienvenido
Laguesma of the Department of Labor and Employment said the
creation of the center is part of the Estrada administration's
efforts to protect the interests of the country's 4.5 million
OFWs.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma said that aside from looking for jobs for OFWs, the
center will also provide the following services:
</P>
<P>
-- Develop livelihood programs and projects for OFWs in
coordination with the private sector;
</P>
<P>
-- Coordinate with appropriate private and government agencies
in the promotion, development, replacement and the full
utilization of the potentials of returning OFWs;
</P>
<P>
-- Institute, in cooperation with other government agencies
concerned, a computer-based information system on skilled Filipino
migrant workers, which shall be accessible to all local private
and public recruitment agencies and employers;
</P>
<P>
-- Provide a periodic study and assessment of job opportunities
for returning OFWs;
</P>
<P>
-- Develop and implement other appropriate programs to promote
the welfare of returning OFWs;
</P>
<P>
-- And provide incentives, in coordination with the Department
of Science and Technology (DOST), to professional and other
highly-skilled OFWs especially in science and technology for their
contributions to national development.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma said the center will be housed at the Overseas Workers
Welfare Administration Center in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Since a financial crisis hit East Asia July last year, many
countries in the region have employed domestic workers to replace
foreign workers, and thousands of Filipinos have returned home
after being laid off.

LUSAKA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The opposition United National
Independence Party (UNIP) led by former president Kenneth Kaunda
and the Lima Party have said that the government's timing of the
local government polls is against the sobering political climate.
</P>
<P>
They challenged the government to immediately convene the
inter-party talks to be attended by heads of all political
parties.
</P>
<P>
Co-chairmen of the inter-party talks, Mainza Chonae of UNIP
trustee, and Lima party leader Guy Scott, said here Monday that
the date for the elections is one of the items on the agreed
agenda for the inter-party summit due to take place soon, Zambia
Daily Maily Tuesday quoted them as saying.
</P>
<P>
The two wondered how the issue of the local government
elections could be discussed if the government has unilaterally
decided to hold the elections without consulting other parties.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly urge the MMD (Movement for Multi-party Democracy)
government to show commitment to the spirit of dialog by
convening the first meeting of presidents immediately and to
publicly commit itself to making changes or corrections that
might be agreed," said the two chairmen.
</P>
<P>
But UNIP has said it will still go ahead to participate in the
elections despite what it terms unfair conditions set out by the
government.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday President Fredrick Chiluba announced that the
local government elections will be held on December 30, 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in
the Philippines is not worrisome compared with other countries in
Asia with the infection level occurring low and at a slow pace,
Health Secretary Alberto G. Romualdez Jr. said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here to mark the World Aids Day, the
secretary said: "(Cases) continue to grow but not as fast as in
our neighboring countries, (HIV infection) is there but going at a
slow rate."
</P>
<P>
However, he said the "not worrisome HIV/AIDS situation" in the
country should never make health authorities to be complacent in
control and prevention efforts.
</P>
<P>
Romualdez said AIDS/HIV control and prevention in the country
will involve the youth so as to contain the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
From January 1984 to October 1998, 1,156 HIV infections were
reported in the Philippines. Most of the HIV/AIDS infections in
the country are in the age groups of 19 to 29 years and 30 to 39
years old.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- For the second successive
year, the Omega Order of Merit title will be decided at the
season-ending 500,000-U.S.-dollar Omega PGA Championship, which
tees -off at the Clearwater Bay Golf and Country Club Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The final stroke play event of the Asian PGA's 1998 season has
attracted the 12 leading players from the 1998 Omega Order of
Merit.
</P>
<P>
Current number one Edward Fryatt of England is strongly
favored to follow suit of last year's winner Mike Cunning from
the United States. Although missing the 1997 Omega PGA
Championship in Hong Kong, Cunning eventually finished in top
spot last year.
</P>
<P>
Fryatt, runner-up in the Perrier Hong Kong Open and winner of
the 1998 Volvo China Open, heads the money list with 135,217 U.S.
dollars in prize money. His South Africa-based compatriot Christ
Williams moves into second place with 120,493 U.S. dollars after
tying for third place at the Hong Kong Open which closed at
Fanling on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Likely to be leading the Asian challenge is the 1996 Omega
Order of Merit winner Kang Wook-soon from South Korea. Kang moved
up to seventh spot on the money list after collecting 50,010 U.S.
dollars in winner's check at Hong Kong Open.
</P>
<P>
"The 1998 Omega Order of Merit title is going to come down on
the wire again," predicted Ramlan Dato Harun, executive director
of Asian PGA. "We have the Asian PGA's finest players competing
at Clearwater Bay, and although there is a little bit of daylight
between the top three and the other contenders, any one of the 12
players can still win. This is how professional golf should be.
Quality players competing at a quality event for a quality title."
</P>
<P>
Rodrigo Cuello of the Philippines, winner of the Omega PGA
Championship last year, is back to defend his title and make
amends for a disappointing final day in the Hong Kong Open, when
a quintuple bogey 10 on the third effectively cost him the
chances for a second Hong Kong Open title.
</P>
<P>
Among those to join him is China's number one Zhang Lianwei.
The winner of the 1996 Volvo Asian Match beat European No. 1
Colin Montgomerie at this year's Alfred Dunhill Cup in October in
Scotland, where he represented the Chinese team.

<P>
KATHMANDU, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch government has
agreed to provide a grant of 5.67 million Netherlands guilders
(2.99 million U.S. dollars) for the implementation of the third
and final phase of the Mechi Hills Development Project in Nepal,
the Nepali Finance Ministry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An agreement to this effect was signed here Tuesday between the

</P>
<P>
The third phase of the project to be completed by July 2001
covers three districts -- Ilam, Panchthar and Taplejung -- in the
Mechi Zone of eastern Nepal. The other district in the zone is
Jhapa.
</P>
<P>
The overall goal of the program is to contribute to the
institutional development in the districts that stimulate and
support the planning and implementation of local initiatives, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
For this, the project aims to strengthen district-based
non-governmental organizations and assist village groups in
analyzing their local developmental problems and potentials, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The project will also strengthen capacity of the district
development committees and the village development committees to
plan, monitor, coordinate and support development in which local
initiatives are integrated, it added.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project began in 1987 with focus on
infrastructure development while the second phase that began in
1993 comprised an integrated community development program, the
ministry noted.

<HEADLINE> Mozambicans Urged to Fight AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano Tuesday called on his countrymen to fight AIDS, the
epidemic of the century, to prevent its spread in this southern
African country.
</P>
<P>
Chissano's statement was published through the Noticias
newspaper today to mark the World AIDS Day which falls on
Tuesday or today.
</P>
<P>
AIDS has become a reality in Mozambique, with more and more
people dying of the disease and more children orphaned, said the
president, who warned that AIDS has greatly hindered the social
and economic development of the next century.
</P>
<P>
He urged Mozambicans from all walks of life to seek for the
best way of life in a bid to avoid infection of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Reports said a total of 183,000 Mozambicans had died of AIDS
by the end of last year since the first case was noted in 1986.
It is estimated by the end of last July that about 208,000 people
in the country are AIDS patients, while over one million of the
total population of 16.5 million are carriers of AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
Most AIDS cases are reported in the central and northern part
of the country, especially in the Beira and Nacala Corridors,
Tete and Zambezia provinces. In some cases, about 90 percent of
the provincial hospital beds are occupied by AIDS patients.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Putonghu Training, Testing System Formed in Macao (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A Putonghu training and testing
system has taken shape in Macao as the handover is drawing near
and Putonghua has been more widely used as an official language in
various sectors in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Institute of Engineering has grown to be the largest
Putonghua (standard spoken Chinese) training center in Macao.
Since 1994, more than 2,000 people flock to the institute every
year to receive Chinese language training.
</P>
<P>
The trainees include Macao civil servants, students, clerks and
business people, who believe that better Chinese language skills
will help them perform better at work.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Macao Administrative and Public Function
Department began Putonghua training courses in the mid-1980s. By
the end of 1994, a total of 1,400 people, the majority of whom
government employees, had received training.
</P>
<P>
The department and the Law Translation Office of the Macao
government have worked together over the past dozen years to send
hundreds of civil servants, legal experts and interpreters to
Beijing for advanced learning of Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 55 percent of employees in public bodies
had mastered spoken Chinese by the end of 1996. The current
percentage must be much higher.
</P>
<P>
In addition, many Chinese training courses are run by the
Language Promotion Center under the Macao Education and Youth
Department, the Macao University, various social organizations and
many schools. In this sense, the number of Chinese learners is
enormous.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, the Macao Institute of Engineering and
the Macao Administrative and Public Function Department have been
working on a practical Putonghua training system which features
different proficiency levels, teaching outlines, series of
teaching materials, teaching methods and testing.
</P>
<P>
A Course in Chinese is the first set of Putonghua teaching
materials in Macao specially compiled for civil servants. It will
consist of 14 books in nine grades, and the first 10 books have
been completed.
</P>
<P>
"Putonghua training for Macao civil servants has entered a
booming period since last year and is moving toward advanced
stages," said Sheng Yan, a professor of the institute. "In the
future, the institute will step up training in vocational
Putonghua and the writing of official documents in Chinese."

<TEXT>
<P>
The professor noted that official document writing is a key
part of Chinese used as an official language. Macao badly needs a
model book which uses standard Chinese and exhibits local
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The current promotion of Putonghua features the combination of
both training and testing. On February 26 this year, the Putonghua
Training and Testing Center under the Macao Institute of
Engineering was founded with support from China's State Language
and Character Commission and State Chinese Proficiency Test
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Professor Sheng was made the center's director. He had been
engaged in Chinese teaching and research in Romania, Pakistan and
the United States. In 1991, Sheng was invited to Macao to teach
Chinese and compile relevant teaching materials.
</P>
<P>
The center mainly takes charge of training Putonghua teachers
and testers in Macao. In addition, it undertakes two types of
tests: a Putonghua proficiency test designed for people of Chinese
origin but using dialects, and a Chinese proficiency test for
people whose native language is not Chinese.
</P>
<P>
A Putonghua proficiency test, the first of its kind in Macao's
history, was held on July 26 this year and received extensive
response. Altogether 153 people applied for the test and they
include professional or spare-time Putonghua teachers,
journalists, broadcasters and civil servants.
</P>
<P>
In the end, 143 examinees obtained Putonghua proficiency
certificates. In particular, nine people got the highest grade,
whose Putonghua ability is equal to that of state-level
broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
With regard to people who do not use Chinese as their native
language, a Chinese proficiency test, also the first one in Macao,
was held on November 7. It was aimed at assessing examinees'
overall capability of Chinese in listening, speaking, reading and
writing.
</P>
<P>
Most of the applicants were Portuguese or Macao-born
Portuguese, others came from countries such as Canada, Australia,
South Korea and Sierra Leone. The result of the examination will
be announced in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
Those who pass the test will be given certificates issued by
China's State Chinese Proficiency Test Commission. The certificate
holds authority around the world and will be of great help for the
examinees' study and work in China.
</P>
<P>
"The most pressing matter at present is a more thorough
theoretical research on the tests, so that they become more
reliable, effective, practical and authoritative," Professor Sheng
said.

MANILA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Three lucky returning Filipino
migrant workers will get the best VIP treatment in their lives as
President Joseph Estrada and First Lady Dr. Loi Estrada will
personally greet them upon arrival at the Ninoy Aquino
International Airport here.
</P>
<P>
According to a Philippine News Agency report Tuesday, the lucky
overseas Filipino workers (OFWs), one each from the Middle East,
Asia, and Europe, will also receive cash prizes from the Overseas
Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) and other surprises from the
Duty Free Philippines, Land Bank of the Philippines and other
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
The report said migrant workers will receive a "red-carpet"
welcome at the airport in Manila during the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
It said the airport will provide special services for the OFWs,
such as installation of additional express lanes exclusively for
arriving and departing OFWs; express lane at the immigration
counters for fast and efficient processing of travel papers; and
express lanes at the customs counters.
</P>
<P>
Entertainment and sports personalities will greet the
vacationing migrant workers and their families from December 16-31
at the airport premises, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has treated its 4.5 million overseas workers as
"national heroes", as their earnings, estimated at 7 billion U.S.
dollars a year, have become the important sources of the nation's
foreign exchange revenues.

LAGOS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's borders with

Saturday to prevent illegal immigrants from coming into Nigeria
to vote during the December 5 local government elections.

<HEADLINE> HK on Way to Restore Fiscal Balance: Financial Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is making effort to
restore fiscal balance, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"If we cannot have a balanced budget this year, we must at
least show we are well on the way to restoring fiscal balance,"
Tsang told the Annual Business Summit of the Hong Kong General
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said the scope for new spending and that for tax
concessions would be extremely limited. He would keep two things
in the forefront of his mind while preparing the budget: the need
to protect the most vulnerable and the need to provide the
foundations for our economy to grow again.
</P>
<P>
In the speech entitled "Saving Private Ryan", the financial
secretary said he had drawn a few lessons from the U.S. movie,
which provided a useful springboard to examine the present
economic situation in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The first was the need for international cooperation, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Political leaders must have the courage to resist
narrow-minded protectionism or the urge for predatory behavior,
however superficially attractive the short run benefits may seem,"
Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
The second lesson was the need for internal cooperation, which
applied very much to the employment situation in the territory.
</P>
<P>
"We must appeal to the good sense of all sides, both employers
and employees, to look out for each other. They must trust each
other, and to establish that trust they must communicate," Tsang
said.
</P>
<P>
The third lesson was the need to remain calm under fire and the
last one was to have a sense of duty and mission.
</P>
<P>
According to the results for the first seven months of the
fiscal year ended October 31 announced by the SAR government
Monday, expenditure for the year to date amounts to 131,850.8
million HK dollars (16,903.9 million U.S. dollars) and revenue to
81,686.9 million HK dollars (10,472.7 million U.S. dollars),
resulting in a deficit for the seven months of 50,163.9 million HK
dollars (6,431.3 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
As a result, the fiscal reserves stood at 415,684.2 million HK
dollars (53,292.8 million U.S. dollars) by October 31, 1998, a
decrease of 41,858.8 million HK dollars (5,366.5 million U.S.
dollars) compared with the level by March 31, 1998, the end of the
previous financial year.
</P>
<P>
A Government spokesman said: "Because the Government's accounts
are prepared on a cash basis, and since the bulk of collections
from Profits Tax and Salaries Tax are normally received in the
latter part of the financial year, it is not unusual, even in good
years, to see a substantial deficit in the first seven months of
the financial year."

MANILA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
set up a hotline and an Internet site for questions about the
potential harm posed by the so-called millennium bug to computer
systems, government officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at helping the public resolve questions and
doubts on the millenium-bug-related issues, they said.
</P>
<P>
The officials quoted the report of the Presidential Commission
on Year 2000 Compliance as saying that the web site contains the
progress made by different sectors in their related projects and a
general explanation of the issues.
</P>
<P>
It also offers computer users a series of guides and conversion
tools to the web sites of solution providers.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug is a built-in flaw in many computer systems
that could jeopardize a large number of activities in both public
and private sectors beginning in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Sectors like transportation, power, water, health,
manufacturing, banking, finance, telecommunications and government
services may become paralyzed if concerned agencies and firms fail
to prepare themselves for the problem.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urged to Develop Handicrafts Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The exploitation of Zambia's
handicrafts sector should be encouraged as the industry is
contributing to the country's foreign exchange earnings and job
creation, a government minister has said.
</P>
<P>
At a crafts competition held here Monday, Environment and
Natural Resources Minister Alfeyo Hambayi said the industry is
very important as it would boost Zambia's falling levels of
employment, the Post newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that about 6,000 people are involved in crafts
either full time or part-time and the sector continues to
contribute toward job creation and poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has been striving to create an enabling
environment to favor the growth of non-traditional exports, said
Hambayi.
</P>
<P>
He observed that while he appreciated the crafts are
contributing positively to the country's economy, there is need
for the sector to address the issue of raw materials management.
</P>
<P>
The minister warned that the uncontrolled exploitation of raw
materials leads to the depletion of resources.
</P>
<P>
Margaret Katongo, managing director of Zambili D'Afrique which
sponsored the competition, said her institution has devised a
strategy of gradual and continual development which is in line
with the current work methods and attitudes in the country.
</P>
<P>
This involves encouraging the use of less capital intensive
and low technology processed by the small and medium scale
enterprises in their manufacture of high quality finished goods,
said Katonga.
</P>
<P>
She added that her firm is committed to empowering men and
women to be self-reliant through business development while
promoting ethical and effective businesses.

South Korea's foreign reserves stood at 4 billion at the end of
1997, forcing it to borrow 58 billion dollars from the
International Monetary Fund after it was gripped by a financial
crisis caused by corporate failures and bad loans of financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Since President Kim Dae-jung came to power last February, South
Korean foreign reserves gradually rose from 29.75 billion dollars
in March to 40.9 billion dollars in June and 48.83 billion in
October.
</P>
<P>
Economists attributed the increase to brisk repayment of
foreign currency-denominated debt to the central bank by domestic
banks amid a continuing current account surplus.
</P>
<P>
The central bank extended 23.29 billion dollars in emergency
foreign currency loans to domestic financial institutions late
last year in a bid to ease their foreign currency shortage.
</P>
<P>
Of the total loans, it has so far withdrawn 18.36 billion
dollars from financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign currency deposits held by South Korean banks
in foreign countries dropped sharply from 11.33 billion dollars at
the end of 1997 to 3.35 billion dollars at the end of last month.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies Meddling in Nigeria's Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Congressman Donald
M. Payne has denied that the U.S. and other Western governments
are meddling in Nigeria's transition to civil rule program by
trying to install their candidate as Nigeria's next president.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference in Nigerian capital Abuja Monday,
the U.S. congressman said the accusation by former Nigerian
Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi is a lie.
</P>
<P>
He further said the accusation would not deter the U.S. in its
move to assist in enthroning a lasting democracy in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Former Nigerian Foreign Minister Ikimi has recently linked
huge campaign funds announced by some political parties to
donations from Western countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Nigeria has suffered enough and that the West should
allow Nigerians to rebuild their countries and choose their
president themselves.
</P>
<P>
Payne, a Democrat from New Jersey, is leading a five-member
delegation from the U.S. House of Representatives International
Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the bane of Nigeria's problem is
mono-economy and the only way to get out of this problem is
through diversification, with preference to agriculture.

Petrofina he had held, is expected to become the vice-president of
the new French-Belgian merger Total/Fina while former Petrofina
chief executive Francois Cornelis will become another
vice-presidents of the group.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> French Oil Group Total Takes over Belgium's Petrofina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The French oil group Total
announced on Tuesday that it will buy 41 percent of the stocks of
Belgium's Petrofina oil group.
</P>
<P>
Once the merger is completed, the new oil group Total/Fina will
 become the sixth biggest oil group in the world and the third
largest in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The deal was struck Friday evening between Total president
Thierry Desmarest and two major shareholders of Petrofina --
Albert Frere-Paul Desmarais, who holds 30.8 percent of the
group's shares, and Etienne Davignon, who holds 11 percent of the
shares.
</P>
<P>
Petrofina suspended its quotations in stock markets on Monday
in expectation of the takeover while the stock price of Total
rose slightly.
</P>
<P>
Total is expected to spend more than 60 billion francs (about 10
billion U.S. dollars) in acquisition of Petrofina.
</P>
<P>
Total's rival, Elf-Aquitaine, and the Italian oil group ENI also
 wished to take over Petrofina, but Total made a quicker decision,
 said the daily Le Figaro.
</P>
<P>
The takeover will allow Total to strengthen its stand in oil
refining and distribution, the two fields in which Petrofina keeps
a leading position.
</P>
<P>
The refinery plant of Petrofina in Antwerp, northern Belgium,
is Europe's best, said experts.
</P>
<P>
The future Total/Fina will deposit from 230 to 260 billion
francs (38 to 43 billion dollars) in the stock markets, more than
200 billion francs by Elf.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected to realize an annual sales figures of more
than 300 billion francs (more than 50 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Eastern Chinese City Giving ID Cards to Karaoke Girls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Authorities in the city of
Wenzhou in China's Zhejiang Province issue identity cards to women
working in Karaoke houses, the popular recreation spots in today's
China, Shanghai's daily Wen Hui Bao reports.
</P>
<P>
The action was intended to standardize local recreation
services and to maintain public order, a local government official
was quoted as saying. It was manifestly not, the official said, to
legalize pornographic activities.
</P>
<P>
The police are continuing their efforts to crack down on
pornography in Wenzhou, which was a pioneer in China's private
sector.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation, which took effect in March, requires
qualified Karaoke attendants to get approval from the local
cultural and police departments. The City Public Security Bureau
issues cards to qualified women.
</P>
<P>
So far, cards have been issued to nearly 2,800 Karaoke service
attendants in the city, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
In related developments, another media report says that an
official with the State Administration of Taxation (SAT)
emphasized the importance of collecting income tax from any kind
of income, but he confessed that, for the time being, it is
difficult to identify the nature of Karaoke services.
</P>
<P>
In the United States and Canada, tax authorities don't need to
know the nature of an income before the tax is collected, the SAT
official was reported as saying. He went on to say that it is the
duty of law-enforcement departments to decide whether income is
legal or not.
</P>
<P>
Chinese authorities have never given the go-ahead to what they
consider pornographic behavior. Last month, a Beijing court
sentenced a woman who was found guilty of organizing a
prostitution ring to death.

<HEADLINE> At Least Four Infected With AIDS Daily in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Four to five Malaysians
get infected daily with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) which
causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), Malaysian Health
Minister Chua Jui Meng said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This excludes cases not reported to the Health Ministry or of
youths unaware that they have HIV," Chua told a press conference
after officiating this year's World AIDS Day in Rawang near here.
</P>
<P>
About 41 to 42 percent of the country's HIV/AIDS sufferers are
youths under 29.
</P>
<P>
Chua attributed most of the local HIV/AIDS cases to unhealthy
life style such as drug abuse, promiscuous sex and homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
The minister said 27,405 HIV/AIDS cases had been reported in
the country as of September 30, and 1,974 of them were terminal
cases and 1,547 have died.
</P>
<P>
This year alone has recorded 443 AIDS deaths and 3,403 new
cases, he said, adding that the number of deaths due to AIDS has
been on an upward trend, increasing from 258 in 1996 to 408 last
year and 443 this year by September 30.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the number of reported AIDS cases declined
from 4,620 in 1996 to 3,918 last year and 3,403 this year.
</P>
<P>
This reflected the effectiveness of the Health Ministry's

DHAKA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will produce an
additional 190 million cubic feet (MCFT) of natural gas daily
after the third national gas development project is completed by
the end of next year, according to sources of the Energy Ministry.
</P>
<P>
At present, a total of 845 MCFT of natural gas is being
produced in the country by three gas companies, The Independent
daily newspaper Tuesday quoted the sources as saying.

Out of the total amount of gas expected to be produced next
year, 100 MCFT could be extracted from the Habiganj gas field
while the remaining 90 MCFT could be obtained from the Titas gas
field after the completion of the project.
</P>

The project was approved by the government in 1993 and
procurement of drilling and other equipment was completed in 1995,
and preparatory work for well drilling has already been completed
after the engagement of a contractor for mud-logging, wire-logging
and other works by inviting international tenders, the sources

The Bangladeshi government has already undertaken the second
phase plan to discover more gas fields and has given priority to
power generation through natural gas, State Minister for Energy

<HEADLINE> Butler May Fabricate Crisis Any Time: Aziz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said on Monday evening UNSCOM Chief Butler could
fabricate a crisis any time the U.S. would ask for it.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Aziz said the prospects
are there for the fabrication of a new crisis by the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) chief should the U.S. ask him
to do so.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question on the issue of documents, Aziz said
that Iraq had replied in an objective and balanced manner to
Butler's demand to obtain the alleged documents.
</P>
<P>
The issue, Aziz added, was debated in the Security Council, and
there had been new stances adopted by China, Russia, France and
others, criticizing Butler's behavior.
</P>
<P>
He further asserted that should the Americans wish to fabricate
a crisis, Butler can do it, and will cook up any pretext, which
may be documents or something else.
</P>
<P>
Aziz accused the UNSCOM of practicing two types of actions: the
first is based on fabricated issues and unfounded packs of lies
that could not be substantiated with tangible evidence, and the
second is about marginal and branch issues which would not
recognize the closing of disarmament files.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Iraq is ready to cooperate with UNSCOM in charge of
dismantling Iraqi mass destruction weapons, in conformity with the
message he addressed to Kofi Annan on November 14.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Iraq will maintain and defend its independence,
dignity and national security, and any transgression on them by
the UNSCOM members is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Iraq announced its approval to resume unconditional
cooperation with the inspectors of the UNSCOM and the
International Atomic Energy Agency, averting an imminent
U.S. military strikes it.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Calls for Israeli Withdrawal from Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Denouncing Israel's occupation as
a "glaring violation of all international norms," Egypt Tuesday
called on Israel to stop haggling and withdraw immediately from
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis "must learn the lesson of history that occupation
can by no means be ad infinitum," the official Egyptian Gazette
newspaper said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed "security zone" in south
Lebanon in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has since been
spearheading a guerrilla war against the Israeli occupation troops
and their allied South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
A total of 23 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Hezbollah's
attacks since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
Israeli peace activists have urged the government to pull back
from Lebanon. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
insists on a conditional withdrawal, saying Lebanese government
should provide in advance security guarantee for Israel's north
areas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected the demand, holding that the withdrawal
should be unconditional in line with the U.N. Resolution 425
adopted in 1982 after Israel's invasion of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The English-language paper urged Israel to disgorge "what it
has uselessly attempted to swallow," a step it said may "save the
lives of its troops" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The paper, meanwhile, cautioned that "Israel's feet will be
sucked deeper into the Lebanese quicksand" due to Netanyahu's
intransigence.
</P>
<P>
It also warned of "deeper divisions inside Israel because a
dearer price has yet to be paid" by the country.

<HEADLINE> Indian Exports Affected by Southeast Asia Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Indian Planning Commission
member Montek Singh Ahluwalia said Tuesday that India's exports
have been affected by the financial and economic crisis in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a function here organized by the World Economic
Forum and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), he said East
Asian economies, which accounted for a significant share of Indian
exports, had slowed down and acceleration in economic performance
in other major markets like the United States and Europe cannot be
expected.
</P>
<P>
Though India had warded off a direct contagion effect in the
short term, it could not think that meltdown in the region and the
recession the world over did not matter, he said.
</P>
<P>
On India's GDP growth, he said India's economic growth for the
current fiscal year was likely to be below six percent. The
country was trying to attract more foreign direct investments to
bridge a growing balance of payment (BOP) deficit, which was
expected between two to three percent.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, New Regional Center of HIV Epidemic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has replaced
the rest of the sub-continent as the main center of the HIV
epidemic, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
The AIDS scourge has already claimed nearly 130,000 South
African lives this year, which was about 390 a day, South African
Welfare Minister Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the eve of World AIDS Day which falls on Tuesday,
she said South Africa accounted for more than half of the 1.4
million new infections in southern Africa this year.
</P>
<P>
The daily rate of HIV infections is estimated to be 1,600, The
Star paper Tuesday quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
At least 168,000 people had progressed from being HIV-positive
to developing full-blown AIDS, she said.
</P>
<P>
At the same function, Peter Piot, head of the United Nations
Joint Program on HIV/AIDS, said South Africa trailed behind its
neighbors in HIV infections in 1990, but had rapidly caught up in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Piot said AIDS threatened to reverse all the gains of human
development in the country as well as erode participatory
democracy.
</P>
<P>
It was known that migration patterns, poverty and hostels for
men played a role in the rocketing AIDS data, but they did not
explain it all, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fraser-Moleketi said population growth could even be negative
after 2008, with average life expectancy likely to fall from
around 60 to 40 years by then.
</P>
<P>
She predicted that almost 250,000 people would die annually
within three years, with the figure rising to 500,000 by 2007.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative number of AIDS deaths by 2001 would be more
than one million, and more than four million by 2008, she added.
</P>
<P>
Infant deaths were expected to rise by around 20 percent
because of mother-to-child transmission. Deaths among children
aged between one and four could rise by 150 percent from 1995 to
2003, she said.
</P>
<P>
"In 1998 there are already an estimated 100,000 AIDS orphans.
This will rise to 590,000 by 2003 and 1.6 million by 2008," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Fraser-Moleketi said South Africa had been rather late in
waking up to the reality of HIV/AIDS. She urged every government
department to set aside funds for concrete programs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the European Union (EU) announced Monday that it
would give 175-million-Rand (31-million-U.S. Dollars) additional
funds next year to the South African government and
non-governmental organizations to tackle AIDS and HIV-related
problems.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Joint
Program on HIV/AIDS has warned that southern Africa faced an
unprecedented emergency because of the alarming rate at which HIV
infection was spreading.
</P>
<P>
UNAIDS executive director Peter Piot, speaking in Johannesburg on
the eve of the UN World AIDS Day observed worldwide Tuesday, said 1.4
million new infections were identified in the region this year.
</P>
<P>
"We now know that despite these already high levels of infection,
the worst is yet to come in southern Africa. The region is facing
human disaster on a scale never seen before," Piot said.
</P>
<P>
Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe are the four worst
affected countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Up to 26 percent of adults in those countries are estimated to be
living with HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Piot admitted that the organization did not understand exactly why
the killer disease is spreading in the region at such a high speed.
</P>
<P>
Migration patterns, poverty and hostels for men were known to be
contributing to the epidemic, but they could not explain it all, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Fiscal Deficit to Be at 6 Percent of GNP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's overall fiscal
deficit will be capped at 6 percent of gross national product
(GNP), Bank Negara (State Bank) Governor Ali Abul Hassan said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government will maintain its track record and will not
resort to monetization to finance the fiscal deficit, Ali Abul
said in a paper presented to the National Outlook Conference
organized by the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research (MIER).
</P>
<P>
In outlining the financing strategy over the 1998/99 period,
Ali Abul said the government remains committed to the policy of
fiscal prudence and financial discipline in the conduct of fiscal
policy.
</P>
<P>
"The government will assure that its revenue is sufficient to
finance operating expenditure," he said, giving the assurance that
in the conduct of fiscal policy, the private sector would not be
crowded out and would continue to have access to loanable funds.
</P>
<P>
He said a total of 62 billion ringgit (16.315 billion U.S.
dollars) is needed over the next two years to finance the fiscal
deficit, National Asset Management Corporation (Danaharta) and
National Capital Fund (Danamodal) as well as the country's
infrastructure development needs.
</P>
<P>
Danaharta was set to buy over the non-performing loans in the
banking sector while Danamodal would recapitalize weak banks.
</P>
<P>
In terms of sources of funding, the government will rely
largely on non-inflationary domestic sources, he said.
</P>
<P>
This will be done through the issuance of bonds and Malaysian
government securities to the Employees Provident Fund and pension
and insurance funds.
</P>
<P>
The funds required by both Danamodal and Danaharta will be
raised through the issuance of ringgit bonds, the bulk of which
will be subscribed by banking institutions.
</P>
<P>
Danamodal has been successful in raising approximately 7.7
billion ringgit (2.026 billion dollars) from the maiden issue of
11 billion ringgit (2.894 billion dollars) bonds, which were
subscribed by banking and financial institutions through lowering
the Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR).
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor said the government would also rely
on official external sources such as international financial
institutions, specifically the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are currently under way with the World Bank for
loans tied to various projects in the agricultural, infrastructure
and social sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia also hopes to benefit from the Miyazawa initiative,
where the Japanese government will provide 30 billion dollars to
assist Asian countries affected by the regional economic crisis,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia also needs to accelerate structural reforms and
prudential measures to strengthen the financial system, the
governor said, adding that the other major challenge to financing
was the need to ensure the viability of quality loans and Bank
Negara had recognized the significant linkages between the
financial system and the real economy.
</P>
<P>
"Our priority is to ensure that the banks' intermediation
process remains effective so that the banks can continue to
provide financing to the productive sectors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia imposed the minimum 8-percent loan growth this year on
all banking institutions.
</P>
<P>
Ali Abul said Malaysia continued to be committed to a free
market and a sound macreconomic policy which were among challenges
the country would face in the medium term.
</P>
<P>
Ali Abul also said there was a need for international efforts
to ensure a more responsible government and market behavior in
order to avert another global financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Allied Militiaman Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Israeli allied
South Lebanon Army (SLA) was wounded by a roadside bomb in south
Lebanon Tuesday morning, the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The militiaman was moderately injured when his car was blown up
by a bomb in Jezzine, an area controlled by the SLA outside the
Israeli-occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has claimed
responsibility for the attack, saying in a statement that its
operation has destroyed a SLA car, killing or wounding the members
aboard.
</P>
<P>
The Tuesday assault is the latest of series of attacks launched
by Lebanese guerrillas in the past two weeks during which Seven
Israeli soldiers have been killed in the so-called security zone.
</P>
<P>
The mounting death toll of Israeli soldiers, which has reached
23 since the start of this year, rekindled heated debates in
Israel over its continued military presense in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
After an emergence meeting on Sunday, Israeli cabinet held that
its troops will not carry out unilateral withdrawal unless
Lebanese government agrees to guarantee its north security.
</P>
<P>
The demand was firmly rejected by Beirut in April when Israel
offered to withdraw its troops from south Lebanon with the same
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its close ally Syria insisted that Israel pull out
its troops unconditionally in line with the U.N. Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has since been spearheading a guerrilla war to try to
oust the Israeli occupation troops and their allied SLA.

<HEADLINE> WIPO Subregional Forum Inaugurated in Colombo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) inaugurated a subregional forum on
intellectual property for South Asian countries in Colombo
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The WIPO organized the two-day forum in collaboration with the
Sri Lankan Ministry of Internal and International Commerce and
Food.
</P>
<P>
Kingsley Wickramaratne, minister of internal and international
commerce and food, told the inauguration ceremony that the
objective of the forum is to enhance awareness about intellectual
property rights as a useful tool for social, cultural and
technological development.
</P>
<P>
The forum will also provide an opportunity to exchange views on
and experience in the promotion, protection and enforcement of
intellectual property among South Asian Association of Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) countries, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"There may be quite a few areas where the SAARC countries can
commence and develop cooperation on matters relating to
intellectual property," Wickramaratne said, adding that the
exchange of technical and patent information among SAARC nations
would be a fine area for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
This is the first-ever meeting on intellectual property among
SAARC nations. It is being held on a proposal made by
Wickramaratne to a visiting delegation of WIPO in July 1998. All
SAARC member countries have sent a delegation to the forum.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony of the forum was also addressed by the
WIPO representative, the U.S. ambassador and the Indian high
commissioner here.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Brazilian Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji met
with visiting Brazilian Foreign Minister Luis Felipe Lampreia here
today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu told Lampreia that China highly values its relations with
Brazil, adding that the decision of the two countries on
establishing strategic partnership demonstrates not only their
emphasis on bilateral cooperation but also on the broad prospect and
rich content for their cooperation in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Under this framework, both countries have exerted great
efforts, Zhu said, citing the considerable progress in bilateral
ties, frequent high-level exchanges of visit and reinforced
cooperation in the economic, trade, scientific and technological
sectors.
</P>
<P>
He also labeled a joint earth-resource satellite research
project a model for south-south cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In international affairs, the two countries have also supported
and coordinated with each other, Zhu said, expressing the hope
the overall cooperation between them will further advance. This is
not only in the fundamental interest of both peoples, but also
conductive to world peace and development, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia said the joint decision on the establishment of the
strategic partnership in 1993 constitutes a landmark in the history of
bilateral relations. The Brazilian government attaches great
importance to its relations with China, considers it a priority, and
hopes to further accelerate friendly cooperation in various
sectors, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu introduced China's economic situation and its efforts to
fend off the Asian financial crisis. Lampreia highly appreciates
China's achievements in its reform, opening-up and economic
construction, as well as its important contribution to the ease of
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that the Brazilian government has taken a series of
measures to invigorate that country's economy, and the
Chinese government sincerely hopes it will succeed in developing
national economy and upgrading the living standard of its people.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia passed on to Zhu a letter from Brizilian president
Fernando Enrique Cardoso, and Zhu asked Lampreia to convey his
kind regards to the president.

<HEADLINE> PQ Re-elected in Quebec Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Quebec's ruling Parti Quebecois
(PQ) won enough seats to form a majority government in Monday's
general election in the French-speaking province of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The separatist PQ, led by Lucien Bouchard, won 75 seats in
Quebec's 125-seat provincial legislature, according to the latest
reports from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).
</P>
<P>
PQ's main rival, the Liberal Party led by Jean Charest, got 48
seats, while the Action Democratique party secured one seat from
a total of 124 seats up for grabs on Monday, CBC reported.
</P>
<P>
The 125th seat will be decided in a by-election in December
because of the recent death of the PQ candidate.
</P>
<P>
The current election mirrored the results from the 1994
election, when the PQ won 77 seats, the Liberal 47 and the Action
Democratique party one seat.
</P>
<P>
The re-election of the PQ government was widely believed to
have much impact on the future of both Quebec and the country of
Canada as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In the 33-day campaign, PQ leader Bouchard maintained that if
re-elected, his government would seek another referendum on Quebec
independence from Canada when "winning conditions" exist.
</P>
<P>
But in his speech to cheering supporters Monday night, Bouchard
only briefly mentioned the referendum issue, while dwelling on
good government and attacks on Canada's federal government.
</P>
<P>
"We also sought a mandate to get conditions for a winning
referendum on Quebec sovereignty," Bouchard said of the referendum
issue.
</P>
<P>
In Ottawa late Monday night, Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said his government will cooperate with the re-elected
Bouchard government if the latter respected the desire of
Quebecers to improve economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
"But when he (Bouchard) talks about bringing together his
famous winning conditions, which he refuses to reveal, to hold
another referendum on separation, he should know we will defend
our country," Chretien warned.
</P>
<P>
Recent polls also indicated that more than 60 percent of Quebec
people did not want to see another referendum in the near future.
</P>
<P>
In the previous two referendums in 1980 and 1995, Quebecers
twice voted "No" to the province's secession from the Canadian
confederation.
</P>
<P>
While conceding his defeat, Liberal leader Jean Charest said
that both Canadians and Quebecers could take heart from the result
of the election.
</P>
<P>
"The result tonight ... reflects the fact that the people of
Quebec, like the people of all Canada, want this country of ours
to work and be a success," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Romania Denies Selling Missile Systems to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Romania Monday denied any
violation of the U.N. arms embargo resolutions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Romania strictly respects the relevant arms embargo
resolutions by the United Nations Security Council against Iraq
and is dedicated to prevent any attempt to violate the
resolutions," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Carmen Podgorean said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"None of the Romanian agencies has violated the resolutions,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the foreign ministry also denied any knowledge of a
reported visit by Iraqi officials last May, who tried to buy
missile guidance systems.
</P>
<P>
"The foreign ministry knows nothing about such a visit,"
Podgorean said.
</P>
<P>
CNN reported Sunday that monitored by the intelligence services
of the United States, Romania and Israel, the Iraqi delegation has
tried in vain to buy the missile equipment which could be placed
on long-range ballistic missiles and threaten nations as far away
as Israel.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that Iraq had placed an order in 1995 with
a Romanian military factory for the missile systems.
</P>
<P>
Nicolae Vacaroiu, the then prime minister, said Monday that his
government did not sell any weapons to embargoed regions. But he
did not rule out the possibility for a third country to sell
Romania's products.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Romania's Defense Ministry also issued a statement,
saying Romania consistently respects the U.N. resolutions against
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Impounds U.S. Wheat Suspected for Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has impounded 258,000
tons of wheat from the United States, which is suspected to be
infested with a serious disease, Zambian Daily Mail reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The wheat was impounded at the weekend in Chirundu bordering
Zimbabwe, 200 kilometers southeast of Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The wheat was suspected to be infested with Karnal Bunty, a
disease commonly found in America.
</P>
<P>
The wheat was imported by National Milling Company, said Allan
Sakala, Plant Quarantine and Phytosanitary Service coordinator of
the Agricultural Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said the wheat has no Zambian phytosanitary backing to
allow its importation into the country.
</P>
<P>
He said under the phytosanitary regulations, no wheat coming
from America should be allowed to be imported into Africa without
a phytosanitary certificate of the receiving country.
</P>
<P>
Sakala said that the impounded wheat will either be burned or
sent back to the country of origin should it be found with the
disease.
</P>
<P>
He said milling companies should obtain phytosanitary
certificates or risk their wheat being confiscated.
</P>
<P>
He said it is now common for most of the milling companies to
evade the law on phytosanitary and import prohibited agricultural
products into the country in the name of liberalization.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Exports Ostriches to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The first batch of 104
ostriches imported by China from Kenya was shipped by air to
Shantou City, south China's Guangdong Province at mid-night
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The exports are the African red-neck ostriches, aging three or
four years old at their reproductive stage.
</P>
<P>
The ostriches, originated in Kenya, are characterized by fast
growth, big size and disease-resistance, compared with other
species in Africa.
</P>
<P>
An Chinese expert said that the introduction of such ostriches
would promote the development of China's ostrich-raising industry
and enhance the co-operation in agricultural field between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China National Areo-Technology Import and Export
Corporation and the Maasai Ostrich Farm in Kenya signed an
agreement on joint operation of the farm in the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the agreement, the Chinese side owns 40
percent of shares of the farm with an investment of some one
million U.S. Dollars in equipment and cash, while the Kenyan side
holds the rest of the shares, using land and ostriches as its
investment,
</P>
<P>
It is learned that in the next two or three years, the farm
will export some 10,000 parent ostriches to China.

<HEADLINE> IMF Insists on Debts Payment to Kenyan National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and Kenya's central bank have made a firm stand that
the multi-billion-Shilling debt defaulters, including two cabinet
ministers, should be forced to repay their bank loans.
</P>
<P>
A dozen of big names labeled as "defaulters" who "borrowed"
billions of Shilling from the troubled Nation Bank of Kenya (NBK)
have been the focus of attention in Kenya over the past week.
</P>
<P>
Micah Cheserem, Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, said
Monday that hopes for economic recovery would be threatened if "a
few bad boys are left to ruin banks and get away with it."
</P>
<P>
"These defaulters threaten our fragile economy. With the
economy in retreat, the last thing we require are fellows walking
around in luxury when they owe millions (of Dollars)," he was
quoted by Tuesday's national newspapers as saying.
</P>
<P>
He warned that failure to act on the high-profile debtors
could shatter the country's hopes for economic recovery, and
challenged the courts to help uphold banking regulations by not
blocking banks' attempts to seize debtors' assets.
</P>
<P>
The IMF, which halted last year a key loan to Kenya on the
grounds of rampant corruption and weak governance, made it clear
that it is closely watching the Kenyan government's response to
the banking crisis and is backing Cheserem's call for the
repayment of big loans.
</P>
<P>
"You can not have people borrowing money without paying back,"
IMF Resident Representative Festus Osunsade said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Osunsade also said that the multi-lateral lender would, at
Cheserem's request, overhaul the Central Bank of Kenya's banking
supervision department.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the government said it could pull out of the
currently cash-strapped NBK, and banking altogether, after
resolving the crisis caused by panic withdrawals and huge bad
debts owed by powerful individuals.
</P>
<P>
Even after the state paid 33.3 million U.S. Dollars two weeks
ago to counter a run on the bank, it still requires an additional
50 million Dollars recommended by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The IMF stressed that the Kenyan government should pump in
more money to stabilize the bank and then the World Bank's
International Finance Corporation may help find a willing buyer
for Kenyan government's 22.5 percent stake in the bank.
</P>
<P>
The NBK, the fourth largest in the east African country, has
accrued 8.4 billion Shillings (140 million U.S. Dollars) of bad
debts owed by parastatals and powerful individuals including two
cabinet ministers and the Deputy Speaker.
</P>
<P>
The IMF proposals follow the recent collapse of five small
private commercial banks and a run on the NBK by frightened
depositors which took 26.6 million Dollars out of the bank's
reserves three weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Hydro-electric Power Station (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese economists say that Ertan will help relieve power
shortage in Chongqing, the largest city in southwestern China, to
a great degree.
</P>
<P>
The government of Sichuan province has reported that it has
lifted its limits on electric power consumption and has begun
encouraging local enterprises and urbanites to use more
electricity. Annual per capita power consumption in Sichuan is 600
kwh, or 10 percent less than that in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
By year 2000, the power Ertan station will have a combined
capacity of 3.3 million kw and will produce 17 billion kwh of
electricity annually. Its profits are estimated at 5.6 billion
yuan annually, and state taxes at 700 million yuan, with 500
million yuan available annually for new power projects.
</P>
<P>
Liu Junfeng said today that China will build 21 power stations
along the Yalong River, which is a tributary of the Yangtze, over
the next few years and make the river China's largest
hydroelectric production base in the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
The 1,517-kilometer-long Yalong is thought to be an ideal place
for power stations because of its drop of more than 4,400 meters
and potential to produce 33.4 million kw.

<HEADLINE> Experts Meet in Nepal on Free Trade Area in S. Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Economic experts, government
officials and representatives of the private sector from South
Asia began a workshop here Tuesday on the North American Free
Trade Area (NAFTA) and the creation of a free trade area in South
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the workshop on NAFTA and SAFTA (South Asian Free
Trade Area) held at the Kathmandu-based Secretariat of the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), SAARC
Secretary-General Naeem U. Hasan said that during recent years, it
has been a conscious policy of the SAARC to promote fruitful
cooperation with other organizations outside the SAARC region.
</P>
<P>
The five-day workshop is being jointly organized by the SAARC
Secretariat and the Canadian International Development Agency. It
is the first of a series of initiatives that the two organizations
have undertaken under a memorandum of understanding they signed in
July 1997.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC originally decided to launch the SAFTA by 2001, but
its leaders deferred the deadline indefinitely at their 10th
summit in July this year.
</P>
<P>
"We in SAARC are keen to know and learn from the NAFTA
experience as indeed the experience of other comparable regional
arrangements about how the progress toward a free trade regime
could be ensured by promoting cooperation in an open and
convergent manner taking into account varied expectations of
economies with different sizes and strengths," Secretary-General
Hasan said.
</P>
<P>
He said his organization hopes to learn as well the practical
steps necessary to overcome anticipated problems in implementing
specific trade liberalizing measures and policy mixes necessary
from the outset to avoid future encumbrances.
</P>
<P>
"We do also realize that for many of our countries, supply side
constraints and other structural and procedural impediments
constitute a major constraint," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the workshop focuses, among others, on recent
evolutions in the world trading system, relevance of regional
trade arrangements for developing countries, recent evolutions in
the norms and disciplines of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on
regional trade arrangements as well as the NAFTA experience and
its relevance for the SAARC member states.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said that whether it is NAFTA or SAFTA or
AFTA (ASEAN Free Trade Area), the issues of free trade area are
the same.
</P>
<P>
"What we're going to see is what are the issues involved in the
free trade area, how you draft the treaty, what are the elements,
what are the issues which come up," he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He held that the other thing relevant for SAFTA is that NAFTA
has a very big country (the United States), a small country
(Canada) and a rather poor country (Mexico).
</P>
<P>
"In SAARC we also have big countries and small countries. To
that extent, there is a relevance of how all of them in NAFTA are
able to profit equally from the free trade area. This is what
we're hoping to do in South Asia," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Canada are expected to make the main presentations
</P>
<P>
at the workshop attended by representatives from the SAARC
member nations -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Australian MP-Elect Challenged Over Dual Citizenship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Sydney businessman Chuck Hong
Tuesday launched legal action against One Nation Party
senator-elect Heather Hill's eligibility for election because of
her apparent failure to renounce her British citizenship.
</P>
<P>
If successful, the challenge, launched Tuesday morning in a
Sydney court by law firm Phillips Fox, may lead to One Nation's
only federal MP being ousted.
</P>
<P>
Under the Australian Constitution, citizens of another country
are not eligible to stand for the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian-born Hong said he would fund the action along
with the help of the Chinese community and a number of
"like-minded" supporters.
</P>
<P>
"The law is very clear on this issue," Hong told journalists in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"When Heather Hill nominated herself as a senate candidate the
law as it stood then and as it stands now prohibited her from
being eligible to do so."
</P>
<P>
Phillips Fox partner Richard Potter said the law was clear.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the United Kingdom is somehow interpreted not to be a
foreign power within the meaning of the constitution then Mrs.
Hill will be disqualified," Potter said.

<HEADLINE> Cases of Skin-Destroying Bacterium Found in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Three new cases of a
skin-destroying, bizarre bacterium that has defied medical science
for 50 years have been treated at Australia's Mossman hospital in
the past few days.
</P>
<P>
A group of scientists identified the bacterium in 1948 but
there is still no cure other than surgery, the Australian
Associated Press (AAP) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ulcer begins as a small pimple or boil and if not treated will
spread into the fat layers and eat into other tissues and
sometimes bones, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
May Smith, director of nursing at Mossman hospital in the
tropical part of Queensland state, told AAP that there was no
treatment other than surgery and if not treated in these early
stages, severe scarring, skin grafts and lengthy hospitalization
would result.
</P>
<P>
"It can be horrendous, but if recognized early it is just a
simple operation," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know how it originates or how it spread to humans,"
she said. "I suspect it's in the soil or close to the ground."
</P>
<P>
Smith and some other scientists have collected air and water
samples from the tropical Mossman area and will now attempt to
identify the bug in the environment.
</P>
<P>
Smith has been involved in the treatment since 1952 as she
first came into contact with the mysterious infection after a
four-year-old Aboriginal girl was admitted to the Mossman
hospital.
</P>
<P>
"I knew we were treating something really different when she
didn't feel any pain. This child spent four years in hospital."
</P>
<P>
The first cases of infection caused by the bacterium, known as
Mycobacterium Ulcerous infection, were reported in Australia's
Victoria state in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
Other microbacterium strains include M Tuberculosis (which
causes tuberculosis) and M leper (which causes leprosy).
</P>
<P>
There have been 52 cases in north Queensland since 1964,
including 13 in the past year, all from the small sugarcane
growing area of Mossman, and 92 cases have been reported since
1939 in the southern coastal areas of Victoria state.
</P>
<P>
The organism is rampant in Africa with more than 10,000 cases
in the past two years and it also occurs in Papua New Guinea, a
tropical South Pacific island nation.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Hails Jiang's Visit to Russia and Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper, the
People's Daily, Tuesday hailed Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
visit to Russia and Japan from November 22 to 30 as a complete
success.
</P>
<P>
In its front-page editorial entitled "Looking to the Future
with Great Foresight", the newspaper said the visit was an
important diplomatic event of far-reaching historical significance
conducted by the Chinese leader at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the editorial said, Jiang proceeded from a
long-term strategic point of view and held in-depth and candid
exchanges of views with leaders of both countries on the prospects
of developing bilateral ties and on international issues of mutual
concern by summarizing the past and looking into the future.
</P>
<P>
The leaders reached broad agreement, made important
achievements and positively influenced international relations.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Jiang
expounded China's stance on the basic trends of the development of
the international community.
</P>
<P>
Both sides reached a new understanding on strengthening the
strategic prospects of bilateral cooperation and enriched the
China-Russia strategic cooperative partnership, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement issued by the two leaders not only set the
direction of the development of the Sino-Russian relationship
oriented toward the 21st century, but also had a positive bearing
on the advancement of world peace, stability and development.
</P>
<P>
It would go down in history as a notable event in international
affairs at the turn of the century, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Tranquillity and harmony along the border were important signs
of the China-Russia friendly ties, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries shared a border line of 4,300 kilometers. The
joint press communique issued on the informal meeting between
Jiang and Yeltsin said the two countries had for the first time
clearly delimited the east and west border sections in the field.
</P>
<P>
This, the editorial said, was a new model for border security
created by the two countries on the Asian continent.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia were close neighbors and both were influential
powers in the world, the editorial said. It pointed out that their
friendly co-existence, mutual understanding and respect, mutual
support for each other's stability and progress, the growth of
their neighborly ties on the basis of equality and mutual benefit
would enhance the prosperity of both countries and make new
contributions to world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The editorial went on to say that at such an important
historical moment, Jiang also paid the first visit to Japan as
head of state.
</P>
<P>
During his Japan tour, Jiang met with Japanese Emperor Akihito
and held candid and in-depth talks with Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
Apart from meetings with friends from the Japanese government
and the public, Jiang also delivered an important speech at
Waseda University.
</P>
<P>
On these different occasions, the editorial said, the Chinese
president expounded the significance of developing long-term
bilateral friendship oriented toward the 21st century by
summarizing historical experience and lessons, and stressed that
only by using history as a mirror can one progress along the right
path.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China was willing to adopt a forward-looking
attitude on the issue of history, but with a precondition of
squarely facing history and acknowledging it, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Such historical facts as the Japanese invasion of China were
not to be denied, Jiang said, noting that Japan should stick to
the path of peace and development and not allow any form of
militarist forces or trends of thought to re-emerge.
</P>
<P>
The editorial referred to the joint declaration issued after
Jiang and Obuchi's talks as the third important document governing
China-Japan ties following the 1972 Sino-Japanese joint statement
and the 1978 China-Japan Peace and Friendship Treaty.
</P>
<P>
It said the joint declaration pointed out that squarely facing
the past and correctly perceiving history constituted an important
foundation for the development of the Sino-Japanese bilateral
relationship.
</P>
<P>
During the talks and in the declaration, the Japanese side, for
the first time, admitted its past aggression against China, and
demonstrated deep introspection over, and expressed apology for,
the great calamities that its aggressive wars had brought to the
Chinese people, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Japan also reiterated that it would strictly abide by the
principles set forth in the Sino-Japanese joint statement on the
Taiwan issue, noting that there was only one China and that Japan
would not support Taiwan independence, but maintain only
non-official exchanges with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
China, the editorial said, hoped that Japan would keep its word
and work to push forward bilateral exchanges and cooperation in
all fields in accordance with the principles set forth in the
Sino-Japanese joint statement and the China-Japan Peace and
Friendship Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that bringing into the new century a healthy,
stable and lasting Sino-Japanese relationship not only conformed
to the fundamental interests of the people of both countries, but
would contribute to the peace and development of the Asia-Pacific
region and the world.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, both sides decided to establish a friendly and
cooperative partnership devoted to peace and development in the
spirit of looking to the future while having history as a mirror.
</P>
<P>
The positioning of bilateral ties, the editorial said, set the
direction of their future development and signified that their
bilateral relationship had entered a new stage of development.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said in conclusion that in the 21st century, it
was the common wish of people all over the world as well as an
irresistible historical trend to realize lasting peace and create
universal prosperity.

<HEADLINE> Three Combined Exhibitions Open in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Three combined exhibitions
opened here Tuesday despite the depressing climate of the regional
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The three events are the 12th Offshore Southeast Asia 98
(OSEA98), a show catering to the downstream sector of the oil and
gas industry; the Fifth Asian International Welding, Surface
Treatment &AMP; Joining Technology Exhibition (WeldtechAsia98), a show
catering to structural projects in the petrochemical, oil, gas and
maritime industry; and the Fourth Asian International Refining,
LNG &AMP; Petrochemical Technology Exhibition &AMP; Conference
(RLPAsia98), a show designed to ensure that exploration activity
levels seen today sustain well into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
The three trade shows are occupying a total net exhibition
space of more than 6,000 square meters with the participation of
880 companies from 41 countries and areas including China, France,
Germany, Italy, Norway, the Netherlands, the United States,
Australia and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Stephen Lee, chairman of Singapore Trade
Development Board (TDB), noted that the number of participants
from neighboring countries at the international trade fairs staged
in Singapore has been trending downward and the TDB has found a
1.8-percent and 9-percent decline in the number of exhibitors and
visitors respectively compared to previous showings of the same
events.
</P>
<P>
Describing many exhibitors and visitors as more cautious now
with their budgets when deciding which foreign events to
participate in, Lee said Singapore has emphasized the need to
develop itself into an international exhibition city with the aim
to become a premier international trading center.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the Singapore government remains committed to the
long-term development of the Exhibition Management Services (EMS)
industry so as to allow the EMS sector, including the exhibition,
hospitality and leisure service providers, benefit from the
economic spin-offs generated by the foreign participants' stay in
Singapore.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. National
Security Adviser Anthony Lake is expected to arrive in Addis
Ababa Wednesday on his third trip to the area to seek a peaceful
solution to the Ethio-Eritrean border dispute.
</P>
<P>
Lake, who is also special presidential envoy, will hold talks
with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and Foreign Minister
Seyoum Mesfin, according to a media report here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to leave Addis Ababa Friday for the Eritrean
capital of Asmara on similar mission.
</P>
<P>
The talks of the special U.S. presidential envoy in the two
capitals will center around the latest proposals of the
high-level Organization of African Unity (OAU) mediation
committee on the border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea in
Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, early last month.
</P>
<P>
The committee came up with a set of proposals that constitute
elements of a framework agreement for a peaceful settlement of
the border dispute.
</P>
<P>
It urged both parties to communicate subsequently their
"definitive response" to its proposals, in time for it to
incorporate them with its report on the issue to be submitted to
the OAU mechanism for conflict resolution summit, now set for
December 17 and 18, in Ouagadougou.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea has rejected the key element of the OAU peace plan
that calls for the withdrawal of its troops from the disputed
Badme border area.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, which accepted the OAU proposals, insists that
Eritrean forces must withdraw from its territory to pave the way
for negotiated settlement, including the deployment of neutral
observers in Badme and other disputed border areas, and the
delimitation and demarcation of its entire 1,000-kilometer-long
border with Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Lake's two previous visits to the area were October and
November respectively.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's GDP May Contract by 6.2 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian Institute of
Economic Research (MIER) has estimated that Malaysia's gross
domestic product (GDP) is to contract by 6.2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The country's real GDP shrank by 2.8 percent in the first
quarter this year and further by 6.8 percent in the second quarter
and 8.6 percent in the third quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
Given the latest available indicators, all the domestic
components of national income will see sharp declines, MIER said
in a paper on the "Malaysian Economic Outlook 1999-2000" at the
1998 National Outlook Conference here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the private think-tank's two surveys in the third
quarter of 1998 on business and consumer sentiments, there is
little change from the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the paper, Executive Director Mohamed Ariff said the
manufacturing sector is still cautious about the outlook and
consumers are still not showing any rigorous signs of a rebound in
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The surveys however indicated that sentiments may be
stabilizing and a turnaround may materialize in the first half of
1999.
</P>
<P>
With the easing of monetary policy and a stimulating fiscal
policy, aggregate demand will see a slight boost in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Several factors will act as potential constraints to any huge
gains in boosting growth, which include the high level of domestic
debt that needs to be cleared up, business and consumer sentiment
affected by the uncertain labor market outlook, sluggish stock
market and property market and weak external demand.
</P>
<P>
Real GDP, meanwhile, is forecast to grow by 0.7 percent for
1999, a slight turnaround after a steep decline in real GDP in
1998 and the economy is projected to see a better growth of 2.7
percent in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The sharper decline in imports relative to exports will see a
better net trade position for 1998, with the merchandise trade
surplus estimated at 46.1 billion ringgit (12.131 billion U.S.
dollars), the private think-tank said.
</P>
<P>
The services deficit is projected at 19.7 billion ringgit
(5.184 billion dollars) and the current account balance will see a
surplus of 23 billion ringgit (6.052 billion dollars), amounting
to 8.5 percent of the gross national product (GNP).

<HEADLINE> 4 in 10 New Zealand Workers Stressed Out: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wellington, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Nearly four out of 10 New
Zealanders are suffering from advanced stages of job burnout, a
Wellington-based daily reported Tuesday quoting an international
survey.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion said the study of 1,099 workers in manufacturing,

contracting, health, emergency services and small business sectors

shows that on average, 38 percent of the workforce has serious
burnout or chronic job stress.
</P>
<P>
Symptoms include poor health, absenteeism, lower performance,
higher job tension, lack of job satisfaction, feelings of
helplessness and lower self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by Bob Boudreau, a visiting Canadian
researcher who has studied burnout in different countries for more

than a decade.
</P>
<P>
It measured three elements of burnout: emotional exhaustion;
personal accomplishment; and depersonalization, or the tendency to

view people as objects.
</P>
<P>
On an international scale, New Zealand's burnout rate ranks
similar to those of Canada, the United States, Ghana and Israel,
Boudreau said.
</P>
<P>
"Some Japanese companies have burnout rates above 70 percent,"
he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, burnout is a workplace plague that is more
widespread and damaging than most people believe.

<HEADLINE> NZ Government to Sell State-Owned Power Generator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
has
decided to sell its asset of Contact Energy, New Zealand's second

biggest generator, which produces 27 percent of the country's
electricity, The Dominion reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Contact Energy is expected to be worth about 1.5 billion NZ
dollars (810 million U.S. dollars). It would be the biggest sale
of a
government asset through a public float, according to the
Wellington-based newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The government is looking to sell 60 percent of the company by

issuing shares to the public and the remaining 40 percent to a
private investor that would be a "cornerstone shareholder," the
paper
said, adding that it expects the public share float and listing of

Contact Energy on the domestic stock exchange to be completed by
the
middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Treasurer Bill Birch was quoted as saying selling
40
percent of the company to a cornerstone shareholder would bring in

expertise to the company to the benefit of all shareholders.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Canadian-controlled TransAlta would be
interested in a 40-percent stake in Contact Energy.
</P>
<P>
The biggest government asset sale has Telecom in 1990. It was
sold to two U.S. telecommunications companies for 4.2 billion NZ
dollars. They later sold half of Telecom in a public share float.

<HEADLINE> Cigarette Price Up Again in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Smokers in New Zealand will

have to pay at least another 10 cents from Tuesday for a packet of
20
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
The local Evening Post reported Tuesday that the increase is
due
to an annual customs and excise adjustment, linked to the consumer

price index (CPI).
</P>
<P>
It is the second price increase for cigarettes this year. The
New
Zealand government raised the price of a packet of 20 by 50 cents
in
May this year.
</P>
<P>
At present, the price for a packet of 20 cigarettes is as high
as
8 New Zealand dollars (4.3 U.S. dollars) with 5 NZ dollars going
to
the government in tax.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, New Zealand government officials

responsible for public health want to place smokers under intense

pressure by raising cigarette price steadily in order to force
them
to quit smoking.
</P>
<P>
An official figure shows that there are about 4,500 smoking-
related deaths a year in New Zealand.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
has
backed off from buying a third Anzac frigate, which has been in
service with the Australian Navy.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley announced the decision
in
a statement, which was released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Shipley said her government has made the
decision after taking public opinion into account and giving
careful
consideration to the wider social and economic priorities.
</P>
<P>
"With the government's accounts currently under pressure, we
need
to tailor our defense spending at this time," she said.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after a six-hour meeting of the cabinet
Monday and a National Party's caucus meeting Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that Prime Minister Shipley gave up the
thought
of buying the second-hand frigate because she knew her plan could
not
go through the parliament. Some independent MPs and MPs from small

political parties had shown that they would quit from supporting
the
National Party in the parliament if the National minority
government
insisted on buying the frigate.
</P>
<P>
At present, the National Party can only count on 62 votes
including its own 44 votes in the 120-seat parliament.

<HEADLINE> Telecoms Privatization Necessary in Kenya: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The privatization of the
telecommunication sector is necessary to allow smooth flow of
trade, Kenyan Trade Minister Joseph Kamotho said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of a two-day World Trade Organization
seminar, the minister said telecommunication services were vital
in facilitating trade in an increasingly globalized economy.
</P>
<P>
The telecommunication network in Kenya was now inadequate,
which hampers the national and international trade, the Standard
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kamotho told the seminar that his government had planned
to expand the telecommunication network to 2.7 million lines by
the year of 2015 at an estimated cost of 323 billion Shillings
(some 5.4 billion U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The privatization of the telecommunication sector is opened to
local and international investors, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
At present, Kenya has a network of 290,000 telephone lines for
a population of 30 million people with one line serving 100
people.
</P>
<P>
Telephone services in the rural areas are insufficient, with
about 14 percent of lines serving 80 percent of the country's
population, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Hydro-electric Power Station Operating (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANZHIHUA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Ertan Hydro-electric
Power Station, China's largest water conservation project this
century, began operating its first two generating units today.
</P>
<P>
At an inaugural ceremony, the Vice-chairman of the National
People's Congress Standing Committee, Zou Jiahua, said that
starting up the first two generating units on schedule showed
China's ability to build world-class projects.
</P>
<P>
This lays a foundation for energy development and the
revitalization of economic growth in the central and western parts
of the country for the next century, Zou said.
</P>
<P>
Ertan is on the lower reaches of the Yalong River in Sichuan
Province and is the second largest power station being built in
China, after the Three Gorges. It will have six 550,000-kw
generating units, with one coming on-line every four months, the
last starting up in year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The project has set a number of records: the world's longest
diversion tunnel (at 1,167 m.) and Asia's largest underground
power house, 280 m. long by 25.5 m. wide and 65 m. high.
</P>
<P>
Ertan is expected to cost 28.5 billion yuan, with 1.8 billion
U.S. dollars coming from World Bank loans. In addition to the
large work force, it has 700 technicians and specialists from 47
countries involved.
</P>
<P>
Inspections done in recent years have given class-A ratings to
all of Ertan's projects that are using loans, says Liu Junfeng,
the general manager of the Ertan Hydro-electric Power Development
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Liu attributes the project's success to the use of
international bidding and financing and the extensive use of
advanced technology and management methods.

PARIS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- French clubs will be prevented
from listing shares on the stock market according to an upcoming
sports law due to be presented this year but delayed, sports
minister Marie-George Buffet was quoted as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The French clubs, such as Marseille, Paris Saint-Germain and
Strasbourg, planned to followsuit wealthier clubs in England,
Germany, Italy, and Spain by listing shares on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
However, Buffet said they feared that Stock market games would
influence sporting results.
</P>
<P>
The new law would maintain the current restriction, while the
clubs were lobbying the government to lift the ban.
</P>
<P>
In England, more than a dozen soccer clubs trade shares, and
in Italy, Lazio became the first club to list earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
If the clubs fail to attain their hope, they will find it more
difficult to compete with rich clubs in other European soccer
giants.

WASHINGTON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Evander Holyfield and

Lewis, who attended today's news conference in New York,
said:"The fans are getting a fight they want to see. I've been
waiting for this fight for such a long time. It's basically
overdue."
</P>
<P>
Holyfield, the WBA-IBF champion from the United States, said
however, "I never thought it wouldn't happen."
</P>
<P>
Ticket prices will range from $1,500 to $100. No pay-per-view

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Shrimp Export Rises Significantly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Export of Bangladesh's frozen
foods, especially shrimp, have registered a sharp rise during the
last two years in spite of the various odds faced by exporters, an
English daily newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh now exports 30,000 tons of shrimps a year as against
only 18,000 tons two years ago, The Bangladesh Observer said.
</P>
<P>
The Frozen Food Association attributed the rise to the efforts
made by exporters in successfully overcoming the temporary ban
imposed by the European Commission (EC) on Bangladeshi shrimps.
</P>
<P>
The ban came on July 1997 following inspection of some shrimp
processing plants by the EC experts for not fulfilling the quality
management as required.

<P>
The temporary ban was withdrawn in late December 1997 as the
government leaders and exporters committed to fulfill the EC's
quality specifications.
</P>
<P>
Since the withdraw of the ban, the exporters, specially fish
processing plant owners, have made additional investment to
modernize their factories and maintain the "strict" sanitation
requirement as prescribed by the importers including the EC.
</P>
<P>
The total fish production in the country during the July
1997-June 1998 fiscal year was estimated at 1.49 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The fisheries sector accounts for about 10 percent of
agriculture GDP (gross domestic product), 3.7 percent of total GDP
and over eight percent of the total foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the sector provides for about 1.5 million full-time
fishermen and about 11 million part-time fishermen.

<HEADLINE> Some Indian Banks to Introduce Gold Deposit Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) has set the priority for nominated banks to introduce gold
deposit schemes in a bid to decrease gold imports, The Observer of
Business and Politics said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The plan also aims at channeling hoarded gold in the country
into productive and economic use. The apex bank has requested each
of the nominated agencies to formulate necessary schemes and
submit the proposals at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
The RBI proposes to make it compulsory for the 10 nominated
banks in the bullion trade to not only sell gold, but also to
facilitate the buying of gold in the form of jewelry from the
public.
</P>
<P>
Also on the RBI's priority list is the introduction of the gold
accumulation plan for the general public whereby the latter would
have access to gold at international rates.
</P>
<P>
The idea behind the RBI's move is that by maintaining the gold
in banks' vaults, banks could lend against it and thereby save
foreign exchange.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Asks For More Flood Rehabilitation Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh needs an additional
276.48 million U.S. dollars for flood rehabilitation, according to
Finance Minister S.A.M.S. Kabria.
</P>
<P>
The minister appealed for more aid during a meeting with
representatives of donor countries and international agencies in
Dhaka Monday, press reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 941.24 million dollars are needed for Bangladesh's
flood rehabilitation and so far the country has received funding
commitments of 664.76 million dollars by donor countries and
international agencies, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government made an appeal in August this year
to donor countries and international agencies for 880 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The additional funds would be required to finance flood
rehabilitation projects concerning urban development, health and
family welfare, rural infrastructure and livestock, he explained.
</P>
<P>
The development partners have given assurance of necessary
funds for post-flood rehabilitation, he added.
</P>
<P>
The floods from July to September this year affected two-thirds
of the country, killed over 1,500 people and destroyed thousands
of houses and damaged roads and rail lines. The most prolonged
disastrous deluge also destroyed move than 2 million tons of rice
in the fields. The overall economic losses are estimated at 4.3
billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's HIV Infection Rate Highest in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia has Asia's highest
infection rate of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which
causes the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), according
to health officials.
</P>
<P>
"About 150,000 of Cambodia's 11 million people are currently
infected with HIV," the Cambodia Daily Tuesday quoted Mean
Chhivun, director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mean Chhivun said that although the government has launched a
condom-use campaign in cooperation with NGOs (non-governmental
organizations) and local businesses to sell 1 million condoms per
month, the HIV infection rate is still surging because it is
difficult to get the message out.
</P>
<P>
"The major reason is the lack of social movement in changing
the social norms...we lack the social mobilization," Mean Chhivun
said.
</P>
<P>
Poverty, lack of education, widespread prostitution, limited
condom use and a social breakdown after years of war have all
contributed to the problem.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey, the money spent on prostitutes every
year in Cambodia was 20 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A recent Ministry of Health survey indicated that four out of
10 prostitutes are HIV carriers while one of every five beer
promoters has contracted the disease.
</P>
<P>
The rate of HIV carriers among police was 6.2 percent while 2.4
percent of married women are also infected with the virus,
according to the survey.

<HEADLINE> Opium-Substitute Crop Test Cultivation Successful in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The test cultivation of flower
wheat, an opium-substitute crop, in Myanmar with the cooperation
of Japan is showing success, said Myanmar leader
Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt.
</P>
<P>
The test cultivation of the crop on 81 hectares was part of the
country's plan to wipe out narcotic drugs, disclosed Khin Nyunt,
First Secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and Development
Council, when meeting with regional authorities in Lashio,
northern Shan state, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Harvesting time has now arrived and substitute crop
cultivation will be extended for regional progress and to
eradicate narcotic drugs," added Khin Nyunt, who is also Chairman
of the Work Committee for Development of Border Areas and National
Races.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has worked out a plan for total elimination of narcotic
drugs within 15 years, initiating the move in 48 townships in the
country which cover those in Shan, Kachin, Kayah and Chin states
after successful transformation of eastern Shan state's Mongla
region into an opium-free zone in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
The country promulgated the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic
Substances Law in 1993, followed by the formation of the Central
Committee for Drug Abuse Control, undertaking the implementation
of drug control projects, aimed at uplifting the living standard
of border region inhabitants and eradicating poppy cultivation.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, in the first six months of
this year, Myanmar seized a total of 4,927 kilograms of narcotics
including 219 kg heroin and 4,471 kg opium, destroying 15 heroin
refineries and over 8,000 hectares of poppy plantations.

JAKARTA -- The Central Bureau of Statistics of Indonesia
announced that annual rate of inflation slowed to 78.15 percent
in November from 79.14 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
"During November, inflation stood at 0.08 percent, lower than
that recorded in 1997 (1.65 percent) due to a drastic fall in the
prices of some basic needs," Kusmadi Saleh of the Bureau's
Distribution and National Balance Statistics said.
</P>
<P>
From January to November 1998, inflation stood at 75.14 percent
 while from April to November 1998 it reached 37.78 percent, Saleh
 was quoted by national newspapers Tuesday as saying.

LONDON -- World oil markets broke records again Monday as
benchmark Brent marked historic lows in London and light crude in
New York touched levels not seen for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
In London, Brent crashed to 10.08 dollars a barrel at one
stage, the lowest price ever recorded on the International
Petroleum Exchange, before a mild bounce brought Brent back from
the brink to close 66 cents down at 10.48 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Adjusted for inflation, prices are now at 25-year lows.
</P>
<P>
New York selling, which had triggered the precipitous fall in
London, took the front month contract under 11 dollars. Mild short
covering there too scooped the contract back from calamity to
11.23 dollars a barrel -- but still over 60 cents lower on the
day. (Oil Prices-New Lows)

The Dow Jones industrial average closed 216.53 lower to

business onto a new electronic platform on Monday.

Designed in conjunction with LIFFE's customers, the system's

It can also be integrated with other existing systems.

Experts say it will make traded options more attractive, thus
boosting the market with enormous potentials, especially after
Euro, the single European currency, is launched early next year.
</P>

However, LIFFE said, the new system initially will be used only
in the trade of options over individual stocks and then, probably
years later, in the trade of government bond futures.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Macedonian Assembly Monday
approved the composition of the new government led by Prime
Minister Ljupco Georgievski and the government's policy statement,
following a full day of debate and deliberations.
</P>
<P>
The new government is composed of the Internal Macedonian
Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonia National
Unity (IMPO-DOMNU), which together won 62 of the 120 seats of the
assembly during the four rounds of voting of the third assembly
elections.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the assembly, Georgievski vowed to take
active measures to promote privatization and welfare reforms.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his government will continue its efforts to
join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and further
develop relations with the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia will try to solve disputes with its neighbors over
issues of country names, languages and territory, he added.
</P>
<P>
Georgievski, 32, a graduate from the language and literature
faculty of Skopje University, has been chairman of IMPO-DOMNU ever
since its founding in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He became Macedonia's vice president in 1991, but resigned
eight months later because he felt disappointed with the country's
slow transformation, reports said.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Georgievski became leader of the major opposition party
by boycotting the second assembly election. He was elected into
the third assembly on October 18 and appointed by President Kiro
Gligorov as the new prime minister on November 23.

<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Li Peng
said that the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) has no
structural reform plans.
</P>
<P>
China has its unique conditions and democracy should be judged
by substance and content, not by form, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, made the remarks in
a recent interview with Peter Seidlitz of Handelsbatt, a
Germany-based newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the elections of villagers' self-management
organizations in China, Li said that China officially promulgated
the Organic Law on Village Committees which contains many new
provisions on election procedures. "We believe that only
with an institutionalized structure, can we ensure justice and
democracy of elections", he noted.
</P>
<P>
The election of village committees is based on universal vote
and people can freely nominate their own candidates, who can only
get elected with over half of the votes, he said.
</P>
<P>
The village committee will make administration of village
affairs open, in labor matters, in the use of land for housing and
family planning, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that there is a procedure for removal of
members of the village committee, whereby 20 percent of the
villagers can request their removal, but there will have to be
support from over half of the villagers.

<TEXT>
<P>
Democracy starts with the grassroots in China because for an
ordinary villager, the person who is of direct concern to him is
not the provincial governor or the county magistrate or even the
head of the township, but the chairman of the village committee,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
"We are also trying to improve the residents' committees in
cities, which roughly correspond to your communities and are
self-management organizations for city dwellers", Li said. "We are
trying to improve the workers' congress system in factories", the
NPC chairman added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that to govern the country according to law
represents an important fundamental strategy for administration.
</P>
<P>
The people's will and the will of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) should be written into law through legal procedures for all
the organizations in the country, including the CPC itself, to
observe, Li said. "In this way, we can avoid repeating the past
mistakes", he noted.
</P>
<P>
Asked how China handles the abuse of power, Li said that cases
involving abuse of power will be dealt with according to law.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is equal before the law, as is clearly provided for
in principles of the Constitution. And there is no exception given
to anybody. Everyone, leaders naturally included, shall abide by
the law", Li emphasized.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman on Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that
the Three Gorges Project is moving ahead and everything is going
according to schedule.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in an interview with Beijing correspondent
Peter Seidlitz of Germany's Handelsbatt.
</P>
<P>
In response to Seidlitz' question about whether the Three
Gorges Dam project could stop another flood next year, he said
that because it is still going on it would not have any great
effect on flood prevention and control next year, but could do so
in five years' time and even more so by 2009.
</P>
<P>
If, in 2009, China were to be hit by a flood of this year's
magnitude, then it could avoid a disaster on the middle and lower
reaches of the Yangtze River, Li said.
</P>
<P>
In the past, however, there were floods even bigger than this
year's, meaning that the Three Gorges Dam alone cannot solve the
flood problem on the middle and lower reaches, he pointed out and
a massive effort is needed on mountains to plant trees and
conserve water and soil, and, on the lower reaches, the
embankments need to be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
This will need a comprehensive approach to solve the problem
once and for all, Li said, and this year's flooding testified yet
again to the need for the Three Gorges Dam.

<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress, spoke
recently with Peter Seidlitz, the Beijing correspondent of
Germany's Handelsblatt.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about whether China is preparing a
press law, Li said, "we will formulate a law that will conform
with China's national conditions."
</P>
<P>
In the two decades of reforms and opening up, Li said, great
changes have taken place in the press and in public opinion in
China and there is a considerable degree of openness and
freedom. "But, we will still tell members of the press that they
should not report anything that does not reflect reality or that
distort facts," he said.
</P>
<P>
To do so would be against professional ethics of the media and
would mislead the public, he said. Freedom of press should be
followed, but individual freedom should not hinder the freedom of
others.
</P>
<P>
Press freedom should be useful for national development and
social stability, he said, and mentioned the news program "Focus"
on CCTV (China Central TV), which exposes the flaws and mistakes
of government offices at various levels.
</P>
<P>
He added that this kind of exposure has never been seen before.
</P>
<P>
Li said that it is fair to say that there has been a great deal
of progress in the international media's coverage of China and
that it is much more objective than before, but that there are
still reports that don't conform to the facts.
</P>
<P>
"We don't think that only reports praising China are good and
reports with some criticism are not necessarily bad for our work,"
he emphasized, explaining that different people may have different
perspectives and different reports on the same event.

<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that
Mao Zedong Thought is a valuable ideological asset of the
Communist Party of China and that China is still guided by it.
</P>
<P>
Mao made indelible contributions to the founding of the
People's Republic of China and the development of the socialist
cause, Li said in a recent interview with Peter Seidlitz, Beijing
correspondent of Germany's Handelsbatt.
</P>
<P>
Seidlitz said that he had watched the celebration of the 100th
anniversary of the birth of President Liu Shaoqi on television and
that he was surprised that the blame for Liu's death had been put
on the Gang of Four and a former defense minister, and asked
whether Mao Zedong's role could be part of the assessment of the
history of that time.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the charges against Comrade Liu Shaoqi were
trumped up and the result of frame-up by Lin Biao, Jiang Qing and
others, and that this had been clearly stated by the 6th Plenary
Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Mao Zedong has a major responsibility for the serious
mistakes of the "Cultural Revolution", which had an impact on the
whole country, Li said, but, taking his life as a whole, his
contributions to China's revolution far exceeded his errors, and
his contribution is the most important.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman on China's Legislative Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Priority in China's
legislative work is given to improving laws on the socialist
market economy and with economic globalization, no one can live in
isolation from others and the Asian financial crisis has left many
questions about this, said Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Because countries differ in levels of strength and
development, developing countries should learn to protect
themselves in the financial sector, otherwise they will suffer
from economic control by rich countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with Peter Seidlitz, Beijing correspondent of
Germany's Handelsblatt, Li said that the NPC is now discussing a
draft of the Contract Law that has been discussed twice by the
Standing Committee. What is needed is a comprehensive Contract Law
for the market economy to protect foreign investment in China and
trade with China.
</P>
<P>
The full text of the draft has appeared in newspapers to
solicit people's views because it is fundamental to civil and
commercial law, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a draft of the Securities Law has been examined by
the Standing Committee four times, with the debate mainly
concentrating on futures.
</P>
<P>
There should be futures trading in securities in accordance
with international practice, but some people believe that the
stocks market in China are under-developed for futures, which are
too speculative.
</P>
<P>
After seriously studying the lessons from the Asian financial
crisis and the global financial turmoil, the Standing Committee
achieved a relative meeting of the mind, that is China does not
have the conditions for practicing futures trading in securities,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, China now have two stock exchanges, one in
Shenzhen and the other in Shanghai, with a total market
capitalization of two trillion yuan, 38 million accounts and a
daily transaction volume of 10 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Equity markets in China are products of reform and opening
up. Their advantage is that they can absorb capital from people
for national-building, but their weakness is that once excessive
speculation occurs, some share-holders will suffer from
significant losses, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said he has been to Shenzhen recently for legislative study,
an important question of which was to look into whether the
banking sector can also participate in the trading of stocks.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that as banks possess big amounts of funds while
individual share-holders only have limited capital, if banks
participate in the stock markets, it would mean unfair
competition," he said.
</P>
<P>
This phenomenon was seen in this Asian financial crisis, where
hedge funds can mobilize great amounts of capital from banks in a
very short time and use that to attack a certain market, Li said.
</P>
<P>
To prevent this situation, he said, there will be unequivocal
stipulations in the law that the operations of the banking and
securities sectors shall be separated and banks shall not
participate in dealing in stocks.
</P>
<P>
Li also introduced China's general legislative work. According
to him, China has a five-year legislative plan and also an annual
legislative program.
</P>
<P>
Naturally, he said, this does not mean that the entire plan or
program will be fulfilled on schedule, because that depends on
the actual situation that the completion of a law requires the
approval of the majority of the NPC deputies of Standing
Committee members, which takes time.
</P>
<P>
In line with the law, draft laws may be put forward by the
government, the people's courts and procuratorates in the case of
judicial laws, and the special committees of the NPC.
</P>
<P>
Thirty signatures of deputies are enough for the tabling of a
legislative motion, but generally, these deputies are not able to
draw up a complete draft law. Nontheless, they can put forth
their basic requirements of the draft law.
</P>
<P>
China has altogether nearly 3,000 deputies in the NPC, and
every year a plenary session is held. During its recess, the 155
member Standing Committee hold sessions lasting seven to 10 days
every two months.
</P>
<P>
The NPC also has nine Special Committees with altogether 212
members, who work full time to assist the NPC and its Standing
Committee in their legislation and supervision.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The year of 1998 will be
remembered by Southeast Asians as the toughest one since World War
II, during which they have to fight a tough battle -- easing pains
of a regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
After decades of remarkable economic growth, Southeast Asian
nations were suddenly hit by a financial shock in July 1997.
Economic "tigers" or potential "tigers" have seen abrupt and steep
downturn of economic growth, and fallen into a severe economic
recession during the course of the 18-month-old crisis.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis, which was characterized by currency
depreciation, rising prices, higher interest rates, massive
business failures and lay-offs, has been translated into
deleterious social consequences.
</P>
<P>
In the five countries hardest hit by the crisis -- Thailand,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and South Korea, the crisis
has directly affected employment, earnings, education, health and
all other social sectors of most population groups.
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, about 90 companies closed every day, and many
companies are cutting salaries by up to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the unemployment rate went up from 7.4
percent in 1997 to 13.3 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, 48 percent of the country's 202 million people
are now below the official poverty line.
</P>
<P>
With the grave social impact of the financial crisis, massive
protests and demonstrations, political unrest and riots have
rocked the once relatively stable region. Following government
changes in Thailand and South Korea, Suharto, who ruled Indonesia
for 35 years, resigned from presidency in May. Some other
countries are also facing threats of a social crisis.
</P>
<P>
To maintain social and political stability of the region,
Southeast Asians, both governments and individuals, have done
their best to alleviate the pains of the crisis in the past year,
and to some extent, with success.

</P>
<P>
As massive unemployment as a result of the crisis has caused
intolerable pains to millions of families in the region,
governments, communities, and labor or management, have all tried
one way and another to minimize the social impact.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the problem, governments in the region have
implemented job-retaining programs, employment services and job
creation programs to assist the unemployed. The South Korean
government has developed a job creation program of start-up loans
for unemployed professionals and managers to help them set up
their own ventures.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare launched
a Center for Assistance to Laid-off Workers. The center is a
one-stop service for laid-off workers that assists with security
cards, job placement, training courses and low-interest loans.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, social security funds in the amount of 300
million pesos (7.5 million U.S. dollars) were used to finance a
program providing low-interest loans to re-training of unemployed
workers.
</P>
<P>
On their part, the management did not respond by simply laying
off workers, but worked together with the labor to minimize the
social impact of the crisis. In the Philippines, trade unions and
employers reached agreements in February and March to avoid
lay-offs and strikes. Over 50 percent of the companies in South
Korea have imposed a freeze on new recruitment, 17 percent have
used early retirement, and 14 percent have used reductions in
working hours.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, some unemployed people in Indonesia and
Thailand migrated from cities to rural areas to work on a family
farm.
</P>
<P>
As an effective way to reduce the pains of the people under the
poverty lines, governments in the region have resorted to direct
cash payments, loans, or distribution of food to create a social
safety net, which had been neglected in most Southeast Asian
nations before the crisis.
</P>
<P>
While the South Korean government has provided loans to the
unemployed and other poor people to cover their general living
expenses, the Philippine Department of Social Welfare and
Development has administered a program of cash transfer to the
poor.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has sponsored a public works program
targeted for the poor instead of providing cash or food. For
1998-99, these programs are budgeted at 2 billion dollars and are
expected to generate 2 million jobs for the poor.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman on Legislature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) spoke
recently with Peter Seidlitz, Beijing correspondent of Germany's
Handelsblatt, on China's legislation.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the NPC and its Standing Committee have enacted
over 300 laws and related decisions on the basis of the
Constitution since the reforms and opening-up began, and the 8th
NPC achieved a great deal in revising the Criminal Law.
</P>
<P>
China had a planned economy in the past, he said, and is now in
the process of building a socialist market economy, so it needs
laws to regulate market behavior.
</P>
<P>
The current NPC has promulgated a number of important laws like
the Higher Education Law and a revision of the Land Management
Law.
</P>
<P>
He said that the revision was necessary because China suffers
from insufficient land resources and recent construction work has
taken up large amounts of farmland, which is a dangerous thing.
So, the revised law puts greater restrictions on land use to
protect arable land.
</P>
<P>
Every province should essentially strive to restore farmland
that has been used for other purposes, and the law provides for a
rigorous compensation system for farmers. The requisition of land
for farmland requires compensation of as much as 30 times the
output value of that particular parcel of land in that particular
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 9th NPC proposed a preliminary socialist legal system with
Chinese characteristics and the Standing Committee is now doing
the corresponding planning and guidelines for legislative work, he
said.

</P>
<P>
Experts said that such public employment programs have proven
to be effective components of social safety nets.
</P>
<P>
With prices of food, fuels and social services rising steeply
during the crisis, governments in the region have also enforced
price controls or subsidies as part of social safety nets.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, free health insurance coverage for the unemployed
has extended from six months to one year. In South Korea, laid-off
workers may continue their health insurance for up to six months.
It also made loans available to the unemployed to help pay for
education, health and housing expenses.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, the government has developed a program to provide
loans and scholarships to poor families to enable them to keep
their children in school during the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Most governments in the region have exempted the poorest
segments of the population from paying even the nominal fees that
are typically charged for public health services.
</P>
<P>
Apart from these measures, most of these countries have used
insurance systems, pensions and provident funds (savings plans
belonging to individual workers) to ease the social impact of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Although as far as the extent of the social impact of the
crisis is concerned, what has been done by countries in the region
seem still not enough, both governments and individuals have done
their best and achieved some success.
</P>
<P>
Since social consequences of the financial crisis are likely to
persist even after the regional economy starts its slow recovery
in the second part of 1999, Southeast Asians have to continue
their tough battle in order to win a final victory.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman on Political Parties in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The chaotic situation of the
"Cultural Revolution," where thousands of political organizations
could appear overnight, should not be repeated, according to Li
Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in an interview with Peter Seidlitz, a
Beijing correspondent of German-based Handelsblatt.
</P>
<P>
in response to a question about whether it is legal or not to
set up political parties, he noted that people should act in
accordance with with the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China is the leading force of China's
revolution and construction, and the People's Congress system is
the fundamental political system of China, he said, and there are
provisions on ensuring that people enjoy an extensive amount of
democracy under this system.
</P>
<P>
There are eight non-Communist parties in China, which grew out
of the country's protracted revolutionary struggle for national
independence and liberation, and they still play an
important role in the political and social life of China, he
said.
</P>
<P>
They are not opposition parties, but are parties that
participate in managing state affairs and represent different
social groups, Li explained. And they do not necessarily share the
same view as the CPC.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the NPC, there is a CPC-led multi-party
cooperation and political consultation system, under which the CPC
or the Chinese Government consult with these parties to solicit
their views, and this system suits China's national conditions and
the people support the CPC leadership, he said.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman on Conclusion on Political Disturbance in 1989 </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC),
spoke recently with Peter Seidlits, Beijing correspondent of
Germany's Handelsblatt, on the conclusion on the political
disturbance in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Party and the Government have already drawn
the correct conclusion on the political disturbance of 1989 and
that will not be changed in any way.
</P>
<P>
This is the consensus of the Party Central Committee with
Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, Li added.
</P>
<P>
Seidlitz said that he thought that China's answer on the June
4th disturbance was that the Party has already reached this
conclusion but that another Chinese leader had said to him in an
interview that history will decide.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, history will decide and history has already decided," was
Li's response. "Our views are the same," he said, explaining that
in answers to questions, specific wordings or way of expressions
may be different, but the spirit is the same and that leaves no
room for fault-finding.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Denies Multi-Party System in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- China promotes democracy and
the rule of law but its road is not patterned after the Western
approach with a separation of powers, a multi-party system, and
privatization, said Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks in a recent interview given to Peter
Seidlitz, Beijing correspondent of Germany's Handelsblatt.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about how the Chinese government
deals with people who want to form an NGO, Li said that the
government will look at the nature of any such organization.
</P>
<P>
If its purpose runs contrary to the Constitution or the basic
policies of China, or against the socialist market economy,
national unity, and independence, or against social stability, and
if it is designed to negate the leadership of the Communist Party,
then it will not be allowed to exist, Li said.
</P>
<P>
But if it is a social group engaging in various activities
beneficial to society, then it will be allowed, as long as it is
registered, he added.
</P>
<P>
China has its own conditions and is a developing country with a
large population. Adopting the Western system indiscriminately and
completely in developing countries will not work and imposing it
in developing countries has never produced good results, he said.
</P>
<P>
"So I believe it should be up to the people of various
countries to make their own decision about the road to
development, and the social system that they would like to adopt
in their own countries, and it should not be judged by Western
standards," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, some Russian friends have praised China and
some have even said that Russia should follow in China's
footsteps. But, he said because countries are different, the
experiences and practices of China may not apply to other
countries, and that they should adopt the system that is suited to
their own conditions.
</P>
<P>
In China, economic development has to be conditioned on
political stability and on the correct handling of the
relationship between reforms, development and stability, Li said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- China's National People's
Congress (NPC) will not use the Westminster formula, whereby
members of parliament are noisy and even rude to each other during
debates, said Li Peng, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Although many may consider that system interesting, the Chinese
people may not be able to accept it, he said. "Maybe this is where
Eastern and the Western cultural traditions differ," Li told Peter
Seidlitz, Beijing correspondent of Germany's Handelsblatt,
recently.
</P>
<P>
Li said he once had the opportunity to observe a parliamentary
session in another country. The opposition party and the ruling
party sat opposite each other. When one side was speaking, people
on the other side were boisterous and chaotic, stamping their feet
or clapping their hands, so the Speaker was crying "order, order"
while striking the gavel, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
In fact, he added, debates can be very heated in the NPC, its
Standing Committee and Special Committee sessions, and divergent
views are expressed.
</P>
<P>
Exactly because of this that repeated discussions and
deliberations are needed, he said. That is why drafts of laws
normally have to go through three reviews before they are finally
passed and sometimes this takes several years.

<HEADLINE> China Considers Opening Telecom Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- China is striving to open its
telecommunication service market to overseas operators by
restructuring its telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jianzhou, director-general of the Planning Department of
of the Ministry of the Information Industry (MII), told a press
conference here today that there is yet no exact timetable for
opening up the country's telecommunication service market.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that China is doing such jobs as separating
postal services from telecommunication services and delinking
operation companies from MII.
</P>
<P>
"These efforts are aimed to create a fair and equal
competition environment for both Chinese and overseas operation
companies," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the recent government investigation of foreign
fund utilization in China Unicom, the sole competitor to the
state-owned China Telecom in the operation sector, does not mean
closing doors to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the investigation is conducted against
certain activities that violated the existing Government
policies. It is designed to protect the interests of foreign
investors, and the results of the investigation will be released
soon.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that China will continue to encourage competition
and foreign investment in the telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
"the operation market is not mature enough for opening to
overseas companies," he said. He gave four reasons for that.
</P>
<P>
First, preferential government policies constitute a
significant percentage of revenues of the operation
sector. Therefore it will be hard to divide profits between
Chinese and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Second, at present, China transfers profits from operation
companies in the eastern part of the country to the loss-making
ones in the western part of the country. This will cause a problem
in offering universal services of the same quality to people around
the country.
</P>
<P>
Third, the fee collection system of the operation sector has
yet to be liberalized.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, China has yet to enforce a telecommunications law to
regulate market competition.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that China is accelerating the process of
restructuring the telecommunications industry and drafting the
telecommunications law.

<HEADLINE> One-Way Charge on Mobile Telephony Unlikely in Near Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- China will not practice one-way
charge on mobile telephone services in the near future, a Ministry
of Information Industry (MII) official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The practice of one-way charge will surely promote the
development of mobile phone services in China, said Chang
Xiaobing, deputy director of the Administration of
Telecommunications under the MII.
</P>
<P>
But there is no exact timetable for implementing one-way charge
because it involves very complex work, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to him, one-way charge requires renovating the
existing charging system, expanding the capacity of the existing
communication network and improving the supporting systems of the
network.
</P>
<P>
He said that the MII and other relevant authorities have
already conducted extensive feasibility studies on adopting
one-way charge.
</P>
<P>
The proposal of one-way charge on mobile telephone services has
been made for at least two years in the country. At present,
anyone who makes and receives a mobile phone call have to pay fees
for the service.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China has more than 23 million mobile telephone
subscribers, and the figure is expected to top 40 million by the
year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Asia Likely to See Economic Turnaround in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- After 18 months of suffering in
the worst financial crisis in decades, Asians saw at last signs of
an economic turnaround in the region: rising currencies and
stocks, lower interest rates, remarkable improvement in current
account balances...
</P>
<P>
All these signs indicate that the crisis is likely to bottom
out in the next six or seven months and Asia could embark on the
road to economic recovery in 1999, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Since the Thai-style crisis spread to the rest of Asia in July
1997, signs of a turnaround emerged several times, and many
economists, including some from the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), claimed not only once that the crisis had reached the
bottom and the worst was over.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, such predictions and recovery signs had all
proved to be false.
</P>
<P>
However, this time the grounds for a turnaround have been
consolidated by actions taken by western industrial nations and
the outcome of economic reforms in the region, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Outside the region, the United States and West European nations
are trying to help Asian countries to resolve the crisis by
lowering interest rates, re-scheduling or writing off debts, and
bailing out troubled banks.
</P>
<P>
Within the region, the five countries most affected by the
crisis -- South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and the
Philippines -- have undertaken economic reforms and restructuring
in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Unsound financial institutions were closed, merged or taken
over by the governments; short-term debts were negotiated into
long-term loans; imports were cut massively; and policies
favorable to agricultural development, foreign investment and
export were adopted.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the reforms is very encouraging: currencies of
Southeast Asian nations have rebounded by 10 percent to 50 percent
in the past three months; stocks are also rising; interest rates
are down.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the IMF forecast that the five most affected
Southeast Asian nations will between them have a current account
surplus of 57 billion U.S. dollars this year, compared with a
deficit of roughly same size in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The most recent reason for cheer is that the Japanese
government is more serious in dealing with the nation's sick
banking system and has adopted measures to stimulate the troubled
economy.
</P>
<P>
This would create an expanding market for Asian exporters and
allow Japanese banks to lend again to their Asian neighbors.

!-Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Based on these positive developments in the region, the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) estimated that the Asian crisis could hit
the bottom in the first half of 1999, and Asian economies will
recover slowly in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's prediction for Asia's economic prospects is almost
the same as that of the ADB.
</P>
<P>
While the IMF and ADB are very cautious in making predictions
this time, Southeast Asian countries seem very optimistic about
their economic future. South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines
have claimed that the economic crisis in their countries has
already reached the bottom and they could see modest economic
growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
But many economists said that although Asia's financial crisis
seems to be easing, much hard work lies ahead before the region's
economies fully recover.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the huge economic collapse in some Asian countries
this year will prevent them from pulling out of the crisis and
recovering easily.
</P>
<P>
During the first three quarters of this year, Asian countries,
especially those in Southeast Asia, experienced the worst period
of the crisis. While many Southeast Asian economies have fallen
into serious recessions, other economies in the region have slowed
down their growth pace.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest ADB outlook, Asia's developing economies
could only grow by 1.8 percent in 1998, and 3.5 percent in 1999,
compared to 6.1 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In Southeast Asia, the situation is even worse. The GDP (gross
domestic product) growth for the region will contract 6.9 percent
in 1998, and will continue to fall by 0.4 percent in 1999. The ADB
expects GDP to contract 16 percent in Indonesia, 7 percent in
Thailand, and 6 percent in Malaysia this year.
</P>
<P>
Another big obstacle to the region's economic recovery is the
lack of confidence by foreign investors. Since the crisis started
18 months ago, foreign investors' confidence in Asia have remained
weak, due to not only the economic crisis, but also political
instability in the region.
</P>
<P>
With the economic situation getting worse, Thailand, South
Korea, and Indonesia have changed guards. The political situation
has not improved in some countries suck as Indonesia, where riots
and protests have become the order of the day despite former
president Suharto's fall in May this year.
</P>
<P>
The unstable political situation has undermined investors'
confidence in the region. The five most troubled East Asian
nations have experienced an estimated net outflow of private
capital of 25 billion U.S. dollars this year, compared with a net
inflow of 94 billion dollars in 1996.

!-in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, economists said, the most urgent problem for
Asian countries is their mountain of bad loans. Economists said
that lower interest rates will do little to spur demand if banks
cannot lend because of huge non-performing loans.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank estimated that non-performing loans have amounted
to 35 percent or more of total bank lending in Indonesia,
Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
But the amount of bad loans are expected to increase further as
the governments could hardly repay their domestic and foreign
debts, which amount to 200 percent of GDP in these countries.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that economic recovery cannot get fully under way
before banks start lending again.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the growth of exports is unlikely to recover quickly
in the near future. Firstly, Asia, which relies so heavily on
electronics for exports, is paying a high price as demand cycles
in world trade or in regional imports will take time to turn up.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, 50 percent of Asia's trade is within the region, but
consumption demands are very weak in Asian countries now because
of the declines in living standards caused by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the problems within the region, Asia's recovery,
to some extent, would also depend on the development of the world
economy in the new year.
</P>
<P>
Slowdowns in the United States, Europe and Latin America are
likely, while Japan, Asia's biggest economy by far, is expected to
remain in recession in 1999. The dim prospects for the world
economy could easily affect Asia's recovery process.
</P>
<P>
As either external problems or internal obstacles could
determine the direction of the region's economy, people should not
be over-optimistic about the prospects of a big turnaround in
1999.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Separatist Party Wins Majority in Quebec Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Quebec's ruling Parti Quebecois
(PQ) has won enough seats to form a majority government in
Monday's general election in the French-speaking province of
Canada.
</P>
<P>
The separatist PQ, led by Lucien Bouchard, won 76 seats in
Quebec's 125-seat provincial legislature, according to the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).
</P>
<P>
PQ's main rival, the Liberal Party led by Jean Charest, won 47
seats, while the Action Democratique party secured one seat from
a total of 124 seats up for grabs, the CBC reported.
</P>
<P>
The 125th seat will be decided in a by-election in December
because of the recent death of a PQ candidate.
</P>
<P>
The current election mirrored the results of the 1994 election,
when the PQ won 77 seats, the Liberals 47 and Action Democratique
one seat.
</P>
<P>
The re-election of the PQ government is expected to have a
significant impact on the future of both Quebec and the country as
 a whole.
</P>
<P>
During the 33-day campaign, PQ leader Lucien Bouchard has
maintained that if re-elected, his government would seek another
referendum on Quebec's independence from Canada when "winning
conditions" exist.
</P>
<P>
Recent polls have indicated that more than 60 percent of voters
did not want to see another referendum in the near future.
</P>
<P>
In the two previous referendums, Quebecers voted to stay in
Canada instead of forming a new country of their own.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Let Currency Slip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian
government will devalue the country's currency to help economic
stability, Finance Minister Pedro Malan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Malan told a meeting of economic researchers that the
government of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso had decided to
slightly lower the exchange rate of the currency, the real.
</P>
<P>
Besides the measure, he said, the government will also lower
interest rates in the coming few months, so as to help curb
inflation, modernize the public sector and improve the basic
education system.
</P>
<P>
As these are the goals of President Cardoso in his second term
of office, an expanded Brazilian economy will benefit all Latin
America, giving it the role of China and Japan in Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Planning Minister Paulo Paiva said
the government will try to make Brazilian businesses competitive,
keep monetary policies stable and restructure the economy.

TEGUCIGALPA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Five generals and 13
colonels in the Honduran army are under investigation for illicit
enrichment, the country's top anti-corruption official said on
Monday.

The officers are suspected to have illegally accumulated wealth
in the 1980's and 1990's, according to Estrada.

BOGOTA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Five cars and a motorcycle were
burned Monday by the rebel Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces
(FARC) for breaking a curfew they imposed on night-time traffic.

Local police in Florencia said the rebels burned the vehicles
after reminding the owners that traffic was banned from 6 p.m. to

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, November 30 (Xinhua) -- More than 300 Chilean
sympathizers of General Augusto Pinochet are to fly to London to
support the former leader in his legal battle against extradition
to Spain, press reports said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Around 100 members of the Augusto Pinochet Foundation will fly
to London on Tuesday, while another 250 supporters will leave in
the next few days.
</P>
<P>
They said they want to be in London before December 11, the
deadline for British Home Secretary Jack Straw to decide whether
Pinochet is to face an extradition hearing.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was detained on October 16 while on a private visit to
London for back surgery.
</P>
<P>
British police acted on an international arrest warrant, filed
by Spain, for genocide, torture and terrorism during his 1973 to
1990 rule.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Britain's Law Lords ruled that Pinochet had no
immunity and could be tried for crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
As Pinochet's supporters prepared to fly to London, former army
officers and ex-government officials offered to testify
voluntarily in favor of him in court.
</P>
<P>
Chilean rightist leader and former interior minister Sergio
Onofre Jarpa said on TV that the supporters willing to appear as
witnesses were not trying to save "the chief" because "there is no
proof against General Pinochet".

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Sacramento Kings forward
Chris Webber, charged with marijuana possession and assaulting a
police officer, will be put into jail if his crimes are
convicted.
</P>
<P>
His fate will decided by a jury after a judge today denied a
motion to enforce a purported plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
Webber, who then played for the Washington Wizards, was
arrested in his sports utility vehicle after being stopped for
speeding while on the way to a practice on January 20.
</P>
<P>
Police say that Webber refused to get out of his car after
failing to show a license or registration. He resisted the
officer and was sprayed with pepper spray. The vehicle was
impounded and police say they found traces of marijuana inside.
</P>
<P>
Webber's attorney Steven Levy asked Judge Williams Missouri to
enforce a plea bargain that he said was offered by prosecutors
and would have dropped the most serious charges.
</P>
<P>
Prince George's County chief prosecutor Jack Johnson said that
offer never was made and the judge denied the motion.

ROME, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Italian soccer giant Inter Milan
have sacked head coach Giji Simoni, Italian news agency ANSA said

Inter was defeated by title contenders Lazio, Juventus and
Fiorentina in this season. At present, Simoni's side ranked
seventh on the standings with five wins, two draws and four
losses.
</P>

The result could not live up to the expectations of Inter's
officials and its crazy fans. Although Simoni coached Inter Milan
to a 3-1 victory over European Cup holders Real Madrid in the
Champions' League last Wednesday and a 2-1 Italian League win
against Salernitana on Sunday, the late wins could not save
Simoni's fate.
</P>

Just hours before he was sacked on Monday night, Simoni picked
up the "Golden Bench" award for being the best coach in Italy.

<HEADLINE> Telephone Consumers Increase dramatically in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- More telephones were provided
during the past four years than during the first 114 years of
telecommunications in Sri Lanka, said Mangala Samaraweera,
Minister of Posts, Telecommunications and Media, in a
telecommunication workshop Monday.
</P>
<P>
From the introduction of telephones into Sri Lanka in 1880 up
to the end of 1994 there had been only 180,724 telephones. But
from December 1994 to October 1998 there had been an addition of
259,515 telephones, said Samaraweera.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the cellular network in particular saw more
than a five fold increase, with 128,684 phones being connected in
addition the Internet and E-mail becoming very popular in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said, "While we strive to make telecommunications accessible
to everyone, we must think of the extraordinary benefits that even
the limited networks and facilities that we have at hand can yield
if applied properly to disaster management."
</P>
<P>
Samaraweera noted that a disaster team with proper equipment
could help people deal with natural disasters as well as man-made
destruction.
</P>
<P>
From the time a telegraph operator tapped out the distress
signal from the sinking Titanic, the world has been aware of the
great potential of telecommunications for preventing, mitigating
and managing disasters, he added.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Tries to Prevent HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is trying to prevent its
 young people from being infected by HIV/AIDS starting from the
school-going age by encouraging them to be abstinent from
premarital sex.
</P>
<P>
Strict measures have been enforced to prevent young girls being
lured with work in neighboring countries, which eventually result
in their being forced into sex trade, said Tuesday's The New Light
of Myanmar in an editorial marking the World AIDS Day 1998.
</P>
<P>
Virginity is still valued in Myanmar's society and sexual
promiscuity is not socially acceptable, warned the paper.
</P>
<P>
"By encouraging our young people to maintain our traditional
values and cultural norms and promoting the adoption of good
morals and character, we can support the young people to refrain
from high risk behaviors," the paper stated.
</P>
<P>
The paper urged young people to refrain from drinking alcohol
and dabbling with drug, pointing out that the practice of
needle-sharing among drug addicts has been one of the major modes
of transmission of HIV/AIDS among young drug addicts at the
beginning in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The paper also emphasized that widespread dissemination of
information and education material on HIV/AIDS to the young people
is essential so as to empower them with knowledge and skills to
prevent HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government, in collaboration with non-governmental
organizations, has introduced programs for protecting young people
especially girls against exploitation and violence.
</P>
<P>
It has obtained assistance and cooperation from four United
Nations agencies and 13 NGOs inside and outside the country for
the HIV/AIDS prevention activities.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar formed the National AIDS Committee in 1989.
</P>
<P>
According to available official data, there were 17,846 HIV
positives and 2,337 AIDS cases in Myanmar as of the end of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Governor Says Situation Delicate in Chiapas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The governor of Chiapas
said situation in the troubled southern Mexican state is delicate
due to four years of conflict with the Zapatista rebels.
</P>
<P>
Governor Roberto Alborres Guillen, a member of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, called on the Zapatista
army to reach a "constructive" peace accord with the government.
</P>
<P>
In his first annual address on the state of Chiapas, Alborres
charged that pro-government paramilitary groups had been guilty of
"homicide, attacks and lesions" against Zapatista supporters.
</P>
<P>
The top state official vowed to push a legislative bill through
the state congress next week and then submit it to the federal
congress for approval, so as to disarm the paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
Guillen was appointed as the governor after his successor
resigned in the wake of the December 22, 1997, massacre of 45
unarmed indigenous people, mostly women and children.
</P>
<P>
The National Statistics Institute said the indigenous
population in Chiapas has the lowest standards of living in
Mexico, and infant mortality there is the highest nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Poverty is often singled out as the main reason for the
existence of the Zapatist Army of National Liberation (ENZL).

commission to investigate Soeharto's alleged hidden wealth amassed
during his 32-year presidency.
</P>
<P>
Refusing to name possible members of the commission, the
minister said that those who have accepted outweigh those who have
refused.
</P>
<P>
No government official is permitted to become a member of the
independent team.
</P>
<P>
"I have already contacted half of the 30 while President
Habibie has personally asked one or two," Tandjung said, adding
that once answers to invitation to join the commission have been
received, a presidential decree could be issued on Tuesday or
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The independent commission has been given three months to
investigate the case and submit their findings to the president,
Tandjung said.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced to step down on May 21 amid the country's
worst political and economic crisis in decades. He is accused of
corruption and abuse of power during his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
Students and citizens in the country have held various
demonstrations, urging the government to bring Soeharto to court
on charges of corruption, collusion and nepotism.

<P>
CARTAGENA, Colombia, November 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen said Monday his country will back
Colombia's anti-drug fight and military modernization.
</P>
<P>
"We can help Colombia make its armed forces more efficient and
keep stability in the region," Cohen said after a meeting here
with Colombian President Andres Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has the capacity to help Colombia step up
its fight against drug trafficking," he said before a meeting of
defense chiefs from 33 countries of North and South America.
</P>
<P>
In meeting his host, Cohen said Washington was ready to help
Colombia fight armed rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Pastrana said the U.S. assistance is part of a
pact to be signed on Tuesday by Cohen and his Colombian
counterpart Rodrigo Lloreda.
</P>
<P>
The United States now spends up to 40 million U.S. dollars a
year on anti-drug efforts in Colombia and up to two million
dollars on training its military.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military has cleared two Colombian army brigades to
receive more U.S. funds this year, and cited abuses as a reason to
deny the eligibility of two other brigades.

<HEADLINE> NBA Owner Hopes Union to Change Negotiators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Isiah Thomas, who has been
both an NBA owner and union president, believes that the players
should find some new negotiators to replace Billy Hunter and
Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
"Billy Hunter has that option, and it may be an option that he
and Patrick decide they want to explore," Thomas said Monday as
the lockout finished its fifth month. "You're got to protect the
players, and you can't keep letting the players get hurt."
</P>
<P>
He expects the whole season will be canceled because of the
mistrust. Thomas said the players have three choices now.
</P>
<P>
"They is no knock on anyone, but the way I always ran the
union was if we brought in talent and that talent wasn't
performing, we had the opportunity to bring in someone else who
would perform."
</P>
<P>
Thomas was a player for the Detroit Pistons from 1981-94 and
was president of the union from 1990-94 before becoming vice
president and part-owner of the Toronto Raptors. He is an analyst
for NBC on its NBA telecasts.
</P>
<P>
He said both sides are not able to negotiate honestyly because
they don't trust each other anymore.
</P>
<P>
Monday, which was supposed to be the players' second payday,
also marked the 11th day since the last full negotiating session
was held. The sides refused to meet again for a resumption of
talks.
</P>
<P>
Thomas said:"The problem here is that both sides have come to
the table and thought the other was bluffing or posturing instead
of getting down to the nitty-gritty of a deal."
</P>
<P>
No players have called for Hunter and Ewing to step aside, but
Thomas said it is better for them to consider it.
</P>
<P>
"That's an option the union has and should always have. It's
OK to be unified, but I prefer to have unity with money. You've
got to rebuild some trust between the sides," Thomas added.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A responsibility system, where
local government officials have to contact at least one
impoverished family and help it find a way to get out of poverty,
has become popular in China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi is one of China's poorest regions, because of years of
wars in the past, its mountainous area and lack of investment.
Local government officials are now busy with road building and
mining as well while some have gone to neighboring Guangdong
Province to try to attract investment for this.
</P>
<P>
Yin Jianxi, a 68-year-old member of the Gelao minority group
there, didn't believe it when he heard that higher-ranking
officials would come to help him when he heard the news. But, now
Yin says, "The Communist Party means what it says," and that the
official who helped his family was "kind and soft-spoken".
</P>
<P>
The official Yin is referring to is Zhao Shaoyao, director of
the Working Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
Committee of Hechi Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Another official, Mo Hanming, the deputy head of the Publicity
Department of the CPC Committee of the Du'an Yao Autonomous
County, has contacted three families and helped them get loans and
has taught them how to raise sheep. With Mo's help, these families
have seen their income grow by 400 yuan annually.
</P>
<P>
Tan Sanchuan, the secretary of the Huanjiang County CPC
Committee, said that his children often complain that they only
see their father on TV.
</P>
<P>
Recently, ethnic minority villages in the region began electing
village officials through a democratic election process and began
handling village affairs in a more open way.
</P>
<P>
Tan Ke'er, a member of the Maonan ethnic group in the village
of Pochuan, goes to every village head and township head election
and says that he wants to elect officials who are just and can
help villagers make more money.

<HEADLINE> Chronic Knee Injury Plagues Ronaldo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Inter Milan's Brazilian striker
Ronaldo Sunday said he might choose some important matches to
play because tendon injuries in both knees were torturing him,
according to reports from Milan.
</P>
<P>
The chronic knee injury has forced Ronaldo to miss 13 of
Inter's 22 games so far the season.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Ronaldo came back into the side and helped it
snatch a 3-1 Champions' league win against Real Madrid. However,
his knee problemes were aggravated in the wake of the intense
match.
</P>
<P>
He had to stay on the bench to watch his teammates' 2-1 home
win against Salernitana in a Sunday's Italian Division First
League fixture.
</P>
<P>
With Thursday's Italian Cup quarter-final tie away to Lazio
approaching, Ronald said he didn't know whether he could recover
at the time.
</P>
<P>
But Inter's head coach Giji Simoni still remained optimistic
and hoped to field Ronald to play for the Lazio game.
</P>
<P>
Inter's director Piero Volpi said people should not exaggerate
the star's injury and Ronald's pain would disappear in the near
future.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Inflation Rate Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bureau of
Statistics of Indonesia announced that annual rate of inflation
slowed to 78.15 percent in November from 79.14 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
"During November, inflation stood at 0.08 percent, lower than
that recorded in 1997 (1.65 percent) due to a drastic fall in the
prices of some basic needs," Kusmadi Saleh of the Bureau's
Distribution and National Balance Statistics said.
</P>
<P>
From January to November 1998, inflation stood at 75.14 percent
while from April to November 1998 it reached 37.78 percent, Saleh
was quoted by national newspapers Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) have set a 1998 inflation rate target of 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Contributing to the November inflation were processed food,
beverages, cigarettes and tobacco (0.14 percent), and housing
(0.12 percent).
</P>
<P>
Contributing to monthly deflation were food (0.03 percent),
clothing (0.19 percent) and transportation and communication (0.01
percent).
</P>
<P>
Saleh said prices fell 0.23 percent in November, with cooking
oil declining 0.12 percent and chicken 0.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Although inflation slowed in November, we are worried that
next month's rate will be high as this year's Christmas, New Year,
Ramadan (Muslim fasting month) and Lebaran (day of celebration at
the end of fasting month) festivities fall within a few weeks of
each other," Saleh.
</P>
<P>
He added that December inflation is usually higher than
November's.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesia booked a trade surplus of 1.77 billion
U.S. dollars in September, down from August's 1.85 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Saleh told reporters total exports in September were down to
3.99 billion U.S. dollars from 4.03 billion U.S. dollars in
August.
</P>
<P>
Imports in September rose slightly to 2.22 billion U.S. dollars
from 2.18 billion U.S. dollars in the previous month, Saleh added.

JAKARTA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Two dormant volcanoes in
Minahasa district in Indonesia's North Sulawesi province may erupt
any time now, Antara News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mount Lokon (1,689 meters) and Mount Mahawu (1,333 meters),
located in the subdistrict of Tomohon, are separated from each
other by a valley.
</P>
<P>
The report said both volcanoes were showing a low level of
activity but could erupt any time, emitting thin white smoke from
their craters in the morning and sulphur at night.
</P>
<P>
The Volcanological Observation Station in the village of
Kakaskasen, Tomohon, confirmed the condition of the two volcanoes,
which lie 25 kilometers south of Manado, North Sulawesi's
provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the Lokon erupted killing one tourist from Switzerland
and inflicting losses totaling hundreds of million of rupiah on
families living in the villages of Kakaskasen, Tinoor and Kinilow.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, 35 years ago the Mahawu erupted damaging
agricultural land and a number of residential houses.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Reportedly Expanding Inquiry to Fund-Raising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Republican-led
Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives is
expanding its impeachment investigation of President Bill Clinton
to fund-raising allegations, committee sources said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The panel, controlled by Republicans 21-16, will seek subpoenas
for internal Justice Department memos debating whether an
independent counsel should have been named in the fund-raising
inquiry, the Associated Press quoted anonymous sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Republicans also will seek testimony this week from FBI
Director Louis Freeh and Justice Department prosecutor Charles
LaBella, both of whom advocated an independent counsel be named to
investigate Clinton's 1996 fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans will vote behind closed doors Tuesday also on
sending document subpoenas to Attorney General Janet Reno and
Clinton demanding that the secret memos Freeh and LaBella wrote
advocating their positions be turned over to the committee, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Democrats described the move as proof of Republican desperation.
</P>
<P>
"We are just left shaking our heads at the weirdness of it
all. We've said before, and this is confirmation, that this is an
impeachment in search of a crime," Democratic committee spokesman
Jim Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
"This says quite a bit, I suspect, about the confidence
Republicans have in the strength of the case they've assembled at
this point," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the panel's chairman, Representative Henry Hyde, a
Republican, attacked Clinton's answers to 81 questions posed by
impeachment investigators. Hyde said the president "chose to
evade" questions in a manner that could force the panel to accept
allegations against Clinton as fact.
</P>
<P>
The White House dismissed Hyde's criticism. "The president
made a good faith effort to respond to politically motivated
questions. The chairman should recognize that the country's
interests in a fair and constitutional process comes ahead of
partisan games like this," spokesman James Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
The White House brushed off an invitation to have Clinton
testify in the panel's impeachment inquiry. "I don't think it's
very likely you'll see the president appear before that
committee," spokesman Joe Lockhart said Monday.

<HEADLINE> Everton Chairman Johnson Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Peter Johnson has resigned as
Everton chairman following a series of controversies culminating
in the row over the sale of Duncan Ferguson to Newcastle, the
English Premier League club announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The news came soon after the club admitted that Johnson had
not told manager Walter Smith about the sale until negotiations
were complete.
</P>
<P>
In a statement the Goodison Park club said: "After 11 years as
chairman of a football club, four years with Everton and seven
years with (first division) Tranmere Rovers, Peter Johnson has
decided to step down as chairman of Everton Football Club.
</P>
<P>
"The role has been particularly difficult to carry out since
he moved to Jersey earlier this year and the increased pressure
has led to health concerns.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Johnson is delighted that Sir Philip Carter and Bill
Kenwright have agreed to take on the roles of chairman and deputy
chairman respectively.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Johnson is to remain on the board as a non-executive
director and over the coming months he will be considering
options for his 68% beneficial interest. The decision to step
down will not affect the sale of his interest in Tranmere which
is currently underway."
</P>
<P>
Johnson bought his controlling interest in Everton for 10
million pounds (16.51 million U.S. dollars). It is now estimated
to be worth around 60 million (99.04 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
During his period in charge Everton have enjoyed little
success on the pitch. The one high spot came in 1995 when they
won the F.A. Cup for the fifth time.
</P>
<P>
After the final game of last season, when the club escaped
relegation only on goal difference, Johnson was given a police
escort from the ground and was subjected to chants of "Johnson
out" by the Goodison Park crowd.

<HEADLINE> Former English Manager Venables Cleared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Terry Venables is in the clear
over the signing of three Australians at Portsmouth.
</P>
<P>
Detectives investigating the transfer of players while the
south coast club was under the control of Venables confirmed
Monday they found no evidence against the former England coach.
</P>
<P>
It was disclosed earlier this month that an inquiry had been
launched into the transfer of three Australian players to the
club last season.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Hampshire Police said: "Hampshire Constabul
ary's fraud squad has completed its evaluation of paperwork and
information concerning the transfer of three Australian players
to Portsmouth Football Club last season.
</P>
<P>
"We have found no evidence of dishonest or corrupt practice of
any person involved in those transfers and that investigation is
now closed."
</P>
<P>
Detectives, however, are continuing to investigate allegations
of "bad business practice" made by the new board of directors at
the club under the chairmanship of Martin Gregory.
</P>
<P>
The exact nature of the allegations is unclear, but they are
not understood to involve the transfer of players.
</P>
<P>
The police spokesman added: "We are continuing our assessment
of the original complaint made by the directors of Portsmouth
Football Club which alleged instances of bad business practice at
the club."
</P>
<P>
News of the investigation came just days after Crystal Palace,
where Venables is now manager, called in the FA to examine the
transfers of several players this season.
</P>
<P>
Portsmouth FC declined to comment on the inquiry, and a
spokeswoman for Crystal Palace said: "I don't think Mr. Venables
would have any comment to make at this stage."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Paolo Di Canio promised
Sheffield Wednesday's fans Monday that he wanted to make up for
his push on referee Paul Alcock.
</P>
<P>
The Italian, now back in training in Yorkshire, has promised
to make himself strong enough for the second half of the season
after missing most of the first.
</P>
<P>
His 11 match suspension for pushing Alcock to the ground ends
in time for a festive return against Leicester at Hillsborough on
Boxing Day.
</P>
<P>
He is still the club's leading scorer with three goals this
season, and despite some encouraging recent results they are
still missing his inspirational qualities.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old has spent the last seven weeks back home in
Italy and is now counting down the days to his return.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Monday after his return to the club, he said: "I
have been training hard with my personal fitness instructor
Michele Palmiere but I just want to play football now.
</P>
<P>
"I desperately need a game. Over the next 25 days I will
train as hard as possible, while playing some matches with my
team-mates.
</P>
<P>
"I am feeling a bit tired because I have had a heavy schedule.
I've been training every day, doing a double session.
</P>
<P>
"I have an appointment with the fans on Boxing Day. I am
conditioning myself to return to the side for the game with
Leicester.
</P>
<P>
"I want to be very strong for Boxing Day and especially for
the rest of the season because I have missed a lot of matches, "
he added.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday manager Danny Wilson is eager for the striker to
return to the first team.
</P>
<P>
"You always miss a player of his creative ability," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the last couple of games we've looked a bit more fluid,
but prior to that we have certainly missed Paolo's talent.
</P>
<P>
"Any manager at any football club would always miss someone
with Paolo's special talent.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously it's been a frustrating time for him because he
wants to be involved. All we can now do is look forward.
</P>
<P>
"He has said he is working very, very hard to get himself
ready for the Boxing Day fixture against Leicester, and it will
be a massive boost to everybody when he is playing again, " the
manager said.

<HEADLINE> Aziz Refutes CNN Report on Iraq's Secret Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz Monday refuted a report of the American Cable News
Network (CNN) on Iraq's secret Missile program.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Aziz said he followed
Monday's CNN program which said Iraq tried to buy "highly
sophisticated missile technology" from Romania and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the CNN report involved two events which took place
in 1995, adding that one event was concerned with an individual's
conduct, in which the Iraqi government was not involved and the
other was a sheer lie.
</P>
<P>
"They are speaking about it as if it is a current issue. This
was an event that took place in 1995," said Aziz, adding that "a
joint investigation conducted by the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) and Iraq shows that Iraqi government is not involved."
</P>
<P>
The deputy premier said that "all Iraq's facilities that work
in the missile area are under daily surveillance. Everyday, they
(U.N. arms inspectors) go and check them. So no proscribed
activities could be conducted without the acknowledge by UNSCOM."
</P>
<P>
Aziz said UNSCOM had never reported to the U.N. Security
Council on any event that showed Iraq did not comply with strict
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"CNN is an American television. They go to that television and
make an allegation. These allegations are not put on the table of
the Security Council so that we could present our case," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is American propaganda against Iraq," Aziz said,
arguing that "if there is such a case as they alleged, why did
not they bring it to the table of the Security Council as a
violation by Iraq for the Council to consider."
</P>
<P>
In the same CNN report, UNSCOM Deputy Chairman Charles Duelfer
alleged that "Iraq was successfully deceiving UNSCOM."
</P>
<P>
In response, Aziz said that "you can expect from American
deputy chief of UNSCOM to speak against Iraq, that is his job. He
was appointed by the American government in this job, as deputy
chairman of UNSCOM, to keep the sanctions on Iraq and to distort
the image of Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"So I am not surprised to hear that from Duelfer," Aziz
added.

For instance, it would use the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM)

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on Wall Street
dipped Monday, seeing the first tri-digit decline in two months in
the blue chip indicator.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed 216.53 lower to
9,116.55 due to profit-taking from a steady 173 gain in the
previous week and renewed fears about the impact of the Asian
financial crisis on the world economy.
</P>
<P>
The Dow rose 214 points a week ago, climbing to its peak of
9,374.27, and both technology-laced Nasdaq composite index and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 created new highs of 2,016.44 and 1,192.33
respectively Friday amid news of big-name mergers.
</P>
<P>
According to the Wall Street Journal research, some aspects of
the world economy still remain uncertain. U.S. growth forecast for
1999 has slowed from 2.3 percent in July to 2.1 percent lately and
estimated 1999 Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 earnings have fallen 7
percent since July.
</P>
<P>
Broader market indicators also posted big losses, with the
Nasdaq losing 66.90 to 1,949.54 due to selling of the Internet and
big technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
On the New York Stock Exchange, decliners led advancers 2-1
with trading volume up to 685 million shares from a light trading
Friday, a shortened post-Thanksgiving session.

<HEADLINE> More Aid Pledged to Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 2 billion U.S.
dollars had been pledged to the Palestinians at an ongoing
conference to support the Middle East peace and development, which
opened here earlier Monday.
</P>
<P>
The pledges include 480 million U.S. dollars by the European
Union, 200 million U.S. dollars by Japan, 100 million U.S. dollars
by Saudi Arabia, 80 million U.S. dollars by Kuwait, 50 million
U.S. dollars by the United Arab Emirates and 30 million U.S.
dollars by Canada.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who is traveling to Gaza in less than two weeks,
opened the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States would extend its program of 100
million U.S. dollars a year to assist Palestinian development and
add another 400 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was among the delegates from
44 countries and six international organizations, including the
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the United
Nations, attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I promised the continuing support of the United States as we
move ahead in the next phase of the peace process. That phase
begins today with this conference," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"Today our purpose is to send a clear signal that this peace is
more than a piece of paper, that the promise imagined at Oslo can
become a concrete reality; a true peace, a growing peace, good for
Palestinians, good for Israelis, good for the region and the
world," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton appealed for generous contribution. "There has been too
little tangible improvement in the life of the Palestinian
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lasting peace has little chance of taking hold "if it does not
deliver results for ordinary people," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was staging the conference "to send a clear signal
that this peace is more than a piece of paper," Clinton added. "We
must convince those who have invested so much in this process that
it was a sound investment."
</P>
<P>
The increase in U.S. aid, which is subject to congressional
approval, was announced after Clinton met with Arafat at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Arafat had reaffirmed his pledge to uphold his
side of agreements with Israel and to work with Israel to ensure
security.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, 2.3 billion U.S. dollars was pledged, "and I
would expect we will do that again," White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said in telling reporters about the boost before Clinton
spoke.

<HEADLINE> Bold Agricultural Policy Reform Needed: EU Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's reform
proposals would need to be implemented boldly and swiftly if the
European model of agriculture is to be revitalized, European
Commissioner Franz Fischler said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to mark the 40th anniversary of the Union's
Committee of Agricultural Organizations, Fischler said the
overriding challenge for EU's common agricultural policy (CAP) is
to give EU farmers renewed self-confidence by offering clear
prospects for the future.
</P>
<P>
However, the beneficial impact of debating the future of the
CAP in recent months, he said, might well vanish into thin air
unless the member states follow up their as yet hazy idea of a
European model with concrete action. "What we need now is a bold
reform of the current market organizations and a decisive step
towards a coordinated policy for rural areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Without reform, the EU can expect serious market imbalances in
the medium term. Restricting agricultural policy to the single
market as suggested by some farming representatives is by no means
a solution, either in market-management terms or for the
agricultural budget, and "We would soon find ourselves at an
impasse" when the next EU enlargement takes place in the future,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the CAP reform is a must for the Union, Fischler said
that if "doing nothing" is the worst option, then "not doing
enough" is surely the next-worst.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that a "mini-reform" cannot give European
farmers new self-confidence.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Fall to New 12-Year Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- World oil markets broke records
again Monday as benchmark Brent marked historic lows in London and
light crude in New York touched levels not seen for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
In London, Brent crashed to 10.08 dollars a barrel at one
stage, the lowest price ever recorded on the International
Petroleum Exchange, before a mild bounce brought Brent back from
the brink to close 66 cents down at 10.48 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Adjusted for inflation, prices are now at 25-year lows.
</P>
<P>
New York selling, which had triggered the precipitous fall in
London, took the front month contract under 11 dollars. Mild short
covering there too scooped the contract back from calamity to
11.23 dollars a barrel -- but still over 60 cents lower on the
day.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the price slump in New York was largely in
reaction to OPEC's (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries)
failure to take any price-supportive measures in Vienna last week,
according to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
The slide on futures also took dated Brent's "physical" value
below 10 dollars a barrel for the first time in 12 years. Dated
Brent prices are looming ever closer to the July 1986 all-time low
of 8.75 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bulging oil inventories, a mild winter and a divided OPEC could
push prices even lower with no immediate reversal in the price
slump in sight, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, OPEC ministers met but shied away from taking any
action to rescue prices. Bitter rivalries between members -- most
notably Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iran -- have divided the once
powerful cartel, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's 11 members meet again in March to consider options that
may include increasing production cuts, which now stand at 2.6
million bpd.
</P>
<P>
Further weighing on the market is the fact that Iraqi exports
are likely to resume shortly as oil traders have started to fix
vessels to load crude after Baghdad agreed to a fifth round of the
"oil-for-food" deal.

<HEADLINE> More than $3 Billion Pledged to Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- More than three billion
U.S. dollars had been pledged to the Palestinians during a
conference to support the Middle East peace and development, said
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Our pledges today are evidence of the international
community's firm commitment to help the Palestinian people build
lives that are better, freer and safer, and to do our part in
laying the foundations for a secure and prosperous Middle East,"
Albright told a press conference following the one-day conference.
</P>
<P>
"There's a great deal of work, hard work ahead on both the
political and economic fronts, but the international community
stands united today in sending Palestinians and all the people of
the region a message of hope and concrete support," she told

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Emergency Assistance for Haiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Monday approved Haiti's request for emergency financial
assistance equivalent to about 21 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This assistance will support the government's economic recovery
program and associated relief and rehabilitation efforts in the
aftermath of Hurricane Georges.
</P>
<P>
The hurricane struck the Haiti in late September, causing
extensive damage to the country. An estimated 240 people died and
tens of thousands were left homeless. The main destruction
occurred in rural areas, as heavy flooding and high winds caused
serious damage to crops and livestock, as well as economic and
social infrastructure. The World Bank estimates put the total
direct economic losses at about 80 million, or 1.9 percent of GDP.

Haiti joined the IMF in September, 1953. Its quota is about 84
million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF financing currently

<HEADLINE> Ambassador: China Continues Supporting Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The world community has the
obligation to help the Palestinian self-rule area in its economic
development and China will continue to provide assistance to the
Palestinian people, said Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that just as it is the responsibility of the
international community to restore the legitimate national rights
of the Palestinian people, it is the unshirkable obligation of the
world to help the self-rule area develop its economy and improve
its people's livelihood," said Li in his remarks at the one-day
Conference to Support Middle East Peace and Development being held
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Li, who was attending the conference on behalf of China's
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, said the Middle East question has
lasted for half a century and both the Palestinians and the
Israelis have suffered heavy tolls. The Palestinian people, in
particular, has had more than enough of their miseries and traumas
brought about in the war.
</P>
<P>
"With the end of the Cold War, the world has entered a new
period of peace and development, which has presented unparalleled
historic opportunities for the peaceful settlement of the Middle
East question," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Major progress has been achieved in the peace talks thanks to
vigorous promotion by the international community and joint
efforts by various parties concerned, he noted. "This is a
blessing for the people of all the countries in the Middle East, a
region torn by protracted turmoil and frequent wars. It is also
the inevitable result of the development of the times."
</P>
<P>
Li said that the interim peace accord reached between Palestine
and Israel last month on the second phase Israeli troop withdrawal
from the West Bank and other issues was the result of the
concerted efforts of the various parties and has been well
received by the international community.
</P>
<P>
"China welcomes and appreciates this development and sincerely
hopes that the accord will be earnestly honored and implemented so
that the Middle East peace process can move forward steadily,"
said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
He said, throughout determined and unremitting efforts, the
Palestinian people have finally realized self-rule on their own
territory. But much needs to be done in the area given its weak
infrastructure, low living standards of the people and
difficulties in economic development.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that to ensure full enjoyment of the Palestinian
people of the tranquillity and prosperity that come with peace is
the best way to strengthen their belief in peace and will serve to
promote the smooth implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli
accord and be conducive to the stability of the whole region.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East issue, Li said, China always upheld justice
without seeking any selfish gains. "The Chinese people deeply
sympathize with the Palestinian people in their sufferings and
support them in their just cause of restoring their legitimate
national rights."
</P>
<P>
He said, "For a long time, we have given selfless political and
moral support to the Palestinian people and provided them with
economic assistance to the best of our ability."
</P>
<P>
Since 1965, according to Li, China has provided a good deal of
humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people. After the
establishment of the Palestinian National Authority, it did a lot
of more work for the infrastructural construction in the self-rule
area. During Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's visit to China
last July, China once again offered new assistance and undertook
to help build some projects.
</P>
<P>
As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,
Li said, China will, as always, work to promote the peace process
together with the rest of the international community and render
active support to programs of assistance to Palestine.

<HEADLINE> Aziz Accuses U.S. of Undermining Comprehensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz Monday accused the United States of deliberately
undermining the United Nations comprehensive review of Iraq's
compliance with relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Aziz said the U.S.,
whose goal was to prolong the sanctions and topple the Iraqi
leadership, would use every means to undermine the review process.
</P>
<P>
For instance, it would use the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) for disarming Iraq as its tool or resort to its veto power
in the Security Council, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. Security Council resolutions, the sanctions,
imposed on Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, cannot be
lifted until U.N. arms inspectors certifies that Iraq has
eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq suspended its cooperation with UNSCOM on October 31 in
protest to the Security Council's failure to take into
consideration the lifting of the crippling sanctions.
</P>
<P>
It agreed to unconditionally resume full cooperation on
November 14, narrowly averting a U.S. military attack.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has reiterated its readiness to conduct a
comprehensive review once Iraq resumes cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors and proves it is prepared to fulfill all its obligations.
</P>
<P>
"We were promised by him (U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan)
and the Security Council that after the resumption of the full
cooperation with UNSCOM, the comprehensive review will be
conducted in a very short time," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
"But 16 days have passed, (chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard) Butler didn't even mention the starting date although he
has said he would deal with it. Until now, we don't know when it
will start," he complained.
</P>
<P>
If the comprehensive review is conducted on the basis of
objective and scientific analysis of the overall situation, it
would undoubtedly find out that Iraq has complied with "all, all"
the obligations under relevant U.N. resolutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official also complained that Prakash Shah, the
U.N. chief's envoy to Iraq, did not bring any new plan when he
returned to Baghdad last week.
</P>
<P>
"I had asked him to convey this message to Annan, but I have
not received any message from the U.N. chief so far," he said.

<HEADLINE> British Scientist Discovers New Way of Screening Embryos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- A British scientist has found a
new way which could identify abnormal embryos before they are used
in infertility treatment, the BBC reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new technique, developed by Dr Ian Findlay, a molecular
biologist at Leeds University, England, is 1,000 times more
sensitive than normal DNA tests.
</P>
<P>
It will allow scientists to screen for up to 10 chromosomes
instead of the two they can test for now. The test involves
studying the DNA of a single cell up to six times, while current
tests only allow a cell to be studied once.
</P>
<P>
Dr Findlay said it may be possible to apply the new DNA test to
pregnant women in the future and allow them to be able to check
for abnormalities at a much earlier stage.
</P>
<P>
The test could also overcome the current low success rate of
IVF treatment and help infertile couples have more chance of
conceiving.
</P>
<P>
Only one in four IVF embryos now leads to pregnancy, which
experts say is because up to 50 percent have chromosomal
abormalities.
</P>
<P>
However, the new technique has caused a storm of protest from
pro-life groups in the UK, which condemned the DNA test as an
example of eugenics in action, the BBC said.

"We have to try to find a just and proper way to resolve these
issues and restore justice to the wrongs that have been done in
the last 50 years," said Lerman.

Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish
Conference, said it's not enough for governments, museums and
other institutions to acknowledge they have custody of Nazi loot,
including much that's difficult to trace to Holocaust victims and
their families.
</P>
<P>
There must be real restitution, whether to individuals or to
Jewish and humanitarian groups that help the survivor community,
he said.

"We are going to ask that the last prisoners of war be released
to the rightful claimants or heirs," Steinberg said, adding that
untraceable art and property should be auctioned to help
survivors.

U.S. Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, the conference's
organizer, cited the case of two Egon Schiele paintings as
examples of the legal confusion caused by an artwork's disputed
history.

<P>
Eizenstat said he hoped the conference would agree on standards
for proving ownership and guidelines for restitution.

The Nazis looted an estimated 9 billion U.S. dollars to 14
billion U.S. dollars in art and other assets. The current value of
that is about 90 billion to 140 billion U.S. dollars.
