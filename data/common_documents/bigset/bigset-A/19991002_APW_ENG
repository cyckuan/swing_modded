<HEADLINE> Driver Calls King Crash Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGOR, Maine (AP) -- The driver who hit horror writer Stephen  
King as he walked near his home says the only reason he was 
indicted on aggravated assault charges was because King is a 
celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why can't they accept that it was an accident?'' Bryan E.  
Smith, 42, said Friday, one day after the criminal indictment was 
issued. ``Just because it's Stephen King ... It's just like O.J. 
Simpson. If you have money, you can make up your own laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King was thrown 14 feet and suffered multiple broken bones and a  
collapsed lung when Smith's minivan hit him June 19. Smith said he 
had been distracted by his dog. If convicted, he could face up to 
10 1/2 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	King, still recovering at his Bangor home, praised the grand  
jury's action and said in a statement: ``These indictments send a 
powerful message: When we slide behind the wheel of our vehicles, 
we are responsible for the lives of others and must be held 
accountable when we fail in that responsibility.''

<HEADLINE> Milan Fashions Elegant, Colorful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- The Versace collection that closed the  
``moda Milanese'' previews summed up the mood for the first summer 
of the new millennium -- ladylike, colorful and free. 
</P>
<P>
	Departing from the label's fame as a sex tank, Donatella Versace  
on Friday showed pretty, printed silk gowns with long sleeves and a 
discreet decollete, spiffy pantsuits with only moderately tight 
trousers and cropped jackets, and evening gowns in embroidered 
chiffon that showed more fabric than flesh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basta (enough) with body baring,'' the designer said after the  
show, held in a former General Electric factory on Milan's 
outskirts. 
</P>
<P>
	To emphasize her new covered look, Donatella wrapped the body in  
scarves from the neck to the buttocks. The theme was especially 
evident in the evening wear, where gowns were little more than 
scarves creatively tied together. 
</P>
<P>
	Bright shades, from leaf-green to orange-red, highlighted the  
show -- confirming this season's trend of abandoning black and 
rediscovering color. 
</P>
<P>
	There also was the sense of freedom of choice, which has marked  
this round of preview showings, in the Versace collection, from the 
ladylike dresses to the sequined hot pants. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the week designers have mixed, matched and separated.  
</P>
<P>
	Unlikely combinations include a man-tailored shirt worn with a  
glitzy sequined skirt (Dolce &AMP; Gabbana), a skirt in rainbow pastels 
matched with a colorful geometric print top (Armani) and a tiny 
jacket over extra-wide pants (Gucci). 
</P>
<P>
	``Fashion should be pick and chose,'' said Stefano Gabbana, who  
with his partner, Domenico Dolce, staged their show in the setting 
of an outdoor market. 
</P>
<P>
	Choices came in shapes too. Trousers went from extra-tight to  
comfortably loose, with the favorite style cropped anywhere between 
ankle and knee. Skirt hemlines played mainly around the knee, but 
others crept up the thigh, culminating in Dolce &AMP; Gabbana's 
six-inch strip. 
</P>
<P>
	Tank tops beat a summer retreat, replaced by bare-backed apron  
tops in anything from traditional silk to high-tech plasticized 
fabrics. But T-shirts, blouses, bra tops and closely fitted 
sweaters are also fine. 
</P>
<P>
	In a dubious season switch, stockings, absent from the winter  
runway, make a summer comeback in fishnet, leopard print or bright 
pink. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the mixed fashion bag, folklore themes abound. Indian,  
peasant, punk and beachcomber all live happily together on the 
runway, united by the strand after strand of beading. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a good season for the silk manufacturers, with designers  
favoring silk jersey, silk prints and chiffon, along with heavy 
doses of gilded and silver silk fabric. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoes are mainly high-heeled, either pumps, slingbacks or  
one-strap sandals. The latest news in the footwear department is 
the suspended heel built on a metal brace introduced by Karl 
Lagerfeld for Fendi. 
</P>
<P>
	Makeup tends toward a natural look, as do hairstyles that are  
either long and loose or demurely pinned up. Tom Ford for Gucci 
created a new style intended to be neo-punk, which actually 
resembles an old scarecrow. 
</P>
<P>
	After a few seasons of quiet shows, there was a big comeback of  
celebrity fashion-watchers on the front rows, with rock stars 
scoring the most points. 
</P>
<P>
	The British group All Saints showed up at Versace, Whitney  
Houston was at Dolce &AMP; Gabbana with husband Bobby Brown, and teen 
heartthrob Ricky Martin flew in from Los Angeles for Armani. 
</P>
<P>
	Off the runway, the big talk was about buying and selling -- not  
only clothes, but companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The hottest item at present is Fendi, whose one-of-a-kind  
``baguette'' bag has become one of the most sought-after 
accessories. The company owned by the five Fendi sisters, with Karl 
Lagerfeld as their designer, is also famous for its extravagant 
furs. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Prada with the French conglomerate LVMH and Gucci have set  
their eyes on Fendi, which would reportedly cost over $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters have yet to agree on whether to sell, or to whom.  
</P>
<P>
	Also up for grabs is the Church and Co., the elite British shoe  
manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Prada, which last month bought upscale Jil Sander, the  
German company known for its exquisitely tailored minimalist style, 
and shoemaker Diego della Valle are eyeing Church. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fashion is a business and it's always on the move,'' said  
Beppe Modenese, honorary president of Italy's fashion chamber and 
the man credited with putting the ``moda Milanese'' on the 
international fashion map.

<HEADLINE> Woman Pays High Price for Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The prize was a split-level ranch house  
overlooking a small lake. The price was a $50 raffle ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	Or so Christine Curl thought.  
</P>
<P>
	Curl won the $240,000 home in the Milwaukee suburb of Oak Creek  
in a raffle held for the St. Ann Center for Intergenerational Care, 
an adult day care program. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the $240,000 prize put Curl into an unfamiliar  
category. Curl, who has worked for 23 years at a post office, was 
suddenly part of the nation's wealthy elite, in the view of the 
Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The wealth meant she had to pay 39.6 percent of her earnings in  
federal income taxes. Combined with state and property taxes, she 
wound up paying $108,000 for her prize. 
</P>
<P>
	The same week she won the house she put it up for sale and  
accepted a couple's offer of $220,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The house has still given Curl and her family some money. Cash  
from the house sale will go toward her daughter's wedding this 
weekend. And she still has enough money for a sizable down payment 
somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the tax hassles, Curl wouldn't mind another free  
house. St. Ann is holding another house raffle Oct. 9, for a 
four-bedroom colonial. This time, she plans to buy three tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know,'' she said. ``My chances are pretty good.''

<HEADLINE> Reds' Cameron Injured, Leaves Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Cincinnati Reds center fielder Mike Cameron  
left Saturday's game against the Milwaukee Brewers in the fourth 
inning with a strained left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameron was playing center field when he fell to the grass for  
no apparent reason shortly after Milwaukee's Mark Loretta flied out 
to right. 
</P>
<P>
	He had difficulty standing up and had to be helped from the  
field by teammates and trainers. The Brewers led Cincinnati 7-4 at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameron, who was 1-for-2 with an RBI single in the game, was  
replaced by Michael Tucker. Cameron, the Reds' leadoff hitter, is 
batting .256 with 21 homers and 66 RBIs.

<HEADLINE>  Myanmar Embassy Hostages Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thailand engineered a peaceful end  
Saturday to the armed takeover of the Myanmar Embassy by five 
pro-democracy activists, flying the rebels by helicopter to the 
Thai-Myanmar border, where they were allowed to go free. 
</P>
<P>
	After holing up in the embassy for 26 hours, the raiders  
released all 38 hostages, Thai Interior Minister Sanan 
Kachornprasart said at a news conference. Another 51 Myanmar 
citizens -- mostly family of diplomatic personnel -- who had hidden 
inside the walled embassy compound were also allowed to walk out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't consider them to be terrorists,'' said Sanan, who was  
one of the government's negotiators with the rebels. ``They are 
student activists struggling for democracy. We have done what we 
have promised them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calling themselves the Vigorous Burmese Student Warriors, the  
hostage-takers had demanded the release of all political prisoners 
in Myanmar, a meaningful dialogue between pro-democracy leader Aung 
San Suu Kyi and the military government, and the convening of an 
elected parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Democracy activists say the rebels' takeover of the embassy  
sprang from deep frustration that their cause is receiving neither 
international attention nor making headway in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissident groups called the incident a ``wake up call'' and  
warned of more violence ahead if the government of Myanmar doesn't 
change its harsh, autocratic rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past 11 years the democracy movement has consistently  
stood for a non-violent solution, but this hasn't really delivered 
significant progress,'' said activist Debbie Stothard of the 
Alternative ASEAN Network on Burma. 
</P>
<P>
	``The students appear to have acted out of outrage at the  
regime's increasing repression and frustration with the failure of 
the international community to respond to the plight of Burma's 
people,'' the Washington-based Free Burma Coalition said of the 
take-over in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Once among the country's best and brightest, thdissidents live  
in malaria-ridden jungle camps and are sometimes attacked by 
Myanmar troops. While dissidents continue to predict victory over 
the military, there are few signs the generals who have ruled 
Myanmar for the past 37 years are loosening their grip on power. 
</P>
<P>
	The exact whereabouts of the five student militants were  
unclear, but the leader of a border-based Myanmar ethnic rebel 
group said he would grant them sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will accept them in even though they are not our group's  
members because they have the same passion that we do to oppose the 
Burmese junta government,'' Bo Mya of the Karen National Union told 
reporters at his stronghold opposite Thailand's Tak province. 
</P>
<P>
	The Karen are the last sizable ethnic minority group fighting  
the central government of Myanmar, also called Burma. 
</P>
<P>
	The move will gall Myanmar's government, which has long  
described the Karen guerrillas as terrorists. Public comments by 
senior Thai officials describing the hostage-takers as fighters for 
democracy were also likely to irritate Yangon's generals. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter under what pretext or disguise it might have been  
staged, the peace-loving people of the world community will not 
tolerate the criminal and the terrorist activities they have 
committed,'' the Myanmar government said in an official news 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanan warned legal action would be taken against the rebels if  
they returned, but also said that Thailand would continue to 
tolerate freedom of expression for Myanmar dissident exiles as long 
as it was within the law. 
</P>
<P>
	One of two senior Thai officials who volunteered to fly with the  
five young rebels as surrogates for the hostages also expressed 
sympathy for their cause. Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand 
Paribatra said in an interview with Thailand's ITV television 
network that the militants were youths who were fighting for 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sukhumbhand and a senior refugee official, Chaiyapruek  
Sawaengcharoen, returned to Bangkok after leaving the five students 
at a drop-off point about a mile from the Myanmar border. 
</P>
<P>
	``They thanked me for saving their lives,'' said Sukhumbhand.  
``I thanked them back and we shook hands before they got off the 
helicopter.''

	Riot Police Stop Belgrade March  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- About 15,000 pro-democracy  
protesters marched toward Belgrade's main hospital Saturday -- only 
to be stopped by heavily armed riot police. The march was to 
demonstrate support for those hurt by police earlier in the week 
when hundreds of riot police charged at protesters marching toward 
President Slobodan Milosevic's villa three nights ago, injuring at 
least 60 people.

	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Suspected guerrillas pushing villagers  
to boycott India's elections set off a land mine Saturday, killing 
five people and wounding three others in Assam state on the eve of 
the last round of India's five-phase ballot, police said. Police 
also shot and killed two rebels in Assam and one local politician, 
bringing the day's death toll to eight in election-related 
violence.

	White House Hurries To Save Test Ban

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House launched an  
effort today to save a global nuclear test ban treaty, and accused 
Senate Republicans of trying to kill it with an unexpectedly quick 
vote. Trying to build support, President Clinton will speak about 
the treaty Tuesday when he signs a major defense bill at the 
Pentagon. Senate GOP leaders abruptly decided Thursday to hold a 
vote on the treaty Oct. 12.

	Reform Party Aims to Reunite  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top Reform Party officials worked today to  
coax a splinter group of their own to return. But organizers of the 
split said they first needed guarantees that Republican 
presidential candidate Pat Buchanan would not become the party's 
nominee. The efforts to reunify came as the party dealt with 
another brouhaha involving comments made by Minnesota Gov. Jesse 
Ventura, the Reform Party's top elected official, in an interview

	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian troops took control of a village  
in Chechnya and clashed with rebels in several parts of the 
breakaway republic today. Chechnya's vice president vowed his 
people would fight off the Russians -- but also called for 
negotiations. Vakha Arsanov suggested Georgian President Eduard 
Shevardnadze could organize talks between Russian and Chechen 
authorities. Russia began air raids on Chechnya last month after 
Muslim militants based in the territory invaded neighboring 
Dagestan, seeking to create an Islamic state.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Al Gore 2000 presidential campaign issued  
a statement defending campaign manager Tony Coelho, who is facing 
scrutiny for financial irregularities during a previous job. ``Tony 
Coelho does a great job as general chair of Gore 2000,'' the 
statement said. Stanley Brand, Coelho's personal lawyer, said his 
client did not violate any laws in a job that did not pay him a 
salary. State Department investigators say Coelho made the 
government liable for a $300,000 personal loan while directing the 
U.S. pavilion at the 1998 world's fair in Portugal.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the Supreme Court's marshal tells  
courtroom spectators Monday that ``the court is now sitting,'' 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg may be absent. Ginsburg returned home 
Sept. 27 after an 11-day hospital stay and surgery for colon 
cancer. The prognosis from her doctor is good, but it is not known 
how long the 66-year-old justice will be homebound. She already has

Williams hit Pat Woodcock with a 22-yard touchdown pass and Nate 
Trout kicked a 37-yard field goal in the final minute of the first 
half to break open a tight game. The defense then held the 
high-powered Green Wave scoreless in the second half as No. 22 
Syracuse rolled to a 47-17 victory.

<HEADLINE> Missile Defense System Test Slated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -- A prototype national  
missile defense system faced a critical test Saturday amid 
criticism that a successful demonstration of the technology would 
only heighten the nuclear threat. 
</P>
<P>
	An unarmed Minuteman missile was set for launch about 7:30 p.m.  
PDT on a flight over the Pacific to the Marshall Islands, where a 
``kill vehicle'' missile was to be launched to try to attempt an 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
	If successful, the interceptor would collide with the  
intercontinental ballistic missile at a combined speed of 16,000 
mph about 140 miles above the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	The Minuteman was configured with a dummy warhead and a decoy  
balloon. 
</P>
<P>
	The defender was the Raytheon-built Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle,  
a 55-inch-long, 120-pound device carried aloft on a booster rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	The system is designed to destroy missiles launched by rogue  
states or terrorists, not a multimissile barrage from a major 
nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics have faulted the test plan as unrealistic and too  
limited to make a sound decision, while peace activists who 
demonstrated outside the base a week ago denounced the testing as 
preparation for war. They planned a demonstration Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials played down expectations, saying that even a  
miss would be considered a success -- as long as the reason was 
known. 
</P>
<P>
	The test, however, is the first of three before a readiness  
review scheduled by the Pentagon for next June. To proceed with 
broader testing, at least two of the tests must result in an 
interception. A White House decision on initial deployment is 
expected after the June review. 
</P>
<P>
	The test comes as nations such as North Korea, Iran and Syria  
are, according to the CIA, developing long-range missiles that 
could hit the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Unarmed U.S. ICBMs are routinely tested in launches from  
Vandenberg to a Marshall Islands target range about 4,200 miles 
across the Pacific.

<HEADLINE> IOC Adds Skeleton, Women's Bobsled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
approved the addition of skeleton and women's bobsled to the sports 
program for the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeleton is a sport in which an athlete rides a sled head-first  
down an ice track. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC executive board also approved the addition of men's and  
women's 1,500-meter races in short-track speedskating, men's and 
women's cross-country ski events, and men's combined sprints in 
Nordic Combined. 
</P>
<P>
	The action came a day before the Salt Lake Organizing Committee  
makes a presentation to the IOC board. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake organizers had asked for approval of the new sports  
and events at the IOC session in Seoul, South Korea, in June. But 
the IOC said then it needed more information from international 
federations to make sure the sports met requirements.

<HEADLINE> Boy Sent to Principal Gets on Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- A 12-year-old boy sent to the principal's  
office for misbehaving walked out of the school and made his way to 
the airport where he boarded a plane without a ticket and flew to 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knew where Christopher Peregory had gone until he called  
his mother from the St. Louis airport later that day. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was practically hysterical,'' said his mother, Renee. She  
said he had never run away before. ``He's a very good child. It was 
just an adventure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peregory walked out of Belle View Elementary School on  
Wednesday, hopped a Metro train to Reagan National Airport and 
picked the Trans World Airlines flight to St. Louis at random. He 
had no ticket or boarding pass. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating whether TWA  
violated airport security procedures. TWA spokesman Jim Brown said 
the boy blended in with a family boarding the flight, then made 
himself inconspicuous by sitting near an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	``It made him look like he was the adult's child,'' Brown said.  
``He was apparently a very savvy kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family's lawyer, Ken Bynum, criticized the airline for  
allowing him to board. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty obvious to me they screwed up in more ways than  
one. This is a 12-year-old. He just walked on,'' Bynum said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the boy called his mother, she contacted the airport and  
child welfare officials took custody of him. He returned home on 
Thursday with a plane ticket provided by TWA.

<HEADLINE> Report: Gun Makers Talk With Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the first time since they have been sued  
over gun-related violence, gun manufacturers started talking with 
various cities on how to improve safety and make weapons tougher to 
get. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations, held Monday in Washington, were an initial  
effort to settle the suits brought by cities across the country, 
which seek millions of dollars in damages to recoup costs related 
to gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an opportunity and an obligation to seek an agreement  
that could achieve some of our objectives and avoid a long and 
costly legal procedure,'' Connecticut Attorney General Richard 
Blumenthal said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	He attended the meeting, along with several other  
representatives from other cities and states. 
</P>
<P>
	Unidentified gun industry executives who attended said they  
would consider a list of the cities' demands, including mandatory 
safety devices and a crackdown on corrupt gun retailers, The New 
York Times reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Present were Ed Shultz, chief executive of Smith and Wesson  
Corp., and officials from Sturm, Ruger and Co., Colt's 
Manufacturing, O.F. Mossberg and sons, Taurus, Glock and Beretta, 
the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several gun makers, including the so-called Ring of Fire  
companies that encircle Los Angeles, were not invited. Also not 
invited was Washington attorney John Coale, one of a group of 
lawyers who represent Newark, N.J., New Orleans, Atlanta, Cleveland 
and Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials are seeking tighter controls by manufacturers  
over distribution to wholesalers and retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	With the goal of curbing the supply of handguns to criminals and  
juveniles through corrupt dealers, the companies would be cut off 
from those who supply a high number of guns used in crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Any agreement would be overseen by an independent monitor picked  
by the cities and approved and paid for by the gun makers, lawyers 
involved in the talks told the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Other demands include placing external locks on all guns,  
incorporating new technology allowing only owners to fire their 
guns and ending the sale of handguns at gun shows and on the 
Internet. In addition, city officials want advertisements stopped 
that claim guns increase home safety.

<HEADLINE> Gordon's Crew Chief Sitting Duck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINSVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Brian Whitesell is a sitting duck, and  
he knows it. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitesell, who replaced Ray Evernham as Jeff Gordon's crew chief  
Wednesday, knows if the Hendrick Motorsports team continues winning 
it will be assumed that Evernham left him a winning combination. 
And if the team loses, it will be because he couldn't match 
Evernham's ability. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not trying to replace Ray Evernham,'' said Whitesell, who  
was the hand-picked successor for the man who guided Gordon to 
three Winston Cup championship in the last four seasons. ``I just 
want to make sure the team performs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the perception that he has been set up to fail by  
Evernham's surprising departure, Whitesell said, ``Is it unfair? 
No. It's my responsibility to get it done. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are basically still intact. What Ray has taught us, we are  
prepared to carry on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, so good. Gordon qualified a solid fifth for Sunday's  
NAPA AutoCare 500 at Martinsville Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a good start,'' said Whitesell, who at 35 is the same  
age as Evernham was when he came to the Hendrick team. ``It's what 
we wanted to accomplish -- a top five. Now we'd like to do the same 
on Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon expressed confidence in Whitesell and the rest of the  
Rainbow Warriors crew. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great race team with a lot of depth,'' Gordon said.  
``I really don't feel like we should skip much of a beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evernham was always the man talking on the radio with Gordon  
during the race. Now that duty falls to Whitesell, who has 
monitored those conversations over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be different,'' Gordon said. ``We miss him. If I  
had my choice, I'd love for him to be there. But I support him in 
wanting to do something else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evernham has said he will try to form his own Winston Cup team.  
Talk in the garage area has him doing that with the support of 
Chrysler, which is expected to return to Winston Cup racing with 
Dodge race cars in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	SECOND DAY LEADER: Hut Stricklin was the only driver who managed  
to qualify on Saturday for the Martinsville race. 
</P>
<P>
	Stricklin, one of only nine drivers who made qualifying attempts  
in the second round, turned a lap of 93.576 mph to take the 35th 
starting spot in the 43-car field. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the top 36 make the lineup on speed and all the other  
second-day qualifiers stood on their Friday laps. 
</P>
<P>
	Added to the lineup as provisional starters, based on team-owner  
points, were rookie Tony Stewart, seven-time Winston Cup champion 
Dale Earnhardt, Chad Little, Johnny Benson, rookie Elliott Sadler, 
Jerry Nadeau and Dave Marcis. 
</P>
<P>
	Sent home were Dick Trickle, Ron Hornaday, Tim Fedewa and Morgan  
Shepherd. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	THE PITS: Sunday will be the second test for the new pit road,  
which will have cars pitting all the way from the middle of turn 
four through the middle of turn one. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinsville officials decided to make the change, eliminating  
the backstretch pits, in the interests of competition. But the new, 
narrow road could cause one heck of a traffic jam. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a one-lane pit road now,'' said Ted Musgrave, who will  
start second, alongside pole-winner Joe Nemechek, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, as long as that pit road is, pit position is very  
important,'' Musgrave said. ``Joe is on the pole, so he picked the 
first pit stall. We picked further back in line, where there's an 
opening in front of us and a straight shot in and out of the pits. 
That will be an advantage in not getting blocked in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sure wouldn't want to be in that very first pit stall (in  
turn four),'' he added. ``That's going to hurt whoever that is or 
anybody in that area.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	SPARK PLUGS: Darrell Waltrip, who will start 22nd on Sunday,  
leads all active drivers with 11 Martinsville wins ... Only 14 of 
92 Martinsville races have been won from the pole, but 75 have been 
won from the top 10 ... Posted awards for the race at NASCAR's 
smallest track are $1,930,531 ... Gordon has finished eighth or 
better, including two wins, in his last nine Martinsville starts.

<HEADLINE> Bill Signed To Outlaw Gay Harassment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis on Saturday signed  
legislation to outlaw the harassment of gay students and teachers 
in public schools and colleges, calling the action an attempt to 
``beat back the forces of hatred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic governor also signed into law a new state  
domestic partners registry for couples who are gay or over age 62, 
extending to them hospital visitation rights and allowing state and 
local government workers to get health benefits for their partners. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the third of three gay-rights bills, the governor signed  
legislation to block job and housing discrimination on the basis of 
sexual orientation. The bill places authority over the cases in the 
state's Fair Employment and Housing Department, a key state civil 
rights agency. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the legislation banning discrimination against gay  
students and teachers that drew the most attention. Three other 
states -- Wisconsin, Massachusetts and Connecticut -- have similar 
antidiscrimination rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, a political leader has taken meaningful action. This  
is the most important piece of legislation ever passed in regard to 
gay-lesbian youth rights,'' said Kevin Jennings, executive director 
of the national Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Held Out of Florida Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Alabama receiver Shamari Buchanan was  
held out of Saturday's game against Florida while the NCAA 
investigated reports that he may have received help in getting a 
speeding charge dropped in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are holding Shamari out of today's game while we  
investigate allegations of potential violation of team rules,'' 
Marie Robbins, UA associate athletic director for compliance, said 
in a statement Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, a backup receiver from Atlanta, received a ticket in  
Calhoun County for traveling 87 mph in a 70 mph zone Jan. 6. The 
charge was dropped April 19, according to a review of records by 
The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until we get the situation figured out, he'll be out,'' said  
UA sports information director Larry White. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation involving Buchanan was part of a widespread  
probe stemming from allegations of ticket fixing that prompted the 
forced resignation of Alabama Department of Public Safety Director 
Mike Sullivan on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	White said Friday that if Buchanan received special treatment,  
it could be an NCAA violation and could affect his eligibility.

<HEADLINE> 'Family Circus' Web Parody To Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARADISE VALLEY, Ariz. (AP) -- An Internet site that parodies the  
Family Circus comic strip by allowing visitors to supply their own 
cartoon captions, some of them raunchy, will be taken down. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Galcik, who created the Dysfunctional Family Circus web  
site in 1995, agreed to take the site down after talking with 
Family Circus' cartoonist Bil Keane by telephone this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not convinced I was on the wrong side of the law,'' he  
wrote on his Web site, but ``knowing Bil was personally upset at 
the site, it depressed me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to take the site down Oct. 8.  
</P>
<P>
	Keane last week threatened legal action against Galcik, saying  
some of the parody captions were indecent -- contrary to the 
wholesomeness and family values he tries to portray with his comic 
strip. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said more than anything else, he didn't want to hurt me,''  
Keane told The Arizona Republic for a story in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Keane, who has drawn the cartoons for 40 years, was pleased by  
the way the situation was being resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has a happy ending, as everything dealing with the Family  
Circus should be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Family Circus is carried by 15,000 newspapers worldwide,  
reaching about 100 million readers.

<HEADLINE> Muslims Protest Disney Exhibit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Dozens of Muslims protested  
outside the entrance to Walt Disney World as a controversial 
exhibit on Israel opened to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit, part of Epcot Center's Millenium Village, has  
sparked angry denouncements from Jews and Muslims unhappy over the 
depiction of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters on Friday carried banners reading ``Israeli Exhibit  
of Falsehood'' and ``Disney and Israel -- Partnership for 
Propaganda,'' and passed out a leaflet that read: ``Why my children 
will not be at Disney today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Muslim groups say the exhibit wrongly depicts Jerusalem as a  
unified city. The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith complained 
that the exhibit doesn't celebrate Jerusalem as the capital of 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were disappointed to see that, according to Disney,  
Jerusalem is the capital of the Millennium, rather than the capital 
of the state of Israel,'' said Abraham Foxman, the ADL's national 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	A delegation of Arab Americans toured the exhibit Friday and  
later called for the addition of a Palestinian display to the 
exhibit of 24 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Warren, Disney spokesman, responded: ``I'm not going to  
prejudge a decision we haven't had a chance to evaluate. Any day 
we're open to hearing from potential sponsors or exhibitors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two Arab countries -- Morocco and Saudi Arabia -- are among the  
countries already represented in the Millennium Village. All the 
exhibits are partially paid for by the countries themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Walt Disney World President Al Weiss said the theme park resort  
did everything it could to avoid politics, but in Israel, politics 
and culture often can be hard to separate. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast  
War, annexed it and claimed the entire city as its capital. The 
Palestinians want the eastern part of the city to be the capital of 
their future state. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of the capital is so thorny that most countries,  
including the United States, have their embassies in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our problem is not with Disney itself, but Disney has chosen  
to be on the wrong side in this instance,'' said Khalid Turaani, 
executive director of the Washington-based group American Muslims 
for Jerusalem. It is boycotting Disney over the Israel exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	Arab foreign ministers had considered a Disney boycott but  
decided against it last week. Weiss met with Arab and Muslim 
leaders in Washington several weeks ago to assuage their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahmad Saidi, an Orlando businessman who toured the exhibit  
Friday, said ``it was fair.'' But Hussein Ibish, spokesman for the 
Washington-based American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, and 
others said the exhibit should have mentioned Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of this is occupied territory,'' Ibish said during the  
tour, waving his hand in front of an enlarged photo of Jerusalem's 
Old City. ``It's an excellent piece of propaganda.''

<HEADLINE> Strategy Aims To Starve Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The biggest thing in cancer is this little  
four-word sentence: Tumors make blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not as obvious as it sounds.  
</P>
<P>
	For a long time, doctors assumed that spreading cancer makes do  
with the blood supply already in place. But no. Now they know that 
cancer grows its own. 
</P>
<P>
	This biologic insight has turned out to be among the precious  
few that opens an entirely new strategy for controlling a human 
ill. In the past two or three years, the discovery has become the 
starting point for the most studied, the most tested, and 
absolutely the most talked about endeavor in all of cancer 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	If it leads where scientists hope -- and where drug companies are  
placing big research bets -- then it should be possible to stop 
cancerous tumors by blocking their ability to launch the fresh 
blood vessels needed for survival. To kill a cancer, the thinking 
goes, starve it. 
</P>
<P>
	At this point, no one knows if it will work. But cancer experts  
say they cannot remember a time when there has been so much 
enthusiasm for a new approach to treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea has taken more than 30 years to evolve from the  
universally scoffed-at brainstorm of Harvard surgeon Judah Folkman. 
Now it is an enterprise being chased by dozens of companies, 
ranging from the biggest pharmaceutical makers to one-idea 
startups. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 20 drugs that block the growth of blood vessels are in  
various stages of testing on people with cancer. More are nearly 
ready for testing. At the National Cancer Institute, Dr. James 
Pluda guesses that literally hundreds of other potential ones are 
in development. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's considered one of the hottest areas in all of medicine,  
not just cancer,'' he says. ``I'm not aware of any drug company, 
big or small, that is not working in this field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cancerous tumors rely on the construction of new blood vessels --  
a process scientists call angiogenesis -- to bring in oxygen and 
nutrients. Without this blood supply, they never grow larger than a 
pinhead. The question is whether any of the drugs in the works can 
thwart this basic biological process and thereby cure cancer, or at 
least stop it from spreading. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason so many companies are interested in this is the  
possibility -- and I emphasize possibility -- that it will be broadly 
applicable to all tumor types,'' says Dr. Susan Hellmann, 
development director at Genentech. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, if all kinds of cancer need new blood vessels,  
then one drug that interrupts this process might be good against 
all of them. With this in mind, drugs such as Sugen's experimental 
blood vessel blocker, SU5416, are being tested against cancers all 
over the body, including the colon, lung, kidney, ovaries, breast 
and skin. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-four separate studies are under way with this one drug  
alone. It's even being tested against cancers of the blood, on the 
theory that even this malignancy requires the growth of fresh blood 
vessels in the bone marrow, where the cancer starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``These could be huge drugs, almost like the Holy Grail,'' says  
Peter Hirth, Sugen's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors explaining their enthusiasm for this approach usually  
start by rhapsodizing over its elegant scientific underpinnings, 
worked out by Folkman and others who joined the field later. Then 
they mention the exceptionally promising experiments on rats and 
mice, in which tumors stop growing, shrivel up, even disappear . 
Finally, they get around to the miracles. 
</P>
<P>
	These amazing stories, the against-all-odds recoveries of people  
at death's door, are the most gripping and yet ephemeral of all the 
evidence in this young field. Most of the new compounds are in such 
early stages of testing, and their study subjects are so riddled 
with cancer, that no one can say with confidence whether the drugs 
do any good at all. 
</P>
<P>
	But a few of the terminally ill volunteers in these last-ditch  
experiments have suddenly gotten better. Even skeptics who have 
watched cancer breakthroughs come and go cannot help being 
intrigued. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most of those who have tried the new drugs, Clayton Twigg  
had failed all standard treatments and was dying. He had a rare and 
extremely aggressive form of thyroid cancer that had spread into 
his chest. At one point, his neck grew so big there was no 
indentation between chin and chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Unwilling to give up, Twigg volunteered for an experimental  
blood vessel blocker at University of Hospitals of Cleveland. In 
February, he became the eighth patient in a study of the safety of 
combretastatin, made by Oxigene. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the second treatment, bingo! The tumor had started to  
shrink,'' said Twigg, 56, an engineer from Westlake, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of six treatments, doctors could no longer see the  
growth on scans. In August, they decided to operate. But when they 
looked around his thyroid for remaining traces of cancer, there 
were none. 
</P>
<P>
	The news, though obviously good, does not mean Twigg has been  
cured. Undetectable cancer may lurk somewhere in his body. Still, 
his doctors say they have never heard of such a dramatic remission 
at Twigg's stage of this particular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, those who follow drug testing are reluctant to  
make too much of stories like this. Cancer is not an entirely 
predictable disease; people sometimes get better for no apparent 
reason. Furthermore, despite being terminally ill, those admitted 
to drug studies are often healthier than run-of-the-mill cancer 
patients, so they respond better to novel therapies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to give the impression this is a cure-all, the  
silver bullet for cancer,'' says Dr. Scott Remick, who heads 
Twigg's study. ``But there's no doubt this patient has had a very 
significant response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twigg takes part in what's called a Phase One study. It is  
limited to a few patients and is intended to see how much of the 
drug can be given safely. The next stage often includes more 
patients and tests whether the drug has any effect on the tumor. 
But true proof of combretastatin's value must await Phase Three, 
the large, costly comparison study in which hundreds of patients 
are randomly assigned to get the drug or dummy shots, then followed 
for a year or two to see if the treatment makes them live longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the time it takes to carry drugs through these levels  
of testing, many believe it will be four or five years before the 
value of the blood vessel stoppers becomes clear. 
</P>
<P>
	The two highest profile candidates in this field are drugs  
called endostatin and angiostatin that have not even entered Phase 
One. Last year, an optimistically worded article in The New York 
Times (deletearticle) quoted scientists predicting that these 
drugs, discovered by Harvard's Folkman, could become a cure for 
cancer within two years. As cancer fighters, they appear to be 
especially powerful, at least in mice and rats, the only test 
subjects so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Folkman and others pointed out that cancer is infinitely harder  
to cure in people than it is in the inbred strains of rodents that 
serve as scientists' drug proving ground. Nevertheless, the stock 
of EntreMed, the small biotech firm developing Folkman's drugs, 
shot from $12 a share to $85 the day after the story ran. (It since 
settled back into the 20s.) 
</P>
<P>
	Endostatin testing will start this fall on 45 to 90 terminally  
ill volunteers in Boston, Houston and Madison, Wis. Because of the 
publicity, the experiment will be subjected to a level of kibitzing 
rare in early stage drug testing, which usually succeeds or fails 
in anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Folkman, for one, doubts this first human test will show much  
benefit, and disappointment is inevitable. ``People two weeks into 
this will write newspaper articles saying it doesn't work,'' he 
says. ``They will get safety data in Phase One, but efficacy will 
take a long time, if it comes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reason: Blood vessel blockers are nothing like traditional  
cancer treatment. Mainstream chemotherapy drugs are poisons that 
work by harming cancer cells more than they do normal ones. Often 
they shrink cancers fast, even though they may fail to destroy 
every last bit of the disease, leaving some to grow back and kill. 
</P>
<P>
	The experimental drugs are unlikely to make cancer wither and  
vanish -- at least, not quickly and predictably. Some may make 
tumors recede; others may only prevent them from getting any larger 
or spreading further. 
</P>
<P>
	If so, this will mean cancer patients may need to take the drugs  
for months, years, even for life. ``Maybe these drugs won't make 
the disease disappear,'' says Dr. Lee Rosen of UCLA's Jonsson 
Comprehensive Cancer Center. ``But if we can stop it from growing 
and make it a chronic disease, that's an OK thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the drugs in the pipeline were designed from scratch to  
target the body's normal blood vessel construction machinery, which 
is hardly ever turned on in healthy adults. Some target messenger 
proteins, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, that activate 
this process. Some block the enzymes that are necessary for new 
blood vessels to burrow through surrounding tissue. Others, like 
endostatin, seem to inhibit the entire process. 
</P>
<P>
	Some older drugs are being looked at afresh, as well. For  
instance, thalidomide, the disgraced sleeping pill, is being tested 
for its newly recognized effects on blood vessels in people with a 
variety of cancers. So are taxol and interferon-alpha, standard 
cancer medicines that may work in low doses as angiogenesis 
blockers. 
</P>
<P>
	While it is possible these medicines will turn out to be  
effective alone, many researchers expect they will work best when 
combined with standard chemotherapy, surgery and radiation. Lab 
experiments suggest that tumors may be far more sensitive to the 
killing effects of chemotherapy after they have been weakened with 
blood vessel inhibitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that a dual therapy, one designed to go after the  
blood vessel and one to go after the cancer cell itself, will lead 
to a super-additive effect,'' says UCLA's Dr. Fairooz Kabbinavar. 
</P>
<P>
	If these drugs pan out, doctors envision a time when patients  
will get a blood test to see which chemical triggers their tumorsto 
make new blood vessels. Then they will take a cocktail of blockers 
tailored to their disease, wait a few weeks for their cancer's 
blood supply to shut down and come back for a knockout punch of 
chemo or radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been one foot in front of another in cancer medicine for  
the past 50 years,'' says Dr. Stephen Sallan of Boston's 
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. ``New concepts, and anti-angiogenesis 
is just one of them, certainly make me feel we will accelerate the 
pace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For some, such as Clayton Twigg, who were present in the first  
moments of this new attack on cancer, the future may have arrived 
just in time. Once given six months to live, he is planning a 
fishing trip to Canada and thinking about returning to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not out of the woods yet, but I'm keeping my fingers  
crossed,'' he says. ``Hopefully we have found something, if not for 
all of cancer, then at least for those with the kind I have. It's a 
terrific time for science.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Student Radical Freed From Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRAMINGHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Katherine Ann Power, the student  
radical who spent 23 years underground after taking part in an 
armed robbery that ended with the death of a police officer, was 
released from prison today. 
</P>
<P>
	Power, 49, said nothing to reporters as she left MCI-Framingham,  
where she has spent the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued by her attorney, James M. Doyle, Power  
said she ``will always carry my human responsibility for the sorrow 
my actions have caused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Power, then a 21-year-old student at Brandeis University, and  
four others robbed a Boston bank to fund radical efforts against 
the Vietnam war. She was waiting in the getaway car when another 
member of the group, William ``Lefty'' Gilday, shot Schroeder in 
the back. Only Power got away. 
</P>
<P>
	For 23 years, she lived under the alias Alice Metzinger,  
eventually settling near Corvallis, Ore. She married a bookkeeper, 
Ronley Duncan, worked as a chef, and had a son, now 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Power returned to Massachusetts in 1993, pleaded guilty to  
manslaughter and was sentenced to eight to 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	She was released early with credit for good behavior and time  
served. 
</P>
<P>
	Power has not said where she will go next. Duncan told the  
Boston Herald he and Power separated over a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Ginsberg's Return To Court Unknown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the Supreme Court's marshal tells  
courtroom spectators Monday that ``the court is now sitting,'' 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg may be absent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg returned home Sept. 27 after an 11-day hospital stay  
and surgery for colon cancer. The prognosis from her doctor is 
good, but it is not known how long the 66-year-old justice will be 
homebound. 
</P>
<P>
	She already has participated in court business since her  
surgery, but cannot take part in oral arguments unless in the 
courtroom. For cases in which she misses the arguments, Ginsburg 
can listen to audio tapes and read transcripts if she chooses to 
participate in deciding them. 
</P>
<P>
	If she opts out of them, her eight colleagues could reach a  
decision without her or order the case reargued. A 4-4 split of the 
justices automatically upholds a lower court's ruling but sets no 
legal precedent.

	Gore Campaign Manager Scrutinized  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- State Department investigators say they have  
uncovered some possible financial irregularities committed by Vice 
President Al Gore's campaign manager in a previous job. 
Investigators say Tony Coelho misused airline tickets, gave his 
niece a federal job and received a $300,000 personal loan that may 
be repaid by the government -- all while he directed the U.S. 
pavilion at a 1998 exposition in Portugal. The report was released 
by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit organization. The 
center said Coelho's actions may have violated federal laws.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the first time since they have been sued  
over gun-related violence, gun manufacturers started talking with 
various cities on how to improve safety and make weapons tougher to 
get. The negotiations, held Monday in Washington, were an initial 
effort to settle the suits brought by cities across the country, 
which seek millions of dollars in damages to recoup costs related 
to gun violence. Unidentified gun industry executives who attended 
said they would consider a list of the cities' demands, including 
mandatory safety devices and a crackdown on corrupt gun retailers, 
The New York Times reported today.

The president was taking his message of tolerance before gay and 
lesbian supporters tonight at a Los Angeles dinner expected to 
raise $850,000 for Democratic candidates. Serving as host for 
Saturday's dinner was ANGLE -- Action Now for Gay and Lesbian

<HEADLINE> Boggs Hits 3,000, Still Going </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Missing the final month of the  
regular season taught Wade Boggs one thing: he is not ready to stop 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not ready to quit,'' the Tampa Bay Devil Rays third  
baseman said on Friday. ``The fire is still burning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs, who on Aug. 7 became the 23rd player with 3,000 career  
hits underwent season-ending arthroscopic right knee surgery one 
month later. He was hitting .301 with two homers and 29 RBIs when 
his 18th season abruptly ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last month has been extremely tough,'' said Boggs, who has  
started a normal offseason training regiment now that his knee has 
healed. ``It's not fun sitting at home. It shows I still want to 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays hold an option for next season and have said a  
final decision won't be made until the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I don't know what to expect for the future,'' Boggs  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs was honored Friday with a plaque on ``Baseball Boulevard''  
outside Tropicana Field commemorating his 3,000th hit.

<HEADLINE> Oilers Retire Wayne Gretzky's Jersey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Now Wayne Gretzky feels his retirement  
is final. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly five months after playing his last game, Gretzky had his  
No. 99 retired by the Edmonton Oilers in extravagant ceremonies 
Friday night, and the Great One called it the ``official'' end of 
his unparalleled hockey career. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky spent a major part of his career in Edmonton, helping  
the Oilers win four Stanley Cups in the '80s before playing for 
teams in Los Angeles, St. Louis and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``As emotional as it was, I couldn't help but stand there and  
smile, thinking over all the wonderful times that I had playing and 
living here,'' said Gretzky, who was given the tribute before the 
Oilers' season opener against the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oilers and Rangers played to a 1-1 tie.  
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky's No. 99 jersey was raised to the rafters in a moving  
ceremony at Skyreach Centre. In attendance were more than 17,000 
cheering fans including Gretzky's family and ex-teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it's only fitting that they're parking me (the banner)  
behind that net,'' said Gretzky, referring to the area where he was 
offensively potent. 
</P>
<P>
	The simple blue banner bearing Gretzky's name, number and the  
team's oil drop logo was lifted to the ceiling following an 
eye-popping light show and video extravaganza highlighted by 
Gretzky's greatest goals being replayed on the Jumbotron. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky thanked the team and the city's fans, saying, ``the  
years here have been nothing but wonderful, nothing but great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he accepted his retirement decision the moment he  
announced it in the spring. ``The fact I can't do it (play hockey), 
it kills me but I've got peace of mind because it was time to move 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw that banner go up, there was no turning back.''  
</P>
<P>
	He said he came home spiritually to Edmonton when he dropped the  
puck before Game 4 of the Oilers-Dallas Stars playoff series in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when I said I'm kind of an Edmonton Oiler again.''  
</P>
<P>
	Many of Gretzky's former Edmonton teammates were in attendance,  
including current Oilers coach Kevin Lowe and Jari Kurri, who 
scored many goals off Gretzky's seeing-eye passes. Kurri flew in 
from Finland for the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of memories came back -- the good old days, the  
two-on-ones, stuff like that,'' Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Muckler, ex-Oilers coach and currently coach of the  
Rangers, added: ``I was just standing there, more or less, saying, 
`Hey guy, you deserve all this.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd gave Gretzky a five-minute standing ovation when he  
entered in a cloud of dry ice and circled the rink standing on the 
bed of a slow-moving black pickup. Flashbulbs popped as players, 
fans and even the refs saluted Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky then hopped off and was hugged by mentor and former  
coach Glen Sather, who is now team president. In his speech, Sather 
called Gretzky ``a great Canadian hero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also at center ice were Gretzky's father Walter, mother Phyllis,  
wife Janet and children Paulina, Ty and Trevor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ex-Oilers Kurri, Mark Messier and Dave Semenko then unveiled a  
Wei Luan portrait of Gretzky celebrating a goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony capped a day of Wayne-adoration that began at noon  
when 5,000 screaming fans ignored freezing temperatures to jam the 
City Hall square to say goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	``One more year! One more year!'' they chanted to Gretzky.  
</P>
<P>
	``They took my skates to the Hall of Fame!'' he shouted. ``I  
don't even have skates!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city hall affair was to officially change the name of the  
3-mile expressway that runs past Skyreach to Wayne Gretzky Drive. 
</P>
<P>
	A bronze statue of him hoisting aloft the Stanley Cup already  
stands outside the rink. It was erected a decade ago after his 
trade to the Los Angeles Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the sweater goes up, it's the official end,'' said  
Gretzky, adding, ``I still wish I could play. I still wish I could 
be out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL has already announced his No. 99 will be retired  
throughout the league, but Edmonton is the first city to send his 
jersey to the rafters. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky holds 61 NHL records. Included are his 894 goals and  
1,963 assists for 2,857 points. In 208 career playoff games, he 
collected 122 goals and 260 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	He played one season in the now-defunct WHA. He scored 46  
regular-season goals plus 10 more in the playoffs to give him a 
combined pro hockey mark of 1,072 -- one more than boyhood idol 
Gordie Howe. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky will be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto  
on Nov. 22. The hall's directors waived the usual three-year 
waiting period.

<HEADLINE> Missile Defense System Test Slated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -- A prototype national  
missile defense system faced a critical test Saturday amid 
criticism that a successful demonstration of the technology would 
only heighten the nuclear threat. 
</P>
<P>
	An unarmed Minuteman missile was set for launch about 7:30 p.m.  
PDT on a flight over the Pacific to the Marshall Islands, where a 
``kill vehicle'' missile was to be launched to try to attempt an 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
	If successful, the interceptor would collide with the  
intercontinental ballistic missile at a combined speed of 16,000 
mph about 140 miles above the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	The Minuteman was configured with a dummy warhead and a decoy  
balloon. 
</P>
<P>
	The defender was the Raytheon-built Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle,  
a 55-inch-long, 120-pound device carried aloft on a booster rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	The system is designed to destroy missiles launched by rogue  
states or terrorists, not a multimissile barrage from a major 
nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics have faulted the test plan as unrealistic and too  
limited to make a sound decision, while peace activists who 
demonstrated outside the base a week ago denounced the testing as 
preparation for war. They planned a demonstration Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials played down expectations, saying that even a  
miss would be considered a success -- as long as the reason was 
known. 
</P>
<P>
	The test, however, is the first of three before a readiness  
review scheduled by the Pentagon for next June. To proceed with 
broader testing, at least two of the tests must result in an 
interception. A White House decision on initial deployment is 
expected after the June review. 
</P>
<P>
	The test comes as nations such as North Korea, Iran and Syria  
are, according to the CIA, developing long-range missiles that 
could hit the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Unarmed U.S. ICBMs are routinely tested in launches from  
Vandenberg to a Marshall Islands target range about 4,200 miles 
across the Pacific.

<HEADLINE> White House Aims To Save Test Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House launched ``a hurry up  
offense'' Saturday to save a global nuclear test ban treaty, racing 
to build support for the landmark agreement while accusing Senate 
Republicans of trying to kill it with an unexpectedly quick vote. 
</P>
<P>
	After two years of inaction and without any hearings on the  
treaty, Senate GOP leaders abruptly decided Thursday to hold a vote 
Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not what the Founding Fathers meant by advise and  
consent,'' Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, said in an 
interview Saturday. ``This is hit and run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration and its allies accused Republicans of rushing  
the vote in hopes of defeating the treaty. Democrats fear they are 
about 15 votes short of the 67 needed to ratify the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to build support, President Clinton will speak about the  
treaty Tuesday when he signs a major defense bill at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	To demonstrate military backing for the agreement, Clinton will  
gather testimonials Wednesday from former chairmen of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, former astronaut and Sen. John Glenn, and Nobel 
laureate physicists. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say the treaty is flawed, in part because it would  
not prevent countries such as North Korea, Iraq and Iran from 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it would put us in a weakened position  
internationally,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said 
Friday. ``But since there have been all these calls and demands for 
a vote, we have offered to vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, major treaties are debated at length in committee  
hearings before coming to a vote in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has not been one day of hearings,'' Berger said. ``This  
process has been short-circuited. We're dealing here with the most 
serious and sober matter that comes before the Senate and we have a 
hurry up offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty calls for an outright ban on all nuclear testing. It  
has been signed by 152 nations, including the United States but it 
has been ratified only by 47 countries, the most recent Bulgaria on 
Wednesday. More significantly, the treaty has been ratified by only 
23 of the 44 nuclear-capable countries that must ratify it for it 
to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
	To win ratification, the treaty requires approval by a  
two-thirds vote in the Senate. Even if all 45 Democrats support the 
treaty, 22 other Republicans must vote ``yes'' for it to be 
ratified. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Armed Services Committee will open three days of  
hearings on the treaty beginning Wednesday. The treaty normally 
would be considered by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee but 
its chairman, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., is one of its foremost 
opponents. Defense Secretary William Cohen and Gen. Henry H. 
Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, will present the 
administration's case. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen is cutting short a trip to Asia to return to Washington  
for a meeting Monday of Clinton's national security team. In 
Singapore, Cohen said Saturday that ratification of the treaty 
would send a strong signal to India and Pakistan, as well as other 
nations, to temper their nuclear ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
	A former Republican senator, Cohen said he wants ``to talk to  
former colleagues and ask them to keep an open mind.'' Shelton, 
also in Asia, may return early, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a verifiable treaty,'' Cohen said, adding that the United  
States has the technology to ensure nuclear tests are not 
conducted. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States stopped nuclear testing in 1992 and relies on  
supercomputer simulations to test the nuclear arsenal. ``This is 
about whether we can stop other countries from testing,'' Berger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the United States to say, `No,' we're going to go the  
other way, we're going to go in the direction of the nuclear 
testers, is crazy,'' Berger said.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Test-Ban Vote Set for Oct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is promising an  
intense, if brief, campaign for Senate ratification of a nuclear 
test ban treaty, suggesting defeat could set back nuclear 
nonproliferation efforts around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	But supporters are not optimistic the campaign will produce the  
67 Senate votes needed for ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate leaders of both parties on Friday agreed to begin  
debating the 152-nation Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty next Friday, 
with a vote set for the following Tuesday, Oct. 12, setting aside 
18 hours for debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats reluctantly agreed to vote this month, after Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., suddenly announced he would 
schedule a vote -- after the treaty had remained bottled up for two 
years in the Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	After first balking, Democrats took Lott's take-it-or-leave-it  
offer after he agreed to delay the vote to Oct. 12 from Oct. 6, and 
agreed to eight more hours of debate than the 10 he initially 
proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel we have no choice,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom  
Daschle, D-S.D. ``This may be the best that we can get. ... We'll 
take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin stressed the  
importance of ratification, saying, ``The eyes of the world are on 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be in a far stronger position to insist that other  
countries do not go down the nuclear testing road if we ratify the 
treaty, '' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the treaty's case is made in ``a serious, sustained, and  
analytical way,'' there will be enough support to ratify it, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate supporters of the treaty were a less sanguine about  
the pact's chances of passage. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the senior Democrat on the Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee, suggested the outlook appeared bleak, 
but that at least the vote would force senators to go on the 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is: If you are going to die, do you want to die  
with no one knowing who shot you or do you want to go at least with 
the world knowing who killed you?'' Biden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the administration has said the test ban treaty should  
be nonpartisan, support for it in the Senate is almost entirely 
Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
	All 45 Democratic senators are expected to support it, but only  
two Republicans -- Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and James Jeffords 
of Vermont -- have endorsed it publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty, which calls for an outright ban on all nuclear  
testing, has been signed by 152 nations, including the United 
States. But it has been ratified by only 18 of the 44 countries 
with nuclear capabilities that must ratify it for it to take 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives contend the pact -- which also has not yet been  
ratified by Russia or China -- could threaten the U.S. ability to 
modernize its arsenal if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the United States already has a vast superiority  
in nuclear weapons, thanks to more than 1,000 nuclear tests during 
the Cold War, and the treaty would lock in that advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said the Armed Services  
Committee, which he chairs, will hold hearings on the treaty next 
week. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, 
R-N.C., has refused to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident that the Senate will vote to reject this  
dangerous arms control pact,'' Helms said Friday. ``The effect of 
this treaty would be to forever forbid the United States from 
testing its nuclear arsenal, while allowing the rogue nations of 
the world to proceed with their nuclear plans.''

<HEADLINE> President Urges Tolerance of Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Citing recent shootings in California and the  
Midwest, President Clinton says it is time Americans deal with 
``the fear of the other'' that motivates such acts of hatred. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was taking his message of tolerance before gay and  
lesbian supporters Saturday night at a Los Angeles dinner expected 
to raise $850,000 for Democratic candidates -- the largest amount of 
Clinton's three-day West Coast swing. 
</P>
<P>
	Serving as host for Saturday's dinner was ANGLE, or Access Now  
for Gay and Lesbian Equality, which initially met with Clinton 
eight years ago. ANGLE was the first gay rights organization to 
endorse Clinton's candidacy then, and remained supportive despite 
disappointments from his ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy for gays 
in the military and his 1996 decision to sign a law denying federal 
recognition of same sex marriages. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said the dinner was one of the largest events of its  
kind outside Washington. About 1,000 guests were expected, each 
making contributions ranging from $250 to $50,000; Besides Clinton, 
California Gov. Gray Davis, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, 
D-Mo.; and Reps. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., and Tammy Baldwin, 
D-Wis., were scheduled speakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Clinton was addressing a separate dinner at the home  
of director Rob Reiner, which was raising $550,000 for the 
Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The president tested themes at two smaller events Friday night  
with Silicon Valley executives. 
</P>
<P>
	He repeated his support for legislation barring job  
discrimination against gays and hate crimes. Clinton urged the 
crowd to fight for ``the innate dignity and equality of every human 
being'' and work to ensure ``a place at the American family table'' 
for all, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or income. 
</P>
<P>
	The president noted that technology offers vast potential for  
transforming American society, but cannot deliver as long as some 
segments of the population cling to prejudices because they are 
afraid of change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here you are out here, all you think about is the new  
millennium,'' Clinton said. ``Isn't it ironic that the thing that's 
holding us back most ... is our inability to form a community 
around our common humanity because of our vulnerability to 
mankind's most ancient fear, the fear of the other?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we need to deal with that,'' he continued. ``I believe  
my party is on the right side of all those issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he has devoted much of his time in office to  
dealing with ``the emotional and practical and national security 
demands'' of international conflicts spurred by hatreds. 
</P>
<P>
	The same elements in those problems, he said, have appeared in  
America over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, he recalled the slayings of gay college student  
Matthew Shepard in Wyoming; James Byrd, a black man, in Texas; a 
Korean student and a former college basketball coach in a shooting 
spree by ``a crazy guy'' in Illinois; and the death of a Filipino 
postman and wounding of a Jewish child in shootings in California. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see people in this so-called modern world, where we're  
celebrating all of your modern ideas and your modern achievements, 
and what is the biggest problem in the world in America? We are 
dragged down by the most primitive of hatreds,'' Clinton said. 
``It's bizarre.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Saturday, the president spent time in Palo Alto visiting  
with his daughter Chelsea, a junior at Stanford University, and 
doing some work on his presidential library. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was returning to Washington early Monday.

<HEADLINE> Controversial Art Attracts Thousands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If you build it -- even with elephant dung,  
bisected pigs and a severed cow's head -- and call it art, they will 
come. 
</P>
<P>
	They did by the hundreds Saturday at the Brooklyn Museum of Art,  
where the much-maligned and mega-hyped ``Sensation'' exhibit drew 
an overflow crowd of art lovers, scene makers and the merely 
curious -- all at $9.75 a head. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 9,200 people toured the show, filling the space to  
capacity. Police remained on site until the museum closed at 11 
p.m., though authorities said the scene was calm. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd began queuing up three hours before the opening, which  
attracted scores of angry protesters upset by art that was deemed 
religiously offensive or pro-animal cruelty. Several museum 
visitors said that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's bitter opposition to 
the show had actually prompted them to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rudy got me here,'' Marvin Schneider said after checking out  
the controversial British show. ``I was interested in seeing this 
after what he said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy began Sept. 22 when the mayor announced that he  
was cutting off the museum's $7 million in annual funding unless 
the exhibit was pulled. Giuliani attacked the exhibit with 
escalating insults: ``sick'' ``Catholic bashing,'' and finally 
``pedophiles on parade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Museum officials in turn sued Giuliani. The city responded by  
suing the museum in an effort to evict it from the city-owned 
building where it's resided for more than a century. Both lawsuits 
are pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Cora Ferrer, 54, said the furor also brought her to the show.  
</P>
<P>
	``The mayor did me a favor,'' she said. ``If he kept his mouth  
shut, I never would have heard of this show. If I listened to him, 
I would have missed all the beauty inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The beauty included a dissected cow and pig, castrated male  
dummies lashed to a tree, and the infamous painting ``The Holy 
Virgin Mary'' with its splash of elephant dung. 
</P>
<P>
	A police sergeant somberly stood watch alongside the painting by  
artist Chris Ofili. The exhibit, which consistently stopped 
visitors in their tracks, was also protected by a plastic screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``What if this was done to your mother?'' asked a sign held by a  
protester outside the museum, which has generally kept a much lower 
profile since opening in 1823. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit opened promptly at 11 a.m., with ticket buyers  
passing through just-installed metal detectors as the sound of 
protesters reciting the ``Hail Mary'' echoed across the museum's 
plaza. 
</P>
<P>
	A sign outside the museum cautioned, ``Sensation. Be Warned.''  
The line to get inside stretched past the museum's property, with a 
steady stream of visitors pouring inside. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 supporters of The Catholic League protested the  
opening, singing hymns and praying the rosary. League President 
William Donohue handed out complementary ``vomit bags'' to people 
waiting to see the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is hate speech, people,'' Donohue told his troops. ``This  
is not art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gareth Brown disagreed. He came with his 7-month-old son, whose  
stroller carried a small sign reading, ``Pro-art, anti-Giuliani.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Art should provoke discussion and controversy, and this  
does,'' Brown said while waiting in line. ``Controversy is not a 
bad thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Museum director Arnold Lehman opted not to dump fuel on the fire  
Saturday. ``There has been a lot of comment on all sides over the 
past few days,'' Lehman said. ``Today's the day to let the art 
speak for itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was just a single arrest for disorderly conduct when an  
anti-Giuliani protester refused police orders to stop blocking a 
sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
	One question that became almost an afterthought in the flap  
remained unanswered: was the exhibit any good? 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some obviously shocking things,'' said patron  
Schneider. ``I thought some things were beautiful. But there was a 
lot of art that I wouldn't hang in my living room.''

<HEADLINE> Heir Searcher Has Lots to Ponder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINE CITY, Minn. (AP) -- A man who has promised to will his  
$375,000 estate to a church opened his living room on Saturday to 
ministers and lay people, hoping they could provide him answers to 
weighty theological questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton Goward, 79, hasn't decided which church will get the  
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Goward began his search for an heir with a personal ad in the  
Star Tribune of Minneapolis in July appealing for suggestions for 
what to do with his estate, since he's estranged from his three 
sons and divorced their mother long ago. Because of the news 
coverage that followed, he's received more than 40,000 pieces of 
mail since then, and he doesn't want any more. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, the 60-plus people who packed his sunny living  
room on a beautiful fall day were more interested in sharing their 
faith than getting his money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it really necessary to be born again?'' Goward asked. ``How  
can we KNOW the Bible is true? ... Why can't we KNOW instead of 
having to guess?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd -- heavy on Evangelicals and Pentecostalists -- was  
eager to help resolve his uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that you're questioning, Clayton, is a sign that God  
is working in your heart,'' said David Holt, a pastor from First 
Evangelical Free Church in La Crosse, Wis., whose sentiments were 
repeated by several others. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why isn't God here right now?'' Goward asked later.  
</P>
<P>
	``He is,'' nearly everyone responded in unison.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see him,'' Goward said.  
</P>
<P>
	Goward expressed frustration that there are so many religions  
and so many different interpretations of the Bible. The frustration 
was illustrated by the heated debate that broke out after Gary 
Amirault, who drove in from Hermann, Mo., disputed the existence of 
hell. The lengthy debate appeared to sway nobody, though Goward 
said he found it interesting. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Goward said he has some thinking to do.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to mull it over,'' he said as he helped himself to a  
plate of fried chicken, mashed potatoes and coleslaw. ``What I'm 
just going to have to do is believe. It's a faith thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And as for what to do with his money -- which is mostly tied up  
in his house and land -- he said he still has to think about that, 
too.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Faces Old Quandary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, having reshaped the balance  
of federal-state government power in recent years, begins its 
1999-2000 term Monday with several chances to fire fresh volleys in 
what some call a states' rights revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices also confront an old quandary -- public aid to  
religious schools -- and a new one close to home -- grandparents' 
right to see their grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into the new century, the court also is tackling  
disputes over tobacco regulation, automobile safety, anti-abortion 
demonstrations and limits on political contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-member court has been intact since 1994 and, despite  
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's recent colon cancer surgery, is not 
expected to undergo any change before the next presidential 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	Three cases will test the court's commitment to giving states  
more power at the federal government's expense -- a phenomenon 
Washington lawyer Charles Cooper calls ``the most noticeable 
development of the Rehnquist court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist has led the court since 1986.  
</P>
<P>
	``These cases address in differing ways a single political  
impulse -- to give more power to the states,'' said Steven Shapiro, 
legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. ``This year, 
the court's consideration of those questions comes even closer to 
core concerns of the civil rights community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The relationship between the federal government and the states --  
what constitutional scholars call federalism -- is not widely 
considered as politically volatile as abortion, religion and other 
topics that reach the nation's highest court. But the justices' 
view of that relationship defines in fundamental ways the ebb and 
flow of political power while affecting everyday American life. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices will use a Virginia case to decide whether Congress  
exceeded its authority in 1994 when it enacted a law allowing women 
who are raped or stalked to sue their attackers. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court threw out the law after ruling that  
Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce and assure equal 
protection for all citizens did not authorize it to give victims 
such a legal right. 
</P>
<P>
	A Florida case will determine whether state employees who say  
they are victims of age discrimination can make a federal case of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices must decide whether Congress, in passing the Age  
Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, wiped out the 11th 
Amendment immunity states enjoy against being sued in federal 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
	A South Carolina dispute over states' practice of selling  
personal information from driver's license records -- such as 
addresses and Social Security numbers -- focuses on Congress' power 
to require states to close motor vehicle records to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	The fate of a 1994 federal law, the Driver's Privacy Protection  
Act, hangs in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
	In a parochial-aid case from Louisiana, the justices must decide  
whether computers and other instructional materials paid for with 
taxpayer money can be lent to all private schools, including those 
with religious missions. 
</P>
<P>
	What the court says could become ``the most important  
church-state decision in over two decades,'' according to the Rev. 
Barry Lynn of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. 
The ruling also may determine the scope of federal efforts to 
connect every American classroom to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Two 1970s decisions limited such direct aid to the lending of  
textbooks, but today's court has, in other contexts, proved more 
tolerant of ties between government and religion. 
</P>
<P>
	A case from Washington state focuses on a state's power to  
provide grandparents with visitation rights even when the 
children's parents object. All 50 states provide such rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices -- six of whom are grandparents -- must decide  
whether such laws wrongly interfere with parents' right to rear 
their families without government interference. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration and tobacco industry square off  
before the court in a fight over smoking. The justices must decide 
whether the Food and Drug Administration can regulate tobacco by 
cracking down on cigarette sales to minors. 
</P>
<P>
	In another regulatory dispute, the court will decide whether  
people who own cars built before air bags became mandatory can sue 
automakers on grounds the safety devices could have saved them from 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices will decide whether Colorado went too far in  
limiting ``sidewalk counseling'' by anti-abortion demonstrators 
when it enacted a 1993 law that bars people from getting within 
eight feet of someone without consent when near a health clinic 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision likely will contain important new guidelines for  
other states and for communities nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	And the court will judge the constitutionality of Missouri's  
money limits on contributions to political candidates. The justices 
are being asked to use the case to reconsider the court's landmark 
1976 ruling that imposed a $1,000 limit on contributions to 
candidates for federal office. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the court has committed itself to deciding 44 cases by  
late June. Dozens more will be added in the coming months. The 
justices decided 75 cases during their last nine-month term, and 
rejected some 7,000 other appeals that reached them.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women Play South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Hundreds of young soccer fans swarmed the  
U.S. women's national team. They leaned over railings with 
outstretched hands, clutching posters, books and balls to get 
autographs from their World Cup heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	And this was only practice.  
</P>
<P>
	They were at Crew Stadium on Friday preparing to play South  
Korea in Sunday's U.S. Women's Cup. The stadium's 22,485 seats sold 
out in days for the doubleheader, which also features Finland and 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Later round U.S. Cup matches in Kansas City, Mo., and  
Louisville, Ky., also are expected to draw big audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	USA is the overwhelming favorite in the tournament and has a  
15-0-0 record in five previous competitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's game is the third for the U.S. women since winning the  
Women's World Cup title on July 10 at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	With a win, the U.S. team will record its 23rd victory of 1999  
and break the record set in 1998 for wins in a calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans are 22-2-2 this year with both losses and one of  
the ties coming against China. The Women's World Cup final counts 
as a draw in the official records. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the team's success on the field, its squeaky-clean  
image and several clever commercials have endeared the team to 
legions of fans. 
</P>
<P>
	With more than 80,000 tickets sold for the U.S. Cup, combined  
attendance for national team games in 1999 will pass 900,000 for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never in my wildest dreams did I think we would play in  
sellout stadiums like this and have crowds like we did this 
summer,'' said Mia Hamm, U.S. soccer's career scoring leader with 
111 goals and 89 assists. ``It's a great opportunity to connect 
with local kids and get them excited about their potential and what 
they can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm will rejoin the team after missing the 6-0 victory over  
Brazil on Sept. 26 in Denver due to a hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiffeny Milbrett said it's important for the team to reach out  
to their fans by signing every autograph and thanking everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we were these guy's age we really didn't have dreams to  
grab on to,'' said Milbrett, who leads the team in scoring this 
year with 19 goals and 11 assists. ``Kids can now dream big and if 
they want, they can be a national team player and an Olympian as 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Carusillo, of Dublin, Ohio, and his wife Natalie, said  
their daughters Noelle, 12, and Michelle, 10, have ``girl soccer 
fever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Their rooms are like shrines to Mia and teammate Christina  
Lilly,'' said Natalie Carusillo, who pulled her daughters out of 
school so they could attend Friday's practice. ``For them to have 
role models of the same gender seems to be a real big connection 
with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Carusillos said families will be tailgating in the parking  
lot on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just a sporting event, it's a family event,'' John  
Carusillo said.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Endorses Cardinals Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Tony La Russa is expected to sign a contract  
extension with the St. Louis Cardinals in the next few days, and 
Mark McGwire is a big supporter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not his fault we're playing the way we are,'' McGwire  
said. ``The media and the public's jumping on Tony and the coaching 
staff and they have nothing to do with it. It's the players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into the season finale the Cardinals are 74-86, their  
third losing record in La Russa's four years with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching injuries have hampered the team the last two years.  
This season the Cardinals lost two starters early and then their 
bullpen, expected to be a strength, collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	They've also been fundamentally sloppy and set a team record for  
strikeouts for the second time in three seasons with 1,201 -- 10 
more than in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire said none of it was La Russa's fault.  
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, he's the most well-prepared manager in the game,''  
McGwire said. ``He gets his players to play, and we've had a lot of 
things happen this year that weren't expected, and this is where we 
are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks La Russa has talked a lot about the future of  
the team, but not about his future with the team. He's said he 
doesn't want to detract from the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll wait till the end of the season,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	La Russa is in the final year of a contract that pays him $1.5  
million per season. General manager Walt Jocketty said the 
extension, for two or three years, will be finalized soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just haven't had a chance to sit down and work out the  
mechanics of the contract yet,'' Jocketty said. ``I'll let you know 
when we do it.''

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Test-Ban Vote Set for Oct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is promising an  
intense, if brief, campaign for Senate ratification of a nuclear 
test ban treaty, suggesting defeat could set back nuclear 
nonproliferation efforts around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	But supporters are not optimistic the campaign will produce the  
67 Senate votes needed for ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate leaders of both parties on Friday agreed to begin  
debating the 152-nation Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty next Friday, 
with a vote set for the following Tuesday, Oct. 12, setting aside 
18 hours for debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats reluctantly agreed to vote this month, after Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., suddenly announced he would 
schedule a vote -- after the treaty had remained bottled up for two 
years in the Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	After first balking, Democrats took Lott's take-it-or-leave-it  
offer after he agreed to delay the vote to Oct. 12 from Oct. 6, and 
agreed to eight more hours of debate than the 10 he initially 
proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel we have no choice,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom  
Daschle, D-S.D. ``This may be the best that we can get. ... We'll 
take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin stressed the  
importance of ratification, saying, ``The eyes of the world are on 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be in a far stronger position to insist that other  
countries do not go down the nuclear testing road if we ratify the 
treaty, '' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the treaty's case is made in ``a serious, sustained, and  
analytical way,'' there will be enough support to ratify it, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate supporters of the treaty were a less sanguine about  
the pact's chances of passage. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the senior Democrat on the Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee, suggested the outlook appeared bleak, 
but that at least the vote would force senators to go on the 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is: If you are going to die, do you want to die  
with no one knowing who shot you or do you want to go at least with 
the world knowing who killed you?'' Biden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the administration has said the test ban treaty should  
be nonpartisan, support for it in the Senate is almost entirely 
Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
	All 45 Democratic senators are expected to support it, but only  
two Republicans -- Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and James Jeffords 
of Vermont -- have endorsed it publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty, which calls for an outright ban on all nuclear  
testing, has been signed by 152 nations, including the United 
States. But it has been ratified by only 18 of the 44 countries 
with nuclear capabilities that must ratify it for it to take 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives contend the pact -- which also has not yet been  
ratified by Russia or China -- could threaten the U.S. ability to 
modernize its arsenal if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the United States already has a vast superiority  
in nuclear weapons, thanks to more than 1,000 nuclear tests during 
the Cold War, and the treaty would lock in that advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said the Armed Services  
Committee, which he chairs, will hold hearings on the treaty next 
week. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, 
R-N.C., has refused to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident that the Senate will vote to reject this  
dangerous arms control pact,'' Helms said Friday. ``The effect of 
this treaty would be to forever forbid the United States from 
testing its nuclear arsenal, while allowing the rogue nations of 
the world to proceed with their nuclear plans.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Stone Mazes Remain Mystery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- On a mild fall day, the wind skimming  
over the dune-colored flanks of the hills above Oakland makes the 
only sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Within this pastoral quiet lies a mystery -- a series of mazes  
laid out in soil and stone across the bottoms of sheltered canyons, 
their symmetry at odds with the rough-hewn setting. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazes have long been used to represent the mystical meaning of  
life. But the question raised by these earth-and-stone patterns is 
a bit more basic: Who put them there, and why? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know exactly when they were noticed. They just sort of  
came to our attention,'' said Ned MacKay, spokesman for the parks 
agency in charge of the Sibley Volcanic Regional Preserve, where 
the mazes are located. 
</P>
<P>
	Park officials believe one of the labyrinths was created in  
1989, marked across the floor of an old stone quarry by a San 
Francisco Bay sculptor and psychic. The other four then appeared in 
tucks and folds of the bald hills rimming the edges of Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Park policy forbids any rearranging of nature -- but the mazes  
are mostly left undisturbed. 
</P>
<P>
	``People seem to enjoy them so we're taking a laissez faire  
attitude,'' MacKay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stumbling upon the mazes for the first time can be an unsettling  
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiker Beth Elliott went looking for the labyrinths some years  
ago, but walked past them unaware until the day she decided to walk 
off the trail and peer over a fence set at the top of a volcanic 
cliff. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just appeared in front of me,'' she said. ``It was  
incredibly stunning, breathtaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She has become a frequent visitor, often tracing the narrow,  
intricate paths to their center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see it as making kind of an inward journey. When I finally  
tracked the place down ... it was around the time that I found that 
my father was dying,'' Elliott said. ``It seemed whenever I went up 
there it was as though walking around there, hiking around there, 
my point of view, my perspective, got lifted up. I was able to work 
through a lot of emotions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The labyrinths are simply made, marked out with lines of raised  
earth set with small rocks, less than a foot high, and range from 
50 feet to about 100 feet across. They are based on a medieval 
design used by New Agers, a single pathway looping toward the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the mazes are round, one is heart-shaped and another is  
a collection of small designs. 
</P>
<P>
	Letters, coins and trinkets are stuffed into rough stone shrines  
at their centers. 
</P>
<P>
	One handwritten message declared: ``Once in a while you can get  
shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some offerings are mystical, an incense stick, a tarot card.  
</P>
<P>
	``One time I could swear that someone had left some cremated  
remains,'' said Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
	Some are just strange, like the miniature Teletubby toy stuffed  
into old sweat socks. 
</P>
<P>
	Park employees occasionally clear out the shrines to keep the  
mementos from becoming litter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabina Magliocco, an assistant professor of anthropology at Cal  
State-Northridge, theorizes that some people feel compelled to 
leave a tangible symbol of their experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are using them for their own personal journeys and  
maybe they leave something of their own the way that you would 
leave a piece of yourself maybe as a token of thanks,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Magliocco gets ``a great sense of serenity'' when she visits,  
and likes the bit of mystery growing up around the mazes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that there's a folklore growing around these  
labyrinths,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> White House Aims To Save Test Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House launched ``a hurry up  
offense'' Saturday to save a global nuclear test ban treaty, racing 
to build support for the landmark agreement while accusing Senate 
Republicans of trying to kill it with an unexpectedly quick vote. 
</P>
<P>
	After two years of inaction and without any hearings on the  
treaty, Senate GOP leaders abruptly decided Thursday to hold a vote 
Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not what the Founding Fathers meant by advise and  
consent,'' Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, said in an 
interview Saturday. ``This is hit and run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration and its allies accused Republicans of rushing  
the vote in hopes of defeating the treaty. Democrats fear they are 
about 15 votes short of the 67 needed to ratify the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to build support, President Clinton will speak about the  
treaty Tuesday when he signs a major defense bill at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	To demonstrate military backing for the agreement, Clinton will  
gather testimonials Wednesday from former chairmen of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, former astronaut and Sen. John Glenn, and Nobel 
laureate physicists. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say the treaty is flawed, in part because it would  
not prevent countries such as North Korea, Iraq and Iran from 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it would put us in a weakened position  
internationally,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said 
Friday. ``But since there have been all these calls and demands for 
a vote, we have offered to vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, major treaties are debated at length in committee  
hearings before coming to a vote in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has not been one day of hearings,'' Berger said. ``This  
process has been short-circuited. We're dealing here with the most 
serious and sober matter that comes before the Senate and we have a 
hurry up offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty calls for an outright ban on all nuclear testing. It  
has been signed by 152 nations, including the United States but it 
has been ratified only by 47 countries, the most recent Bulgaria on 
Wednesday. More significantly, the treaty has been ratified by only 
23 of the 44 nuclear-capable countries that must ratify it for it 
to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
	To win ratification, the treaty requires approval by a  
two-thirds vote in the Senate. Even if all 45 Democrats support the 
treaty, 22 other Republicans must vote ``yes'' for it to be 
ratified. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Armed Services Committee will open three days of  
hearings on the treaty beginning Wednesday. The treaty normally 
would be considered by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee but 
its chairman, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., is one of its foremost 
opponents. Defense Secretary William Cohen and Gen. Henry H. 
Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, will present the 
administration's case. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen is cutting short a trip to Asia to return to Washington  
for a meeting Monday of Clinton's national security team. In 
Singapore, Cohen said Saturday that ratification of the treaty 
would send a strong signal to India and Pakistan, as well as other 
nations, to temper their nuclear ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
	A former Republican senator, Cohen said he wants ``to talk to  
former colleagues and ask them to keep an open mind.'' Shelton, 
also in Asia, may return early, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a verifiable treaty,'' Cohen said, adding that the United  
States has the technology to ensure nuclear tests are not 
conducted. 
</P>
<P>
	However, The Washington Post quoted unidentified senior  
officials as saying the Central Intelligence Agency has concluded 
in a new assessment of its capabilities that it cannot monitor 
low-level nuclear tests in Russia precisely enough to ensure 
compliance with the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper reported in Sunday's editions that the new assessment  
was shared with senior congressional staffers before Lott changed 
course and scheduled the treaty for an early vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Armed Services  
Committee and a treaty opponent, told the Post that new information 
on Russian testing activity will be made available to the Senate 
during briefings and hearings this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States stopped nuclear testing in 1992 and relies on  
supercomputer simulations to test the nuclear arsenal. ``This is 
about whether we can stop other countries from testing,'' Berger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the United States to say, `No,' we're going to go the  
other way, we're going to go in the direction of the nuclear 
testers, is crazy,'' Berger said.

<HEADLINE> Carter Celebrates 75th Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMERICUS, Ga. (AP) -- Wearing a tuxedo and his trademark toothy  
grin, former President Jimmy Carter was in a jovial mood as he 
celebrated his 75th birthday with about 800 well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad I made it,'' Carter quipped during Friday night's  
festivities. ``I've never had a better time in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The birthday bash at the historic Rylander Theatre in Americus,  
just 12 miles east of Carter's hometown of Plains, included 
performances by Pat Boone and the Indigo Girls, a giant birthday 
cake and healthy helpings of anecdotes about Carter's days in the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters filled the theater's 630 seats, while another 200 sat  
outside in a parking lot to enjoy the celebration on a giant 
television screen. 
</P>
<P>
	Joined by his wife, Rosalynn, at a news conference, Carter  
called his loss to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election 
his ``biggest failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At that time, I looked on it as an embarrassing failure,''  
Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could rationalize and say `If the hostages hadn't been held,  
I would have been re-elected,''' he said referring to the 1979 
crisis when Iranian students held 52 Americans hostage at the U.S. 
Embassy for more than a year. ``I had a lot of unfulfilled 
expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter said he's drawn strength from his religious beliefs.  
Apparent setbacks have consistently provided him with new 
opportunities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had ups and downs, but almost invariably the downs have  
become some of the most fortunate things in my life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As an example, Carter pointed to his work in founding the Carter  
Center after he left Washington. Since then, he's become known as 
the most active former president in modern U.S. history, monitoring 
elections worldwide, championing peace and human rights and working 
to improve living conditions in developing nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the speakers at the event were ABC television analyst Sam  
Donaldson and senior White House correspondent Helen Thomas of 
United Press International. Both covered Carter's campaign and 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	The party also served as a fund-raiser for the Rylander Theatre,  
which was built in 1921 as a cinema, closed in disrepair in 1951 
and was reopened this summer after $4 million in refurbishments.

<HEADLINE> Free Vacation Wins at Woodbine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Free Vacation, who won the Breeders' Stakes, the  
third leg of Canada's thoroughbred triple crown last August, 
returned to racing Saturday with a victory in the $183,925 Wonder 
Where Stakes, the third leg in the Canadian filly triple tiara, at 
Woodbine Race Track. 
</P>
<P>
	Free Vacation, ridden by Laurie Gulas, placed herself at the top  
of the 3-year-old filly class with the five-length win over 
Synchronized. Twinkle Creek finished third. 
</P>
<P>
	The bay daughter of Fly So Free -- owned by Roger Attfield, Bill  
Werner and Mickey and Phyllis Canino -- had a dream trip over the 1 1/4 
miles on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
	Gulas sent Free Vacation to the front early and held a  
two-length lead before Synchronized, ridden by Tyrone Harding, made 
a bid for the lead on the final turn. 
</P>
<P>
	But Free Vacation drew away in the stretch to win in 2:08.78  
over a course listed as yielding. 
</P>
<P>
	``She broke really well today and that's what put me on the  
lead,'' Gulas said. ``She has natural speed and we didn't get to 
show last time (in the Breeders'). 
</P>
<P>
	``This time, it was a clean break and she just galloped around.  
She's an awesome filly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The win, worth $115,873, increased Free Vacation's career  
earnings to $452,694.

<HEADLINE> Extent of Floyd Damage Unknown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Dangerous bacteria and chemicals flushed  
into North Carolina waterways by Hurricane Floyd's disastrous flood 
haven't caused widespread health problems, but long-term 
environmental damage remains to be seen, state officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, there are relatively few reports of cholera,  
mosquito-borne diseases or other illness from contact with polluted 
water or mud -- even as thousands of people return to homes they 
evacuated when Floyd dumped up to 20 inches of rain last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely a silver lining. It's one of the few items of  
good news we've received,'' said Johanna Reese, a spokeswoman for 
the state Division of Environmental Health. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, flood waters continued to threaten low-lying  
communities as rain from storms this week caused rivers to crest 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government expects to buy up to 10,000 homes in an  
effort to move residents and businesses off flood plains. ``It will 
be our worst flood disaster in the Southeast ever,'' said Todd 
Davison with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the state, the flood inundated 23 municipal sewage  
treatment plants and more than 50 livestock waste lagoons, flushing 
out thousands of gallons of bacteria-laden waste. The carcasses of 
thousands of drowned livestock will pose health risks until they 
are incinerated or buried. 
</P>
<P>
	Chemicals and petroleum products leaked from gas stations,  
junkyards, farms and chemical plants. As the pollutants are carried 
downstream to the Atlantic, fish will likely die. 
</P>
<P>
	The extent of the damage may not be known for weeks, said Larry  
Cahoon, a biological science professor at the University of North 
Carolina at Wilmington who inspected the mouth of the Cape Fear 
River on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awful brown out there. The crew of the ship told me  
they've never seen it that bad,'' said Cahoon, who estimates the 
brown water has spread across 200 square miles of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Water contaminated by bacteria from feces could cause  
gastrointestinal diseases, and dehydration from severe vomiting or 
diarrhea could be fatal for young children, the elderly and people 
with weakened immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
	However, samples taken from more than 100 inland sites show  
levels of fecal coliform bacteria are a lot lower than expected, 
said Ernie Seneca, a state spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Chemical pollutants have been diluted by the huge volumes of  
water left by Floyd, said Dan Thornton, an emergency response 
coordinator for the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollutants include mercury and chromium spilled from at least  
six industrial sites, said Bill Meyer, the state's top hazardous 
waste regulator. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with chemical spills, half of 51 sites visited by state  
inspectors had damage to underground fuel storage tanks, Meyer 
said. About 1,550 service stations and oil distributors were 
flooded, and some 20,000 tanks holding home heating oil or other 
fuel haven't been checked, Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, dirty-brown water stood waist-deep in parts of  
Kinston. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still in a crisis,'' said Reginald Lee, a Lenoir County  
emergency management spokesman. Two hundred businesses and 
thousands of homes were flooded in the county. 
</P>
<P>
	Clyde Cox, 77, a retired municipal worker, sloshed through his  
Kinston yard in hip waders, wearing a white surgical mask to block 
the rotten stench. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time it's ever been in the yard in 30 years,''  
said Cox, who had no flood insurance. ``All the flooding we've had, 
it's the first time. Any help I can get, I sure would appreciate 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Surge Continues in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Democrat Bill Bradley has a 51 percent to 32  
percent lead over Republican Gov. George W. Bush of Texas among 
potential New York voters, according to a statewide poll released 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll from the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute found  
Bush in a statistical dead heat with Vice President Al Gore among 
New York voters surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Bradley and Gore remained in a statistical tie among  
New York Democrats, the momentum appeared to be in Bradley's favor 
on that front as well. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest survey, 44 percent of Democrats said they favored  
the former senator from New Jersey while 41 percent backed the vice 
president. A Quinnipiac poll from early August had Gore leading 
Bradley, 47 percent to 38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll released two weeks ago by the Hamden, Conn.-based  
pollsters had Bradley leading Bush, 47 percent to 37 percent, with 
Bush and Gore statistically tied. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad news for Bush and Gore came on the eve of new forays  
into New York for both. Bush, the Republican front-runner, is to 
fly across upstate New York on Monday with New York Gov. George 
Pataki, a potential running mate. Gore is to visit the Albany area 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush's slip is showing as he prepares to introduce  
himself to New York voters,'' Maurice Carroll, director of the 
Quinnipiac polling institute, said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York is considered a must-win state for Democrats if they  
are to retain the White House and the state's early March 7 primary 
gives it added importance. 
</P>
<P>
	With Bradley gaining ground in key early primary states like New  
York and New Hampshire, and raising money faster than the vice 
president, Gore announced Wednesday that he was revamping his 
campaign and moving it from Washington to Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said ``the last thing we're  
going to do is take anything for granted,'' he said the poll 
``represents the progress we've been making in New York.'' Hauser 
said the poll ``reflects the feeling that Democrats want a nominee 
who can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Peter Ragone said, ``We're in a tough campaign in  
Bradley's backyard and Al Gore knows it. But he's taking this 
campaign to the grassroots, working his heart and soul out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest Quinnipiac telephone poll of 1,049 registered New  
York voters was conducted Sept. 24-30 and has a margin of error of 
plus or minus 3 percentage points. The polling based on the sample 
of 452 registered Democrats has a margin of error of plus or minus 
5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Quinnipiac poll also indicated that New Yorkers are looking  
less favorably on the vice president than they did just a few weeks 
ago. While Gore was rated favorably by 31 percent of New York 
voters in early August, that slipped to 24 percent in the latest 
poll. Bush's favorability rating was also down slightly.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Plans New Industrial Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea's richest man said  
Saturday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Il has personally 
approved his plan to build a large-scale industrial park in the 
reclusive communist country. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung Ju-yung, founder and honorary chairman of the Hyundai  
group, made the remarks upon returning from an extended five-day 
visit to North Korea, during which he met the country's top leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung's trip, originally scheduled for three days, was extended  
by two days for a meeting with Kim on Friday. Chung said his 
meeting with Kim at the latter's countryside resort also covered 
other subjects, but he declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He basically has accepted our proposal to build an industrial  
park there,'' Chung said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai plans to relocate 800 to 900 garment and other plants to  
the industrial park on North Korea's southwest coast, close to the 
border with South Korea, and use surplus South Korean electricity 
for the factories. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan also includes construction of car assembly lines with  
an annual capacity of 50,000, as well as television and other 
electronic assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung said the North Korean leader looked healthy and tanned.  
</P>
<P>
	Relations between the two Koreas remain largely frozen because  
of political and military tensions. They are still technically at 
war, having signed no peace treaty at the end of the 1950-53 Korean 
War.

<HEADLINE> Farm Aid Spurs Look at New Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It is harvest time again, and Congress is  
passing another multibillion-dollar bailout to keep farmers in 
business. Many lawmakers say it also is time to find a cheaper, 
more effective way to support farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea getting the most attention is a new subsidy program  
proposed by Rep. Charles Stenholm of Texas, the senior Democrat on 
the House Agriculture Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	His plan would provide payments to farmers when prices for crops  
fall significantly below average. The size of the checks would be 
tied to local crop yields. The idea is to guarantee farmers a 
minimum level of income each year, and ensure the cash goes to 
farmers, not landowners, as some subsidies now do. 
</P>
<P>
	``The payments would go directly to actual producers in time of  
need,'' Stenholm said. ``It's the kind of long-term approach we 
should be using to address agriculture's cyclical problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 ``Freedom to Farm'' law was supposed to wean growers  
from their dependence on government programs. But market prices 
collapsed last year and economists see little improvement ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers rushed out $6 billion in emergency relief last fall,  
and the Senate is expected to give final approval this week to $8.7 
billion more. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our current farm law doesn't provide the necessary safety net  
for our producers,'' said Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo. Stenholm's 
plan deserves ``close scrutiny,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law provides growers with crop subsidies that are tied  
to fluctuations in prices, not yields, and fixed ``market 
transition'' payments that decline each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Groups such as the National Farmers Union that think the  
government should do more to assist smaller-scale farms are 
interested in Stenholm's idea because it would provide more 
protection when prices are low or crops are poor. 
</P>
<P>
	The much bigger American Farm Bureau Federation and others like  
Stenholm's plan because it would not require controls on 
production, a key feature of the Depression-era farm policy 
Congress tossed out in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like an idea that has strong possibility and merit,''  
said Dick Newpher, executive director of the Farm Bureau's 
Washington office. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Agriculture Committee chairman, Republican Larry  
Combest of Texas, also has expressed interest. He plans a 
comprehensive review of government farm programs next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman wanted to use something like  
Stenholm's plan to distribute $5.5 billion in emergency relief 
included in the latest bailout. Farm groups balked at that 
suggestion because they feared it would delay the assistance. 
Instead, the money will go to recipients of the market transition 
checks, some of whom are not farming anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Stenholm's plan, which was originally proposed by economists at  
the Agriculture Department and Ohio State University in the early 
1990s, is not without its critics. 
</P>
<P>
	The payments could worsen the worldwide grain glut by  
encouraging farmers to plant crops in areas where they do not do 
well, such as parts of Stenholm's west Texas district, said Neil 
Harl, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University. The 1996 
farm law was designed to do just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
	Harl, who believes the government should go back to controlling  
production and paying farmers to hold grain off the market, said 
the law is ``fatally flawed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., wonders where the government would get  
the money for Stenholm's payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, ranking Democrat on the House  
agricultural appropriations subcommittee, is concerned that the 
program could wind up steering still more farm subsidies to Texas 
to the detriment of other regions.

<HEADLINE> Trotting Triple Crown Winner Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, Pa. (AP) -- Super Bowl, the most recent and only living  
winner of the Trotting Triple Crown, died Saturday from 
complications of old age at Hanover Shoe Farm. He was 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Super Bowl won the Trotting Triple Crown in 1972, including the  
prestigious Hambletonian. He had 38 wins in 51 lifetime starts with 
winnings of $600,156. 
</P>
<P>
	He was trained and driven by Stanley Dancer and owned during his  
racing career by Dancer's wife Rachel and Rose Hild Farm. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting in 1973, Super Bowl sired more than 1,400 racehorses  
who won $75.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of his sons, Speed Bowl (1982), Probe (1989), American  
Winner (1993) and Tagliabue (1995) also won the Hambletonian. 
</P>
<P>
	Super Bowl was a favorite with visitors to Hanover Shoe Farm  
because of his gregarious personality and appetite for food treats 
of any kind.

	AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo. (AP) -- Air Force baseball coach Joe  
Giarratano, who led the Falcons to their best winning percentage in 
four years, has been fired after one season, academy officials 
confirmed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force spokeswoman Helen Littlejohn verified Giarratano's  
firing but said she could not give any other details. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Giarratano, Air Force went 19-32 last year for a .372

finished 5-20 in the Western Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Giarratano, a Denver native, came to Air Force in 1998 after  
spending four seasons as the head coach at Mesa State, which went 
141-85 under him and advanced to the NCAA Division II West 
Regionals in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to his stint at Mesa State, Giarratano went 189-90 as the  
head coach at Colby (Kan.) Junior College. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Aims to Reunite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top Reform Party officials worked Saturday to  
coax a splinter group of their own to return. But organizers of the 
split said they first needed guarantees that Republican 
presidential candidate Pat Buchanan would not become the party's 
nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The presidential candidate of the Reform Party is almost the  
single hinge that will bring us back together,'' Ted Muga, chairman 
of the splinter group known as the American Reform Party, said at a 
meeting of 100 supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would never associate ourselves with any organization in  
which a person like that whose religious, political or moral views 
are of his nature,'' Muga said of Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sure would be nice to have ya'll back,'' implored Jack  
Gargan, chairman-elect of the Reform Party. ``We've got to put 
aside those things we disagree on.'' On a possible Buchanan run, 
Gargan said he had to remain ``neutral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The efforts to reunify came as the party dealt with another  
brouhaha involving comments made by Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, 
the Reform Party's top elected official, in an interview with 
Playboy magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, whose frank talk got him elected in a November upset,  
told Playboy that organized religious ``is a sham,'' the Navy 
Tailhook scandal was ``much ado about nothing'' and fat people 
``can't push away from the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On being governor, he said: ``It's good to be king.''  
</P>
<P>
	Reform Party chairman Russell Verney demanded Friday that  
Ventura resign from the party, saying the former professional 
wrestler ``brought shame'' to himself. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gargan told the American Reform Party leaders Saturday,  
``Let's cut him some slack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not ready to throw him out the party,'' Gargan said. He  
added: ``I'm not letting him off the hook. I think he's learned a 
very valuable lesson from it. I think we need to judge him by what 
he has done as governor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, former Connecticut Gov. Lowell Weicker, who is weighing  
running for the Reform Party presidential nomination, seemed to 
take a jab at Ventura telling delegates, ``Whether of our making or 
not, the current flamboyance, zaniness and brouhahas reflect on all 
of us as independents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterwards, when asked by reporters if he was referring to  
Ventura, Weicker said, ``I went out of my way not to mention names. 
I don't want to do that. But hey . . . if the shoe fits wear it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates, however, did not seem too disturbed about Ventura.  
Instead, they were more concerned over the Reform Party's possible 
candidates for president, Muga said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura is trying to head off the possible candidacy of the  
conservative Buchanan, who may leave the GOP for a Reform Party 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura has urged real estate tycoon Donald Trump to run, but  
aides said Saturday he also would be open to Weicker. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump, who spoke with the group Friday night and had political  
operatives mingling with delegates, is probably not a viable 
candidate for the party, Muga said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reaction (to Trump) was very unreceptive on a number of  
issues,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump is expected to announce a decision in December. Weicker  
said he would make up his mind this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Perot has not ruled out a third presidential race,  
although members of the American Reform party already have voiced 
opposition. Perot and Buchanan are expected to talk soon by 
telephone about Buchanan's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan plans to announce his intentions by mid-October.

	Pound led an inquiry which led to the expulsion or resignation  
of 10 IOC members in connection with gifts, cash, college 
scholarships and other favors accepted by members and their 
families during the Salt Lake City bid. 
</P>
<P>
	A report submitted to Congress last month detailed a similar  
pattern of gift-giving during the Atlanta bid. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pound, attending an IOC executive board meeting in Athens,  
said: ``I don't believe there's anything in that report that would 
lead to any further action against any members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said the IOC would rely on the findings of its new ethics  
commission, which announced last week it would review the Atlanta 
report for any possible misconduct by IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound complained that no IOC members were contacted to give  
their version of events before the Atlanta report, prepared by 
former Attorney General Griffin Bell, was made public. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report detailed a lot of offers that were pushed upon IOC  
members and were not accepted,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., has said the report showed ``votes  
were for sale'' and said the Atlanta bid was surrounded by a 
``culture of corruption.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Upton has scheduled a House hearing on the Atlanta bid Oct. 14  
and requested that IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch appear as a 
witness. He has threatened to subpoena Samaranch if he declines to 
testify voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC director general Francois Carrard said Samaranch was  
expected to announce Sunday whether he would go to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the pressures from Congress, IOC members are  
reluctant to travel to the United States because they could face 
questioning by the FBI in connection with its Salt Lake City 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a concern on the part of some of the members,'' Pound  
said. ``They don't understand how the Justice Department and the 
FBI works. They're nervous.''

<HEADLINE> Poor Workers Grope for Prosperity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- Like it or not, Andrea Cooper is doing  
her bit to fuel the economic boom. She is 3 months old and heading 
to a day-care program so her mother can replace welfare payments 
with a $6.75-an-hour hospital paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be tough,'' says Tonya Cooper, single mother of  
Andrea and three older children. ``I feel bad leaving her so young, 
but I truly believe God is not going to put my children in the way 
of any harm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is nothing new about poverty in America. But never before  
have poor families like the Coopers had to wage their daily 
struggles amid such pervasive chatter about unprecedented 
prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	While the wealthy grow steadily richer riding the stock market  
surges, millions of working Americans grope for their infinitesimal 
share of the boom. 
</P>
<P>
	Many have been forced off welfare as part of nationwide reforms;  
others are victims of layoffs or lack the skills now in demand. 
Wages often are too meager to allow self-sufficiency; work is often 
grueling or mind-numbing, on night shifts, without health insurance 
or other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cooper and other hard-pressed Wilkes-Barre residents sound  
more fatalistic than angry as they discuss their lives. But 
anti-poverty workers in the city of 48,000 express outrage on their 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Sister Marie Larkin, a Roman Catholic nun who came from Ireland  
to Pennsylvania nine years ago, is still shocked that such a 
prosperous nation is home to such widespread poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	``The CEOs of these companies are making millions,'' she says.  
``They're making it because some poor worker is earning a pittance 
... I think it's criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sister Larkin, who runs a shelter for disadvantaged women, has  
compared experiences with friends working in the impoverished 
African country of Zambia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the poor here are in a worse situation,'' she says.  
``In Zambia, they don't know what they're missing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Decades ago, Wilkes-Barre was a thriving city in northeast  
Pennsylvania's coal belt. As the mines gradually closed, the 
jobless rate rose. Then it soared into double-digits after many 
manufacturers -- notably in the garment industry -- pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
	More than eight years into the national economic boom,  
Wilkes-Barre has gradually whittled its jobless rate to 5.7 
percent, the lowest this decade although well above the national 
rate of 4.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Civic leaders herald the new jobs as evidence of a turnaround,  
but many are low-level service jobs in health care, retailing and 
telemarketing that pay less than $7 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not family-sustaining jobs,'' says Joe Capece, an  
official of an electrical workers union and the regional trade 
union council. ``We've got to have jobs that people could raise a 
family on, buy a house on. Instead, you're asking people to live in 
poverty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capece echoes a complaint heard often around Wilkes-Barre: Some  
retailers and other employers were hiring people to work 30 to 34 
hours a week, just under the 35-hour limit needed for workers to 
qualify for the benefits of full-time status. Nationally, according 
to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 3.2 million people involuntarily 
work at part-time jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkes-Barre used to be a labor stronghold, but union strength  
has ebbed with the loss of manufacturing jobs. Local figures 
closely mirror the national trend: Union members now comprise about 
14 percent of the American workforce, compared with 20 percent in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the unionized manufacturing jobs lost in Wilkes-Barre  
paid twice as much as the new service jobs. Some major 
service-sector employers, such as Wal-Mart and McDonald's, have 
resisted union organizing efforts nationwide with almost total 
success. ``People are scared to organize,'' Capece says. 
</P>
<P>
	A worker like Jay Miscavage doesn't have a chance to contemplate  
union membership. Homeless, and gaunt from a 25-pound weight loss, 
Miscavage has been taking temporary jobs, skimping on meals and 
sleeping in his pickup in motel parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm lucky I've got a truck,'' he says. ``The guys I'm working  
with are sleeping in the woods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miscavage, 39, discusses his predicament after finishing a  
serving of pizza at the St. Vincent de Paul Kitchen, a storefront 
charity meal program in a rundown section of downtown. The kitchen 
serves 300 to 400 lunches daily, up from less than 100 a decade 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks during the summer, Miscavage resisted going to the  
kitchen even though he was nearly broke. ``I felt there were people 
who deserved the food more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What changed his mind? ``I was hungry,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	Miscavage worked for 12 years as a landscaper, earning $12 an  
hour -- good by local standards -- but he was unhappy with his boss 
and quit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I'd be able to find something better, but it didn't  
work out that way,'' he says, describing recent temporary jobs that 
paid barely above the $5.15-an-hour minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say the economy is going up, but you have to work for  
$5.50 an hour,'' he says. ``You can't save nothing. It's the rich 
that get richer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics support Miscavage's gripe. Recent figures from the  
Congressional Budget Office show that the poorest 20 percent of 
U.S. households will average $8,800 in after-tax income this year, 
down from $10,000 in 1977, while at the same time the average 
income of the richest 1 percent has more than doubled to $515,600 
after taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jared Bernstein, an economist with the Economic Policy  
Institute, a Washington think tank, says the trends in Wilkes-Barre 
reflect worrisome national problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a place where blue-collar guys in the past could find  
decent middle-class jobs,'' he says. ``The quality of the jobs 
they've lost are obviously far superior to the jobs that are being 
created.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the boom, the nation has lost 1 million manufacturing  
jobs in the past decade. Average pay for top executives has 
quadrupled since 1990, but roughly 45 million Americans --including 
many in low-paid service jobs -- lack health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with health-care coverage, child care and transportation  
are often cited in Wilkes-Barre as the toughest challenges facing 
low-income workers. The city bus system doesn't run at night, 
making it difficult for workers without cars to handle nightshift 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who do work at night, or attend night school, have created  
a need for off-hour child care. The Catholic Youth Center has 
extended its day-care program from 5:30 p.m. until midnight and may 
operate round-the-clock. 
</P>
<P>
	``The parents are really grateful,'' says Laura Bozinski, the  
center's director of child care. Nap-time in the evening session 
starts at 9 p.m., and the kids often are sound asleep when their 
parents collect them. 
</P>
<P>
	For single mothers targeted by welfare reform programs, child  
care can be a huge obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
	Nikiki Blake, 28, has five children, ages 2 to 11. She is now  
surviving solely on child-support payments after going off welfare, 
quitting a low-paying job as a nursing assistant, and failing to 
find other work that would mesh with family demands. 
</P>
<P>
	She is glad to have escaped the bureaucratic regimen of welfare  
yet is pessimistic about the chances of completing one more year of 
school that would qualify her as a registered nurse. 
</P>
<P>
	Welfare officials often lack patience, she says. ``They want you  
to take the first little crummy job that comes along. But $6 an 
hour is not going to cut it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The one good thing about not being on welfare is there's no  
one on your back,'' she says. ``But it's also a struggle if you're 
off welfare ... . Unless you find somebody rich to marry or win the 
lottery, it's really hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Pennsylvania's welfare reform program was enacted in early  
1997, the number of families receiving cash assistance in 
Wilkes-Barre's Luzerne County has dropped from 3,157 to 1,589. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Pennsylvania's welfare department, Jay Pagni,  
says the state recognizes the need to train former recipients for 
better jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Wilkes-Barre, there are relatively few semiskilled jobs  
that pay more than $9 an hour. Anti-poverty advocates say that's 
the minimum needed in the region for a single parent with one child 
to be self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	Sister Larkin tells of one single mother from her shelter who  
proudly got off welfare and took a restaurant job that produced a 
combination of wages and tips far too meager to support her family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said to her, 'Forget it. You can't do this. Go back on  
welfare until you can get a better job,''' Sister Larkin recalls. 
</P>
<P>
	``You shouldn't have to put up with such conditions,'' the nun  
says. ``But the poor seem to have no voice anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Brady, head of a Luzerne County anti-poverty organization  
called the Commission on Economic Opportunity, is a daily witness 
to the consequences of low-wage jobs. But he says there is little 
use blaming the employers, since they generally adjust their wages 
up or down based on the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady expresses hope that Wilkes-Barre's labor market will  
tighten enough so employers will have to offer higher wages to 
attract workers. In the meantime, he worries about the toll on 
families when parents have to work two jobs or on night shifts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who's left out of this?'' he asks. ``It may be the children.  
Are they getting the nurturing they need? Are they getting proper 
nutrition?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tonya Cooper asks herself those same questions as she braces for  
the working-day separation from little Andrea. The new hospital job 
also requires Ms. Cooper to work every other weekend, so she must 
find someone to keep an eye on her three school-age children on 
those days. 
</P>
<P>
	To fulfill her dream of completing a college degree at night,  
Ms. Cooper will eventually have to decide whether to spend even 
more time away from her children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get frustrated a lot of times,'' she says, softly and  
calmly. ``It seems like it's so hard to get ahead. And when you 
finally are succeeding, you get knocked down. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to get out there and be motivated and try to get what  
you want. I'm doing the best that I can.''

<HEADLINE> Rockies' Leyland Unemotional Finale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Jim Leyland wept openly April 17 when the Colorado  
Rockies presented him with his 1,000th managerial victory. He 
doesn't expect a similar flow of emotion Sunday when he carries out 
his final lineup card before the Rockies' game against the San 
Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure there are going to be some moments where I have a  
tough time, but I think everybody is tired at the end of the season 
whether teams are going good or bad,'' Leyland said. ``The way I'll 
look at it is the season is over and I'm going home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland, 54, who signed a three-year $6 million contract to  
manage the Rockies on Oct. 5, 1998, will end his 11-year managerial 
career Sunday. Going into Saturday's game against the Giants, he 
had a 1,066-1,127 record with Pittsburgh, Florida and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	After much speculation surrounding his future with the Rockies,  
he told his players Sept. 6 that he wouldn't be returning in 2000. 
Leyland admitted he would miss the regimen he'd become accustomed 
to, but was elusive about his future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am hoping to stay in the game, but I don't know when that's  
going to happen or if that's going to happen,'' he said. ``It will 
be different going home knowing I won't be planning spring training 
for the first time in 15 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland and Colorado ownership have discussed a role with the  
team, but none of the talk has resulted in anything of substance. 
He acknowledged Saturday that finding a position probably wasn't a 
high priority of newly hired general manager Dan O'Dowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan's got so many things to do to get all his soldiers in  
order for next year,'' Leyland said. ``I'm not sure it's best for 
me to stay in the organization or just move on. I remember when 
they offered a job to Don Baylor and he said he felt strange about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I want to tag along. I'm not sure whether it  
is not best for everybody to make a new start and turn the page.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing is certain: Leyland is leaving the game to be closer  
to his family. He never moved his family from Pittsburgh and lived 
at Coors Field after converting a conference room into an 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to spend time with my family,'' Leyland said. ``I was  
home on Easter Sunday maybe once or twice in the last 14 or 15 
years, make that 30 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland's Marlins won the World Series in 1997 and his Pirates  
won three division titles. None rank as his No. 1 accomplishment of 
becoming a major league manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact I never played in the big leagues and was able to get  
over the minor league syndrome,'' said Leyland, who signed with the 
Detroit Tigers Sept. 21, 1963, but never played above Double A from 
1964-69. ``I think to get over that syndrome and earn the respect 
of most of the players, that's No. 1 for me. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an honor to get the job with the Pirates and the chance  
to take a team to the playoffs and the World Series. I'll always 
appreciate that I got that chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland also is proud of his relationship with Barry Bonds.  
</P>
<P>
	``I love Barry and we had a great relationship,'' Leyland said.  
``We were two people that demanded respect for one another and gave 
it to each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barry was a gifted player and it took me a while to earn his  
respect. I was from the era of his dad (Bobby), but his dad was a 
star major leaguer and I was a minor league guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of his teams, Leyland rated the Pirates of the early '90s and  
the 1997 Marlins as his favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had all of the pieces together in Pittsburgh and were very  
good and had a chance to be very good for a long time,'' Leyland 
said. ``The Florida team was the best team in baseball at the end 
and you can't take that away because we beat the Atlanta Braves 
10-out-of-12 in the regular season and 4-of-6 in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still bothered by people that accused us of buying a World  
Series. We had all the players in place, but nobody picked us to 
win in spring training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland listed Bonds, Kirk Gibson, Andy Van Slyke and Kevin  
Brown among the greatest players he's managed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Bonds was one of the greatest players to play the game  
and Gibson was unbelievable at rising to the occasion,'' Leyland 
said. ``Larry Walker was the most instinctive I've managed. Kevin 
Brown, Jack Morris, Doug Drabek ... but my favorite was Bob Walk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bob would always take the ball and do whatever he was asked to  
do.''

<HEADLINE> Strategy Aims To Starve Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The biggest thing in cancer is this little  
four-word sentence: Tumors make blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not as obvious as it sounds.  
</P>
<P>
	For a long time, doctors assumed that spreading cancer makes do  
with the blood supply already in place. But no. Now they know that 
cancer grows its own. 
</P>
<P>
	This biologic insight has turned out to be among the precious  
few that opens an entirely new strategy for controlling a human 
ill. In the past two or three years, the discovery has become the 
starting point for the most studied, the most tested, and 
absolutely the most talked about endeavor in all of cancer 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	If it leads where scientists hope -- and where drug companies are  
placing big research bets -- then it should be possible to stop 
cancerous tumors by blocking their ability to launch the fresh 
blood vessels needed for survival. To kill a cancer, the thinking 
goes, starve it. 
</P>
<P>
	At this point, no one knows if it will work. But cancer experts  
say they cannot remember a time when there has been so much 
enthusiasm for a new approach to treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea has taken more than 30 years to evolve from the  
universally scoffed-at brainstorm of Harvard surgeon Judah Folkman. 
Now it is an enterprise being chased by dozens of companies, 
ranging from the biggest pharmaceutical makers to one-idea 
startups. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 20 drugs that block the growth of blood vessels are in  
various stages of testing on people with cancer. More are nearly 
ready for testing. At the National Cancer Institute, Dr. James 
Pluda guesses that literally hundreds of other potential ones are 
in development. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's considered one of the hottest areas in all of medicine,  
not just cancer,'' he says. ``I'm not aware of any drug company, 
big or small, that is not working in this field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cancerous tumors rely on the construction of new blood vessels --  
a process scientists call angiogenesis -- to bring in oxygen and 
nutrients. Without this blood supply, they never grow larger than a 
pinhead. The question is whether any of the drugs in the works can 
thwart this basic biological process and thereby cure cancer, or at 
least stop it from spreading. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason so many companies are interested in this is the  
possibility -- and I emphasize possibility -- that it will be broadly 
applicable to all tumor types,'' says Dr. Susan Hellmann, 
development director at Genentech. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, if all kinds of cancer need new blood vessels,  
then one drug that interrupts this process might be good against 
all of them. With this in mind, drugs such as Sugen's experimental 
blood vessel blocker, SU5416, are being tested against cancers all 
over the body, including the colon, lung, kidney, ovaries, breast 
and skin. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-four separate studies are under way with this one drug  
alone. It's even being tested against cancers of the blood, on the 
theory that even this malignancy requires the growth of fresh blood 
vessels in the bone marrow, where the cancer starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``These could be huge drugs, almost like the Holy Grail,'' says  
Peter Hirth, Sugen's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors explaining their enthusiasm for this approach usually  
start by rhapsodizing over its elegant scientific underpinnings, 
worked out by Folkman and others who joined the field later. Then 
they mention the exceptionally promising experiments on rats and 
mice, in which tumors stop growing, shrivel up, even disappear . 
Finally, they get around to the miracles. 
</P>
<P>
	These amazing stories, the against-all-odds recoveries of people  
at death's door, are the most gripping and yet ephemeral of all the 
evidence in this young field. Most of the new compounds are in such 
early stages of testing, and their study subjects are so riddled 
with cancer, that no one can say with confidence whether the drugs 
do any good at all. 
</P>
<P>
	But a few of the terminally ill volunteers in these last-ditch  
experiments have suddenly gotten better. Even skeptics who have 
watched cancer breakthroughs come and go cannot help being 
intrigued. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most of those who have tried the new drugs, Clayton Twigg  
had failed all standard treatments and was dying. He had a rare and 
extremely aggressive form of thyroid cancer that had spread into 
his chest. At one point, his neck grew so big there was no 
indentation between chin and chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Unwilling to give up, Twigg volunteered for an experimental  
blood vessel blocker at University of Hospitals of Cleveland. In 
February, he became the eighth patient in a study of the safety of 
combretastatin, made by Oxigene. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the second treatment, bingo! The tumor had started to  
shrink,'' said Twigg, 56, an engineer from Westlake, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of six treatments, doctors could no longer see the  
growth on scans. In August, they decided to operate. But when they 
looked around his thyroid for remaining traces of cancer, there 
were none. 
</P>
<P>
	The news, though obviously good, does not mean Twigg has been  
cured. Undetectable cancer may lurk somewhere in his body. Still, 
his doctors say they have never heard of such a dramatic remission 
at Twigg's stage of this particular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, those who follow drug testing are reluctant to  
make too much of stories like this. Cancer is not an entirely 
predictable disease; people sometimes get better for no apparent 
reason. Furthermore, despite being terminally ill, those admitted 
to drug studies are often healthier than run-of-the-mill cancer 
patients, so they respond better to novel therapies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to give the impression this is a cure-all, the  
silver bullet for cancer,'' says Dr. Scott Remick, who heads 
Twigg's study. ``But there's no doubt this patient has had a very 
significant response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twigg takes part in what's called a Phase One study. It is  
limited to a few patients and is intended to see how much of the 
drug can be given safely. The next stage often includes more 
patients and tests whether the drug has any effect on the tumor. 
But true proof of combretastatin's value must await Phase Three, 
the large, costly comparison study in which hundreds of patients 
are randomly assigned to get the drug or dummy shots, then followed 
for a year or two to see if the treatment makes them live longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the time it takes to carry drugs through these levels  
of testing, many believe it will be four or five years before the 
value of the blood vessel stoppers becomes clear. 
</P>
<P>
	The two highest profile candidates in this field are drugs  
called endostatin and angiostatin that have not even entered Phase 
One. Last year, an optimistically worded article in The New York 
Times (deletearticle) quoted scientists predicting that these 
drugs, discovered by Harvard's Folkman, could become a cure for 
cancer within two years. As cancer fighters, they appear to be 
especially powerful, at least in mice and rats, the only test 
subjects so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Folkman and others pointed out that cancer is infinitely harder  
to cure in people than it is in the inbred strains of rodents that 
serve as scientists' drug proving ground. Nevertheless, the stock 
of EntreMed, the small biotech firm developing Folkman's drugs, 
shot from $12 a share to $85 the day after the story ran. (It since 
settled back into the 20s.) 
</P>
<P>
	Endostatin testing will start this fall on 45 to 90 terminally  
ill volunteers in Boston, Houston and Madison, Wis. Because of the 
publicity, the experiment will be subjected to a level of kibitzing 
rare in early stage drug testing, which usually succeeds or fails 
in anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Folkman, for one, doubts this first human test will show much  
benefit, and disappointment is inevitable. ``People two weeks into 
this will write newspaper articles saying it doesn't work,'' he 
says. ``They will get safety data in Phase One, but efficacy will 
take a long time, if it comes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reason: Blood vessel blockers are nothing like traditional  
cancer treatment. Mainstream chemotherapy drugs are poisons that 
work by harming cancer cells more than they do normal ones. Often 
they shrink cancers fast, even though they may fail to destroy 
every last bit of the disease, leaving some to grow back and kill. 
</P>
<P>
	The experimental drugs are unlikely to make cancer wither and  
vanish -- at least, not quickly and predictably. Some may make 
tumors recede; others may only prevent them from getting any larger 
or spreading further. 
</P>
<P>
	If so, this will mean cancer patients may need to take the drugs  
for months, years, even for life. ``Maybe these drugs won't make 
the disease disappear,'' says Dr. Lee Rosen of UCLA's Jonsson 
Comprehensive Cancer Center. ``But if we can stop it from growing 
and make it a chronic disease, that's an OK thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the drugs in the pipeline were designed from scratch to  
target the body's normal blood vessel construction machinery, which 
is hardly ever turned on in healthy adults. Some target messenger 
proteins, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, that activate 
this process. Some block the enzymes that are necessary for new 
blood vessels to burrow through surrounding tissue. Others, like 
endostatin, seem to inhibit the entire process. 
</P>
<P>
	Some older drugs are being looked at afresh, as well. For  
instance, thalidomide, the disgraced sleeping pill, is being tested 
for its newly recognized effects on blood vessels in people with a 
variety of cancers. So are taxol and interferon-alpha, standard 
cancer medicines that may work in low doses as angiogenesis 
blockers. 
</P>
<P>
	While it is possible these medicines will turn out to be  
effective alone, many researchers expect they will work best when 
combined with standard chemotherapy, surgery and radiation. Lab 
experiments suggest that tumors may be far more sensitive to the 
killing effects of chemotherapy after they have been weakened with 
blood vessel inhibitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that a dual therapy, one designed to go after the  
blood vessel and one to go after the cancer cell itself, will lead 
to a super-additive effect,'' says UCLA's Dr. Fairooz Kabbinavar. 
</P>
<P>
	If these drugs pan out, doctors envision a time when patients  
will get a blood test to see which chemical triggers their tumorsto 
make new blood vessels. Then they will take a cocktail of blockers 
tailored to their disease, wait a few weeks for their cancer's 
blood supply to shut down and come back for a knockout punch of 
chemo or radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been one foot in front of another in cancer medicine for  
the past 50 years,'' says Dr. Stephen Sallan of Boston's 
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. ``New concepts, and anti-angiogenesis 
is just one of them, certainly make me feel we will accelerate the 
pace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For some, such as Clayton Twigg, who were present in the first  
moments of this new attack on cancer, the future may have arrived 
just in time. Once given six months to live, he is planning a 
fishing trip to Canada and thinking about returning to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not out of the woods yet, but I'm keeping my fingers  
crossed,'' he says. ``Hopefully we have found something, if not for 
all of cancer, then at least for those with the kind I have. It's a 
terrific time for science.''

<HEADLINE> Farm Aid Spurs Look at New Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It is harvest time again, and Congress is  
passing another multibillion-dollar bailout to keep farmers in 
business. Many lawmakers say it also is time to find a cheaper, 
more effective way to support farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea getting the most attention is a new subsidy program  
proposed by Rep. Charles Stenholm of Texas, the senior Democrat on 
the House Agriculture Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	His plan would provide payments to farmers when prices for crops  
fall significantly below average. The size of the checks would be 
tied to local crop yields. The idea is to guarantee farmers a 
minimum level of income each year, and ensure the cash goes to 
farmers, not landowners, as some subsidies now do. 
</P>
<P>
	``The payments would go directly to actual producers in time of  
need,'' Stenholm said. ``It's the kind of long-term approach we 
should be using to address agriculture's cyclical problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 ``Freedom to Farm'' law was supposed to wean growers  
from their dependence on government programs. But market prices 
collapsed last year and economists see little improvement ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers rushed out $6 billion in emergency relief last fall,  
and the Senate is expected to give final approval this week to $8.7 
billion more. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our current farm law doesn't provide the necessary safety net  
for our producers,'' said Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo. Stenholm's 
plan deserves ``close scrutiny,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law provides growers with crop subsidies that are tied  
to fluctuations in prices, not yields, and fixed ``market 
transition'' payments that decline each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Groups such as the National Farmers Union that think the  
government should do more to assist smaller-scale farms are 
interested in Stenholm's idea because it would provide more 
protection when prices are low or crops are poor. 
</P>
<P>
	The much bigger American Farm Bureau Federation and others like  
Stenholm's plan because it would not require controls on 
production, a key feature of the Depression-era farm policy 
Congress tossed out in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like an idea that has strong possibility and merit,''  
said Dick Newpher, executive director of the Farm Bureau's 
Washington office. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Agriculture Committee chairman, Republican Larry  
Combest of Texas, also has expressed interest. He plans a 
comprehensive review of government farm programs next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman wanted to use something like  
Stenholm's plan to distribute $5.5 billion in emergency relief 
included in the latest bailout. Farm groups balked at that 
suggestion because they feared it would delay the assistance. 
Instead, the money will go to recipients of the market transition 
checks, some of whom are not farming anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Stenholm's plan, which was originally proposed by economists at  
the Agriculture Department and Ohio State University in the early 
1990s, is not without its critics. 
</P>
<P>
	The payments could worsen the worldwide grain glut by  
encouraging farmers to plant crops in areas where they do not do 
well, such as parts of Stenholm's west Texas district, said Neil 
Harl, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University. The 1996 
farm law was designed to do just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
	Harl, who believes the government should go back to controlling  
production and paying farmers to hold grain off the market, said 
the law is ``fatally flawed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., wonders where the government would get  
the money for Stenholm's payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio Democrat who heads the House  
agricultural appropriations subcommittee, is concerned that the 
program could wind up steering still more farm subsidies to Texas 
to the detriment of other regions.

<HEADLINE> Extent of Floyd Damage Unknown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Dangerous bacteria and chemicals flushed  
into North Carolina waterways by Hurricane Floyd's disastrous flood 
haven't caused widespread health problems, but long-term 
environmental damage remains to be seen, state officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, there are relatively few reports of cholera,  
mosquito-borne diseases or other illness from contact with polluted 
water or mud -- even as thousands of people return to homes they 
evacuated when Floyd dumped up to 20 inches of rain last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely a silver lining. It's one of the few items of  
good news we've received,'' said Johanna Reese, a spokeswoman for 
the state Division of Environmental Health. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, flood waters continued to threaten low-lying  
communities as rain from storms this week caused rivers to crest 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government expects to buy up to 10,000 homes in an  
effort to move residents and businesses off flood plains. ``It will 
be our worst flood disaster in the Southeast ever,'' said Todd 
Davison with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the state, the flood inundated 23 municipal sewage  
treatment plants and more than 50 livestock waste lagoons, flushing 
out thousands of gallons of bacteria-laden waste. The carcasses of 
thousands of drowned livestock will pose health risks until they 
are incinerated or buried. 
</P>
<P>
	Chemicals and petroleum products leaked from gas stations,  
junkyards, farms and chemical plants. As the pollutants are carried 
downstream to the Atlantic, fish will likely die. 
</P>
<P>
	The extent of the damage may not be known for weeks, said Larry  
Cahoon, a biological science professor at the University of North 
Carolina at Wilmington who inspected the mouth of the Cape Fear 
River on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awful brown out there. The crew of the ship told me  
they've never seen it that bad,'' said Cahoon, who estimates the 
brown water has spread across 200 square miles of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Water contaminated by bacteria from feces could cause  
gastrointestinal diseases, and dehydration from severe vomiting or 
diarrhea could be fatal for young children, the elderly and people 
with weakened immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
	However, samples taken from more than 100 inland sites show  
levels of fecal coliform bacteria are a lot lower than expected, 
said Ernie Seneca, a state spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Chemical pollutants have been diluted by the huge volumes of  
water left by Floyd, said Dan Thornton, an emergency response 
coordinator for the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollutants include mercury and chromium spilled from at least  
six industrial sites, said Bill Meyer, the state's top hazardous 
waste regulator. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with chemical spills, half of 51 sites visited by state  
inspectors had damage to underground fuel storage tanks, Meyer 
said. About 1,550 service stations and oil distributors were 
flooded, and some 20,000 tanks holding home heating oil or other 
fuel haven't been checked, Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, dirty-brown water stood waist-deep in parts of  
Kinston. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still in a crisis,'' said Reginald Lee, a Lenoir County  
emergency management spokesman. Two hundred businesses and 
thousands of homes were flooded in the county. 
</P>
<P>
	Clyde Cox, 77, a retired municipal worker, sloshed through his  
Kinston yard in hip waders, wearing a white surgical mask to block 
the rotten stench. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time it's ever been in the yard in 30 years,''  
said Cox, who had no flood insurance. ``All the flooding we've had, 
it's the first time. Any help I can get, I sure would appreciate 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Bill Signed To Outlaw Gay Harassment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis on Saturday signed  
legislation to outlaw the harassment of gay students and teachers 
in public schools and colleges, calling the action an attempt to 
``beat back the forces of hatred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic governor also signed into law a new state  
domestic partners registry for couples who are gay or over age 62, 
extending to them hospital visitation rights and allowing state and 
local government workers to get health benefits for their partners. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the third of three gay-rights bills, the governor signed  
legislation to block job and housing discrimination on the basis of 
sexual orientation. The bill places authority over the cases in the 
state's Fair Employment and Housing Department, a key state civil 
rights agency. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the legislation banning discrimination against gay  
students and teachers that drew the most attention. Three other 
states -- Wisconsin, Massachusetts and Connecticut -- have similar 
antidiscrimination rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, a political leader has taken meaningful action. This  
is the most important piece of legislation ever passed in regard to 
gay-lesbian youth rights,'' said Kevin Jennings, executive director 
of the national Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network.

<HEADLINE> 'Doping Passport' Issue Pushed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Athletes should be ineligible to compete  
in future Olympics unless they carry a ``doping passport'' proving 
they have undergone regular out-of-competition drug tests, an 
Olympic athletes' group said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee executive board, meanwhile,  
endorsed proposals for 15 athletes to be appointed as members of a 
reformed IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC athletes' commission met with the executive board  
Saturday to push for a bigger role in the running of the Olympics 
and press for stronger measures to fight performance-enhancing 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission member Johann Olav Koss, the Norwegian speed skater  
who won three gold medals at the 1994 Lillehammer Games, said all 
Olympic athletes should carry a ``doping passport'' requiring them 
to be available for out-of-competition controls 365 days a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The passport would be stamped each time the athlete is tested.  
Details would be forwarded to a new international anti-doping 
agency, which would keep records of who had been tested, where and 
when. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved, passports would start to be issued before next  
year's Sydney Games, but the project would only go into full effect 
in time for the 2004 Summer Games in Athens. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to have testing of at least 20,000 athletes before  
Athens,'' Koss said. ``In 2004, you will need to have a passport, 
or you will not be able to participate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The passport initiative emerged from a working group of the IOC  
2000 commission, a special panel studying a series of reforms in 
the wake of bidding and drug scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	Another central proposal of the reform panel, the appointment of  
15 athletes to the IOC, was formally backed Saturday by the 
executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes would be elected by their peers. To be eligible,  
they would have to be current Olympic athletes or have competed 
within the past eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes' group recommended that eight members come from  
summer sports and four from winter sports, with three others 
selected on a geographical basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes would be elected to an eight-year term. At least  
one would serve on the decision-making executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal will be submitted for ratification along with other  
reform measures at the special IOC session in Lausanne, 
Switzerland, on Dec. 11-12. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes' group backed the IOC's proposal for a world  
anti-doping agency, a project which has been attacked by White 
House drug policy adviser Barry McCaffrey. He and other critics say 
the agency should be totally independent of the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Koss said the athletes are satisfied that the agency, due to be  
set up by the of this year with initial IOC funding of $25 million, 
will gradually become fully independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Koss expressed doubts about the feasibility of McCaffrey's  
proposal for athletes' drug samples to be preserved so they can be 
tested years later when better detection methods become available. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Koss urged the United States to commit funds to help  
scientists develop reliable tests for human growth hormone, EPO and 
other drugs which can't be detected in standard urine controls. 
</P>
<P>
	Koss also said he would like the IOC athletes' group to be  
represented at the Oct. 20 hearing called by U.S. Sen. John McCain 
into doping in Olympic sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes raised several concerns about the IOC's proposed  
anti-doping code, a document which sets out drug rules and 
sanctions for all Olympic sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Koss said the group was particularly unclear about the code's  
distinction between ``intentional doping'' and non-intentional 
doping. The athletes will review that and other issues with IOC 
leaders again later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Ctvrtlik, a former U.S. Olympic volleyball player who is  
on the athletes' panel, said critics of the IOC's anti-doping 
policies should give the organization a break. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easy when you are outside the IOC to be critical,'' he  
said. ``We have the same goals, the same objectives. It's not 
helpful to pull in different directions.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley: Campaign Starts Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley said  
his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination is ``beginning 
to grow'' as voters begin to draw distinctions between him and Vice 
President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say we have momentum, but I say no. We just have a  
little traction,'' Bradley said. ``We want momentum in January.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In visits to a rural clinic and American Legion post at this  
central Iowa town west of Des Moines, Bradley focused on his 
just-unveiled health-care proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	His campaign has begun to get new attention because of  
increasing signs that he is narrowing the gap with Gore, who until 
recently was assumed to have a lock on the nomination. Polls have 
shown Bradley within striking distance in Iowa, where precinct 
caucuses launch the nominating season early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	While conceding he's picked up steam, Bradley is working hard to  
lower expectations. Meeting with reporters, he noted that Gore has 
the full weight of the White House at his disposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have the president of the United States right by your  
side, willing to help you every step of the way, you have 
entrenched powers in the Democratic National Committee, you arrive 
on Air Force Two and you are ahead nationally,'' he said. ``To me 
that's the favorite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that also works the other way. As vice president, Gore must  
campaign with a large entourage and a security shield, while 
Bradley can run a much lower-keyed and more grass-roots effort. 
Saturday's swing underscored that difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley sat with a handful of people at a rural health clinic to  
talk about health care and spoke to 65 folks at a down-home 
breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that people are beginning to learn more about how I'm  
running the campaign, respecting the voters, reaching out to 
people, telling them what I believe. I think that it's beginning to 
grow,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are looking for politicians to lead from their core  
convictions.''

<HEADLINE> Nemechek a Happy NASCAR Winner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINSVILLE, Va. (AP) -- A few weeks ago, Joe Nemechek was  
struggling on the track and unhappy off of it. 
</P>
<P>
	His career as a Winston Cup driver was in jeopardy.  
</P>
<P>
	After failing to find much spark with Sabco Racing, the  
36-year-old Nemechek was a lame duck driver with two top-10 
finishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wow, what a different feeling this is,'' Nemechek said Friday  
after winning the pole for the NAPA AutoCare 500 at Martinsville 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The pole also came the day it was officially announced that  
Nemechek signed to drive for Andy Petree Racing the next two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing better than winning,'' the smiling Nemechek  
said after turning his fast lap of 95.223 mph on the .533-mile, 
paperclip-shaped Martinsville oval. 
</P>
<P>
	The big change began Sept. 19 in Loudon, N.H., when Nemechek won  
for the first time in 180 Winston Cup starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Jeff Gordon and Dale Jarrett and Tony Stewart, `Now I  
know what you guys feel like.''' Nemechek added. ``And the feeling 
on this team is getting the cars right, I'm driving better. It 
takes the whole package if you want to win and, right now, 
everything is going well for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for replacing Ken Schrader on Petree's team next year,  
Nemechek said, ``I'm excited. I was confident I'd wind up with a 
good ride, but this takes a load off my mind, knowing what I'm 
going to be doing next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nemechek earned the nickname ``Front Row Joe'' in 1997 when he  
won his first two poles. He went without a pole last year, won one 
in July in Daytona Beach, Fla., and has four in his Winston Cup 
career and his first in Martinsville. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was on the outside pole here two years ago, but this is  
really great. That was a perfect lap. The car never slipped a 
bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Musgrave, whose best previous starts this season were a pair  
of 11ths, took the second spot at 95.070, followed by Geoffrey 
Bodine, who was third at 94.836, followed by Kyle Petty at 94.794 
and Gordon at 94.761. 
</P>
<P>
	For Gordon, it was the first race in his Winston Cup career  
without Ray Evernham as his crew chief. Evernham, who plans to 
start his own team, left Hendrick Motorsports on Wednesday and has 
been replaced by Brian Whitesell. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is pretty much what I'd hoped for,'' said Whitesell, a  
protege of Evernham. ``We just wanted to get a solid qualifying run 
and the guys got it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, who owns a 257-point lead on Mark Martin in the  
standings, managed a 14th-place qualifying run, while Martin was 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was pretty good for me at this racetrack,'' Jarrett said.  
``I'd like to try to win this race. We know we can run pretty well 
here. We have to run well here and we've run not so good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first race at Martinsville with an extended pit lane  
allowing all 43 starters on Sunday to pit on the front 
straightaway. That meant a change in qualifying, with all the cars 
entering the track midway through the backstretch and getting 
nearly a lap and a half to warm up before taking the green flag for 
their two qualifying laps. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this new format, you had to guess a little bit,''  
Nemechek said. ``We really got it right this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Labonte, third in the season points -- trailing Martin by  
just seven and ahead of rookie teammate Stewart by 13 -- crashed 
hard late in the morning practice and managed to a qualifying 25th 
in his backup. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, on a tear recently, had his worst qualifying effort of  
the season. He was 35th among the 47 drivers who made attempts and 
will have to decide whether to try again today or stand on his 
first-day lap.

</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Armed riot police stopped a group of  
about 15,000 protesters marching toward President Slobodan 
Milosevic's villa Saturday in Belgrade. A tense standoff ensued, 
but the police didn't start wielding their clubs as they had 
earlier this week. Instead, they pushed the protesters back to the 
city's main square, where the crowds listened to fiery speeches by 
opposition leaders. Saturday marks the 12th consecutive day of 
protests against Milosevic.

	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Suspected guerrillas pushing villagers  
to boycott India's elections gunned down a local politician in the 
state Saturday. The guerrillas have been fighting security forces 
for several years, seeking more autonomy. The guerrillas also set 
off a land mine, killing five people and wounding three others in 
Assam state on the eve of the last round of India's five-phase 
ballot, police said.

	Gore Campaign Stands Behind Manager  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Al Gore 2000 presidential campaign issued  
a statement defending campaign manager Tony Coelho, who is facing 
scrutiny for financial irregularities during a previous job. ``Tony 
Coelho does a great job as general chair of Gore 2000,'' the 
statement said. Stanley Brand, Coelho's personal lawyer, said his 
client did not violate any laws in a job that did not pay him a 
salary. State Department investigators say Coelho made the 
government liable for a $300,000 personal loan while directing the 
U.S. pavilion at the 1998 world's fair in Portugal.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Five white sheriff's deputies face criminal  
charges for allegedly chasing and opening fire on a black couple in 
their car while the officers were off-duty. Two of the deputies 
were charged yesterday with attempted murder and aggravated 
discharge of a firearm. All five also were charged with obstruction 
of justice, prosecutors said. An attorney for Cory Simmons, 23, and 
his girlfriend, Dominique Mapp, 20, had alleged the June 2 
confrontation was racially motivated, but Devine said there was no

	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian troops clashed with rebels in  
several parts of the breakaway republic as they took control of a 
village in Chechnya Saturday. Chechnya's vice president vowed his 
people would fight off the Russians -- but also called for 
negotiations. Vakha Arsanov suggested Georgian President Eduard 
Shevardnadze could organize talks between Russian and Chechen 
authorities. Russia began air raids on Chechnya last month after 
Muslim militants based in the territory invaded neighboring 
Dagestan, seeking to create an Islamic state.

an extra point in overtime today, lifting No. 21 Alabama to a 40-39 
victory and snapping No. 3 Florida's 30-game home winning streak. 
Kemp got his second chance after Bennie Alexander of Florida jumped 
offsides following Shaun Alexander's 25-yard touchdown run on the 
first play of Alabama's overtime possession. Alexander furthered 
his Heisman Trophy candidacy, finishing with 106 yards rushing, 94 
yards receiving and four touchdowns. Quarterback Andrew Zow threw

	PINE MOUNTAIN, Ga. (AP) -- David Toms overcame a bogey on the  
first hole for another 6-under 66 today that gave him a 
three-stroke lead going into the final round of the Buick 
Challenge. Toms answered his bogey with a 5-wood to 18 feet for an 
eagle on the second hole, and the rest of the day was a breeze. He 
never came close to another bogey and finished at 16-under 200, in 
good position for his second PGA Tour victory this year.

<HEADLINE> Blood Vessels Targeted in Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Cancer gets most of the attention, but any disease  
that involves the unwanted growth of blood vessels could be a 
target for the new angiogenesis-blocking medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, the inappropriate spread of blood vessels inside  
the eye is a common cause of blindness. Some speculate that the 
same blood vessel inhibitors being developed for cancer could be 
important drugs for eye disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Other illnesses where the drugs might help include hardening of  
the arteries; arthritis; endometriosis, the uterine disorder; and 
Crohn's disease, a digestive system inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
	It is still too soon to know whether angiogenesis blockers will  
do anything for these disorders, but one encouraging patient 
experience raises the possibility of a role against Von 
Hippel-Lindau syndrome. This rare, inherited condition involves the 
growth of small knots of blood vessels, called angiomas, throughout 
the body. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Williams, 47, a medical secretary from Roanoke, Va., had  
already lost her left eye to the disease when she was diagnosed 
with an angioma on the optic nerve of her right eye. With her 
vision failing, she went to Boston in April to receive an 
angiogenesis-blocking drug at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was wearing glasses,'' she said. ``After my fourth  
treatment, my glasses came off. I haven't worn them since. My 
vision is better than perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A larger study is getting under way to test the drug, Sugen's  
SU5416, in others with Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.

<HEADLINE> Ginsberg's Return To Court Unknown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the Supreme Court's marshal tells  
courtroom spectators Monday that ``the court is now sitting,'' 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg may be absent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg returned home Sept. 27 after an 11-day hospital stay  
and surgery for colon cancer. The prognosis from her doctor is 
good, but it is not known how long the 66-year-old justice will be 
homebound. 
</P>
<P>
	She already has participated in court business since her  
surgery, but cannot take part in oral arguments unless in the 
courtroom. For cases in which she misses the arguments, Ginsburg 
can listen to audio tapes and read transcripts if she chooses to 
participate in deciding them. 
</P>
<P>
	If she opts out of them, her eight colleagues could reach a  
decision without her or order the case reargued. A 4-4 split of the 
justices automatically upholds a lower court's ruling but sets no 
legal precedent.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Surge Continues in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Democrat Bill Bradley has a 51 percent to 32  
percent lead over Republican Gov. George W. Bush of Texas among 
potential New York voters, according to a statewide poll released 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll from the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute found  
Bush in a statistical dead heat with Vice President Al Gore among 
New York voters surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Bradley and Gore remained in a statistical tie among  
New York Democrats, the momentum appeared to be in Bradley's favor 
on that front as well. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest survey, 44 percent of Democrats said they favored  
the former senator from New Jersey while 41 percent backed the vice 
president. A Quinnipiac poll from early August had Gore leading 
Bradley, 47 percent to 38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll released two weeks ago by the Hamden, Conn.-based  
pollsters had Bradley leading Bush, 47 percent to 37 percent, with 
Bush and Gore statistically tied. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad news for Bush and Gore came on the eve of new forays  
into New York for both. Bush, the Republican front-runner, is to 
fly across upstate New York on Monday with New York Gov. George 
Pataki, a potential running mate. Gore is to visit the Albany area 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush's slip is showing as he prepares to introduce  
himself to New York voters,'' Maurice Carroll, director of the 
Quinnipiac polling institute, said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York is considered a must-win state for Democrats if they  
are to retain the White House and the state's early March 7 primary 
gives it added importance. 
</P>
<P>
	With Bradley gaining ground in key early primary states like New  
York and New Hampshire, and raising money faster than the vice 
president, Gore announced Wednesday that he was revamping his 
campaign and moving it from Washington to Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said ``the last thing we're  
going to do is take anything for granted,'' he said the poll 
``represents the progress we've been making in New York.'' Hauser 
said the poll ``reflects the feeling that Democrats want a nominee 
who can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Peter Ragone said, ``We're in a tough campaign in  
Bradley's backyard and Al Gore knows it. But he's taking this 
campaign to the grassroots, working his heart and soul out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest Quinnipiac telephone poll of 1,049 registered New  
York voters was conducted Sept. 24-30 and has a margin of error of 
plus or minus 3 percentage points. The polling based on the sample 
of 452 registered Democrats has a margin of error of plus or minus 
5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Quinnipiac poll also indicated that New Yorkers are looking  
less favorably on the vice president than they did just a few weeks 
ago. While Gore was rated favorably by 31 percent of New York 
voters in early August, that slipped to 24 percent in the latest 
poll. Bush's favorability rating was also down slightly.

<HEADLINE> Garciaparra Returns to Red Sox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Shortstop Nomar Garciaparra rejoined the Boston  
Red Sox on Saturday and said his injured right wrist will not 
hinder his performance in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, who was hit by a pitch from the Orioles' Al Reyes  
on Sept. 25, will not play in Boston's final two regular-season 
games in Baltimore. But he said he will ready for action Wednesday, 
when the Red Sox open the postseason with a best-of-5 series 
against either Cleveland or Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without a doubt. No question,'' he said Saturday in the Boston  
clubhouse. ``I don't think it's going to limit me now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra leads the AL in batting .357. He has 27 home runs  
and 104 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra was examined Friday by Red Sox team physician Arthur  
Pappas at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in 
Worcester. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bone looks fine,'' Pappas said, ``but there is a tendon  
that travels under the bone that is bruised and that tendon is 
swollen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra said the injury does not hinder his throws from  
shortstop, but he admitted feeling a twinge of pain when he swings 
the bat. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra left the team before Thursday night's game in  
Chicago against the White Sox. By the time he returns Wednesday, he 
will have gone a week without playing. But he was not concerned 
about the time off. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll definitely have some workouts inbetween now and then,''  
he said. ``It's not going to be six days of non-activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By sitting out the final two games, Garciaparra appears to be a  
sure bet to win his first batting title in the major leagues. He 
entered Saturday with a seven-point cushion on Derek Jeter of the 
New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it happens, it's definitely a nice honor, but it wasn't my  
goal at the beginning of the season,'' he said. ``I won't be happy 
with this season if we don't go all the way.''

<HEADLINE> Ecton Park Wins Super Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSSIER CITY, La. (AP) -- Ecton Park, the winner of the Jim Dandy  
at Saratoga in August, beat Menifee, the runner-up in both the 
Kentucky Derby and Preakness, by two lengths to win the $500,000 
Super Derby at Louisiana Downs on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Alex Solis and carrying 126 pounds, Ecton Park covered  
1 1/4 miles in 2:00.4, 1-10th of a second off the track record, and 
returned $8.80, $3.20 and $2.40. 
</P>
<P>
	``It went very much like I hoped it would,'' Solis said. ``I  
just wanted to track the first two horses and make my move whenever 
I felt like it was needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ecton Park won $300,000, increasing his career totals to  
$852,635. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, who finished two lengths ahead of Pineaff in the field  
of eight 3-year-olds, paid $2.40 and $2.10. He earned $100,000 to 
increase his career earnings to $1,732,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Pineaff was $2.60 to show.  
</P>
<P>
	Menifee was allowed to settle off the pace and made a move three  
wide with a quarter-mile remaining, but could do little with the 
winner through the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kind of scrambled the first few jumps,'' said Menifee's  
jockey, Pat Day. ``He got up on his feet around the first turn and 
were right behind the eventual winner where I wanted to be. I 
kicked on him off the turn and the other horse opened up on us. We 
went after him in earnest and we just weren't able to run him 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Answer Lively, the 1998 2-year-old champion, took the early  
lead, but Ecton Park stayed on pace and made his move about the 
three-quarter pole. 
</P>
<P>
	``Around the three-eighths pole, I asked my horse a little bit  
and I got him going and coming to the three-sixteenths, I let him 
roll,'' Solis said. ``It worked out very good for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Gonzales rode Answer Lively to a sixth-place finish. He  
said the horse started off well but then started to make some 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he displaced his palette again,'' Gonzales said. ``He  
was making the noise and I started to pull him up a bit and then he 
opened up again but then started making the noise again and 
displaced again. I think he just got too excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Completing the order of finish from fourth place were:  
Temperence Time, Brassy Wells, Answer Lively, Captain Countdown and 
Bosque County.

<HEADLINE>  Robertson Rebuilding Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inside the 2-million-member Christian  
Coalition, organizers admitted to ``slackening'' enthusiasm while 
founder Pat Robertson struggled this weekend to rebound from two 
troubled years and rebuild his army for the 2000 election. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to see a powerful religious revival,'' Robertson  
predicted at his annual ``Road to Victory'' conference, commanding 
an audience with six of this season's eight Republican presidential 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The certainty of President Clinton's departure is the biggest  
factor rejuvenating a membership weary of the Christian Coalition's 
financial and organizational problems and its lack of any tangible 
effect since helping Republicans sweep into control of Congress in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clinton's over. His term is over,'' said Robertson, who closed  
the two-day conference of 3,500 of his faithful on Saturday. ``They 
sense the possibility of seeing a principled conservative in the 
White House and they realize the importance of Supreme Court 
justices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To a howl of approval, Republican presidential candidate Steve  
Forbes stoked those embers when he rallied the group. ``The clock 
is ticking. In 477 days, Bill Clinton will no longer be president 
of the United States!'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Robertson  
acknowledged coalition members have been ``dispirited'' and that he 
is still ``a way away'' from his fund-raising goal to distribute 
some 75 million voter guides before November 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizational disarray followed the resignations and firings of  
several staffers. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Miller, chairman of the Des Moines, Iowa, chapter, said he  
has felt a ``slackening'' of interest among members. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll say, 'We've read this' and 'We've heard this.' It  
hasn't helped the cause to have all this internal strife,'' said 
Miller. ``A lot of them are now getting involved with individual 
candidates instead of an umbrella group like the Christian 
Coalition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christine White, a five-year coalition member and actress with  
roles on TV's ``Twilight Zone'' and ``Bonanza,'' said she also has 
felt a change in the group's power. ``There's been no action in 
terms of the great needs of the country,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Robertson said he is not giving up. ``It hasn't been easy,  
let's face it,'' he told CNN's ``Evans, Novak, Hunt &AMP; Shields.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, we had a financial hit ... but we're coming back and this  
weekend, to me, was a major turning point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, front-runner George W. Bush, Elizabeth Dole, Gary Bauer,  
Alan Keyes and Orrin Hatch each called on the coalition in the 
cavernous hotel ballroom where it met in flashy, convention style. 
Each showed off conservative -- and religious -- credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan, where Clinton's  
1992 edge over Vice President Bush was 500,000 votes or less, 
Robertson said his coalition could turn out the 1 percent to 3 
percent of next year's vote that could provide the margin of 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have to have a majority. What we have to have is a  
significant minority to sway the swing states,'' Robertson told the 
AP. 
</P>
<P>
	He exhorted members to mobilize: ``If we aren't in the field in  
this coming election, Republicans will lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for  
Separation of Church and State, called Robertson's 
convention-opening speech ``probably the most blatantly 
pro-Republican speech I have ever heard him give in this election -- 
at least as interested in G-O-P as he is in G-O-D.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was talk like that that kept Robertson's group from receiving  
tax-exempt status as a nonprofit religious organization. 
</P>
<P>
	It also landed him in a 1996 government lawsuit charging that  
the group's voter guides, phone banks and other get-out-the-vote 
operations were partisan activities designed to aid Republican 
candidates and should be treated as political contributions under 
federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled in August in favor of the Christian  
Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how his unabashed Republican-boosting squared with claims  
that his activities are nonpartisan, Robertson replied with a grin: 
``Well, my members can have Democrats, too, if they want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee chairman Jim Nicholson dangled  
tempting prospects as he appealed to the coalition to ``do your 
part'' in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a historic opportunity ahead of us -- a chance to  
elect a Republican president and a Republican Congress. It's been 
almost half a century since we last did that,'' Nicholson said. 
``We're counting on you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Reed's address had more of a bucking-up tone to it. ``You  
have made history, you have changed America. Don't you let anyone 
ever tell you any different,'' said Reed, who was executive 
director in the coalition's heyday and is now a strategist for 
Bush, the Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Lynn, an ardent critic of the Christian Coalition: ``This  
is a group on the ropes. I would not never declare this group dead, 
but it seems to be falling into a deep sleep.''

	The Rev. Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for  
Separation of Church and State, called Robertson's 
convention-opening speech ``probably the most blatantly 
pro-Republican speech I have ever heard him give in this election -- 
at least as interested in G-O-P as he is in G-O-D.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was talk like that that kept Robertson's group from receiving  
tax-exempt status as a nonprofit religious organization. 
</P>
<P>
	It also landed him in a 1996 government lawsuit charging that  
the group's voter guides, phone banks and other get-out-the-vote 
operations were partisan activities designed to aid Republican 
candidates and should be treated as political contributions under 
federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled in August in favor of the Christian  
Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how his unabashed Republican-boosting squared with claims  
that his activities are nonpartisan, Robertson replied with a grin: 
``Well, my members can have Democrats, too, if they want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee chairman Jim Nicholson dangled  
tempting prospects as he appealed to the coalition to ``do your 
part'' in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a historic opportunity ahead of us -- a chance to  
elect a Republican president and a Republican Congress. It's been 
almost half a century since we last did that,'' Nicholson said. 
``We're counting on you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Reed's address had more of a bucking-up tone to it. ``You  
have made history, you have changed America. Don't you let anyone 
ever tell you any different,'' said Reed, who was executive 
director in the coalition's heyday and is now a strategist for 
Bush, the Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Lynn, an ardent critic of the Christian Coalition: ``This  
is a group on the ropes. I would not never declare this group dead, 
but it seems to be falling into a deep sleep.''

<HEADLINE> Mets In Control of Their Destiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just one day ago, the New York Mets' playoff  
hopes were on life support following a disastrous 10-day stretch 
that saw them go from four games ahead in the wild-card chase to 
two games back. 
</P>
<P>
	One dramatic win and a little outside help later let the Mets  
take the field Saturday night against Pittsburgh in control of 
their playoff destiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's back in our hands again,'' Matt Franco said after  
Cincinnati lost to Milwaukee 10-6, bringing the Mets within a 
half-game of the wild-card lead with two games to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing how you can go from out of it to back in it so  
suddenly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All it took was a 3-2 win in 11 innings over the Pirates on  
Friday night -- New York's second victory in 10 games -- and losses 
by Houston and Cincinnati to bring the Mets within a game of the 
wild-card leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds' loss Saturday guaranteed that the Mets would have a  
chance to at least force a wild-card playoff on Sunday. That was 
quite a trip in less than 48 hours after a devastating 4-3, 
11-inning loss to Atlanta on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get hot, then you're not,'' manager Bobby Valentine said.  
``You can't stay hot. That's how this game is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately for the Mets, the Reds did not stay hot, losing  
three straight games. Many of the Mets gathered early Saturday to 
follow the Reds' game. 
</P>
<P>
	When the game was unavailable on their satellite, a group of  
them gathered around a computer screen in manager Bobby Valentine's 
office, watching pitch-by-pitch updates come over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	That's baseball fever in the high-tech, wild-card age.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was doing a little managing, but mostly rooting,'' Valentine  
said. ``It's much more nerve-wrecking watching a game when you have 
no control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before taking the field, the Mets were gathered in their  
clubhouse watching the Astros finish off a 3-0 win over Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	That meant there would be no one-game playoff Monday at Shea  
Stadium between the Mets and Astros. The Mets and Reds would have a 
one-game playoff in Cincinnati if they finish in a two-way tie. 
</P>
<P>
	If there is a three-way tie, New York is automatically in and  
the Reds and Astros play one game in Cincinnati to decide the NL 
Central champion -- the loser would be out of the playoffs because 
it would finish a half-game behind the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can play in a tough division and win more games than  
another team that wins their division and not make the playoffs,'' 
Valentine said defending the system. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of them happens to play another game. Being that we are  
the ones who benefit, then it's really fair. But when did we start 
dealing with what's fair?'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Mets win twice and Cincinnati loses, New York is also in  
as the wild card. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's neat for baseball with all the different possibilities  
going into the last weekend,'' Valentine said. ``I'd rather have it 
neat for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever happens, Valentine knows he probably needs a win  
Sunday. And he decided to stick with Orel Hershiser instead of 
using Al Leiter on three days' rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine took Leiter out after seven innings on Wednesday to  
leave open that option, but with his lack of experience on short 
rest decided to stick with Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's only done it once and that was in 1994 in May, not after  
200 innings,'' Valentine said. ``This is not the time to experiment 
with something you haven't done all year. Especially when we have a 
good option in a well-rested Orel.''

<HEADLINE> Probe Checks Mental Hospital Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- No one knows how many patients have died at  
mental health facilities after being restrained or put into 
seclusion because most centers are not required to report such 
deaths, congressional investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, said  
in a report released Friday it determined that at least 24 people 
died and 1,000 were injured or abused in 1998, but the actual 
numbers probably are much higher. Only 15 states have reporting 
systems, it said, and most facilities are not required to report. 
</P>
<P>
	``While restraint and seclusion use can injure patients and  
staff, the full extent of that risk is not known because reporting 
is so fragmentary,'' the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers in the House and the Senate, following Hartford  
Courant investigative articles in Connecticut, have introduced 
bills that would require better reporting, better training of 
mental health care workers and a doctor's authorization before a 
patient is restrained. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate will hold hearings on the issue before Congress  
adjourns for the year, said Sen. William Roth, the Delaware 
Republican who chairs the Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have to tell you that hospitals should be places of  
safety and healing,'' Roth said. The GAO report and the newspaper 
articles suggest an urgent need to ``rededicate ourselves to 
continued improvement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mental health experts generally agree that a patient must be  
restrained or put into seclusion on an emergency basis when he is a 
danger to himself or to others, the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Far less agreement exists about the use of restraint and  
seclusion in any other situation,'' such as punishment or staff 
convenience, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The random use of restraints cited by the GAO suggests bad  
luck, more than medical science, determines which patients end up 
restrained, secluded or even dead,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, 
D-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO said 240,000 people require either inpatient treatment  
in mental hospitals or residential treatment in centers or group 
homes each year. About 120,000 people with mental retardation lived 
in intermediate care facilities and 240,000 others lived in smaller 
residential settings in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	No federal regulations governed the use of restraint and  
seclusion in those facilities until July 1999, when the Health Care 
Financing Administration put new restrictions on hospitals that 
received federal Medicare money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although this is a positive step, people in residential  
treatment centers and group homes participating in the Medicaid 
Home and Community-Based Waiver program have limited federal 
protection,'' the GAO report said. ``While some states have 
regulations in place governing the use of restraint and seclusion, 
often these regulations do not apply to privately operated 
facilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about protecting our loved ones from deadly  
restraint,'' said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. ``They should not fear 
for their lives -- and their families should not fear for their 
lives -- when they check into a hospital.''

<HEADLINE> Gordon's Crew Chief Sitting Duck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINSVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Brian Whitesell is a sitting duck, and  
he knows it. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitesell, who replaced Ray Evernham as Jeff Gordon's crew chief  
Wednesday, knows if the Hendrick Motorsports team continues winning 
it will be assumed that Evernham left him a winning combination. 
And if the team loses, it will be because he couldn't match 
Evernham's ability. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not trying to replace Ray Evernham,'' said Whitesell, who  
was the hand-picked successor for the man who guided Gordon to 
three Winston Cup championship in the last four seasons. ``I just 
want to make sure the team performs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the perception that he has been set up to fail by  
Evernham's surprising departure, Whitesell said, ``Is it unfair? 
No. It's my responsibility to get it done. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are basically still intact. What Ray has taught us, we are  
prepared to carry on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, so good. Gordon qualified a solid fifth for Sunday's  
NAPA AutoCare 500 at Martinsville Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a good start,'' said Whitesell, who at 35 is the same  
age as Evernham was when he came to the Hendrick team. ``It's what 
we wanted to accomplish -- a top five. Now we'd like to do the same 
on Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon expressed confidence in Whitesell and the rest of the  
Rainbow Warriors crew. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great race team with a lot of depth,'' Gordon said.  
``I really don't feel like we should skip much of a beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evernham was always the man talking on the radio with Gordon  
during the race. Now that duty falls to Whitesell, who has 
monitored those conversations over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be different,'' Gordon said. ``We miss him. If I  
had my choice, I'd love for him to be there. But I support him in 
wanting to do something else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evernham has said he will try to form his own Winston Cup team.  
Talk in the garage area has him doing that with the support of 
Chrysler, which is expected to return to Winston Cup racing with 
Dodge race cars in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	SECOND DAY LEADER: Hut Stricklin was the only driver who managed  
to qualify on Saturday for the Martinsville race. 
</P>
<P>
	Stricklin, one of only nine drivers who made qualifying attempts  
in the second round, turned a lap of 93.576 mph to take the 35th 
starting spot in the 43-car field. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the top 36 make the lineup on speed and all the other  
second-day qualifiers stood on their Friday laps. 
</P>
<P>
	Added to the lineup as provisional starters, based on team-owner  
points, were rookie Tony Stewart, seven-time Winston Cup champion 
Dale Earnhardt, Chad Little, Johnny Benson, rookie Elliott Sadler, 
Jerry Nadeau and Dave Marcis. 
</P>
<P>
	Sent home were Dick Trickle, Ron Hornaday, Tim Fedewa and Morgan  
Shepherd. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	THE PITS: Sunday will be the second test for the new pit road,  
which will have cars pitting all the way from the middle of turn 
four through the middle of turn one. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinsville officials decided to make the change, eliminating  
the backstretch pits, in the interests of competition. But the new, 
narrow road could cause one heck of a traffic jam. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a one-lane pit road now,'' said Ted Musgrave, who will  
start second, alongside pole-winner Joe Nemechek, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, as long as that pit road is, pit position is very  
important,'' Musgrave said. ``Joe is on the pole, so he picked the 
first pit stall. We picked further back in line, where there's an 
opening in front of us and a straight shot in and out of the pits. 
That will be an advantage in not getting blocked in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sure wouldn't want to be in that very first pit stall (in  
turn four),'' he added. ``That's going to hurt whoever that is or 
anybody in that area.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	SPARK PLUGS: Darrell Waltrip, who will start 22nd on Sunday,  
leads all active drivers with 11 Martinsville wins ... Only 14 of 
92 Martinsville races have been won from the pole, but 75 have been 
won from the top 10 ... Posted awards for the race at NASCAR's 
smallest track are $1,930,531 ... Gordon has finished eighth or 
better, including two wins, in his last nine Martinsville starts.

	Clinton Pushes Patients' Rights  
</P>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Praising broad protections written into  
California's new health care reform law, President Clinton urged 
voters today to press Congress to ``do the same for every 
American'' as the House votes this week on a national patients' 
bill of rights. In his weekly radio address, Clinton decried as 
``simply unacceptable'' a provision in a Senate budget bill that 
effectively would take away the right to a timely appeal when a 
health plan denies coverage. He urged the House to reject the 
provision, which he said lawmakers are likely to do if their 
constituents speak up.

	Ex-Student Radical Freed From Jail

	FRAMINGHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Katherine Ann Power, the student  
radical who spent 23 years underground after taking part in an 
armed robbery that ended with the death of a police officer, was 
released from prison today. Power, 49, said nothing to reporters as 
she left MCI-Framingham, where she has spent the last six years. In 
a statement, Power said she ``will always carry my human 
responsibility for the sorrow my actions have caused.'' Power and 
four others robbed a Boston bank to fund radical efforts against 
the Vietnam war. She was waiting in the getaway car when another 
member of the group shot the officer in the back.

	Kosovo Albanians Put Up Barricade

<P>
	KOSOVO POLJE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Dozens of ethnic Albanians threw  
up a barricade today in front of this Serb town's municipal 
building, vowing to stay until a nearby Serb roadblock was removed. 
The Albanians also returned to a previously erected roadblock on 
Kosovo's main road, which they had abandoned yesterday in line with 
a U.N.-brokered deal calling for both sides to dismantle their 
barricades. But the talks, in which the deal was made, broke down 
in the afternoon when the United Nations refused to give full 
control of one school in town to the Serbs.

	Russia, U.S. Sign Nuclear Accord  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The United States and Russia today agreed to  
cooperate in the monitoring and safeguarding of nuclear materials. 
The deal was signed by visiting Energy Secretary Bill Richardson 
and his Russian counterpart, Yevgeny Adamov, after the unveiling of 
a crisis situation center at the Russian Nuclear Power Ministry, 
the ITAR-Tass news agency said. The agreement envisages a Russian 
national program of registration, monitoring and protection of 
nuclear materials, including their transportation, ITAR-Tass said.

	Japan Lifts Nuclear Plant Advisory  
</P>
<P>
	TOKAIMURA, Japan -- The Japanese government today lifted an  
evacuation order for more than 160 residents living near a 
uranium-processing plant that caused the nation's worst nuclear 
accident. Since the Thursday morning accident, which set off an 
atomic reaction and sent three workers to the hospital, people 
living in a 385-yard radius had been evacuated to a nearby 
community center. ``Safety has been confirmed,'' top government 
spokesman Hiromu Nonaka said in a nationally televised news 
conference.

go free, Thailand's interior minister said. The pro-democracy 
rebels released all 38 hostages, and another 51 Myanmar citizens

at the Brooklyn Museum of Art amid cheers of First Amendment 
advocates and jeers of disgusted detractors. Visitors lined up this 
morning to get into the museum, and about three dozen protesters

Catholic League and from animal rights groups. One demonstrator

they have undergone regular out-of-competition drug tests, an 
Olympic athletes' group said today. The International Olympic 
Committee executive board, meanwhile, endorsed proposals for 15 
athletes to be appointed as members of a reformed IOC. The IOC 
athletes' commission met with the executive board today to push for 
a bigger role in the running of the Olympics.

<HEADLINE> President Urges Tolerance of Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Citing recent shootings in California and the  
Midwest, President Clinton says it is time Americans deal with 
``the fear of the other'' that motivates such acts of hatred. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was taking his message of tolerance before gay and  
lesbian supporters Saturday night at a Los Angeles dinner expected 
to raise $850,000 for Democratic candidates -- the largest amount of 
Clinton's three-day West Coast swing. 
</P>
<P>
	Serving as host for Saturday's dinner was ANGLE, or Access Now  
for Gay and Lesbian Equality, which initially met with Clinton 
eight years ago. ANGLE was the first gay rights organization to 
endorse Clinton's candidacy then, and remained supportive despite 
disappointments from his ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy for gays 
in the military and his 1996 decision to sign a law denying federal 
recognition of same sex marriages. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said the dinner was one of the largest events of its  
kind outside Washington. About 1,000 guests were expected, each 
making contributions ranging from $250 to $50,000; Besides Clinton, 
California Gov. Gray Davis, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, 
D-Mo.; and Reps. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., and Tammy Baldwin, 
D-Wis., were scheduled speakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Clinton was addressing a separate dinner at the home  
of director Rob Reiner, which was raising $550,000 for the 
Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The president tested themes at two smaller events Friday night  
with Silicon Valley executives. 
</P>
<P>
	He repeated his support for legislation barring job  
discrimination against gays and hate crimes. Clinton urged the 
crowd to fight for ``the innate dignity and equality of every human 
being'' and work to ensure ``a place at the American family table'' 
for all, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or income. 
</P>
<P>
	The president noted that technology offers vast potential for  
transforming American society, but cannot deliver as long as some 
segments of the population cling to prejudices because they are 
afraid of change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here you are out here, all you think about is the new  
millennium,'' Clinton said. ``Isn't it ironic that the thing that's 
holding us back most ... is our inability to form a community 
around our common humanity because of our vulnerability to 
mankind's most ancient fear, the fear of the other?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we need to deal with that,'' he continued. ``I believe  
my party is on the right side of all those issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he has devoted much of his time in office to  
dealing with ``the emotional and practical and national security 
demands'' of international conflicts spurred by hatreds. 
</P>
<P>
	The same elements in those problems, he said, have appeared in  
America over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, he recalled the slayings of gay college student  
Matthew Shepard in Wyoming; James Byrd, a black man, in Texas; a 
Korean student and a former college basketball coach in a shooting 
spree by ``a crazy guy'' in Illinois; and the death of a Filipino 
postman and wounding of a Jewish child in shootings in California. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see people in this so-called modern world, where we're  
celebrating all of your modern ideas and your modern achievements, 
and what is the biggest problem in the world in America? We are 
dragged down by the most primitive of hatreds,'' Clinton said. 
``It's bizarre.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Saturday, the president spent time in Palo Alto visiting  
with his daughter Chelsea, a junior at Stanford University, and 
doing some work on his presidential library. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was returning to Washington early Monday.

<HEADLINE> Chipper Jones' Prospects for MVP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Chipper Jones was consumed by personal turmoil  
during baseball's offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted having a child out of wedlock and his marriage  
collapsed, tarnishing his All-American image. 
</P>
<P>
	Somehow, Jones managed to put aside those problems once he  
stepped on the field. This offseason, he might enjoy a more 
pleasant task: picking up his first Most Valuable Player award. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the MVP right now,'' said teammate Greg Maddux, who knows  
a little something about awards as the only pitcher to win four 
straight Cy Youngs. ``Look at what the guy has done down the 
stretch. That carries more weight than the first three months of 
the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Jones was solid but not spectacular through the early  
part of the season, failing to make the All-Star game for the first 
time since 1995, when he was a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't just rely on your reputation to get you to the  
All-Star game,'' he said. ``You've got to put up some numbers. I 
didn't do that. That's OK. I'd rather play in the Fall Classic than 
the Midsummer Classic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since June 16, when Jones was at .283 with 15 homers and 41  
RBIs, he has been a hitter possessed. Almost single-handedly, he 
kept the Braves' offense afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Andres Galarraga missed the season while undergoing cancer  
treatment, Javy Lopez succumbed in late July to a gimpy knee and 
Brian Jordan has been plagued by a sore right hand. Jones has 
continued to excel, despite not having a healthy, consistent power 
hitter in the lineup to protect him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy picked a great time to get hot,'' Jordan said. ``It's  
a special time in anyone's career when you have the sense you can 
do no wrong at the plate. He has a lot of confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones probably will become the first player in major league  
history to hit .300 with at least 100 runs, 100 RBIs, 40 homers, 40 
doubles, 100 walks and 20 stolen bases. (Houston's Jeff Bagwell 
also was in the running). 
</P>
<P>
	``From a personal standpoint, it's been great,'' said Jones,  
whose previous career high for homers was 34. ``I couldn't ask for 
anything more. I worked my tail off during the offseason to get 
better and it's been just awesome. It's nice that all the hard work 
is bearing some fruit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' most serious competition for the MVP probably will come  
from Bagwell. The slugging first baseman has put together another 
season of excellence under similar circumstances; the Astros have 
played the whole year without Moises Alou. 
</P>
<P>
	Other National League MVP candidates include Arizona's Matt  
Williams and New York's Mike Piazza. While St. Louis' Mark McGwire 
and last year's winner, Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs, continued 
to bash homers, neither plays for a contending team -- usually a 
prerequisite. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's flattering to be considered,'' Jones said. ``But I've got  
to put that on the back burner. I'm having a good year, but the 
most important thing is helping the club win at crunch time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the offseason of his personal discontent, Jones focused  
on the upcoming season to get him through it. Instead of relaxing 
on the golf course like many players, he put together a grueling 
workout program that added about 20 extra pounds and a lot of 
muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' main focus was to avoid the subpar finishes -- he had been  
just a .256 hitter in September and October -- that were plaguing 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``That guy does all the little things it takes to be ready to  
play,'' Maddux said. ``That's why he's a real easy guy to root 
for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll get no argument from the New York Mets, who were dominated  
by Jones all season but especially in a three-game set at Turner 
Field on the next-to-last week. 
</P>
<P>
	With New York trailing the Braves by a game with 12 to play,  
Jones homered four times in a sweep that propelled Atlanta to its 
eighth straight division title. 
</P>
<P>
	``McGwire does that occasionally, and maybe Sosa,'' Braves  
manager Bobby Cox said. ``But when you're trying to win with only a 
handful of games left, those things jump out at you. He dominated 
the series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, a switch-hitter, used to display most of his power  
batting lefty but is now dangerous from either side. After his 
power display against the Mets, he had 30 homers from the left 
side, 15 from the right side -- in more than 250 fewer at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	``My confidence is equal from both sides of the plate for the  
first time in my career,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to his MVP credentials, he broke Todd Hundley's NL record  
of 41 homers by a switch-hitter. Jones will fall short of the major 
league mark, Mickey Mantle's 54-homer season in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, Mickey Mantle was one of the guys I tried to  
pattern my game after,'' Jones said, laughing off any comparison. 
``It will be a few more years before you can lump me in that 
category.''

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes Sign Top Draft Tanabe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- David Tanabe, Carolina's top draft pick,  
has signed a multi-year contract with the Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanabe will join the Hurricanes on Monday in Raleigh for  
practice, a team spokesman said Saturday. Terms of the contract 
were not revealed. 
</P>
<P>
	In signing with the NHL team, Tanabe reversed his decision to  
play in the Canadian juniors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are extremely pleased to have reached an agreement with  
David. He had a very impressive training camp for just a 
19-year-old player,'' Carolina general manager Jim Rutherford said 
in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The rookie defenseman had played well enough in the exhibition  
season to earn a spot on Carolina's 23-man roster. But Tanabe said 
an impasse in contract negotiations had led him to decide to play 
instead in Kootenay, British Columbia, for the Western Hockey 
League team that drafted him. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanabe, the 16th overall pick in the June amateur draft from  
Wisconsin, said he expected an offer comparable to what the 17th 
pick, defenseman Barret Jackman, got from the St. Louis Blues: a $1 
million signing bonus and a three-year deal worth $2.65 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanabe said the team offered a three-year contract with a  
signing bonus of $500,000. Tanabe's agent, Lewis Gross, said the 
Hurricanes' offer was ``not even half of what Jackman is getting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes have lost $55 million since arriving in North  
Carolina after the 1996-97 season, team owner Peter Karmanos said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes also are embroiled in a contract dispute with  
center Keith Primeau, the team's captain. Primeau, a restricted 
free agent, has not yet reported to the Hurricanes.

<HEADLINE>  McGwire Hits No. 64 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire hit his 64th home run in the first  
inning Saturday, tying him for 10th on the career list and putting 
him two ahead of Sammy Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa was watching in right field when McGwire hit a 3-0 pitch  
from Andrew Lorraine into the shrubbery over the center field wall, 
a drive estimated at 424 feet that gave the St. Louis Cardinals a 
1-0 lead over the Chicago Cubs. It was his first homer on that 
count in at least two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides putting some distance between Sosa in his bid to win  
consecutive home run titles, McGwire hit the 521st of his career to 
tie Willie McCovey and Ted Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has hit 244 home runs the last four seasons, an average  
of 61 per season. Sixty-one was the record held by Roger Maris for 
37 seasons before McGwire hit 70 and Sosa 66 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1990s McGwire has hit 404 home runs, 22 more than Ken  
Griffey Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire entered the game 0-for-1 with a walk against Lorraine.  
</P>
<P>
	Neither McGwire nor Sosa came close to a home run on Friday  
night, the first game of the season-ending three-game series 
between the Cardinals and Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's last three homers have been to straightaway center.

<HEADLINE> Stars' Modano Suffers Head Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Dallas Stars center Mike Modano suffered injuries  
to his head and neck when checked into the boards during Saturday 
night's game against the Anaheim Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could have been career-ending, but it was not,'' said Stars  
coach Ken Hitchcock. ``So we're very lucky, considering the 
severity of the hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock said that tests revealed Modano had a sprained  
ligament in his neck and a slight concussion as the result of the 
hit by defenseman Ruslan Salei. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano was pursuing the puck to the right of the Anaheim goal  
when he was checked from behind by Salei at 4:00 of the second 
period. Modano was knocked off his skates, lost his helmet, and 
slid into the end boards, striking his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Team medical personnel attended to Modano on the ice for five  
minutes, then he was strapped to a stretcher to keep his head 
immobilized. He was taken to Baylor Medical Center for examination. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Modano was alert and spoke to his mother while  
being loaded into the ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Best case scenario is he has a very stiff neck,'' Hitchcock  
said of Modano. ``I don't know how long he's going to be out, but 
it's not career-ending. ... There's no neurological damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Modano was to be held overnight for further observation.  
</P>
<P>
	When Dallas' Brett Hull saw what happened to his linemate, he  
began punching Salei. Salei received a game misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano had two goals in Friday night's season-opening 6-4  
victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins and is considered one of the 
league's elite players.

<HEADLINE> Green Card Renewals May Flood INS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal officials are preparing to renew green  
cards for about 660,000 immigrants during the next year as 
documents issued a decade ago expire. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service has reorganized to  
shorten the waits for obtaining and renewing documentation for 
immigrants to work and live permanently in the United States, 
officials said. In Los Angeles, the agency set up a special office 
to help handle nearly one-third of the total renewals. 
</P>
<P>
	``People should remain calm and not panic,'' said Elaine Komis,  
an INS spokeswoman. ``We're doing everything possible to make this 
as quick a process as possible for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The number of immigrants needing new paperwork, however, worries  
some advocates because the agency already has a backlog of 
first-time applicants for green cards. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge problem,'' said Jeanne Butterfield, executive  
director of American Immigration Lawyers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Green cards began expiring Friday because in 1989 the INS  
started issuing documents valid for 10 years. Immigrants' 
permanent-resident status does not change because of the 
expiration, but they may have trouble getting jobs, obtaining 
government benefits or returning to the United States from abroad 
without a green card. 
</P>
<P>
	Because employers might be unfamiliar with the temporary  
documentation, advocates worried that immigrants will run into 
problems at work or returning from a trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will the employer know if this is legal or counterfeit?'' Ms.  
Butterfield said. ``Will they accept it? It's crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Renewing a green card is expected to take 10 to 12 months and  
INS officials said they are working to shorten that time. Meantime, 
immigrants can get a temporary stamp in their passport that 
designates their residency status. Or they can get a temporary 
photo identification from one of 33 INS district offices 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Another concern is that 900,000 immigrants are waiting to get  
their first green cards. Processing time has dropped from 27 months 
to 12 months, INS officials said. But advocates worry that renewals 
will get a lower priority than first-time applicants. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Komis denied that renewals would be shunted aside, saying  
the paperwork would be handled separately from first-time 
applicants.

<HEADLINE> Asian Boycott of World Cup Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- South Korea will play host to the opening match  
of the next World Cup on June 1, 2002, with the final to take place 
June 30 in Japan, international soccer officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dates for the World Cup were set at a FIFA executive  
committee meeting, at which Asian countries also formally agreed to 
accept a plan for the number of places per continent in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, Asia will get a chance for a fifth spot in the  
World Cup in a playoff with Europe, essentially the same terms that 
provoked a walkout by Asian delegates to a FIFA meeting in Los 
Angeles in July and threats of a possible World Cup boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	``The threat of any boycott has been set off with a red card  
somewhere and will not come up again,'' FIFA president Sepp Blatter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter acknowledged, though, that Asian delegates were still  
not happy about the plan, and by the committee's decision to reject 
an Asian request that the Asian team have its playoff against the 
Oceania representative instead of one from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``You cannot have happiness for everybody, it is not possible,''  
Blatter said. ``But we have peace in the football family now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asia had three automatic berths in last year's tournament and  
got another spot when Iran won a playoff with Australia, the 
Oceania champion. The continent will get four automatic berths for 
2002, with its third team in qualifying playing Europe's 14th place 
team for a fifth berth. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-day meeting of the FIFA executive committee ended  
Saturday with soccer officials setting the dates for the next World 
Cup, which will be jointly hosted by South Korea and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The June 1 kickoff is the earliest since 1986 when the  
tournament was played in Mexico and started May 31. Last year's 
World Cup in France began June 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee officials had discussed starting the finals even  
earlier to try to avoid the area's rainy season, but European 
soccer officials protested successfully that a May kickoff was out 
of the question because the European soccer season would not end 
early enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who today can predict weather conditions in June 2002 in Korea  
and Japan?'' Blatter asked. 
</P>
<P>
	In other issues, Blatter said:  
</P>
<P>
	-- A record 172 entries for the next World Cup were in by the  
Sept. 30 deadline, with others expected by mail that will lift the 
number of entries to about 190. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The site of the 2006 World Cup will be decided at a July 5-6,  
2000, meeting of FIFA's 24-member executive committee in 
Switzerland. Brazil, Germany, South Africa, England and Morocco are 
the five finalists. 
</P>
<P>
	-- FIFA is making progress on a master calendar that would help  
solve scheduling conflicts among different soccer federations. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The prospect of the World Cup being held every two years,  
instead of every four years, has been shelved until after the 2002 
World Cup. ``It's not dead, it's just well guarded,'' Blatter said.

<HEADLINE> Haves Seek Personal Satisfaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEND, Ore. (AP) -- The first time Collins Hemingway saw the  
snowcapped Three Sisters mountains, he was recently divorced and 
driving west with his toddler son to take a job as a copy editor at 
an Oregon newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	After helping the newspaper make the jump to computerized  
editing, Hemingway took a leap himself, landing a job at a public 
relations firm to help create an image for an upstart software 
company called Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	After 18 years in high-tech public relations and marketing --  
seven with Microsoft, where he capped his career collaborating with 
Bill Gates to write ``Business @ The Speed of Thought'' -- Hemingway 
has done what a lot of people who tapped into booming stock options 
have done: retired before they burned out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably had better odds of being struck by lightning than  
ending up where I am now,'' says Hemingway, 49, who grew up poor in 
Arkansas after his father ran out. Now, he's sitting in the living 
room of a custom home with a sweeping view of those same Three 
Sisters he fell in love with driving west. 
</P>
<P>
	The high desert of central Oregon attracts a lot of people like  
Hemingway. People who have worked hard in a boom ecomony that 
rewarded them with wealth. People who have decided work means more 
than just making money and retirement doesn't mean putting their 
feet up. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemingway is looking forward to writing a novel instead of  
speeches for Gates, getting involved in his community instead of 
jetting around the world, and doing a little consulting and 
investing while still having time to backpack through those 
spectacular mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	``All my life I've worked hard solving problems for other  
people, at work other people wanted me to do,'' he says. ``What is 
going to be nice, for what I hope will be the next 20 or 30 years, 
is not that I will be sitting around the swimming pool drinking 
margaritas, but that I will be doing work I want to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the '49ers rushed to California for gold, people who have  
already struck it rich rush to Bend to find another elusive 
element: joy. Between 1990 and 1997, Bend and surrounding Deschutes 
County grew 34 percent, to just over 100,000 people -- three times 
the overall state growth rate. 
</P>
<P>
	As a 30-year resident, developer Bill Smith almost qualifies as  
a native. In the past 10 years he has seen a lot of people like 
Hemingway move to Bend as it morphed from a dying timber town to an 
L.L. Bean-lifestyle boomtown by hooking successful people who like 
to play in the great outdoors. There is world-class skiing, fly 
fishing, dozens of golf courses and wide open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just affluence that causes it,'' Smith says. ``It's a  
willingness of people right now to not chase monetary rewards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's because job movement among companies is now  
accepted, firms are offering sabbaticals, those kinds of things. 
Now it's OK to move to Bend, Ore., and live there and get by on 
significantly less than you would if you applied yourself in a city 
like Seattle or Detroit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like a lot of other folks, Marc Blank and his wife, Cezanne,  
fell in love with Bend after skiing Mount Bachelor. They moved here 
before bothering to figure out how to make a living. 
</P>
<P>
	He had graduated from MIT and medical school but gave up plans  
to be a doctor and moved to Los Angeles to design computer games. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take long to get tired of L.A.  
</P>
<P>
	He began in Bend by doing some freelance work and consulting  
before enlisting a partner from a previous company to start 
Eidetic, a computer game outfit still basking in the success of a 
million-seller, ``Syphon Filter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone working for me is doing well, but everyone could do  
better,'' Blank says. ``What they get is a place that is more 
matching to their temperaments. We tend to keep people a long time 
because they have made a life decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Bill Smith, not related to the developer, found that he  
was not really satisfied after working so hard for success on Wall 
Street, then starting a financial advisory firm with his wife in 
Westport, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably had the best of that lifestyle,'' Smith recalls of  
his life in Connecticut. ``Our business was successful. We were our 
own bosses. And we lived in the town we worked in. But it wasn't 
serene. Horns honked. People wrestled over parking spaces. Most of 
our friends were commuting to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	What they wanted most, he says, was easy access to recreational  
activities. ``One winter we rented a ski condo in Vermont, but it 
took six hours to get there. It seemed that as soon as we got there 
we had to turn around and get home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Looking around the country, they found Colorado too boring,  
Florida too hot, New England too cold. Bend was just right, with no 
waiting list for the tennis club and lots of other people just like 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Though they had put away enough to retire, with two growing sons  
and people who knew their background asking for financial advice, 
Smith and his wife, Linda Zimbalist, restarted their firm. 
</P>
<P>
	But in this life, Smith wears T-shirts and sweat pants to work  
instead of suits. Instead of a BMW, he drives a four-wheel drive 
pickup. 
</P>
<P>
	While his friends back in Connecticut are riding the train home  
from Wall Street, he spends summer evenings practicing softball 
with a bunch of other 50-somethings. He also volunteers at a ranch 
for troubled boys. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got, for the first time, playmates,'' Smith says. ``We  
have no desire to leave and will probably stay here forever.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Admits Smuggling Ring Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- An attorney from Arizona pleaded guilty  
to taking part in an illegal adoption ring in which 17 Mexican 
babies were smuggled across the border and placed in American homes 
for $20,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Reyes, who also kept an office in the Mexican town of Agua  
Prieta, pleaded guilty Friday in federal court to conspiracy and to 
submitting false paperwork. He could be sentenced to nearly 3 1/2 
years in prison and could be fined up to $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Reyes also agreed to pay a total of $125,000 to the adoptive  
parents, many of whom were from New York's Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, two Long Island women pleaded guilty to breaking  
immigration laws for their part in the ring. Arlene Lieberman and 
Arlene Reingold, neighbors in the community of Medford, face up to 
2 years in prison and were ordered to pay restitution to the 
American families. 
</P>
<P>
	The women have yet to be sentenced. Reyes will be sentenced Dec.  
17.

<HEADLINE>  Stars Raise 5 Banners for One Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars are so proud of all they  
accomplished last season that they couldn't raise just one 
commemorative banner. 
</P>
<P>
	Or two. Or even three or four.  
</P>
<P>
	A whopping five flags -- a black centerpiece flanked by two  
smaller white ones on each side -- now hang from the rafters of 
Reunion Arena, all honoring the first Stanley Cup title in 
franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering that the Dallas Mavericks also are tenants of  
Reunion Arena, it would be understandable if the Stars felt they 
had to overdo things just to give the building a championship 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	But team owner Tom Hicks had a different explanation during the  
banner-raising ceremony prior to the season opener Friday night, a 
6-4 victory over Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight we raise five banners, a reminder that although there  
is one championship, it takes many victories to get there,'' Hicks 
told a sellout crowd of 17,001. ``Collectively they say there was 
no better team, no one who worked harder and no one else who 
brought it home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five banners hang directly over the blue line in front of  
the Stars' bench. The one that matters most is the black one, which 
has gold and green trim and the words ``Stanley Cup Champions'' in 
white. 
</P>
<P>
	From farthest to closest, the white ones represent the  
Presidents' Trophy for best regular-season record, the Pacific 
Division championship, the Western Conference regular-season 
championship, and the Campbell Bowl for representing the West in 
the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The middle two smack of overexuberance because they're covered  
by the first one. If a team has the best record in hockey, they 
would have to earn the other two distinctions. 
</P>
<P>
	But coach Ken Hitchcock said there was a more specific purpose  
at work. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see the chronological order of what we've  
accomplished, it brings to life what a long trek it is,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The journey began when the Stars moved here in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
	Their first flag raised was for the 1996-97 Central Division  
championship. Months later, the No. 7 jersey of Neal Broten, a 
longtime star for the Minnesota North Stars, was retired and hung 
next to it. 
</P>
<P>
	After reaching the Western Conference finals in 1997-98, the  
Stars put up three banners: Central Division champs, Western 
Conference regular-season champs and Presidents' Trophy winners. 
Those hang over the other blue line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot of accomplishments,'' said captain Derian Hatcher,  
who had the honor of unveiling the most prized banner. ``But I 
can't say that some of them don't belong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock probably enjoyed the ceremony more than anyone because  
he was saving his emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, the actual winning moment was a thrill and the parade-pep  
rally back home was great, but Hitchcock considered those ``window 
dressing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Seeing the banner go up and getting your name on the Cup,  
those are everlasting,'' he said. ``They are visuals that never go 
away. That's what makes it really special.''

<HEADLINE> Ferret Helps Fix High-Tech Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PETERSON AIR FORCE BASE, Colo. (AP) -- The U.S. Space Command has  
millions of dollars worth of all the latest computers and other 
electronic gear, and plenty of highly trained employees. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it ran into a problem at its new Year 2000 missile  
warning center, the solution didn't come from an engineer, a 
computer wiz or a physicist. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Misty saved the day. Misty is a ferret, a four-legged,  
furry, inquisitive relative of minks. 
</P>
<P>
	To connect new computers at the center, wires had to be threaded  
through 40-foot-long, narrow conduits that already contained other 
wires. 
</P>
<P>
	The job would have driven a human loopy, but Lt. Col. Randy  
Blaisdell, who supervised the building of the center, volunteered 
Misty, his pet for six years. He recalled that ferrets had been 
used to pull wires through tight spaces in World War II-era 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Blaisdell tied a piece of yarn around the one-pound ferret's  
midsection. Misty dashed through the conduit, towing the yarn, and 
then the yarn was used to pull a wire. Misty made several trips and 
her work was done in an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	All it cost was a promise of strawberry Pop Tarts, Misty's  
favorite treat. 
</P>
<P>
	``She really enjoys going through the conduits,'' Blaisdell  
said. ``And she definitely works cheap.''

<HEADLINE> Hatch, Keyes Address GOP Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) -- Presidential candidates'  
demands for drastic tax reform drew applause and cheers during the 
Western States Republican Leadership Conference on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have got to simplify our tax returns. And we've got to make  
it so we don't need the IRS any more,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, 
R-Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch came in second to no-show George W. Bush in a straw poll  
of nearly 500 paid participants at the conference. Bush received 34 
percent of the votes, organizers said, while Hatch got 29 percent 
and Steve Forbes 24 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On taxes, Alan Keyes said the issue is neither that income taxes  
are too progressive nor that they should be flat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with the income tax is that it's there,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Although all the Republican presidential candidates were  
invited, only three attended the conference at Jackson Lake Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes spoke Friday before heading to a Christian Coalition  
conference attended by George W. Bush, Elizabeth Dole and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch described himself as the only Western candidate, a  
colleague and admirer of Ronald Reagan who would get tough on drugs 
and crime and rebuild the military. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact of the matter is, we have a more dangerous world  
today than when we had two superpowers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch promised to support Western causes, such as preserving  
private land rights that he said environmentalists would like to 
take away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to tell you, they're a rough bunch. And they don't  
have any conception of what it takes to run this country,'' he 
said. ``It's time we take it back from them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saving Social Security and Medicare, he said, will require ``a  
conservative president with guts.'' And parents should have the 
right ``to walk their children away from poor, bad schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes warned of a dire ``moral crisis'' brought on by the  
Clinton presidency that is destroying the nation.

<HEADLINE> Ryder Loss Blamed on James  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European Ryder Cup player Jean Van de Velde has  
blamed European captain Mark James for last weekend's stunning loss 
to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of lashing out at the behavior of the American team and  
their fans, Van de Velde said it was ``morally wrong'' that three 
players were left on the sidelines by James until the singles 
competition on the final day. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't make good use of nine players and put three in the  
bin,'' Van de Velde said in Saturday's The Daily Telegraph. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I'm not the best player in the world, but I did finish  
ninth on the Ryder Cup points list, and if you qualify you should 
play,'' added Van de Velde, who blew a three-stroke lead on the 
72nd hole of this year's British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Van de Velde said James did not speak to him after the match.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would expect him to come to me in the near future and talk  
about it,'' Van de Velde said. 
</P>
<P>
	Van de Velde, who spoke openly after he lost the British Open,  
said Europe lost the Ryder Cup because its top players were 
exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has been focusing on the Americans' bad behavior,''  
he said. ``But to me the result had nothing to do with that. We 
lost because we asked too much of most of the guys and because we 
didn't put enough trust in three.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Van de Velde, Jarmo Sandelin and Andrew Coltart  
also sat out until the final day. 
</P>
<P>
	Van de Velde was beaten easily, 6 and 5, by Davis Love III in  
Sunday's singles. Sandelin and Coltart also lost their matches. 
</P>
<P>
	The Frenchman, a member of the European Tour Players' committee,  
said he would suggest that European players in future Ryder Cups 
play every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I haven't really taken part in the match. It has made  
me feel so bad.''

<HEADLINE> Ruth Calls Big Shot in 1932 Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Babe Ruth lived in his own little world, blithely oblivious to  
rules and regulations, anything that might have interfered with his 
carefree approach to life. Call it simply being Babe. 
</P>
<P>
	This occasionally caused problems for the defining figure of  
baseball's first 50 years. There was, for example, the matter of 
his called home run in the 1932 World Series, one of the great 
sports moments of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, anybody who has ever tried to hit a baseball knows how  
difficult it is. It's even more complicated when the pitcher is 
angry. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth never found this much of a problem. He had a lifetime  
batting average of .342 with 714 home runs. In his prime, he 
sometimes hit more home runs by himself than whole teams. He was 
convinced that he could do just about anything he wanted, whenever 
he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	So, when the New York Yankees reached the 1932 World Series  
against the Chicago Cubs, he put that theory to the supreme test. 
In Game 3 of that Series, on Oct. 1, he got into an ultimate battle 
of one-upmanship with Cubs bench jockeys, a confrontation that 
concluded with the Babe standing at home plate, apparently 
predicting that he was about to hit one over the fence. 
</P>
<P>
	A called shot.  
</P>
<P>
	Right there, in the middle of a World Series game.  
</P>
<P>
	With a ballpark full of Cubs fans booing him.  
</P>
<P>
	And a dugout full of Cubs players needling him.  
</P>
<P>
	Sounds outrageous, doesn't it?  
</P>
<P>
	Ruth thought so, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody but a blankety-blank fool would have done what I did  
that day,'' he told writer John P. Carmichael. ``When I think of 
what an idiot I could have been if I had struck out. And I could 
have, too, just as well as not because I had made up my mind to 
swing at the next pitch if I could reach it with my bat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The called shot had its origins in a minor league player  
transaction during the season when Chicago purchased shortstop Mark 
Koenig, who had played four full seasons and parts of two others in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Koenig played brilliantly, batting .353 in 33 games. But the  
penurious Cubs thought the contribution was worth no more than a 
half-share of World Series money. Don't forget, there was a 
Depression going on. 
</P>
<P>
	Koenig was the Yankees shortstop in 1927 when Ruth electrified  
baseball by hitting 60 home runs. He still had plenty of friends in 
the New York dugout and when the Yankees decided he was being 
shortchanged, the seeds were planted for a dandy feud. 
</P>
<P>
	The Series opened in New York, and right from the start players  
from both benches were insulting each other. The loudest Cubs were 
pitchers Pat Malone, Burleigh Grimes and trainer Andy Lotshaw, who 
shouted at Ruth, ``If I had you, I'd hitch you to a wagon, you 
potbelly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It had been a difficult season for the Babe. He missed about  
three weeks with a pulled muscle in his right thigh and there was 
an appendicitis scare in September when he was out again. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in seven years, he did not lead the league in  
homers, finishing with 41, well short of Jimmie Foxx's 58. He was 
not in the mood to be razzed, certainly not by some guy who dealt 
in liniment and adhesive tape instead of balls and strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mind no ballplayers yellin' at me,'' he said. ``But  
the trainer cuttin' in, ... that made me sore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth gave the abuse right back to the Cubs. And on the  
scoreboard, where it counted, the Yankees dominated. They won the 
opener 12-6 with Ruth and Lou Gehrig homering. In Game 2, New York 
won again, 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Series moving to Chicago, Ruth now faced a hostile  
crowd as well as the Cubs bench. The abuse was nonstop and the Babe 
gave as good as he got. In the first inning, he hit a three-run 
homer on his first swing and chugged around the bases with a huge 
grin on his moon face. 
</P>
<P>
	By the fifth, the score was tied 4-4 and the taunting had  
reached a fever pitch. Charlie Root was on the mound for the Cubs 
and his first pitch was a called strike. Ruth, holding the bat with 
his left hand, raised his right as if to acknowledge strike one. 
</P>
<P>
	The next two pitches were balls, then another called strike.  
Again Ruth raised his right hand, for strike two. 
</P>
<P>
	A fan, Matt Kandle, filmed a home movie of Ruth's at-bat. The  
fuzzy first frame shows the slugger pointing, but it's not clear at 
what. It could be at Root. It could be at the Cubs dugout, which by 
this time was howling. Or it could be at the fence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth gave this account to Carmichael: ``I didn't exactly point  
to any one spot, like the flagpole. I just sort of waved to the 
whole fence, but that was foolish enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took two strikes and after each one I held up my finger and  
said, `That's one,' and `That's two.' Then's when I waved to the 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't point to any spot, but as long as I'd called the  
first two strikes on myself, I had to go through with it. It was 
dammed foolishness, but I just felt like doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth hit Root's next pitch into the bleachers and chortled as he  
circled the bases, clasping his hands over his head like a 
triumphant fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just laughed to myself going around the bases,'' he said.  
``I was thinking to myself, `You lucky bum ... lucky, lucky.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Did he really call his shot? Could he have been that audacious?  
</P>
<P>
	An air of mystery surrounded the event because only one writer,  
Joe Williams, sports editor of Scripps-Howard Newspapers, mentioned 
it the next day. Later, others picked up on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Those in the ballpark that day had divided opinions.  
</P>
<P>
	Root was angry at the suggestion that Ruth had shown him up that  
way. His reaction was pitcher-typical. ``If he had made a gesture 
like that, I'd have put one in his ear,'' he said cheerfully. 
</P>
<P>
	Catcher Gabby Hartnett said the Babe was gesturing to the Cubs  
bench, not pointing to the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gehrig, who followed Ruth's homer with one of his own, said,  
``What do you think of that big monkey? Calling his shot and 
getting away with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The debate never stopped and Ruth often was coy about it, adding  
to the mystery. There were times, as in the interview with 
Carmichael, when he took credit for the called shot, and other 
times when he was elusive. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, though, that home run remains one of the most  
talked-about moments in World Series history.

<HEADLINE> Ripken Hopes To Return Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken returned to Camden Yards on Saturday  
for the first time since season-ending surgery nine days ago and 
said he hopes to resume baseball activities by the end of November. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pleasantly surprised. ... I don't want to get ahead of  
myself, but the plan is to spend four, maybe six weeks to let the 
soft tissue heal,'' said the Baltimore star, who underwent surgery 
to a nerve irritation in his lower back on Sept. 23 in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll slowly start a general exercise program. Then I'll pick  
up a bat and a baseball, I would assume, maybe Dec. 1 or late 
November.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, speaking publicly for the first time since the  
procedure, said his decision was made with his offseason 
rehabilitation regimen in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not too far off my regular schedule,'' the third  
baseman said. ``I have a full offseason to recover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By opting for surgery 11 days before the end of the season,  
Ripken temporarily halted his pursuit of 3,000 hits. He is nine 
hits shy of that plateau. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken hit his 400th home run Sept. 2 and batted a career-high  
.340 in 86 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great year and it was a discouraging year,'' said  
Ripken. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken's father, Cal Sr., died late in spring training. Later,  
the Orioles star went on the disabled list for the first two times 
in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mentally, it was uplifting and also the worst,'' he added. ``I  
rediscovered a swing I hadn't had. ... I'd like to what would have 
happened if I had that swing over 650 at-bats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken left the Orioles after experiencing pain in his back  
Sept. 21 in Texas and traveled the next day to Cleveland, where Dr. 
Henry Bohlman performed the 2 1/2-hour procedure after Ripken briefly 
deliberated his options. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I've been worn down. ... The fact that I'm walking  
around and feeling good are good indicators. I don't have a fear of 
trying it again. The only way you find out is to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While his pain may be subsiding, Ripken has maintained a sense  
of humor through his ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to see the scar?'' he asked reporters, pulling up his  
black warmup jersey to reveal a six-inch scar on the middle of his 
lower back, just above his waistline.

<HEADLINE> Ruth Calls Big Shot in 1932 Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Babe Ruth lived in his own little world, blithely oblivious to  
rules and regulations, anything that might have interfered with his 
carefree approach to life. Call it simply being Babe. 
</P>
<P>
	This occasionally caused problems for the defining figure of  
baseball's first 50 years. There was, for example, the matter of 
his called home run in the 1932 World Series, one of the great 
sports moments of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, anybody who has ever tried to hit a baseball knows how  
difficult it is. It's even more complicated when the pitcher is 
angry. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth never found this much of a problem. He had a lifetime  
batting average of .342 with 714 home runs. In his prime, he 
sometimes hit more home runs by himself than whole teams. He was 
convinced that he could do just about anything he wanted, whenever 
he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	So, when the New York Yankees reached the 1932 World Series  
against the Chicago Cubs, he put that theory to the supreme test. 
In Game 3 of that Series, on Oct. 1, he got into an ultimate battle 
of one-upmanship with Cubs bench jockeys, a confrontation that 
concluded with the Babe standing at home plate, apparently 
predicting that he was about to hit one over the fence. 
</P>
<P>
	A called shot.  
</P>
<P>
	Right there, in the middle of a World Series game.  
</P>
<P>
	With a ballpark full of Cubs fans booing him.  
</P>
<P>
	And a dugout full of Cubs players needling him.  
</P>
<P>
	Sounds outrageous, doesn't it?  
</P>
<P>
	Ruth thought so, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody but a blankety-blank fool would have done what I did  
that day,'' he told writer John P. Carmichael. ``When I think of 
what an idiot I could have been if I had struck out. And I could 
have, too, just as well as not because I had made up my mind to 
swing at the next pitch if I could reach it with my bat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The called shot had its origins in a minor league player  
transaction during the season when Chicago purchased shortstop Mark 
Koenig, who had played four full seasons and parts of two others in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Koenig played brilliantly, batting .353 in 33 games. But the  
penurious Cubs thought the contribution was worth no more than a 
half-share of World Series money. Don't forget, there was a 
Depression going on. 
</P>
<P>
	Koenig was the Yankees shortstop in 1927 when Ruth electrified  
baseball by hitting 60 home runs. He still had plenty of friends in 
the New York dugout and when the Yankees decided he was being 
shortchanged, the seeds were planted for a dandy feud. 
</P>
<P>
	The Series opened in New York, and right from the start players  
from both benches were insulting each other. The loudest Cubs were 
pitchers Pat Malone, Burleigh Grimes and trainer Andy Lotshaw, who 
shouted at Ruth, ``If I had you, I'd hitch you to a wagon, you 
potbelly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It had been a difficult season for the Babe. He missed about  
three weeks with a pulled muscle in his right thigh and there was 
an appendicitis scare in September when he was out again. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in seven years, he did not lead the league in  
homers, finishing with 41, well short of Jimmie Foxx's 58. He was 
not in the mood to be razzed, certainly not by some guy who dealt 
in liniment and adhesive tape instead of balls and strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mind no ballplayers yellin' at me,'' he said. ``But  
the trainer cuttin' in, ... that made me sore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth gave the abuse right back to the Cubs. And on the  
scoreboard, where it counted, the Yankees dominated. They won the 
opener 12-6 with Ruth and Lou Gehrig homering. In Game 2, New York 
won again, 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Series moving to Chicago, Ruth now faced a hostile  
crowd as well as the Cubs bench. The abuse was nonstop and the Babe 
gave as good as he got. In the first inning, he hit a three-run 
homer on his first swing and chugged around the bases with a huge 
grin on his moon face. 
</P>
<P>
	By the fifth, the score was tied 4-4 and the taunting had  
reached a fever pitch. Charlie Root was on the mound for the Cubs 
and his first pitch was a called strike. Ruth, holding the bat with 
his left hand, raised his right as if to acknowledge strike one. 
</P>
<P>
	The next two pitches were balls, then another called strike.  
Again Ruth raised his right hand, for strike two. 
</P>
<P>
	A fan, Matt Kandle, filmed a home movie of Ruth's at-bat. The  
fuzzy first frame shows the slugger pointing, but it's not clear at 
what. It could be at Root. It could be at the Cubs dugout, which by 
this time was howling. Or it could be at the fence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth gave this account to Carmichael: ``I didn't exactly point  
to any one spot, like the flagpole. I just sort of waved to the 
whole fence, but that was foolish enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took two strikes and after each one I held up my finger and  
said, `That's one,' and `That's two.' Then's when I waved to the 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't point to any spot, but as long as I'd called the  
first two strikes on myself, I had to go through with it. It was 
dammed foolishness, but I just felt like doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth hit Root's next pitch into the bleachers and chortled as he  
circled the bases, clasping his hands over his head like a 
triumphant fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just laughed to myself going around the bases,'' he said.  
``I was thinking to myself, `You lucky bum ... lucky, lucky.' '' 
</P>

	Did he really call his shot? Could he have been that audacious?

talked-about moments in World Series history.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses Racketeering Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A consumer group plans to appeal a judge's  
dismissal of one of the first lawsuits in the nation to accuse a 
health maintenance organization of racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said Aetna Inc. promised quality medical care, but  
encouraged widespread cost-cutting and penalized doctors who didn't 
increase their patient load. The lawsuit, filed in April on behalf 
of nearly 6 million Aetna customers, claimed the abuses were so 
widespread they constituted a pattern of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge John P. Fullam this week agreed with  
Aetna, the nation's largest health insurer, which admitted that its 
advertising claims of being committed to ``maintaining and 
improving quality health care'' were ``mere puffery,'' but didn't 
amount to fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Fullam on Wednesday rejected the plaintiffs' argument that ``in  
every case, individual physicians ... will be moved to put their 
own economic interests ahead of their patients' welfare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if that happened, the fault would be with the doctor, not  
the HMO, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a  
California-based consumer group representing the plaintiffs, called 
the decision a ``temporary setback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the nation's largest health care company  
admitted in this litigation that its commitment to quality health 
care was 'mere puffery' is a devastating admission that we intend 
to fully explore,'' foundation president Harvey Rosenfield said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to have a tremendous impact on this company's  
reputation and ability to service the marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Aetna spokeswoman did not return a call for comment Friday.  
The company's U.S. Healthcare unit, based in Blue Bell, Pa., 
provides health insurance to 21 million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aetna case was one of the first to accuse an HMO of  
racketeering, a charge originally aimed at organized crime. A 
similar lawsuit filed under federal racketeering laws against U.S. 
Healthcare in 1988 also was dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of Supreme Court rulings over the past two years have  
permitted a broader use of racketeering laws and allowed more 
lawsuits by people who claim to have been harmed by a pattern of 
illegal activities.

<HEADLINE>  Robertson Rebuilding Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inside the 2-million-member Christian  
Coalition, organizers admitted to ``slackening'' enthusiasm while 
founder Pat Robertson struggled this weekend to rebound from two 
troubled years and rebuild his army for the 2000 election. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to see a powerful religious revival,'' Robertson  
predicted at his annual ``Road to Victory'' conference, commanding 
an audience with six of this season's eight Republican presidential 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The certainty of President Clinton's departure is the biggest  
factor rejuvenating a membership weary of the Christian Coalition's 
financial and organizational problems and its lack of any tangible 
effect since helping Republicans sweep into control of Congress in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clinton's over. His term is over,'' said Robertson, who closed  
the two-day conference of 3,500 of his faithful on Saturday. ``They 
sense the possibility of seeing a principled conservative in the 
White House and they realize the importance of Supreme Court 
justices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To a howl of approval, Republican presidential candidate Steve  
Forbes stoked those embers when he rallied the group. ``The clock 
is ticking. In 477 days, Bill Clinton will no longer be president 
of the United States!'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Robertson  
acknowledged coalition members have been ``dispirited'' and that he 
is still ``a way away'' from his fund-raising goal to distribute 
some 75 million voter guides before November 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizational disarray followed the resignations and firings of  
several staffers. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Miller, chairman of the Des Moines, Iowa, chapter, said he  
has felt a ``slackening'' of interest among members. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll say, 'We've read this' and 'We've heard this.' It  
hasn't helped the cause to have all this internal strife,'' said 
Miller. ``A lot of them are now getting involved with individual 
candidates instead of an umbrella group like the Christian 
Coalition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christine White, a five-year coalition member and actress with  
roles on TV's ``Twilight Zone'' and ``Bonanza,'' said she also has 
felt a change in the group's power. ``There's been no action in 
terms of the great needs of the country,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Robertson said he is not giving up. ``It hasn't been easy,  
let's face it,'' he told CNN's ``Evans, Novak, Hunt &AMP; Shields.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, we had a financial hit ... but we're coming back and this  
weekend, to me, was a major turning point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, front-runner George W. Bush, Elizabeth Dole, Gary Bauer,  
Alan Keyes and Orrin Hatch each called on the coalition in the 
cavernous hotel ballroom where it met in flashy, convention style. 
Each showed off conservative -- and religious -- credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan, where Clinton's  
1992 edge over Vice President Bush was 500,000 votes or less, 
Robertson said his coalition could turn out the 1 percent to 3 
percent of next year's vote that could provide the margin of 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have to have a majority. What we have to have is a  
significant minority to sway the swing states,'' Robertson told the 
AP. 
</P>
<P>
	He exhorted members to mobilize: ``If we aren't in the field in  
this coming election, Republicans will lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for  
Separation of Church and State, called Robertson's 
convention-opening speech ``probably the most blatantly 
pro-Republican speech I have ever heard him give in this election -- 
at least as interested in G-O-P as he is in G-O-D.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was talk like that that kept Robertson's group from receiving  
tax-exempt status as a nonprofit religious organization. 
</P>
<P>
	It also landed him in a 1996 government lawsuit charging that  
the group's voter guides, phone banks and other get-out-the-vote 
operations were partisan activities designed to aid Republican 
candidates and should be treated as political contributions under 
federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled in August in favor of the Christian  
Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how his unabashed Republican-boosting squared with claims  
that his activities are nonpartisan, Robertson replied with a grin: 
``Well, my members can have Democrats, too, if they want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee chairman Jim Nicholson dangled  
tempting prospects as he appealed to the coalition to ``do your 
part'' in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a historic opportunity ahead of us -- a chance to  
elect a Republican president and a Republican Congress. It's been 
almost half a century since we last did that,'' Nicholson said. 
``We're counting on you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Reed's address had more of a bucking-up tone to it. ``You  
have made history, you have changed America. Don't you let anyone 
ever tell you any different,'' said Reed, who was executive 
director in the coalition's heyday and is now a strategist for 
Bush, the Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Lynn, an ardent critic of the Christian Coalition: ``This  
is a group on the ropes. I would not never declare this group dead, 
but it seems to be falling into a deep sleep.''

<HEADLINE> Letters Show Gore's Vietnam Dilemma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A series of letters written 33 years ago by a  
teen-age Al Gore reveals the inner conflict he felt over whether to 
serve in Vietnam amid a near-consensus on his Harvard University 
campus that the war was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout much of the vice president's political life, he has  
been dogged by criticisms that he entered the Army to help his 
anti-war father's failing bid for re-election to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	But the writings offer a look at the decision-making process of  
a young man agonizing over a conflict between a gut feeling that 
the war was wrong and a sense that commitment to the war effort 
might be the right thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore offered the letters, written in 1966 to future wife Mary  
Elizabeth ``Tipper'' Aitcheson, for review by historian Douglas 
Brinkley of the Eisenhower Center for American Studies at the 
University of New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Brinkley has written an article on the letters, being published  
next week in Talk magazine, and The Boston Globe reported the story 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brinkley confirmed to The Associated Press that he had received  
the letters from Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the letters Saturday, Gore spokesman Chris Lehane  
said: ``They're accurate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letters track Gore's thoughts as he moved from an outspoken  
war critic to a military enlistee. He also spoke of the ``courage 
and rashness'' of fellow Harvard freshman Denmark Groover III from 
Macon, Ga., who left school to join the military despite almost 
universal opposition to the war from Harvard's student body. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure he didn't do the right thing,'' Gore wrote. ``I  
admire him a great deal; I admire his courage and rashness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old Gore assailed the ``intellectual smugness'' on  
the Harvard campus and said he would be prepared to enlist at the 
end of the school year if he could be convinced that the war was 
righteous. 
</P>
<P>
	One letter said Gore's Harvard colleagues ``seemed so smug and  
confident'' in belittling Groover's ``faith and sacrifice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It made me furious,'' he wrote.  
</P>
<P>
	Gore wrote he was stymied in determining his fate because of his  
fundamental belief the war was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's hard is to reconcile my understanding and admiration of  
Denmark with my belief about the war. It's wrong, we're wrong. A 
lot of people won't admit it and never will, but we're wrong,'' 
Gore wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also had conflicts within his family about the war.  
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Sr. was so outspoken against  
America's role in Vietnam that his opponent, Bill Brock, dubbed him 
``the third senator from Massachusetts.'' The other two were 
liberals Edward Kennedy and Edward Brooke. 
</P>
<P>
	In the article, Gore told Brinkley his mother, Pauline, urged  
him not to let his father's flagging campaign influence his 
decision to enlist. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-war position of the elder Gore was anathema to many  
Southerners who supported the U.S. intervention in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	After three terms in the Senate, he was defeated in 1970 shortly  
before Gore left to serve in Vietnam. Gore spent five months in the 
war zone, working as a journalist for military newsletters.

</P>
<P>
	Organizational disarray followed the resignations and firings of  
several staffers. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Miller, chairman of the Des Moines, Iowa, chapter, said he  
has felt a ``slackening'' of interest among members. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll say, 'We've read this' and 'We've heard this.' It  
hasn't helped the cause to have all this internal strife,'' said 
Miller. ``A lot of them are now getting involved with individual 
candidates instead of an umbrella group like the Christian 
Coalition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christine White, a five-year coalition member and actress with  
roles on TV's ``Twilight Zone'' and ``Bonanza,'' said she also has 
felt a change in the group's power. ``There's been no action in 
terms of the great needs of the country,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Robertson said he is not giving up. ``It hasn't been easy,  
let's face it,'' he told CNN's ``Evans, Novak, Hunt &AMP; Shields.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, we had a financial hit ... but we're coming back and this  
weekend, to me, was a major turning point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, front-runner George W. Bush, Elizabeth Dole, Gary Bauer,  
Alan Keyes and Orrin Hatch each called on the coalition in the 
cavernous hotel ballroom where it met in flashy, convention style. 
Each showed off conservative -- and religious -- credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan, where Clinton's  
1992 edge over Vice President Bush was 500,000 votes or less, 
Robertson said his coalition could turn out the 1 percent to 3 
percent of next year's vote that could provide the margin of 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have to have a majority. What we have to have is a  
significant minority to sway the swing states,'' Robertson told the 
AP. 
</P>
<P>
	He exhorted members to mobilize: ``If we aren't in the field in  
this coming election, Republicans will lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for  
Separation of Church and State, called Robertson's 
convention-opening speech ``probably the most blatantly 
pro-Republican speech I have ever heard him give in this election -- 
at least as interested in G-O-P as he is in G-O-D.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was talk like that that kept Robertson's group from receiving  
tax-exempt status as a nonprofit religious organization. 
</P>
<P>
	It also landed him in a 1996 government lawsuit charging that  
the group's voter guides, phone banks and other get-out-the-vote 
operations were partisan activities designed to aid Republican 
candidates and should be treated as political contributions under 
federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled in August in favor of the Christian  
Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how his unabashed Republican-boosting squared with claims  
that his activities are nonpartisan, Robertson replied with a grin: 
``Well, my members can have Democrats, too, if they want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee chairman Jim Nicholson dangled  
tempting prospects as he appealed to the coalition to ``do your 
part'' in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a historic opportunity ahead of us -- a chance to  
elect a Republican president and a Republican Congress. It's been 
almost half a century since we last did that,'' Nicholson said. 
``We're counting on you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Reed's address had more of a bucking-up tone to it. ``You  
have made history, you have changed America. Don't you let anyone 
ever tell you any different,'' said Reed, who was executive 
director in the coalition's heyday and is now a strategist for 
Bush, the Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Lynn, an ardent critic of the Christian Coalition: ``This  
is a group on the ropes. I would not never declare this group dead, 
but it seems to be falling into a deep sleep.''

<HEADLINE> Five Deputies Charged in Chicago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Five white sheriff's deputies face criminal  
charges for allegedly chasing and opening fire on a black couple in 
their car while the officers were off-duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the deputies were charged Friday with attempted murder  
and aggravated discharge of a firearm. All five also were charged 
with obstruction of justice, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have an individual firing into an occupied vehicle without  
any justification under the law,'' Cook County State's Attorney 
Richard Devine said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for Cory Simmons, 23, and his girlfriend, Dominique  
Mapp, 20, had alleged the June 2 confrontation was racially 
motivated, but Devine said there was no such evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the charges, the deputies thought Simmons had cut  
them off in traffic. They then allegedly chased him and 
subsequently opened fire, shattering the rear window of the car. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. Thomas Lanigan, 34, fired at the vehicle as Anthony  
Bohling, a 32-year-old deputy, drove, according to Devine. Both 
were charged with attempted murder, aggravated discharge of a 
firearm, official misconduct and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies Andrew Remus, 37, Daniel Troike, 27, and former deputy  
Robert Jones, 29, are charged with official misconduct and 
obstruction of justice. Both charges are felonies. 
</P>
<P>
	All five were released on bond Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	The Cook County sheriff's office announced Friday that Lanigan  
was suspended. Bohling, Remus and Troike were stripped of their 
police powers and placed in administrative jobs. Jones resigned 
from his job in July.

<HEADLINE> Mets In Control of Their Destiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just one day ago, the New York Mets' playoff  
hopes were on life support following a disastrous 10-day stretch 
that saw them go from four games ahead in the wild-card chase to 
two games back. 
</P>
<P>
	One dramatic win and a little outside help later let the Mets  
take the field Saturday night against Pittsburgh in control of 
their playoff destiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's back in our hands again,'' Matt Franco said after  
Cincinnati lost to Milwaukee 10-6, bringing the Mets within a 
half-game of the wild-card lead with two games to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing how you can go from out of it to back in it so  
suddenly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All it took was a 3-2 win in 11 innings over the Pirates on  
Friday night -- New York's second victory in 10 games -- and losses 
by Houston and Cincinnati to bring the Mets within a game of the 
wild-card leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds' loss Saturday guaranteed that the Mets would have a  
chance to at least force a wild-card playoff on Sunday. That was 
quite a trip in less than 48 hours after a devastating 4-3, 
11-inning loss to Atlanta on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get hot, then you're not,'' manager Bobby Valentine said.  
``You can't stay hot. That's how this game is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately for the Mets, the Reds did not stay hot, losing  
three straight games. Many of the Mets gathered early Saturday to 
follow the Reds' game. 
</P>
<P>
	When the game was unavailable on their satellite, a group of  
them gathered around a computer screen in manager Bobby Valentine's 
office, watching pitch-by-pitch updates come over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	That's baseball fever in the high-tech, wild-card age.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was doing a little managing, but mostly rooting,'' Valentine  
said. ``It's much more nerve-wrecking watching a game when you have 
no control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before taking the field, the Mets were gathered in their  
clubhouse watching the Astros finish off a 3-0 win over Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	That meant there would be no one-game playoff Monday at Shea  
Stadium between the Mets and Astros. The Mets and Reds would have a 
one-game playoff in Cincinnati if they finish in a two-way tie. 
</P>
<P>
	If there is a three-way tie, New York is automatically in and  
the Reds and Astros play one game in Cincinnati to decide the NL 
Central champion -- the loser would be out of the playoffs because 
it would finish a half-game behind the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can play in a tough division and win more games than  
another team that wins their division and not make the playoffs,'' 
Valentine said defending the system. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of them happens to play another game. Being that we are  
the ones who benefit, then it's really fair. But when did we start 
dealing with what's fair?'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Mets win twice and Cincinnati loses, New York is also in  
as the wild card. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's neat for baseball with all the different possibilities  
going into the last weekend,'' Valentine said. ``I'd rather have it 
neat for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever happens, Valentine knows he probably needs a win  
Sunday. And he decided to stick with Orel Hershiser instead of 
using Al Leiter on three days' rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine took Leiter out after seven innings on Wednesday to  
leave open that option, but with his lack of experience on short 
rest decided to stick with Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's only done it once and that was in 1994 in May, not after  
200 innings,'' Valentine said. ``This is not the time to experiment 
with something you haven't done all year. Especially when we have a 
good option in a well-rested Orel.''

<HEADLINE> President Urges Tolerance of Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Citing recent shootings in California  
and the Midwest, President Clinton says it is time Americans deal 
with ``the fear of the other'' that motivates such acts of hatred. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was taking his message of tolerance before gay and  
lesbian supporters Saturday night at a Los Angeles dinner expected 
to raise $850,000 for Democratic candidates -- the largest amount of 
Clinton's three-day West Coast swing. 
</P>
<P>
	Serving as host for Saturday's dinner was ANGLE -- Access Now for  
Gay and Lesbian Equality -- and organizers said it was one of the 
largest events of its kind outside Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The president tested themes at two smaller events Friday night  
with Silicon Valley executives. 
</P>
<P>
	He repeated his support for legislation barring job  
discrimination against gays and hate crimes. Clinton urged the 
crowd to fight for ``the innate dignity and equality of every human 
being'' and work to ensure ``a place at the American family table'' 
for all, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or income. 
</P>
<P>
	The president noted that technology offers vast potential for  
transforming American society, but cannot deliver as long as some 
segments of the population cling to prejudices because they are 
afraid of change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here you are out here, all you think about is the new  
millennium,'' Clinton said. ``Isn't it ironic that the thing that's 
holding us back most ... is our inability to form a community 
around our common humanity because of our vulnerability to 
mankind's most ancient fear, the fear of the other?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we need to deal with that,'' he continued. ``I believe  
my party is on the right side of all those issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he has devoted much of his time in office to  
dealing with ``the emotional and practical and national security 
demands'' of international conflicts spurred by hatreds. 
</P>
<P>
	The same elements in those problems, he said, have appeared in  
America over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, he recalled the slayings of gay college student  
Matthew Shepard in Wyoming; James Byrd, a black man, in Texas; a 
Korean student and a former college basketball coach in a shooting 
spree by ``a crazy guy'' in Illinois; and the death of a Filipino 
postman and wounding of a Jewish child in shootings in California. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see people in this so-called modern world, where we're  
celebrating all of your modern ideas and your modern achievements, 
and what is the biggest problem in the world in America? We are 
dragged down by the most primitive of hatreds,'' Clinton said. 
``It's bizarre.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Saturday, the president spent time in Palo Alto visiting  
with his daughter Chelsea, a junior at Stanford University, and 
doing some work on his presidential library. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was returning to Washington early Monday.

<HEADLINE> Ex N.J. Police Chief Sues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHERRY HILL, N.J. (AP) -- A State Police superintendent who was  
fired for saying minorities were more likely to be involved in 
cocaine and marijuana trafficking is suing the state for 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Williams' lawsuit, filed Friday, seeks more than $21  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	It claims that Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and former Attorney  
General Peter Verniero, now a state Supreme Court justice, fired 
Williams in February ``because of his status as a white male, age 
59, in order to replace him with a black superintendent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor and the attorney general hung me out to dry,''  
Williams said Saturday from his attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the governor and the attorney general's office  
said they had not seen the lawsuit and declined to comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't, as a rule, comment on litigation, no matter how  
baseless or pathetic it is,'' Whitman spokesman Peter McDonough 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	One day before Williams' lawsuit was filed, FBI agent Carson  
Dunbar was confirmed by the state Senate as his replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy stemmed from an interview Williams gave the  
Star-Ledger of Newark in which the 35-year veteran trooper 
discussed drug arrests and why certain drivers are pulled over. 
</P>
<P>
	He denied that racial profiling was involved and said statistics  
showing that 75 percent of people arrested on the New Jersey 
Turnpike over a two-month period were minorities was not unexpected 
because minorities were more likely to be involved in cocaine and 
marijuana trafficking. Eighty-three percent of the people arrested 
in that same period were convicted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Black Ministers Council of New Jersey was outraged and  
demanded he be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams defended his comments again on Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I told the truth then, I'd tell the truth now,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Since Williams' firing, two reports from the attorney general's  
office have acknowledged racial profiling by the State Police and 
detailed changes to end it.

<HEADLINE> Rabbit Discovery Spurs Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The biggest thing in cancer is this little  
four-word sentence: Tumors make blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not as obvious as it sounds.  
</P>
<P>
	For a long time, doctors assumed that spreading cancer makes do  
with the blood supply already in place. But no. Now they know that 
cancer grows its own. 
</P>
<P>
	This biologic insight has turned out to be among the precious  
few that opens an entirely new strategy for controlling a human 
ill. In the past two or three years, the discovery has become the 
starting point for the most studied, the most tested, and 
absolutely the most talked about endeavor in all of cancer 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	If it leads where scientists hope -- and where drug companies are  
placing big research bets -- then it should be possible to stop 
cancerous tumors by blocking their ability to launch the fresh 
blood vessels needed for survival. To kill a cancer, the thinking 
goes, starve it. 
</P>
<P>
	At this point, no one knows if it will work. But cancer experts  
say they cannot remember a time when there has been so much 
enthusiasm for a new approach to treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea has taken more than 30 years to evolve from the  
universally scoffed-at brainstorm of Harvard surgeon Judah Folkman. 
Now it is an enterprise being chased by dozens of companies, 
ranging from the biggest pharmaceutical makers to one-idea 
startups. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 20 drugs that block the growth of blood vessels are in  
various stages of testing on people with cancer. More are nearly 
ready for testing. At the National Cancer Institute, Dr. James 
Pluda guesses that literally hundreds of other potential ones are 
in development. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's considered one of the hottest areas in all of medicine,  
not just cancer,'' he says. ``I'm not aware of any drug company, 
big or small, that is not working in this field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cancerous tumors rely on the construction of new blood vessels --  
a process scientists call angiogenesis -- to bring in oxygen and 
nutrients. Without this blood supply, they never grow larger than a 
pinhead. The question is whether any of the drugs in the works can 
thwart this basic biological process and thereby cure cancer, or at 
least stop it from spreading. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason so many companies are interested in this is the  
possibility -- and I emphasize possibility -- that it will be broadly 
applicable to all tumor types,'' says Dr. Susan Hellmann, 
development director at Genentech. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, if all kinds of cancer need new blood vessels,  
then one drug that interrupts this process might be good against 
all of them. With this in mind, drugs such as Sugen's experimental 
blood vessel blocker, SU5416, are being tested against cancers all 
over the body, including the colon, lung, kidney, ovaries, breast 
and skin. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-four separate studies are under way with this one drug  
alone. It's even being tested against cancers of the blood, on the 
theory that even this malignancy requires the growth of fresh blood 
vessels in the bone marrow, where the cancer starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``These could be huge drugs, almost like the Holy Grail,'' says  
Peter Hirth, Sugen's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors explaining their enthusiasm for this approach usually  
start by rhapsodizing over its elegant scientific underpinnings, 
worked out by Folkman and others who joined the field later. Then 
they mention the exceptionally promising experiments on rats and 
mice, in which tumors stop growing, shrivel up, even disappear . 
Finally, they get around to the miracles. 
</P>
<P>
	These amazing stories, the against-all-odds recoveries of people  
at death's door, are the most gripping and yet ephemeral of all the 
evidence in this young field. Most of the new compounds are in such 
early stages of testing, and their study subjects are so riddled 
with cancer, that no one can say with confidence whether the drugs 
do any good at all. 
</P>
<P>
	But a few of the terminally ill volunteers in these last-ditch  
experiments have suddenly gotten better. Even skeptics who have 
watched cancer breakthroughs come and go cannot help being 
intrigued. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most of those who have tried the new drugs, Clayton Twigg  
had failed all standard treatments and was dying. He had a rare and 
extremely aggressive form of thyroid cancer that had spread into 
his chest. At one point, his neck grew so big there was no 
indentation between chin and chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Unwilling to give up, Twigg volunteered for an experimental  
blood vessel blocker at University Hospitals of Cleveland. In 
February, he became the eighth patient in a study of the safety of 
combretastatin, made by Oxigene. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the second treatment, bingo! The tumor had started to  
shrink,'' said Twigg, 56, an engineer from Westlake, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of six treatments, doctors could no longer see the  
growth on scans. In August, they decided to operate. But when they 
looked around his thyroid for remaining traces of cancer, there 
were none. 
</P>
<P>
	The news, though obviously good, does not mean Twigg has been  
cured. Undetectable cancer may lurk somewhere in his body. Still, 
his doctors say they have never heard of such a dramatic remission 
at Twigg's stage of this particular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, those who follow drug testing are reluctant to  
make too much of stories like this. Cancer is not an entirely 
predictable disease; people sometimes get better for no apparent 
reason. Furthermore, despite being terminally ill, those admitted 
to drug studies are often healthier than run-of-the-mill cancer 
patients, so they respond better to novel therapies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to give the impression this is a cure-all, the  
silver bullet for cancer,'' says Dr. Scott Remick, who heads 
Twigg's study. ``But there's no doubt this patient has had a very 
significant response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twigg takes part in what's called a Phase One study. It is  
limited to a few patients and is intended to see how much of the 
drug can be given safely. The next stage often includes more 
patients and tests whether the drug has any effect on the tumor. 
But true proof of combretastatin's value must await Phase Three, 
the large, costly comparison study in which hundreds of patients 
are randomly assigned to get the drug or dummy shots, then followed 
for a year or two to see if the treatment makes them live longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the time it takes to carry drugs through these levels  
of testing, many believe it will be four or five years before the 
value of the blood vessel stoppers becomes clear. 
</P>
<P>
	The two highest profile candidates in this field are drugs  
called endostatin and angiostatin that have not even entered Phase 
One. Last year, an optimistically worded article in The New York 
Times (deletearticle) quoted scientists predicting that these 
drugs, discovered by Harvard's Folkman, could become a cure for 
cancer within two years. As cancer fighters, they appear to be 
especially powerful, at least in mice and rats, the only test 
subjects so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Folkman and others pointed out that cancer is infinitely harder  
to cure in people than it is in the inbred strains of rodents that 
serve as scientists' drug proving ground. Nevertheless, the stock 
of EntreMed, the small biotech firm developing Folkman's drugs, 
shot from $12 a share to $85 the day after the story ran. (It since 
settled back into the 20s.) 
</P>
<P>
	Endostatin testing will start this fall on 45 to 90 terminally  
ill volunteers in Boston, Houston and Madison, Wis. Because of the 
publicity, the experiment will be subjected to a level of kibitzing 
rare in early stage drug testing, which usually succeeds or fails 
in anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Folkman, for one, doubts this first human test will show much  
benefit, and disappointment is inevitable. ``People two weeks into 
this will write newspaper articles saying it doesn't work,'' he 
says. ``They will get safety data in Phase One, but efficacy will 
take a long time, if it comes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reason: Blood vessel blockers are nothing like traditional  
cancer treatment. Mainstream chemotherapy drugs are poisons that 
work by harming cancer cells more than they do normal ones. Often 
they shrink cancers fast, even though they may fail to destroy 
every last bit of the disease, leaving some to grow back and kill. 
</P>
<P>
	The experimental drugs are unlikely to make cancer wither and  
vanish -- at least, not quickly and predictably. Some may make 
tumors recede; others may only prevent them from getting any larger 
or spreading further. 
</P>
<P>
	If so, this will mean cancer patients may need to take the drugs  
for months, years, even for life. ``Maybe these drugs won't make 
the disease disappear,'' says Dr. Lee Rosen of UCLA's Jonsson 
Comprehensive Cancer Center. ``But if we can stop it from growing 
and make it a chronic disease, that's an OK thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the drugs in the pipeline were designed from scratch to  
target the body's normal blood vessel construction machinery, which 
is hardly ever turned on in healthy adults. Some target messenger 
proteins, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, that activate 
this process. Some block the enzymes that are necessary for new 
blood vessels to burrow through surrounding tissue. Others, like 
endostatin, seem to inhibit the entire process. 
</P>
<P>
	Some older drugs are being looked at afresh, as well. For  
instance, thalidomide, the disgraced sleeping pill, is being tested 
for its newly recognized effects on blood vessels in people with a 
variety of cancers. So are taxol and interferon-alpha, standard 
cancer medicines that may work in low doses as angiogenesis 
blockers. 
</P>
<P>
	While it is possible these medicines will turn out to be  
effective alone, many researchers expect they will work best when 
combined with standard chemotherapy, surgery and radiation. Lab 
experiments suggest that tumors may be far more sensitive to the 
killing effects of chemotherapy after they have been weakened with 
blood vessel inhibitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that a dual therapy, one designed to go after the  
blood vessel and one to go after the cancer cell itself, will lead 
to a super-additive effect,'' says UCLA's Dr. Fairooz Kabbinavar. 
</P>
<P>
	If these drugs pan out, doctors envision a time when patients  
will get a blood test to see which chemical triggers their tumorsto 
make new blood vessels. Then they will take a cocktail of blockers 
tailored to their disease, wait a few weeks for their cancer's 
blood supply to shut down and come back for a knockout punch of 
chemo or radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been one foot in front of another in cancer medicine for  
the past 50 years,'' says Dr. Stephen Sallan of Boston's 
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. ``New concepts, and anti-angiogenesis 
is just one of them, certainly make me feel we will accelerate the 
pace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For some, such as Clayton Twigg, who were present in the first  
moments of this new attack on cancer, the future may have arrived 
just in time. Once given six months to live, he is planning a 
fishing trip to Canada and thinking about returning to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not out of the woods yet, but I'm keeping my fingers  
crossed,'' he says. ``Hopefully we have found something, if not for 
all of cancer, then at least for those with the kind I have. It's a 
terrific time for science.''

<HEADLINE> Questions Still Haunt Korean Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *and MARTHA MENDOZA    	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writers    	
</P>
<P>
	Old soldiers have spoken out after a half-century, corroborating  
the Korean accounts of refugee killings at No Gun Ri. But for U.S. 
Army investigators, many questions still hang in the air over the 
South Korean killing field -- and in the corridors of the Pentagon 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
	What American officer gave the ultimate order to fire on the  
people packed beneath the No Gun Ri railroad bridge? Did the 
hundreds of civilians pose any threat? How high in the ranks did 
knowledge of No Gun Ri extend? 
</P>
<P>
	The Army investigation announced Thursday will seek more detail  
from veterans about those harrowing hours early in the Korean War. 
But there's one question that only the Pentagon itself can answer: 
Why didn't it uncover the basic facts of No Gun Ri before? 
</P>
<P>
	After months of research and interviews, The Associated Press  
reported Wednesday that a dozen ex-GIs, supporting Korean 
survivors' accounts, said their battalion of the 7th Cavalry 
Regiment machine-gunned a large number of civilians at the hamlet 
of No Gun Ri in late July 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	The Koreans say 400 South Korean refugees were killed at the  
bridge and in a preceding air attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. troops, in only their third day at the warfront, feared  
enemy North Korean soldiers were hidden among the refugees as they 
fled south with retreating U.S. and South Korean forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Several 7th Cavalry veterans told the AP their company  
commander, Capt. Melbourne Chandler, issued an on-scene order to 
``eliminate'' the refugees. But they believe he discussed it with 
battalion headquarters by radio. One veteran said he was told a 
battalion-level officer issued the order. 
</P>
<P>
	But was it cleared even higher -- with the regiment, with the 1st  
Cavalry Division? 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler died in 1970. Other battalion officers were killed in  
the war. And investigators may learn little from the colonel who 
commanded the battalion, Herbert Heyer, now 88 and ailing. He told 
the AP he didn't know about the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Whoever ordered the refugees shot probably felt authorized by  
blanket ``kill'' orders passed down the chain of command. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1st Cavalry Division, standing orders told troops to fire  
on anyone, including refugees, trying to cross their lines. In a 
neighboring division, a general ordered that civilians be 
considered ``enemy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Military lawyers today call such orders patently illegal.  
</P>
<P>
	Did the 8th Army's Lt. Gen. Walton H. Walker, commander of the  
entire warfront, sanction these orders? And what about the 
theater's supreme commander in Tokyo -- World War II hero Gen. 
Douglas MacArthur? 
</P>
<P>
	The fear of white-clad South Korean peasants, citizens of an  
allied nation, stemmed from widespread reports that North Korean 
soldiers were donning white clothes and joining refugee columns to 
attack U.S. units from the rear. 
</P>
<P>
	In interviews and declassified military archives, the AP found  
some seemingly solid instances of such infiltration. But other 
accounts by veterans sounded like overtold hearsay. One retired 
colonel who was there laughed when asked about the supposed 
discovery of a refugee woman with a hidden radio in the 7th Cavalry 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe it,'' Gilmon A. Huff told the AP before his  
death earlier this year. ``I never saw one. But it makes a good 
story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it was, the North Koreans would have had little problem  
slipping around the Americans' rear: At one point, two 
``side-by-side'' U.S. regiments were separated by seven miles of 
unguarded territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, did someone fire on the 7th Cavalry troops from among  
the refugee throng at No Gun Ri? A few veterans said there was 
sporadic gunfire out from beneath the bridge, or at least they were 
told there was. Others said they don't remember hostile fire, or at 
least the American fire going in was so heavy they wouldn't have 
noticed. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what, the lawyers say, the presence of a few  
combatants doesn't justify the killing of a large number of 
noncombatants. 
</P>
<P>
	Before digging into these matters, the Army will be asking  
itself questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, faced with the South Koreans' allegations,  
Army historians checked the archival record and reported no 
``substantiation'' of a massacre. The AP, too, found no 
verification of No Gun Ri in the record. 
</P>
<P>
	But did the Army overlook such circumstantial evidence as the  
standing ``kill'' orders, and the map coordinates placing a 7th 
Cavalry battalion at No Gun Ri? 
</P>
<P>
	Army Secretary Louis Caldera sounded interested in such  
questions when he announced the latest investigation Thursday, 
telling reporters, ``We will also look into the investigations that 
we've done to date.''

<HEADLINE> Man Proposes to Woman on Death Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The only woman on death row in Arizona plans to  
marry a former German neo-Nazi convicted in the 1992 fire bombing 
of a Berlin cafe. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the Arizona Department of Corrections said a  
German national named Ingo Hasselbach had proposed to Debra Milke 
in a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	The two have never met or even spoken by phone.  
</P>
<P>
	Department spokeswoman Camilla Strongin said a signature on  
faxes sent to the prison requesting information about marrying 
Milke match the signature of a German journalist by the same name 
who requested an interview with Milke last year but was denied. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasselbach, reached Saturday at a home in Goodyear, about 20  
miles west of Phoenix, confirmed his interest in marrying Milke and 
his conviction for the 1992 cafe attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love her,'' he said. ``I don't think it's crazy. I feel she  
is an innocent woman. I feel she will be freed someday. That's the 
hope I have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He began writing her last year, and around December they began  
to express feelings for each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took time to fall in love with her,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He proposed in writing about four months ago. She said yes about  
a month ago. But she refuses to see him because she doesn't want to 
endure the strip-searches and other security precautions that come 
with visits. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old journalist, who wrote ``Fuhrer-Ex: Memoirs of a  
Former Neo-Nazi'' after cutting ties with the extremist group in 
1993, was credited with founding East Germany's first neo-Nazi 
party. 
</P>
<P>
	Milke, 35, was convicted of ordering a man to kill her  
4-year-old son in 1989 for a share of a $5,000 life insurance 
policy she had taken out on the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	She spends 23 hours a day in her cell waiting for her appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	Strongin said Milke had applied for permission to marry but both  
bride and groom still need to complete their marriage applications 
and return all the necessary documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the documents are in, prison officials will have 70 days to  
approve or deny the marriage. Even if they approve it, prison rules 
prohibit overnight conjugal visits. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many cases, as soon as the ceremony is completed and the 'I  
do's' are said, the inmate goes back to his cell and the spouse 
goes home,'' said Michael Linderman, a chaplain at the Arizona 
Prison Complex in Perryville, where Milke is behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasselbach said he left the neo-Nazi lifestyle after a 1992  
arson attack near Hamburg that killed a grandmother and two young 
girls. His book was one of the most forthcoming accounts of the 
neo-Nazi lifestyle, telling of bored youths drinking beer and 
attacking foreigners for sport. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been in Arizona for several weeks and is working to get  
Milke's conviction overturned.

<HEADLINE> Garciaparra's Right Wrist Bruised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- American League batting leader Nomar  
Garciaparra should be ready when the Boston Red Sox start the 
playoffs Wednesday after learning his right wrist is bruised and 
not broken. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, who was hit by a pitch Sept. 25 against the  
Baltimore Orioles, was examined Friday by Red Sox team physician 
Arthur Pappas at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in 
Worcester. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bone looks fine,'' Pappas said, ``but there is a tendon  
that travels under the bone that is bruised and that tendon is 
swollen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra left the team before Thursday night's game in  
Chicago, where he hit a two-run homer the night before when Boston 
clinched a wild-card berth. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a chance he would miss the entire three-game series in  
Baltimore that ends the regular season. Red Sox manager Jimy 
Williams said he wasn't concerned if that happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have that workout day Tuesday which will allow him to  
evaluate himself,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox begin the best-of-5 division series Wednesday at  
Cleveland or Texas, whichever has a better record. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, who is batting .357, had asked to return home to be  
examined. 
</P>
<P>
	``It alleviates the concern that (he) had,'' Williams said. ``It  
was a good suggestion by Nomar to go back to Boston.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley: Campaign Starts Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDFIELD, Iowa (AP) -- Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley said  
his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination is ``beginning 
to grow'' as voters begin to draw distinctions between him and Vice 
President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say we have momentum, but I say no. We just have a  
little traction,'' Bradley said. ``We want momentum in January.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In visits to a rural clinic and American Legion post at this  
central Iowa town west of Des Moines, Bradley focused on his 
just-unveiled health-care proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	His campaign has begun to get new attention because of  
increasing signs that he is narrowing the gap with Gore, who until 
recently was assumed to have a lock on the nomination. Polls have 
shown Bradley within striking distance in Iowa, where precinct 
caucuses launch the nominating season early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	While conceding he's picked up steam, Bradley is working hard to  
lower expectations. Meeting with reporters, he noted that Gore has 
the full weight of the White House at his disposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have the president of the United States right by your  
side, willing to help you every step of the way, you have 
entrenched powers in the Democratic National Committee, you arrive 
on Air Force Two and you are ahead nationally,'' he said. ``To me 
that's the favorite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that also works the other way. As vice president, Gore must  
campaign with a large entourage and a security shield, while 
Bradley can run a much lower-keyed and more grass-roots effort. 
Saturday's swing underscored that difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley sat with a handful of people at a rural health clinic to  
talk about health care and spoke to 65 folks at a down-home 
breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that people are beginning to learn more about how I'm  
running the campaign, respecting the voters, reaching out to 
people, telling them what I believe. I think that it's beginning to 
grow,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are looking for politicians to lead from their core  
convictions.''

<HEADLINE> Glance at New Supreme Court Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some other cases to be decided by the Supreme Court in its  
1999-2000 term: 
</P>
<P>
	--Can patients sue and collect damages from health-maintenance  
organizations (HMOs) on the theory that financial bonuses offered 
to doctors who keep costs down can deprive them of adequate care? A 
federal appeals court said yes in an Illinois case. 
</P>
<P>
	--May states block release of police records and other government  
documents to those who would sell the information, even when the 
records routinely are released to the news media? A federal appeals 
court said no in a California case. 
</P>
<P>
	--Can Hawaii limit by their race the voters who elect a  
nine-member board that oversees a program benefiting only residents 
of Hawaiian blood? A federal appeals court said yes. 
</P>
<P>
	--May police chase, stop and question someone for running away  
after seeing them? The Illinois Supreme Court said no. 
</P>
<P>
	--Can public universities use mandatory student activity fees to  
subsidize campus groups that pursue political goals. A federal 
appeals court said no in a University of Wisconsin case. 
</P>
<P>
	--Does a federal law aimed at protecting children from glimpses  
and earfuls of sex-oriented material on inadequately scrambled 
cable TV channels violate cable operators' free-speech rights? A 
federal judge in Delaware said yes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Can states set rules for staffing and operation of oceangoing  
oil tankers even though national and international standards are in 
place? A federal appeals court said yes in a case from Washington 
state.

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Hernandez To Pitch First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Orlando Hernandez, and not Roger  
Clemens, will start Game 1 of the AL playoffs for the New York 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Pettitte will pitch Game 2, followed by Roger Clemens in  
Game 3 on the road. David Cone will start the fourth game, if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Joe Torre announced his rotation for the best-of-5 first  
round before Saturday's game against Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	It's still uncertain whether the World Series champions will  
face Cleveland or Texas when the playoffs begin Tuesday night at 
Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Also unknown was whether Hideki Irabu, who went 11-7 with a 4.89  
ERA as the Yankees' No. 5 starter, will be included on the 
postseason roster. Torre said he will release the 25-man squad on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said there was no one main reason why he picked ``El  
Duque'' over Clemens, a five-time Cy Young Award winner. He called 
Hernandez the Yankees' most consistent starter this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all can't pitch on one day,'' Torre said. ``I could have  
put the names into a hat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez, who won the pivotal fourth game of the 1998 ALCS  
against Cleveland after not pitching for two weeks, is 17-9 with a 
4.12 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it was a big surprise because of the pitching staff we  
have here,'' Hernandez said through a translator. ``I'm pretty 
happy, pretty excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not afraid because I'm positive in the way I approach the  
game. The pressure is there, but I'm not afraid. The most important 
thing is to win the whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez joined the Yankees last season and won his postseason  
starts against Cleveland in the ALCS and San Diego in the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens was expected to become the staff ace after he was  
acquired for David Wells in a four-player trade with Toronto during 
spring training. The right-hander has struggled, going 14-10 with a 
4.60 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was disappointed at not starting the opener, Clemens  
said: ``No, not at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It could have gone either way. We have the luxury of having  
four guys that can be a No. 1 guy at anytime. We're all excited for 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens has reported being too strong when he has pitched with  
extra days off. His Game 4 start will take place four days after 
his normal spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have to work backwards from that day,'' Clemens said.  
``I'll probably throw a couple extra long bullpen session.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The set-up does give the Yankees' two veterans pitchers for the  
games away from Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Joe could go wrong,'' Cone said. ``How many  
teams have Roger Clemens and me in Games 3 and 4.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Employee May Have Misused Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tony Coelho, Vice President Al Gore's campaign  
manager, approved questionable contractor payments, hired his niece 
for a job and may have stuck the government with repayment of a 
$300,000 personal loan while directing the U.S. pavilion at the 
1998 world's fair in Portugal, State Department investigators 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Their report said Coelho and his staff also misused donated  
airline tickets, hired two stepsons of the U.S. ambassador to 
Portugal and had the government reimburse $26,000 in expenses to a 
consultant who worked in Coelho's New York City office. Coelho's 
rental of a chauffeur-driven Mercedes ``was especially 
troublesome'' because the cost exceeded a $500 ceiling while a 
fleet of six vans for the pavilion were under used. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general's report was released by the Center for  
Public Integrity, a nonprofit organization that tracks government 
fraud, waste and abuse and ethical conflicts involving public 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The center said Coelho's actions may have violated federal laws  
governing use of federal funds for international expositions. 
</P>
<P>
	A Gore spokesman, Chris Lehane, declined immediate comment on  
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations surfaced at a difficult time for the Gore  
campaign. Reeling from Democratic presidential challenger Bill 
Bradley's surge in the polls and fundraising, Gore several days ago 
shook up his campaign and moved it to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho, then House Democratic whip, left Congress in 1989 amid  
questions about his personal financial dealings. A legendary fund 
raiser, Coelho once headed his party's congressional money-raising 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho was appointed U.S. commissioner general for the world's  
fair in Lisbon in June 1996, with responsibility for fund raising, 
as well as the design, fabrication and operation of the U.S. 
pavilion. The expo was estimated to cost $8 million, but the figure 
jumped to $9.8 million and ``will likely cost more'' because of 
pending lawsuits, the inspector general said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law says government funds should not be spent unless  
``expressly authorized and appropriated'' for pavilions at the 
international fair. The report said no authorization was granted 
for Expo 98, ``yet U.S. government funds accounted for over 80 
percent of the total U.S. pavilion funding...'' The report 
concluded that the United States Information Agency ``may have 
violated the spirit, if not the letter'' of that law. 
</P>
<P>
	That agency, the report said, turned over control of the  
operation to Coelho who, the Center for Public Integrity reported, 
lived in an $18,000-a-month luxury apartment billed to the USIA and 
used free donated airline tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general said Coelho obtained a personal loan of  
$300,000 from a Portuguese bank so that a private foundation could 
construct a memorial wall in the shape of a wave. 
</P>
<P>
	The loan was listed on pavilion records as a liability and the  
foundation hadn't made any payments as of December 1998. The U.S. 
government could be obligated to pay for the sculpture, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report and further information developed by the center said  
that Coelho and his staff: 
</P>
<P>
	--Directed the USIA to reimburse a New York contractor $26,000  
even though officials ``could not find a legal basis'' for expenses 
such as travel, office space and relocation. The contractor was 
project manager for the pavilion. Other ``questionable payments'' 
initiated by Coelho included dinner for Portuguese guides, laundry 
services, the luxury apartment, and a dry-run reception that cost 
$294 for food and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Hired his niece, Debra Coelho, in violation of USIA  
regulations, at $2,500 a month as an assistant to his deputy. He 
also hired two stepsons of Gerald McGowan, the U.S. ambassador to 
Portugal, at inflated salaries. One stepson received $2,700 a month 
and the other $3,200 a month. The contract ``did not identify any 
duties'' for McGowan's stepsons, the IG said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Did not ``adequately manage and control'' use of airline  
tickets, hotel accommodations and other lodging, free Expo tickets, 
motor vehicles, computers and VIP gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Elaborating on the IG's report, the center reported that Coelho  
also was involved in business ventures in Portugal with at least 
three corporate underwriters of the U.S. Pavilion. Ethics rules 
prohibit special government employees from working on matters that 
would affect their financial interests. 
</P>
<P>
	The center also described Coelho's efforts to gain public  
funding after private fund raising failed. 
</P>
<P>
	It said Coelho first secured support of a friend, then-Navy  
Secretary John Dalton. A House-Senate conference report strongly 
suggested that the service participate as a sponsor of the U.S. 
exhibit on ocean research and technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho then worked out a pledge from the National Institute of  
Environmental Health Sciences. As in the Navy's case, a paragraph 
in a conference report urged NIEHS ``to lend its expertise and 
provide technical assistance'' to the exposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before the Expo opened, the IG said the two agencies --  
armed with the legislative encouragement -- kicked in some $6.5 
million, or 82 percent of the funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Samuel Wilson, the institute's deputy director, said the agency  
originally wanted to contribute $500,000 -- not the $4 million 
donated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know the origin of the idea of our involvement,''  
Wilson told the center. ``It's safe to say it wasn't an 
institute-developed idea.''

could include a nuclear exchange, former U.S. defense secretary 
William Perry said Saturday at an arms control symposium. 
</P>
<P>
	``The losing side might be tempted to use nuclear weapons in a  
desperate attempt to save the day,'' Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking in a panel discussion that ended a two-day Nobel  
Symposium called ``A future arms control agenda,'' Perry said he 
thinks it's likely that more nations will obtain nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year's India test ruptured the fragile barrier of the  
(Non Proliferation Treaty). Not surprisingly, Pakistan quickly 
followed suit, and my expectation is that we will see Iran, Iraq 
and possibly Syria go nuclear as well,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Francesco Calogero of Italy, a former executive of the Pugwash  
Conference on Science and World Affairs, winner of the 1995 Nobel 
Peace Prize, said the availability of highly enriched uranium -- the 
kind used in nuclear weapons -- is particularly worrisome. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that there is an even chance that a nuclear explosion  
in a city will occur in the next decade,'' he said. ``This nuclear 
explosion will be due to a terrorist act, or perhaps be made by ... 
some crazy people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 220 pounds of highly enriched uranium is needed to  
make a bomb, and there's more than 2.2 million pounds of the 
material in Russia alone, Calogero said. Nations, organizations and 
``very rich individuals'' ought to help reduce the risk by offering 
payment for de-enriching of uranium, Calogero said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Gun Makers Talk With Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the first time since they have been sued  
over gun-related violence, gun manufacturers started talking with 
various cities on how to improve safety and make weapons tougher to 
get. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations, held Monday in Washington, were an initial  
effort to settle the suits brought by cities across the country, 
which seek millions of dollars in damages to recoup costs related 
to gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an opportunity and an obligation to seek an agreement  
that could achieve some of our objectives and avoid a long and 
costly legal procedure,'' Connecticut Attorney General Richard 
Blumenthal said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	He attended the meeting, along with several other  
representatives from other cities and states. 
</P>
<P>
	Unidentified gun industry executives who attended said they  
would consider a list of the cities' demands, including mandatory 
safety devices and a crackdown on corrupt gun retailers, The New 
York Times reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Present were Ed Shultz, chief executive of Smith and Wesson  
Corp., and officials from Sturm, Ruger and Co., Colt's 
Manufacturing, O.F. Mossberg and sons, Taurus, Glock and Beretta, 
the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several gun makers, including the so-called Ring of Fire  
companies that encircle Los Angeles, were not invited. Also not 
invited was Washington attorney John Coale, one of a group of 
lawyers who represent Newark, N.J., New Orleans, Atlanta, Cleveland 
and Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials are seeking tighter controls by manufacturers  
over distribution to wholesalers and retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	With the goal of curbing the supply of handguns to criminals and  
juveniles through corrupt dealers, the companies would be cut off 
from those who supply a high number of guns used in crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Any agreement would be overseen by an independent monitor picked  
by the cities and approved and paid for by the gun makers, lawyers 
involved in the talks told the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Other demands include placing external locks on all guns,  
incorporating new technology allowing only owners to fire their 
guns and ending the sale of handguns at gun shows and on the 
Internet. In addition, city officials want advertisements stopped 
that claim guns increase home safety.

<HEADLINE> Schott Hands Over Control of Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Marge Schott said she wouldn't change anything  
about the way she ran the Cincinnati Reds as controlling partner 
for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what I would have done differently, except for  
stood up and fought with the boys a little more,'' Schott, 71, said 
in a telephone interview Friday after completing a $67 million deal 
to pass control of the Reds to their new chief executive officer, 
Carl Lindner. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she still enjoys seeing fans, especially children, at  
her front-row box seat in Cinergy Field. She plans to keep the box 
seat and wants to stay involved in the annual parade that marks 
baseball's opening day in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball's history in this country,'' Schott said. ``The fans  
are the most important thing. It's nothing without the fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During her time in charge of the sport's oldest professional  
team, baseball officials suspended and scolded the feisty 
businesswoman for making remarks that offended minorities and 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	She offended several Reds players and employees, including a  
former team controller who sued her. But she said they all are part 
of fond memories. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always cared about my people who work for me,'' she said.  
``The Reds have been a very dear thing to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schott, a Cincinnati auto dealer, became a limited partner of  
the team in 1981, bought the controlling share in 1984 and was in 
charge when the Reds won the 1990 World Series. She said selling 
the Reds while the team is in contention for the playoffs is 
particularly difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sad day. Yes, it is, honey. I don't like to sell  
things. I'm a keeper, not a seller,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very much hands-on. I did try and bring some good  
players in and everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what she plans to do next, she replied, ``I don't know,  
honey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's owners approved the sale on Sept. 15, clearing the  
way for the official closing of the deal Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindner, who has known Schott for a number of years, said she  
accomplished many things as managing partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has always kept the fans first in her mind,'' Lindner  
said. ``For that, all of Cincinnati should thank her and join me in 
wishing her the very best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schott remains a limited partner, holding one of the Reds' 13  
ownership shares. The other partners are Cincinnati businessman 
George L. Strike; Wall Street money manager William Reik Jr.; 
Multimedia of Cincinnati Inc., a subsidiary of Gannett Co. Inc.; 
the Louise Nippert Trust, the Carl A. Kroch Trust and the 
Lindner-controlled Great American Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
	John Allen, installed by baseball to run the team's daily  
operations while Schott was suspended, remains the team's managing 
executive.

<HEADLINE> No Agreement on Palestinian Passage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel and the Palestinians failed to reach  
agreement Saturday on conditions for the so-called safe passage 
Palestinians use to cross Israeli territory between the West Bank 
and the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	As the route was to have opened Sunday, the delay is the first  
major setback in the implementation of the deal signed by Israeli 
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at 
the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Israel has been ahead of schedule in releasing 200  
Palestinian security prisoners and handing 7 percent of the West 
Bank to Palestinian administrative control. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian negotiator Jamil Tarifi said the Israelis still  
insist on the right to arrest Palestinians traveling on the safe 
passage and refuse to permit the Palestinian Authority to issue the 
magnetic cards which are to be used by Palestinian drivers making 
the crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We consider these points degrading and humiliating to the  
Palestinian people and the Palestinian Authority,'' said Tarifi, 
who is Minister for Civil Affairs in the Palestinian Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben Ami expressed confidence  
that understanding will be reached in the next few days ``on the 
basis of the two key principles from Israel's point of view - 
security and sovereignty,'' his spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli officials have said Israel must retain control over  
which Palestinians enter Israeli territory and must be able to 
arrest militants who pose a threat to security.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Farmers Unfazed by Volcano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LLOA, Ecuador (AP) -- For the past year, the Guagua Pichincha  
volcano has menaced the small villages and dairy farms on its upper 
slopes. 
</P>
<P>
	But when authorities announced this week that an eruption could  
be just days away and warned villagers to get out, many refused. 
How could they leave behind their prized dairy cows, their only 
source of income? 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have jobs, just our cows. They're all we have,''  
60-year-old Enriqueta Maygua explained in anguish as she milked one 
of her 10 cows under the volcano's shadow. 
</P>
<P>
	Her graying hair pulled into a long braid down her back, Maygua  
told how the villagers of Lloa, just outside Quito, used to work as 
``huasipungueros'' -- Quechua for ``sharecroppers'' -- on a sprawling 
hacienda. Land reform in 1973 broke it up and distributed small 
plots of land to the estate's workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Talking about how much it meant to the villagers to become  
property owners themselves, she said, ``If we don't milk our cows, 
they will become ill and soon die, and we will have nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lloa's farmers were relieved when seismic activity in the  
volcano waned Friday. But scientists warned that the 15,840-foot 
mountain may be gathering strength for renewed activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say Quito's 1.4 million inhabitants are not exposed to  
lava flows, since the volcano's crater faces away from the city and 
another peak of the mountain stands as a natural barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	But authorities warn that heavy ash from an eruption mixed with  
rain could cause mudslides in Quito neighborhoods built high up on 
the eastern slopes of Pichincha. 
</P>
<P>
	And villages located on the southern, western and northern  
slopes of the mountain could be directly threatened by lava flows. 
Officials say Lloa -- just 3,600 feet below Pichincha's active peak 
-- is the most exposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Located amid green pastures and yellow fields of barley on  
Pichincha's southern slope, Lloa is a prosperous village of 650 
residents with concrete-block homes and clean streets. About 2,200 
more people live in outlying hamlets and isolated farm houses. 
</P>
<P>
	Army troops moved into town Tuesday and urged people to evacuate  
to Quito. Many did, especially women with small children, moving 
into the shelters or into homes of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	But at least 150 people have stayed in Lloa to look after the  
community's farm animals. Hundreds more are believed to be hanging 
on in outlying hamlets, said Abraham Viracucha, 53, president of 
Lloa's governing board. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women who have gone to Quito to stay in shelters with their  
children return early each day to help milk cows,'' Viracucha said, 
standing in a pasture surrounded by villagers who had herded cows 
together to be milked. 
</P>
<P>
	Viracucha says the area's poor farmers have 1,800 to 2,000 dairy  
cows, most of them still pasturing high up on the slopes of the 
volcano. 
</P>
<P>
	A government-run experimental farm with 2,500 head of sheep is  
allowing villagers to keep 350 cows in pastures lower down on the 
slopes, on a plateau better situated to escape the flow of lava. 
</P>
<P>
	But a worried Viracucha says the farm's administrators have  
refused to allow more cattle to be kept on the farm even though 
there is sufficient pasture. 
</P>
<P>
	A cousin, Marcia Viracucha, 37, owns a small storefront grocery  
a block from the village plaza. Hers is the only shop that is not 
locked and boarded up. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why she had not left when soldiers urged her to evacuate,  
she shrugged and said, ``Who knows when one is going to die. It's 
in God's hands.''

<HEADLINE> Ecton Park Wins Super Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSSIER CITY, La. (AP) -- Ecton Park, the winner of the Jim Dandy  
at Saratoga in August, beat Menifee, the runner-up in both the 
Kentucky Derby and Preakness, by two lengths to win the $500,000 
Super Derby at Louisiana Downs on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Alex Solis and carrying 126 pounds, Ecton Park covered  
1 1/4 miles in 2:00.4, 1-10th of a second off the track record, and 
returned $8.80, $3.20 and $2.40. 
</P>
<P>
	``It went very much like I hoped it would,'' Solis said. ``I  
just wanted to track the first two horses and make my move whenever 
I felt like it was needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ecton Park won $300,000, increasing his career totals to  
$852,635. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, who finished two lengths ahead of Pineaff in the field  
of eight 3-year-olds, paid $2.40 and $2.10. He earned $100,000 to 
increase his career earnings to $1,732,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Pineaff was $2.60 to show.  
</P>
<P>
	Menifee was allowed to settle off the pace and made a move three  
wide with a quarter-mile remaining, but could do little with the 
winner through the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kind of scrambled the first few jumps,'' said Menifee's  
jockey, Pat Day. ``He got up on his feet around the first turn and 
were right behind the eventual winner where I wanted to be. I 
kicked on him off the turn and the other horse opened up on us. We 
went after him in earnest and we just weren't able to run him 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Answer Lively, the 1998 2-year-old champion, took the early  
lead, but Ecton Park stayed on pace and made his move about the 
three-quarter pole. 
</P>
<P>
	``Around the three-eighths pole, I asked my horse a little bit  
and I got him going and coming to the three-sixteenths, I let him 
roll,'' Solis said. ``It worked out very good for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Gonzales rode Answer Lively to a sixth-place finish. He  
said the horse started off well but then started to make some 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he displaced his palette again,'' Gonzales said. ``He  
was making the noise and I started to pull him up a bit and then he 
opened up again but then started making the noise again and 
displaced again. I think he just got too excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Completing the order of finish from fourth place were:  
Temperence Time, Brassy Wells, Answer Lively, Captain Countdown and 
Bosque County.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Manager's Future Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- For Ray Miller, the writing is on the warehouse  
wall at Camden Yards: In all likelihood, he will be fired as 
manager of the Baltimore Orioles soon after the season ends Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Miller said Saturday that he has absolutely no idea about  
his future. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite carrying one of the highest payrolls in baseball over  
the past two years, the Orioles have endured two straight losing 
seasons under Miller's direction. This, after advancing to the 
American League championship series in each of the previous two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the terms of Miller's contract, the Orioles have 72  
hours after Sunday's finale to decide whether to retain him. He 
expects to learn his fate during a meeting with owner Peter 
Angelos. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the club option. Either it will be taken or it won't,''  
he said Saturday. ``I've talked to the owner quite a bit this week. 
It's been amicable and we've talked about a lot of things. I don't 
know what's going to happen. I'll talk to him probably Monday and 
find out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday afternoon, Miller was more concerned with getting the  
Orioles by the final two games without a host of injured players. 
After finding emergency replacements for injured starting pitchers 
Friday and Saturday, he learned that Sunday's scheduled starter, 
Sidney Ponson, can't pitch because of a sore shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been that kind of season. First baseman Will Clark, third  
baseman Cal Ripken and second baseman Delino DeShields all had 
multiple stints on this disabled list. Pitchers Mike Mussina, 
Arthur Rhodes and Scott Kamieniecki were lost for extended periods 
of time. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitching was horrid during the first half of the season,  
dooming Baltimore to a 36-51 record at the All-Star break. A 
sparkling second half, highlighted by a 13-game winning streak in 
September, has given Miller a spark of hope that he might be around 
to guide a younger team in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been very proud of this club. This club should have  
folded three times this year, absolutely folded,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, the surge convinced Miller that he maintained  
the respect of a club comprised heavily of veterans with sizable 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never had any problem with anybody out here, other than  
the time with Albert (Belle) in Florida,'' Miller said, referring 
to an argument with Belle after the manager removed him in a 
double-switch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never had anybody (complaining) because they're not in  
the lineup or want to play more,'' Miller contended. ``I try to do 
the best I can to talk to a guy when he's struggling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore fans, he said, have been behind him despite the  
Orioles' fourth-place finish in the AL East. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing I've been most proud of is the fan response has been  
great for me,'' he said. ``My mail's been great, and I've only been 
booed two or three times at length, and most of the times it's been 
when I've gone out to pull somebody and they want him to stay in. 
They don't the guy's got 130 pitches or whatever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's easy to cite injuries, bad pitching and poor chemistry for  
the Orioles' woes. But Miller knows where the blame ultimately 
lies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody has to be responsible, so if you're the guy, I guess  
you've got to be responsible,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That may be what Angelos tells him Monday. Either way, Miller  
has already thought about life after managing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say I'm done (with baseball), but I'm not going to  
go looking for a job,'' he said. ``This is where I wanted to be, 
this is where I'd like to stay. If it doesn't work out, I'm going 
to do some normal things. I've been doing this since 1963.''

<HEADLINE> Lindros' Future Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VORHEES, N.J. (AP) -- Eric Lindros sits at his locker, beads of  
sweat dripping from his nose. A T-shirt clings to his muscles, 
which have returned to their rock-hard state after a painful 
comeback from a collapsed lung. 
</P>
<P>
	He is out of breath but has plenty to say once he catches it.  
</P>
<P>
	Lindros, the Philadelphia Flyers' franchise player, is ready for  
his annual ritual. Each year, he pursues the Stanley Cup mightily 
and gets blamed if the Flyers come up short. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who know him -- his teammates, his coach, even the general  
manager he refuses to talk about, Bob Clarke -- see it as an unfair 
burden placed on one of the NHL's best players who has yet to win 
the ultimate prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros, who has spent all of his adult life trying to live up  
to the label of superstar, sees it that way, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``One person wins a Stanley Cup. That's right. Sure,'' said  
Lindros, his sharp words cutting through the music of Nirvana after 
a grueling practice. ``I'm not even getting into that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros is growing tired of the expectations he once likened to  
the weight of a piano, before the Flyers were swept by Detroit in 
the 1997 Stanley Cup finals. But with Lindros and nine teammates 
signed only through this season, including longtime linemate John 
LeClair, these Flyers could be entering their final days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I offered them a one-year deal that basically made sure that I  
was going to play here this year,'' said Lindros, healthy again 
after missing the Flyers' playoff series last season with the 
collapsed lung. ``As far as anything else above and beyond that, I 
want to see the direction that the team goes. I want to see what 
happens this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ominous words, considering Lindros is the man around whom the  
Flyers have built their Stanley Cup hopes for the better part of a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was offered around the league a few years ago, I  
thought about what it would be like playing in different cities,'' 
Lindros said. ``If they want to make a trade now, if they want to 
move me, they move me. I'm not going to worry about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ruthless style that is unmistakably Lindros' -- the bursts of  
speed, the crushing body checks, the look in his eyes that scouts 
first saw when he was a teen-ager -- does him little good in the 
arena of public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I've seen that in all my travels, the way the  
burden is being put solely on the lap of Eric,'' goaltender John 
Vanbiesbrouck said. ``He's a great team guy, a great team leader. 
Anybody who says anything else doesn't know him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros, 26, signed a one-year contract for this season that  
will pay him $8.5 million plus incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've made it clear through my contract stance that I don't  
have intentions of moving,'' Lindros said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clarke, the fiery GM who was captain of the Flyers' last  
Stanley Cup championship team in 1975, was disappointed when 
Lindros wouldn't sign a long-term deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be better for the security of the club, I think -- the  
team, the players, everybody,'' Clarke said. ``We asked if they 
were interested, and they said they were not interested in the 
long-term. So that was fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke rankled Lindros last summer when he proclaimed that if  
Lindros wanted to be the highest-paid player in hockey, it was time 
for him to play that way. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros, Clarke and team chairman Ed Snider had a private  
meeting last month at the team's training camp in Peterborough, 
Ontario. No one will divulge what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``To say you're a failure because you don't win the Cup is  
probably being a little harsh,'' said Clarke, who nonetheless 
stands by last summer's ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros has been at the center of maelstroms like this ever  
since being picked No. 1 in the 1991 draft by Quebec. He balked at 
playing for the Nordiques and was traded to the Flyers for six 
players, two draft picks and $15 million. Snider, who promised an 
imminent parade down Broad Street, hired Clarke two years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, the Flyers were knocked out of the playoffs in the  
first round for the second straight year, losing to Toronto. They 
lost without Lindros, who had the biggest health scare of his life 
when teammate Keith Jones found him languishing in the bathtub of

	Lindros was checked or fell on his stick in a game against the  
Predators, puncturing his lung. With an incredible threshold for 
pain, Lindros left the rink believing he was just bruised. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jones found him soaking in the bathtub, he knew the captain  
was in trouble. Six pints of blood had seeped into the lung, but 
Lindros believes he would have been healthy enough to play in the 
second round. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bridge we didn't cross,'' Lindros said.  
</P>
<P>
	Once again, Lindros is expected to lead the charge.

<HEADLINE> IOC Suspends Afghan Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- The IOC on Saturday suspended  
Afghanistan's Olympic Committee on grounds that it can no longer 
function under the Taliban regime in Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
	Francois Carrard, director general of the International Olympic  
Committee, said another organization with headquarters in Kabul, 
under Taliban rule, claims it is recognized as a national Olympic 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The old committee, ``does not control the sport anymore,''  
Carrard said. ``It's practically disbanded. Its president is in 
exile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban-run committee does not meet IOC requirements for  
recognition, he said. Among other things, the committee bans women 
from competing in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said the suspension did not mean the IOC had withdrawn  
its recognition of Afghanistan. He said the IOC would try to find a 
formula to help any Afghan athletes compete in next year's Sydney 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban, or the students of Islam, are Sunni Muslims and  
mostly Pashtuns -- Afghanistan's majority ethnic group. They rule 90 
percent of the country, including Kabul, and are battling the 
opposition alliance in a bid to capture the remaining parts of 
Afghanistan. The Taliban took over Kabul in September 1996.

<HEADLINE> Stars Raise 5 Banners for One Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars are so proud of all they  
accomplished last season that they couldn't raise just one 
commemorative banner. 
</P>
<P>
	Or two. Or even three or four.  
</P>
<P>
	A whopping five flags -- a black centerpiece flanked by two  
smaller white ones on each side -- now hang from the rafters of 
Reunion Arena, all honoring the first Stanley Cup title in 
franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering that the Dallas Mavericks also are tenants of  
Reunion Arena, it would be understandable if the Stars felt they 
had to overdo things just to give the building a championship 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	But team owner Tom Hicks had a different explanation during the  
banner-raising ceremony prior to the season opener Friday night, a 
6-4 victory over Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight we raise five banners, a reminder that although there  
is one championship, it takes many victories to get there,'' Hicks 
told a sellout crowd of 17,001. ``Collectively they say there was 
no better team, no one who worked harder and no one else who 
brought it home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five banners hang directly over the blue line in front of  
the Stars' bench. The one that matters most is the black one, which 
has gold and green trim and the words ``Stanley Cup Champions'' in 
white. 
</P>
<P>
	From farthest to closest, the white ones represent the  
Presidents' Trophy for best regular-season record, the Pacific 
Division championship, the Western Conference regular-season 
championship, and the Campbell Bowl for representing the West in 
the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The middle two smack of overexuberance because they're covered  
by the first one. If a team has the best record in hockey, they 
would have to earn the other two distinctions. 
</P>
<P>
	But coach Ken Hitchcock said there was a more specific purpose  
at work. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see the chronological order of what we've  
accomplished, it brings to life what a long trek it is,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The journey began when the Stars moved here in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
	Their first flag raised was for the 1996-97 Central Division  
championship. Months later, the No. 7 jersey of Neal Broten, a 
longtime star for the Minnesota North Stars, was retired and hung 
next to it. 
</P>
<P>
	After reaching the Western Conference finals in 1997-98, the  
Stars put up three banners: Central Division champs, Western 
Conference regular-season champs and Presidents' Trophy winners. 
Those hang over the other blue line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot of accomplishments,'' said captain Derian Hatcher,  
who had the honor of unveiling the most prized banner. ``But I 
can't say that some of them don't belong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock probably enjoyed the ceremony more than anyone because  
he was saving his emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, the actual winning moment was a thrill and the parade-pep  
rally back home was great, but Hitchcock considered those ``window 
dressing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Seeing the banner go up and getting your name on the Cup,  
those are everlasting,'' he said. ``They are visuals that never go 
away. That's what makes it really special.''

<HEADLINE> IOC: No Need To Punish Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- The IOC official who led the internal  
investigation into the Salt Lake City scandal said Saturday he saw 
no need for punitive action in connection with Atlanta's winning 
bid for the 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	International Olympic Committee vice president Dick Pound said  
the excesses related to Atlanta did not compare with those stemming 
from Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound led an inquiry which led to the expulsion or resignation  
of 10 IOC members in connection with gifts, cash, college 
scholarships and other favors accepted by members and their 
families during the Salt Lake City bid. 
</P>
<P>
	A report submitted to Congress last month detailed a similar  
pattern of gift-giving during the Atlanta bid. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pound, attending an IOC executive board meeting in Athens,  
said: ``I don't believe there's anything in that report that would 
lead to any further action against any members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said the IOC would rely on the findings of its new ethics  
commission, which announced last week it would review the Atlanta 
report for any possible misconduct by IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound complained that no IOC members were contacted to give  
their version of events before the Atlanta report, prepared by 
former Attorney General Griffin Bell, was made public. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report detailed a lot of offers that were pushed upon IOC  
members and were not accepted,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., has said the report showed ``votes  
were for sale'' and said the Atlanta bid was surrounded by a 
``culture of corruption.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Upton has scheduled a House hearing on the Atlanta bid Oct. 14  
and requested that IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch appear as a 
witness. He has threatened to subpoena Samaranch if he declines to 
testify voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC director general Francois Carrard said Samaranch was  
expected to announce Sunday whether he would go to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the pressures from Congress, IOC members are  
reluctant to travel to the United States because they could face 
questioning by the FBI in connection with its Salt Lake City 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a concern on the part of some of the members,'' Pound  
said. ``They don't understand how the Justice Department and the 
FBI works. They're nervous.''

	Rebels Appear To Have Freed Hostages  
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Some 40 diplomats and foreigners who  
were taken hostage by rebels at the Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok 
appear to have been released today, police said. However, a full 
accounting of the hostages was not available from authorities. 
Meanwhile, a helicopter carrying rebels who seized the embassy on 
Friday flew out of Bangkok with two senior Thai officials. The 
rebels had earlier had demanded to be flown to the Thai-Myanmar 
border, officials said. Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart said 
Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra and a senior refugee 
official, Chaiyapruek Sawaengcharoen, had volunteered to take the 
place of the hostages and fly with the rebels.

	Workers Confirm Bodies in E.Timor  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Faced with daunting challenges, U.N.  
forensics experts are preparing to investigate alleged atrocities 
in East Timor, despite Indonesia's complaints that it should be 
allowed to conduct its own probe. There is no police force or 
justice system to hold onto suspects, the rainy season is looming, 
and Indonesia's unwillingness to cooperate will further complicate 
matters. Despite fears that hundreds, maybe thousands of people 
were killed during a rampage by anti-independence militias, 
evidence of possible war crimes has been scarce so far. 
Peacekeepers today indicated they had found 13 more bodies near the 
capital's airport only to issue a clarification later that they 
were confirming the earlier discovery along with three new bodies.

	Study: Race Has Powerful Role in U.S.  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Blacks still end up at the bottom of the pack when  
it comes to opportunities ranging from jobs to housing, according 
to a new study that indicates race continues to play an enormous 
role in the success of Americans. Fifty researchers studied the 
cities of Atlanta, Boston, Detroit and Los Angeles and found that 
race is deeply entrenched in the country's cultural landscape -- 
perhaps even more than many Americans realize or are willing to 
admit.

	Cooler Weather To Help Firefighters  
</P>
<P>
	CORONA, Calif. (AP) -- Firefighters surrounded a blaze that  
destroyed one home and threatened hundreds more, while cooler 
temperatures elsewhere became an ally in knocking down blazes that 
scorched tens of thousands of acres. ``All evacuations have been 
canceled and all evacuation centers closed,'' Becky Luther, a 
California Department of Forestry-Riverside County fire 
spokeswoman, said Friday as firefighters were encircled the 
440-acre Corona fire. Firefighters made some progress against two 
fires in San Diego County that had burned close to 3,000 acres.

	U.S. Probe Welcomed in Korea

	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korean demonstrators held a  
two-hour rally and welcomed a U.S. promise to investigate 
allegations American forces killed several hundred refugees with 
machine-gun fire at the start of the Korean War. ``We throw up both 
of our hands to welcome the U.S. decision,'' said Chung Eun-yong, 
spokesman for a group of aging South Koreans who say they survived 
the alleged killings at No Gun Ri in July 1950. During a peaceful 
two-hour rally yesterday in front of the U.S. 8th Army headquarters 
in Seoul, dozens of activists praised Washington's decision to 
formally review the No Gun Ri case.

	Milosevic Facing Heat from Opponents

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Slobodan Milosevic's pro-democracy  
opponents are calling for more protests against the Yugoslav 
president, defying possible legal action against the opposition 
leaders and a growing government crackdown. The leaders of daily 
demonstrations demanding Milosevic's ouster announced another 
protest march toward Belgrade's main hospital today in support of 
dozens of opposition protesters injured in two police interventions 
against the protesters earlier this week. Signaling further 
crackdown, a government-controlled public prosecutor yesterday 
demanded an investigation into the clashes between the police and 
the demonstrators.

to stay home and shut their windows. But even as officials at the 
plant northeast of Tokyo said danger from radiation released 
Thursday was subsiding, fears persisted that people near the 
Tokaimura facility may suffer long-term effects from the accident.

expected to be announced today, Pippen will be traded from the 
Houston Rockets to the Portland Trail Blazers, The Associated Press

<HEADLINE> Ex-UK Starter Injured in Ohio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Former University of Kentucky football  
player Jeremy Streck was in critical condition Saturday after being 
hit by a man who was charged with driving under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Streck was hit at 3:10 a.m. EDT Friday in  
Columbus and taken to the Ohio State Medical Center. The family 
asked that no information other than his condition be released. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Paul K. Synadinos, 20, of Gahanna, Ohio, was charged  
with DUI. 
</P>
<P>
	Streck was a starting senior offensive guard on the Kentucky  
team last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The wife of Streck's former high school coach in Cincinnati  
confirmed that Streck had received serious injuries in the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been told it's very serious,'' said Crystal Suriano,  
whose husband, Vince, coached Streck at Anderson High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeremy was still friends with several of the players he played  
with here,'' Suriano said. ``Some of them have gone up to Columbus 
to see about him. We're all just beside ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UK football spokesman Tony Neely said Friday night that Kentucky  
coach Hal Mumme and his coaching staff had been made aware of the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're extremely concerned for Jeremy and his family,'' Neely  
said. ``We'll be watching that situation and will be keeping Jeremy 
and his family in our thoughts and prayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-5, 313-pound lineman from Cincinnati, Streck started 18  
games and played in 32 during his Kentucky career. He started all 
12 games last season at left guard as the Wildcats went 7-5, making 
their first appearance in a New Year's Day bowl game since 1952. 
Streck also made the SEC Academic Honor roll last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Redshirted in 1994, Streck played defensive tackle as a redshirt  
freshman, totaling two tackles, one against Cincinnati and one 
versus Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	He moved to offensive line in 1995 and started seven games  
despite missing three games with a dislocated kneecap. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, as a junior, Streck alternated with Mike Webster at  
left guard. Last year, he took over the starting spot at left 
guard, while Webster moved over to right guard.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Plans New Industrial Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea's richest man said  
Saturday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Il has personally 
approved his plan to build a large-scale industrial park in the 
reclusive communist country. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung Ju-yung, founder and honorary chairman of the Hyundai  
group, made the remarks upon returning from an extended five-day 
visit to North Korea, during which he met the country's top leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung's trip, originally scheduled for three days, was extended  
by two days for a meeting with Kim on Friday. Chung said his 
meeting with Kim at the latter's countryside resort also covered 
other subjects, but he declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He basically has accepted our proposal to build an industrial  
park there,'' Chung said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai plans to relocate 800 to 900 garment and other plants to  
the industrial park on North Korea's southwest coast, close to the 
border with South Korea, and use surplus South Korean electricity 
for the factories. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan also includes construction of car assembly lines with  
an annual capacity of 50,000, as well as television and other 
electronic assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung said the North Korean leader looked healthy and tanned.  
</P>
<P>
	Relations between the two Koreas remain largely frozen because  
of political and military tensions. They are still technically at 
war, having signed no peace treaty at the end of the 1950-53 Korean 
War.

	SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) -- When a Shreveport television station  
canceled Rosie O'Donnell's talk show last month, she promised the 
station she'd visit their city if they put her back on the air.

``Just remember, eight million people are watching.''

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 7, Indians 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Pat Hentgen took a shutout into the ninth  
inning and Toronto hit four homers Saturday as the Blue Jays beat 
Cleveland 7-3, leaving the Indians' playoff situation up in the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
	Hentgen (11-12) won for the first time in five starts with  
perhaps his best outing this season. Entering the ninth, he had 
allowed five singles but lost a chance at his first shutout in more 
than two years when Carlos Baerga singled and Alex Ramirez homered. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, Hentgen had struck out six and dominated a club  
which scored its 1,000th run of the season Friday and could have 
wrapped up home-field advantage in the first round with a win. 
</P>
<P>
	Richie Sexson had a pinch-hit RBI single in the ninth as the  
Indians tried to rally, but rookie reliever Billy Koch came on with 
two on and got his 31st save. 
</P>
<P>
	A Cleveland win would have assured the Indians of playing Boston  
and having home-field advantage in the first round of the playoffs. 
The Indians can still get home-field advantage if Texas loses 
either of its final two games. The Rangers play at Anaheim Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Green, Tony Batista, Willis Otanez and rookie Casey Blake  
all homered for the Blue Jays. Three of those shots came off 
Indians starter Jaret Wright, whose performance couldn't have come 
at a worse time for Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians were hoping Wright (8-10) had finally put a  
frustrating year behind him and could be counted on as the team's 
No. 4 starter in the postseason. But he lasted just 2 1-3 innings, 
allowing six runs and seven hits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays teed off on Wright in the third inning, hitting  
three homers to score six runs. Wright hadn't given up an earned 
run in his previous 12 innings in two starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Green made it 2-0 with his 42nd homer, a two-run shot, that  
snapped his 1-for-18 streak against the Indians this season. 
Following a walk and single, Indians pitching coach Phil Regan came 
out to try and settle down Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wright's next pitch was hit over the wall in left by  
Batista, putting Toronto up 5-0. Otanez then hit his seventh homer 
to end Wright's afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander was booed as he walked slowly toward the  
dugout. But unlike his last home start on Sept. 17, when he mocked 
the crowd by tipping his cap after he being pounded by the Yankees, 
Wright kept his head bowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto went ahead 7-0 in the fifth when Blake homered Jim  
Brower. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Hentgen's last shutout came on June 20, 1997, against  
Baltimore. ... During the game, Toronto announced that five of its 
coaches will not return next season. ... If he plays Sunday, Tony 
Fernandez will tie Montreal manager Felipe Alou for the most games 
played by a Dominican. Fernandez has played 2,081 career games. ... 
Some ammunition for Manny Ramirez's AL MVP resume: Cleveland is 
35-3 when he homers and 64-20 when he drives in a run. ... Blake's 
homer came in his 33rd at-bat. ... The Blue Jays announced they 
have picked up the contract option for 2000 on catcher Darrin 
Fletcher. Fletcher posted career highs in hits, runs, homers and 
RBIs this season. ... Toronto is 31-14 in its last 45 road games. 
... Cleveland's Jim Thome is 0-for-11 with five strikeouts in the 
series.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Fern Wins Yellow Ribbon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Spanish Fern went four wide into the  
stretch and took the lead midway to the wire to win Saturday's 
$500,000 Yellow Ribbon Stakes by 1 1/4 lengths over Caffe Latte. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden for the first time by Chris McCarron, Spanish Fern  
covered 1 1/4 miles on the turf in 1:59 2-5 and paid $7.40, $4.20 and 
$3.80 as the second wagering choice of 37,292 fans at Santa Anita. 
The winner carried 123 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Irish-bred Caffe Latte, ridden by Corey Nakatani, returned $6.40  
and $5, while Shabby Chic, under Chris Antley, was another 1 1/4 
lengths back in third and paid $6.80 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Favored Fiji finished sixth out of seven horses in her first  
race since winning the Yellow Ribbon by two lengths last year. She 
had been out of action since then with a variety of minor ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiji was between horses in midstretch, but couldn't muster a  
late kick under Jerry Bailey, who came in from New York for the 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Spanish Fern wasn't in the best shape,  
either. She had quarter cracks and then got sick on trainer Robert 
Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarron got the mount since Kent Desormeaux, her previous  
rider, is recovering from a broken wrist. Alex Solis, who rode 
Spanish Fern three times before Desormeaux, was in Louisiana on 
Saturday where he won the Super Derby on Ecton Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Neil Drysdale said he would run Fiji at the same  
distance in the $500,000 Vinery First Lady at Keeneland on Oct. 15. 
Drysdale said he would see how the mare does before committing to 
the Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Turf next month at Gulfstream. 
</P>
<P>
	A rematch between Fiji and Spanish Fern could occur in either or  
both races. Frankel has never won a Breeders' Cup race. 
</P>

	The victory, worth $300,000, increased Spanish Fern's career  
earnings to $437,321, with five victories in 10 starts. Frankel 
also won the Yellow Ribbon in 1993 with Possibly Perfect.

<HEADLINE> Predators Sign Forward Jason Dawe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Nashville Predators bolstered their  
offense on Saturday by signing free agent forward Jason Dawe. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawe, 26, has scored 20 or more goals three times in the NHL,  
most recently in the 1997-98 season when he had 20 with Buffalo and 
the New York Islanders. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-10, 190-pound right wing has played in 362 career  
games with the Sabres, Islanders and Montreal. He had only six 
goals last season with New York and Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	He went to training camp with Edmonton, and Nashville general  
manager David Poile said Dawe was looking for a home and took a 
``hefty cut in pay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always been a goal scorer his whole career. We've got to  
find a way to get scoring chances,'' Poile said of a team that 
averaged 2.32 goals last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawe still has to clear waivers, but will be assigned to  
Nashville's IHL affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, show us your stuff and get back to where you were  
two years ago. There should be a good chance for you to get an 
opportunity here,'' Poile said he told Dawe.

<HEADLINE> Thrashers Return NHL To Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The wait is over.  
</P>
<P>
	After a 19-year absence, Atlanta makes its re-entry into the NHL  
when the expansion Thrashers play their inaugural game against the 
New Jersey Devils at the $213 million Philips Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been so long since the Flames were here,'' left wing  
Denny Lambert said. ``These people have been waiting for hockey to 
return. You can tell already that they want to be a part of this 
team. They're eager to learn the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the Flames moved to Calgary in 1980, the city went more  
than a decade without a team. The minor-league Knights rekindled 
interest when they were launched in 1992, winning the IHL 
championship and playing before several sellout crowds at the old 
Omni. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knights left, too, when it became apparent the city was  
moving toward bigger and better things. The Omni was torn down to 
make way for the new 18,559-seat arena, which will be filled to 
capacity for the Thrashers' debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to do well and make it a memorable night,''  
center Ray Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers were part of a four-team, three-year expansion  
phase for the NHL. The Nashville Predators started play last 
season, while the Minnesota Wild and Columbus Blue Jackets will 
enter the league in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``First-year teams are a lot of fun,'' said Lambert, part of a  
Predators team that surprisingly won 28 games last season. 
``There's no pressure on you. No one expects you to win any games. 
But if you do win, everyone jumps on the bandwagon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bandwagon already is crowded. The Thrashers have about  
13,000 season ticket holders and have sold out their first three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	On opening night, the team plans to close off an adjacent street  
and set up ``Thrasherville,'' a collection of games and interactive 
exhibits for early-arriving fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials were secretive about some elements of the pregame  
festivities, such as who will sing the national anthem and take 
part in the ceremonial puck drop. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the players, they tried to maintain as much normality as  
possible with all the excitement swirling around them. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to make it too big a deal,'' Ferraro said.  
``You might end up tightening yourself up and not play as well as 
you should.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie coach Curt Fraser also figures to be nervous.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's certainly going to be a lot of distractions,'' he  
said. ``I want to find something for us to do so we don't have to 
think about that. A lot of these guys have been through it. They 
can help me with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two of those players are Lambert and left wing Andrew Brunette.  
</P>
<P>
	Teammates a year ago in Nashville, they are going through the  
expansion process all over again with the Thrashers, who acquired 
them in separate trades. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, there was a little regret when I left Nashville,''  
said Brunette, doing his part to fit in with his new city by 
wearing an Atlanta Braves cap after a recent practice. ``I thought 
I would be there a long time. Now, hopefully, I'll be here a long 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As with all expansion teams, the Thrashers are desperately short  
on scorers. With a roster that includes no one with more than 13 
NHL goals last season, the team was shut out in its final two 
exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it comes to natural goal scorers, there's probably only  
10 in the league,'' said Ferraro, one of the players who must score 
about 20 goals for the Thrashers to be successful. ``We don't have 
a Brett Hull who can bury goals on the power play. We don't have a 
(Joe) Sakic or a (Peter) Forsberg. Then again, a lot of other teams 
don't, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers will play an aggressive, forechecking style,  
hoping to outwork their opponents and create scoring chances off 
turnovers. But, as the preseason showed, there aren't many players 
outside of Ferraro, Nelson Emerson and top draft pick Patrik Stefan 
who look comfortable with the puck on their stick. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're producing a lot of chances,'' Fraser said. ``We've got  
to work on finishing around the net.''

<HEADLINE> Courts Battle 'Columbine Copycats' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- There's an empty desk at a middle  
school near Fort Lauderdale. Another nine in Lansing, Mich. Three 
more in Janesville, Wis. And at least four others in Mobile, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	All over the country, youngsters who would normally be in math  
class or on the playground are in jail cells and homes for 
delinquents after authorities cracked down on a wave of bomb 
threats that followed the massacre at Colorado's Columbine High 
School last April. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, each violent note passed between young friends, every  
threatening remark overheard in the hallways became possible 
grounds for criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	The juvenile justice system is now teeming with hundreds of  
children -- many first-time offenders -- who made bomb threats and 
concocted death plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the Columbine copycats thought their threats were a  
joke. Others wanted a day off from school. Still others may have 
really wanted people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly when these cases arose after Columbine, everyone was  
on notice that a terrible tragedy had occurred, and certainly that 
had to be a factor that played into how the cases were dealt 
with,'' said Juvenile Judge Melanie May in Fort Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors and principals took no chances after watching the  
harrowing scenes of children fleeing hand in hand from the school 
in Littleton, Colo., where two teen-age boys terrorized their 
schoolmates and the nation. The teens killed 12 students and a 
teacher before turning their guns on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we lost a sense of innocence about what goes on in our  
schools,'' May said. ``I don't think we'll ever be the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the weeks after the April massacre, the National Safety  
Center estimates at least 3,000 copycat bomb threats were made -- 
about five times the number usually reported in the last few months 
of a school year. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the wake of Columbine, kids were saying more stupid stuff  
and adults were taking those things more seriously,'' said Johnson 
County, Kan., prosecuting attorney Paul Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
	Case in point: Ashley Guris, a 12-year-old at Landon Middle  
School in Jacksonville, was arrested on a felony charge of 
threatening to blow up her school just one day after the Columbine 
slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't mean it at all,'' she later said. ``The words just  
kind of fell out.'' Charges were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Others did mean it.  
</P>
<P>
	Days after Columbine, a 15-year-old boy in Conyers, Ga., opened  
fire on his school, wounding six students. Anthony ``T.J.'' Solomon 
is in prison now, fighting a court order to try him as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	In Port Huron, Mich., three boys -- ages 13, 14 and 15 -- are  
awaiting trial on charges of plotting to kill students and teachers 
in a plan based on Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no specific numbers to show courts and schools are  
meting out tougher punishments post-Columbine. Generally, 
prosecutors and school districts do not keep separate records of 
the copycat cases or their resolutions. Most juvenile court records 
are not public. 
</P>
<P>
	Anecdotally, it's clear districts are taking a harder line after  
Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Fort Lauderdale area, 35 middle school children are being  
prosecuted for making some sort of threat, including one who called 
police to report children were barricaded in a school and being 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	In Minneapolis, prosecutors said they would review evidence of  
any crime committed on school property and try to bring a charge 
that same day to make a statement that such acts will not be 
tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
	In Illinois, Gov. George Ryan this summer signed into law all of  
the proposals for school safety made by the state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	Some say the crackdown can go too far.  
</P>
<P>
	In Virginia, soon after Columbine, a high school boy was  
suspended for coloring his hair blue -- even though his hair was 
blue for five months before the shootings, said Kent Willis, 
executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The school said it was reacting to a mandate by the governor to  
crack down on potentially dangerous behavior, Willis said. ``The 
problem was the schools seemed unable to draw the distinction 
between what was a real threat and what was not,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	School safety advocates maintain it's better to be safe than  
sorry. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Stephens, executive director of the National School Safety  
Center, suggests schools tell students: ``If you make a threat on 
this campus, your parents will be the second call we make. The 
first call will be to law enforcement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the new school year, the number of reported incidents has  
dropped dramatically. Still, there were a few. 
</P>
<P>
	In Palatka, Fla., two self-described Satan worshipping  
teen-agers were charged with conspiracy to commit murder after a 
teacher told authorities the boys planned to kill students and 
teachers at their former high school. When questioned, the boys 
said they planned to do a better job than the shooters in 
Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	Would any of these alleged threats been carried out? Juvenile  
prosecutors nationwide say that's a tough question to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our biggest challenge in dealing with these cases is  
distinguishing between kids whose threats are empty and kids whose 
threats are real,'' said Douglas Weiner, chief of the criminal 
prosecutions in the Cleveland, Ohio-area. ``Because we're dealing 
with kids' safety, there's no margin of error, which makes it 
especially difficult.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Student Radical Freed From Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRAMINGHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Former anti-Vietnam War radical  
Katherine Ann Power, who spent 23 years underground, walked out of 
prison Saturday after serving time for taking part in an armed 
robbery in which a police officer was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-year-old woman said nothing to reporters as she left  
MCI-Framingham, where she had spent six years. Two unidentified 
women escorted her into a car and drove off. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a statement issued by her lawyer, James M. Doyle, Power  
said she ``will always carry my human responsibility'' for her role 
in the death of Officer Walter Schroeder, a father of nine. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a time to acknowledge that a human life, once lost, is  
lost forever: that the death of a father, husband, and brother is a 
terrible event, and one for which I will always be deeply sorry,'' 
Power's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Power was a 21-year-old student at Brandeis University in 1970  
when she and four fellow activists robbed a bank in Boston's 
Brighton neighborhood to fund efforts against the Vietnam War. She 
was waiting in the getaway car when William ``Lefty'' Gilday shot 
Schroeder in the back. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Power got away. Gilday was convicted of murder and  
sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Power took the alias Alice Metzinger, lived in women's communes,  
gave birth to a son and settled in Lebanon, Ore., where she married 
a bookkeeper, Ronley Duncan, and became known for her cooking at a 
tea and coffee house. 
</P>
<P>
	After beginning therapy for depression, she returned to  
Massachusetts in 1993. She pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was 
sentenced to eight to 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	She was released early with credit for good behavior and time  
served. 
</P>
<P>
	Power's release comes as another radical who spent years as a  
fugitive, Sara Jane Olson, formerly known as Kathleen Ann Soliah, 
awaits trial on charges that she planted bombs under Los Angeles 
police cars in 1975 as part of a conspiracy by the Symbionese 
Liberation Army. She was arrested in June in St. Paul, Minn., where 
she had settled into a comfortable life as an actress, a doctor's 
wife and a mother of three. 
</P>
<P>
	In Power's case, Schroeder's family maintains that she has been  
punished too lightly. ``I think six years is a fairly light 
sentence when you're talking about circumstances involving the 
death of somebody,'' daughter Clare Schroeder said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Power hasn't said where she will go next, her  
brother-in-law, John Whittaker of Denver, said her plans include 
trips to Colorado and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	``But other than that, we have no idea what her future plans  
are,'' he said in a telephone interview Saturday. ``We're all 
looking forward to uniting with her when she gets to Denver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Power and Duncan are still legally married, but he has said he  
hasn't spoken with her in the past year. Last week, Duncan said he 
didn't even know she was to be released. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oregon, people who knew Power as Alice Metzinger have largely  
taken a forgiving attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a good citizen when she lived here and I expect she  
will be when she comes back,'' said police Detective Sgt. John 
Atchley. ``She was so quiet when she lived here that a lot of 
people don't really know who she is.''

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Test-Ban Vote Set for Oct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is promising an  
intense, if brief, campaign for Senate ratification of a nuclear 
test ban treaty, suggesting defeat could set back nuclear 
nonproliferation efforts around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	But supporters are not optimistic the campaign will produce the  
67 Senate votes needed for ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate leaders of both parties on Friday agreed to begin  
debating the 152-nation Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty next Friday, 
with a vote set for the following Tuesday, Oct. 12, setting aside 
18 hours for debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats reluctantly agreed to vote this month, after Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., suddenly announced he would 
schedule a vote -- after the treaty had remained bottled up for two 
years in the Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	After first balking, Democrats took Lott's take-it-or-leave-it  
offer after he agreed to delay the vote to Oct. 12 from Oct. 6, and 
agreed to eight more hours of debate than the 10 he initially 
proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel we have no choice,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom  
Daschle, D-S.D. ``This may be the best that we can get. ... We'll 
take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin stressed the  
importance of ratification, saying, ``The eyes of the world are on 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be in a far stronger position to insist that other  
countries do not go down the nuclear testing road if we ratify the 
treaty, '' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the treaty's case is made in ``a serious, sustained, and  
analytical way,'' there will be enough support to ratify it, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate supporters of the treaty were a less sanguine about  
the pact's chances of passage. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the senior Democrat on the Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee, suggested the outlook appeared bleak, 
but that at least the vote would force senators to go on the 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is: If you are going to die, do you want to die  
with no one knowing who shot you or do you want to go at least with 
the world knowing who killed you?'' Biden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the administration has said the test ban treaty should  
be nonpartisan, support for it in the Senate is almost entirely 
Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
	All 45 Democratic senators are expected to support it, but only  
two Republicans -- Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and James Jeffords 
of Vermont -- have endorsed it publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty, which calls for an outright ban on all nuclear  
testing, has been signed by 152 nations, including the United 
States. But it has been ratified by only 18 of the 44 countries 
with nuclear capabilities that must ratify it for it to take 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives contend the pact -- which also has not yet been  
ratified by Russia or China -- could threaten the U.S. ability to 
modernize its arsenal if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the United States already has a vast superiority  
in nuclear weapons, thanks to more than 1,000 nuclear tests during 
the Cold War, and the treaty would lock in that advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said the Armed Services  
Committee, which he chairs, will hold hearings on the treaty next 
week. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, 
R-N.C., has refused to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident that the Senate will vote to reject this  
dangerous arms control pact,'' Helms said Friday. ``The effect of 
this treaty would be to forever forbid the United States from 
testing its nuclear arsenal, while allowing the rogue nations of 
the world to proceed with their nuclear plans.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Sues State for Alleged Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- A disabled woman whose husband allegedly  
held her captive on a putrid sailboat while he collected state 
checks as her caregiver has filed a $55 million claim against the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda David accuses the Department of Social and Health Services  
and agency caseworkers of ``gross negligence and deliberate 
indifference'' to more than a decade of abuse, allegedly at the 
hands of her husband, Victor David. 
</P>
<P>
	Her claim lays out a pattern of caseworkers and doctors noticing  
signs of abuse over her 15 years as a client of the DSHS, but 
failing to take corrective action. 
</P>
<P>
	Filing the claim is the first step toward suing DSHS in state  
court. Agency spokesman Gordon Schultz said the department cannot 
comment on pending litigation 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. David, 51, was rescued by Everett police in January 1997.  
Authorities found her jammed into the bow of the boat, covered with 
vomit, surrounded by dog excrement, and unable to move. Her nose 
was broken and her limbs deformed by repeated fractures. 
</P>
<P>
	David was arrested in May and is being held in the Snohomish  
County Jail on charges including second-degree assault. He has 
denied the abuse, saying his wife suffers from multiple sclerosis. 
A competency hearing is scheduled for Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. David's claim, filed Friday with the state Division of Risk  
Management, said she suffered physical and emotional damage 
``directly related to the physical, emotional and mental torture 
she sustained while a client of DSHS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the mid-1980s until 1997, Mrs. David lived on her husband's  
filthy 30-foot sailboat with large German shepherds. For much of 
that time, caseworkers were suspicious that she was being abused 
and raised questions, but ultimately didn't act on their 
suspicions, her lawyer said. Workers stopped visiting the boat in 
1988 and stopped checking on her altogether in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty months later, she was finally rescued. Today, she's in a  
nursing home, suffering from brain damage and blind in one eye and 
with only partial vision in the other. She uses a wheelchair and 
can't eat, wash or use a restroom by herself. 
</P>
<P>
	DSHS Secretary Lyle Quasim initially defended his agency, saying  
he could find nothing caseworkers had done incorrectly. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gov. Gary Locke said the system, including state social  
workers, local police and lawyers, had failed Mrs. David.

<HEADLINE> Rockets Trade Pippen to Portland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scottie Pippen was traded today, and the Trail Blazers said he's  
happy to be headed to Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	In a six-for-one deal, Pippen was sent from the Houston Rockets  
to the Portland Trail Blazers for Kelvin Cato, Stacey Augmon, Walt 
Williams, Ed Gray, Brian Shaw and Carlos Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen wanted out of Houston, as evidenced by his highly  
critical remarks Wednesday about Rockets teammate Charles Barkley, 
but would have preferred to go to the Lakers so he could be 
reunited with Phil Jackson, his coach in Chicago when Pippen and 
the Bulls won six championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Trail Blazers president and general manager Bob Whitsitt said  
that in a phone conversation with Pippen, the player downplayed 
reports that he wanted to go to the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's looking forward to being a Trail Blazer,'' Whitsitt said.  
</P>
<P>
	``He said `That Los Angeles stuff is blown out or porportion. I  
like Portland. I like what's going on.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers and Rockets discussed a deal early in the summer that  
would have sent Glen Rice and Robert Horry to the Rockets for 
Pippen, but Houston ultimately declined. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Rockets are willing to take back six reserves -- none of  
whom averaged double figures in points last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers had to give up six players in order to make the  
trade work under NBA salary cap guidelines. Pippen will make more 
than $14 million this season, and Portland had to put that amount 
of salaries together. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen will join Steve Smith and Detlef Schrempf as additions to  
an improved Trail Blazers team that made it to the Western 
Conference finals last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets were eager to part with Pippen and his $67 million  
five-year contract, which still has four seasons remaining, 
following a poor 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen was somewhat of a disappointment, averaging 14.5 points  
and shooting just 43 percent from the field while complaining 
throughout the season that the Rockets' slow-down style of offense 
hindered his game. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen blasted Barkley on Wednesday in an ESPN interview, saying  
he ``doesn't show the desire to want to win.'' The attack came 
after Barkley criticized Pippen in August for publicly lobbying for 
a trade to the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley complained he had sacrificed greatly in February to make  
salary-cap room in order for the Rockets to acquire Pippen from the 
Bulls in a sign-and-trade deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's creating all this controversy just to get traded,''  
Barkley said Thursday. ``He wants to get traded so bad that he'll 
just say anything to make it happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, 34, is a seven-time All-Star and two-time Olympian who  
won his six titles with the Bulls as the second option behind 
Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, a seven-year veteran, will be joining his fifth NBA  
team. The 6-foot-8 forward averaged between 10.3 and 17.0 points in 
his first six seasons before dropping to 9.3 last season as a 
reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Augmon, a defensive specialist, will be entering his eighth NBA  
season with his fourth team. Cato, a 6-foot-11 center, is entering 
his third season. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray, acquired by Portland in the Steve Smith-Isaiah Rider trade  
over the summer, averaged 4.9 points for the Hawks last season. 
Shaw and Rogers barely played last season and might not even make 
the Rockets' roster for the regular season.

<HEADLINE> President Urges Tolerance of Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Urging Americans to ``purge the darkness in  
our hearts,'' President Clinton called on the nation Saturday to 
reject the type of hatred that led to shootings in California and 
the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The president delivered his message of tolerance before gay and  
lesbian supporters at a black-tie dinner that raised $850,000 for 
Democratic congressional candidates -- the largest amount of 
Clinton's three-day West Coast swing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest problem we've got is the primitive age-old fear  
and dehumanization of the other people who are not like us,'' 
Clinton said to extended applause. ``I'm going to do everything I 
can, every day that I have, to remind people of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it is expected for Americans to disagree over specific  
issues. But he said there should be no disagreement over ``whether 
we share a common humanity'' despite differences in race, religion, 
ethnicity or sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be one America,'' Clinton said. ``And we cannot be  
under the illusion that either material prosperity or technological 
breakthroughs alone can purge the darkness in our hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serving as host for Saturday's dinner was ANGLE, or Access Now  
for Gay and Lesbian Equality, which initially met with Clinton 
eight years ago. ANGLE was the first gay rights organization to 
endorse his candidacy then, and remained supportive despite 
disappointments from his ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy for gays 
in the military and his 1996 decision to sign a law denying federal 
recognition of same sex marriages. 
</P>
<P>
	The president alluded to those disappointments even as he  
appealed for continued support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I could have done better. But we've done pretty well,  
and we're a long way from where we were,'' he said. ``I still 
believe in the future of America, and you are a part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said the dinner was one of the largest events of its  
kind outside Washington. About 1,000 guests attended, each making 
contributions ranging from $250 to $50,000; Besides Clinton, 
California Gov. Gray Davis, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, 
D-Mo.; and Reps. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., and Tammy Baldwin, 
D-Wis., were scheduled speakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Clinton was addressing a separate dinner at the home  
of director Rob Reiner, which was raising $550,000 for the 
Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The president tested themes at two smaller events Friday night  
with Silicon Valley executives. 
</P>
<P>
	He repeated his support for legislation barring job  
discrimination against gays and hate crimes. Clinton urged the 
crowd to fight for ``the innate dignity and equality of every human 
being'' and work to ensure ``a place at the American family table'' 
for all, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or income. 
</P>
<P>
	The president noted that technology offers vast potential for  
transforming American society, but cannot deliver as long as some 
segments of the population cling to prejudices because they are 
afraid of change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here you are out here, all you think about is the new  
millennium,'' Clinton said. ``Isn't it ironic that the thing that's 
holding us back most ... is our inability to form a community 
around our common humanity because of our vulnerability to 
mankind's most ancient fear, the fear of the other?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we need to deal with that,'' he continued. ``I believe  
my party is on the right side of all those issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he has devoted much of his time in office to  
dealing with ``the emotional and practical and national security 
demands'' of international conflicts spurred by hatreds. 
</P>
<P>
	The same elements in those problems, he said, have appeared in  
America over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, he recalled the slayings of gay college student  
Matthew Shepard in Wyoming; James Byrd, a black man, in Texas; a 
Korean student and a former college basketball coach in a shooting 
spree by ``a crazy guy'' in Illinois; and the death of a Filipino 
postman and wounding of a Jewish child in shootings in California. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see people in this so-called modern world, where we're  
celebrating all of your modern ideas and your modern achievements, 
and what is the biggest problem in the world in America? We are 
dragged down by the most primitive of hatreds,'' Clinton said. 
``It's bizarre.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Saturday, the president spent time in Palo Alto visiting  
with his daughter Chelsea, a junior at Stanford University, and 
doing some work on his presidential library. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was returning to Washington early Monday.

<HEADLINE> Rockets Trade Pippen to Portland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Trail Blazers were thrilled to get  
him, the Rockets were equally glad to get rid of him. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Scottie Pippen himself, others were left to do the  
talking. 
</P>
<P>
	In a deal that had been rumored for days, the six-time NBA  
champion and seven-time All-Star was traded to Portland on Saturday 
for Kelvin Cato, Stacey Augmon, Walt Williams, Ed Gray, Brian Shaw 
and Carlos Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	Blazers president and general manager Bob Whitsitt said Pippen  
was ``extremely excited'' about the deal, and Pippen's agent, Jimmy 
Sexton, concurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, however, said nothing publicly from his home in  
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't read anything into that,'' Sexton said of Pippen's  
silence. ``After Scottie evaluated the situation in Portland, 
looked at their roster, what they did last year and the pieces 
they've added, he was excited. They'll have a legitimate chance to 
win the NBA championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen's first choice for a new team was the Los Angeles Lakers,  
where he would have rejoined former Bulls coach Phil Jackson. There 
was speculation that Portland might turn around and trade Pippen to 
the Lakers for Glen Rice and other players -- speculation that 
figures to continue through the season -- but on Saturday the 
Blazers were talking about Pippen being a part of their drive for a 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked with Scottie on the phone, and he said, 'That L.A.  
stuff was blown out of proportion. I love Portland and I like 
what's going on,' '' Whitsitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, finalized Saturday morning during a conference call  
with the Rockets and the NBA, was hastened when Pippen lambasted 
Barkley in an ESPN interview aired Wednesday. Pippen called his 
teammate ``fat'' and ``selfish,'' and said he wanted out of Houston 
because Barkley didn't have enough desire to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Other teams, including the Milwaukee Bucks and New Jersey Nets,  
made late offers that were rejected. The Lakers considered offering 
Rice, Robert Horry and Travis Knight, but ultimately declined. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're moving forward,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.  
``I think we've taken a negative situation and tried to turn it 
into a positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, 34, signed a five-year, $67 million contract with the  
Rockets before the lockout-shorted 1999 season began. But he never 
fit into Houston's low-post oriented offense, and competed with 
stars Hakeem Olajuwon and Barkley for looks at the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you play that style of basketball (with the Bulls), I  
understood it would take some time to adjust,'' Tomjanovich said at 
a news conference in Houston. The coach said he talked with Pippen 
on the phone and told him he was sorry it didn't work out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very professional. We wished each other luck,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen is due to make $14.8 million this season, which nearly  
equals the combined salaries of the six players Portland traded. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season Pippen averaged 14.5 points, his lowest output since  
1988-89, his second season with the Bulls and two years before the 
Bulls won the first of their six titles. He also shot a career-low 
43 percent, but averaged 6.5 rebounds and 5.9 assists and made the 
NBA's All-Defensive first team for the eighth straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers, already loaded with talented players like Brian  
Grant, Rasheed Wallace, Damon Stoudamire and new acquisitions 
Detlef Schrempf and Steve Smith, don't care if he ever returns to 
the scoring level that made him a selection on the NBA's 50 
all-time greatest players. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Scottie averages 14, seven rebounds, seven assists and two  
steals ever year for the next four years, perfect,'' Whitsitt said. 
``We'll take that in a heartbeat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen has been one of the NBA's most dominant forwards the last  
decade, but he has not proved he can effectively lead a team 
without Michael Jordan around. In the 1994 playoffs, with Jordan 
off playing minor-league baseball, Pippen refused to enter a game 
in the final seconds against the Knicks when Jackson had drawn up 
the final shot for Toni Kukoc instead of him. 
</P>
<P>
	In Houston, it was clear from Wednesday's interview, Pippen did  
not get along with Barkley, his teammate on the Dream Team that won 
the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. Pippen complained that he was not 
getting the ball enough, and Barkley complained that he had given 
up part of his salary so the Rockets could afford Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
	The falling out between the two intensified over the summer when  
they traveled together on a tour for Nike, the athletic footwear 
maker. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no telling how Pippen will fit in with the Blazers, who  
are deep at every position despite unloading six players. Last 
season, Stoudamire groused about not getting enough minutes, even 
during the Blazers' four-game series loss to San Antonio in the 
Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets, meanwhile, likely will jettison at least three of  
their new players. The team had 18 players under contract without 
Pippen before the trade. Tomjanovich sounded most interested in 
Williams, a good outside shooter, and Cato, a 6-foot-11 center who 
showed promise backing up Arvydas Sabonis. 
</P>
<P>
	That means the Rockets could cut Augmon, Gray, Shaw and Rogers  
during training camp, which begins Tuesday. The Blazers might be 
interested in re-signing Augmon, a defensive specialist, to a 
contract considerably less than his $3.2 million salary.

<HEADLINE> $20M Needed To Keep Reds Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- On the day Marge Schott became a part of the  
Cincinnati Reds' past, general manager Jim Bowden issued a grave 
warning about his overachieving team's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden, in Milwaukee on Friday to watch the Reds attempt to  
clinch a playoff berth in a three-game series with the Brewers, 
decried the gaps in baseball's economic structure while praising 
his current team's improbable run to the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden thinks Cincinnati would need a $20 million payroll  
increase to keep the current team intact for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``A small-market team just can't do what we've done,'' Bowden  
said. ``What we've done doesn't change the economic problems of 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds' payroll is $35 million and is the lowest among the  
nine teams still in contention for a postseason berth. That bottom 
line was even lower before Bowden acquired starting pitcher Juan 
Guzman at the trading deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden figures he would need at least a $55 million payroll to  
keep intact the solid nucleus he has built in the past 18 months 
through trades, the maturation of young players and good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds would be able to generate a large amount of revenue  
with an extended postseason run, but even a trip to the World 
Series and the resulting increases in season-ticket sales for 2000 
might not bring in the funds Bowden said he will need. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything's possible, but right now it's unlikely,'' he said.  
``It's almost impossible to keep all these elements together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden has ample experience in building teams and watching them  
be destroyed. His Cincinnati teams in 1994 and 1995 won NL Central 
Division championships, but the team's payroll edged up higher than 
the small-market Reds could afford, particularly when the 
free-spending Schott was forced to stop running the team. 
</P>
<P>
	So Bowden dismantled the Reds, jettisoning Ron Gant, David  
Wells, Benito Santiago, Tony Fernandez and Mike Jackson, among 
others. He tried to patch the lineup with fill-ins like Eric Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cincinnati fell to .500 in 1996, and played 1997 and 1998 at  
18 games under .500, not finishing higher than third place in the 
division. So the Reds decided to tear down the team and rebuild, 
starting with the trade of starter John Smiley to Cleveland in July 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to turn it over to young, talented kids, and we had to  
do it at the expense of our best players,'' Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next 16 months, Jeff Brantley, Dave Burba, Jeff Shaw,  
Mike Remlinger, Paul Konerko and Bret Boone left as Bowden built a 
core of youngsters for the future. But even Bowden couldn't have 
predicted how quickly the team would come together -- and how much 
fun they would have doing it. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of veterans Greg Vaughn, Denny Neagle and others  
have complemented and provided leadership to Cincinnati's 
youngsters such as Sean Casey and Pokey Reese. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen a team that has such a good time,'' Bowden  
said. ``In '94, '95, we had trouble in the clubhouse. This year 
we've had nothing but peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden had no intention of tracing that peace back to Schott's  
departure from involvement in the day-to-day operations of the 
club, though he did praise the limited partnership controlled by 
Carl Lindner and two others which formally took over the team 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This ownership group lets employees do their jobs,'' Bowden  
said. ``How much revenue we generate will determine what kind of 
team we can put on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he's perennially a contender for other jobs in bigger  
markets, Bowden thinks his future is in Cincinnati. He and Reds 
managing executive John Allen appear to have smoothed over any 
differences they might have had, and the once-dismal farm system 
finally is showing promise. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden, who was a candidate for GM jobs in Los Angeles and  
Baltimore during the last offseason, signed a three-year contract 
extension last October that will keep him in Cincinnati through 
2003, the same year the Reds' new ballpark is scheduled to open. 
</P>
<P>
	And though he doesn't expect his surprising team to return  
intact in 2000, he'll go back to work anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll try to figure out another way to win,'' Bowden said.

<HEADLINE> Police Shoot at S. African Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAZIZINI, South Africa (AP) -- The funeral of a racist army  
lieutenant turned violent Saturday when mourners insisted on giving 
the man a 12-gun salute over the orders of police. At least three 
people were wounded as the crowd of 2,000 screamed and scattered. 
</P>
<P>
	Police fired live ammunition and tear gas at the funeral of Lt.  
Sibusiso Madubela, a black soldier who killed seven white military 
officers and a white civilian in a killing spree last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayhem followed the firing of two shots by funeral-goers who  
were starting a 12-gun salute. Army helicopters hovered overhead 
and landed to unload police reinforcements in this small village 
near Umtata, 35 miles inland from the Indian Ocean on the 
southeastern coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Superintendent Wayne Hackert said the live shots were  
fired into the air, not at the crowd, and claimed the three 
injuries could have happened as the crowd panicked. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot allow the blatant defiance of law and order in front  
of everybody,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In funeral speeches before the violence, officials from the Pan  
Africanist Congress vowed to slay whites and claimed that Madubela 
went on his killing spree to teach whites a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
	The killings last month at Tempe military base in Bloemfontein --  
finally stopped by a fatal bullet -- emphasized racial tensions in 
the armed forces as former black guerrillas and their white 
military enemies have been melded into a common force after the end 
of apartheid in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Hackert said PAC officials made it clear earlier in the week  
that they were determined to fire an honors salute for Madubela. 
The military had refused the PAC's request for an honorary burial. 
</P>
<P>
	Swayi Mqojana, an official of the PAC, a small, militant black  
group, charged that police had disarmed funeral-goers during 
weapons searches in order to set them up for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the day the government has declared war on the PAC,''  
he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech at the graveside earlier, Lethlata Mphahleli, former  
head of operations for PAC guerrillas, encouraged blacks to imitate 
Madubela's massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``Go and liberate this country the way Madubela did,'' Mphahleli  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tension began building before the ceremony, when police armed  
with rifles and shotguns stopped about 30 PAC supporters who were 
chanting ``one settler, one bullet.'' The activists wanted police 
to stop searching mourners as they arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	A mix of personal and political factors appeared to have  
motivated Madubela -- a former member of the PAC armed wing -- to 
kill his colleagues. He was demoted from captain in the guerrilla 
group to lieutenant, and family members have said he nurtured 
resentment over his demotion.

<HEADLINE> Church Shooter Spoke Often With Cops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- The gunman who killed seven people  
inside a Baptist church, then sat down in a pew and shot himself, 
had talked regularly with the city's police chief for nearly a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Fort Worth Police Chief Thomas Windham told the Fort Worth  
Star-Telegram on Saturday that Larry Gene Ashbrook had called his 
office at least four or five times since 1990, typically rambling 
about unemployment and his years in the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't make anything out of it other than here's a guy who  
lost his job,'' Windham said. ``He always seemed like a nice-enough 
guy to me. It's an understatement now to say that's a misperception 
of him, but nothing in those conversations would ever signal he was 
a violent individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his first call, nine years ago, Ashbrook complained that he  
had lost his job because police were following him, Windham said. 
He said he assured Ashbrook that wasn't true. 
</P>
<P>
	Such calls aren't unusual. Windham said about half a dozen  
people regularly call his office to complain or talk. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time he spoke with Ashbrook was a few months before the  
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said: `How are you doing?'  
</P>
<P>
	``He said: `Not too good. My father died.'  
</P>
<P>
	``I said: `I'm very sorry to hear that.'  
</P>
<P>
	``He said: `All he left me was debts. I don't have a job. I  
haven't worked for years and I guess I'm going to lose my house 
because it's not paid for, and I don't have any way to pay for 
it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't angry, and he really wasn't distraught. It was just  
a voice of concern,'' Windham said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 15, Ashbrook walked into Wedgwood Baptist Church and  
opened fire during a youth meeting, shooting 14 people before 
taking his own life. 
</P>
<P>
	Windham said Ashbrook never mentioned guns or religion, and he  
said he didn't consider urging Ashbrook to seek professional help. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only advice I ever gave him was, just because he lost one  
job doesn't mean he couldn't get another,'' Windham said.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Woos Christian Conservatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes  
asked Christian conservatives Saturday to follow him and not GOP 
front-runner George W. Bush. ``We don't have to settle for mush,'' 
Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes tried to rally support at the Christian Coalition's  
annual ``Road to Victory'' conference by painting his agenda as 
more conservative -- and more defined -- than that of Bush, the Texas 
governor who is the runaway favorite in polls and among Republican 
campaign contributors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The front-runner won't promise to appoint pro-life judges, but  
I have and will. The front-runner won't promise to appoint a 
pro-life running mate; I have and will,'' Forbes said to applause 
from some 3,500 coalition members at a downtown hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``George W. Bush, it's time to debate. ... The Republican Party  
deserves to know its nominee,'' Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	He reiterated his support for school vouchers, school prayer and  
a flat tax. He stressed repeatedly that he would appoint to the 
federal bench only those judges ``who believe in the sanctity of 
the Constitution and in the sanctity of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said, without elaboration, that he would have ``no  
litmus test'' for judicial appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very tempting, with an election coming up, to muffle our  
principles,'' Forbes said Saturday. ``We don't have to settle for 
mush. We don't have to abandon the party of Reagan'' in order to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	The wealthy publisher, his wife, Sabina, and three of their five  
daughters then mingled with coalition members over a picnic lunch 
paid for by Forbes. Members of his small army of young volunteers 
wore matching denim shirts with red bandannas knotted around their 
necks. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes also castigated Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, a former  
professional wrestler, for his published comments last week against 
organized religion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bullies end up belittling themselves,'' Forbes said. ``Faith  
is not a crutch for the weak. It is a wellspring of hope and 
comfort for the humble.''

	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- South Korea will play host to the opening match  
of the next World Cup on June 1, 2002, with the final to take place 
June 30 in Japan, international soccer officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dates for the World Cup were set at a FIFA executive  
committee meeting, at which Asian countries also formally agreed to 
accept a plan for the number of places per continent in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, Asia will get a chance for a fifth spot in the  
World Cup in a playoff with Europe, essentially the same terms that 
provoked a walkout by Asian delegates to a FIFA meeting in Los 
Angeles in July and threats of a possible World Cup boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	``The threat of any boycott has been set off with a red card  
somewhere and will not come up again,'' FIFA president Sepp Blatter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter acknowledged, though, that Asian delegates were still  
not happy about the plan, and by the committee's decision to reject 
an Asian request that the Asian team have its playoff against the 
Oceania representative instead of one from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``You cannot have happiness for everybody, it is not possible,''  
Blatter said. ``But we have peace in the football family now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asia had three automatic berths in last year's tournament and  
got another spot when Iran won a playoff with Australia, the 
Oceania champion. The continent will get four automatic berths for 
2002, with its third team in qualifying playing Europe's 14th place 
team for a fifth berth. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-day meeting of the FIFA executive committee ended  
Saturday with soccer officials setting the dates for the next World 
Cup, which will be jointly hosted by South Korea and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The June 1 kickoff is the earliest since 1986 when the  
tournament was played in Mexico and started May 31. Last year's 
World Cup in France began June 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee officials had discussed starting the finals even  
earlier to try to avoid the area's rainy season, but European 
soccer officials protested successfully that a May kickoff was out 
of the question because the European soccer season would not end 
early enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who today can predict weather conditions in June 2002 in Korea  
and Japan?'' Blatter asked. 
</P>
<P>
	In other issues, Blatter said:  
</P>
<P>
	-- A record 172 entries for the next World Cup were in by the  
Sept. 30 deadline, with others expected by mail that will lift the 
number of entries to about 190. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The site of the 2006 World Cup will be decided at a July 5-6,  
2000, meeting of FIFA's 24-member executive committee in 
Switzerland. Brazil, Germany, South Africa, England and Morocco are 
the five finalists. 
</P>
<P>
	-- FIFA is making progress on a master calendar that would help  
solve scheduling conflicts among different soccer federations. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The prospect of the World Cup being held every two years,  
instead of every four years, has been shelved until after the 2002 
World Cup. ``It's not dead, it's just well guarded,'' Blatter said.

<P>
	PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) -- Seattle Post-Intelligencer sportswriter  
Angelo Bruscas had a brush with the law while trying to cover 
Washington State's 31-7 victory over California on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	After crowding past a civilian security guard following the  
game, Bruscas failed to stop for a Washington State University 
police officer and was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pushing one of our kids was a major mistake. He compounded it  
when he didn't comply with the request to stop,'' Sgt. Steve Hansen 
said. ``We maybe could have straightened it out. He needed to stop 
and talk with the officer instead of walking away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruscas didn't stop for the officer right away because he had to  
use the restroom. 
</P>
<P>
	She handcuffed him when he came out and he was taken to the  
campus police station, cited for fourth-degree assault, obstruction 
of an officer, and released. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted in Whitman County District Court he could face a  
maximum sentence of a year in jail and a $5,000 fine, Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington State sports information director Rod Commons said  
the security guard had been told to hold back the media for 10 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the media began to argue strongly and somebody opened  
the door and they started charging up the stairs,'' Commons said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruscas says he was just doing his job with the rest of the  
reporters hurrying to the media room. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's standard procedure. It's not like we were barging into  
the locker room,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruscas, who was wearing his press pass, said he couldn't  
believe his arrest, but he had the bruised wrist to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so flabbergasted. I'm still stunned. I may have to get  
something for my wrist,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My editors were flabbergasted. I wrote my story off the quote  
sheet. I wasn't able to talk to players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said a lawyer has been contacted.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've never encountered anything like this in 20 years of  
reporting,'' Bruscas said. ``It's the equivalent of being arrested 
going into City Hall to cover the city council meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruscas said his big mistake was choosing to use the toilet  
rather than talking to the officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly wasn't belligerent or anything like that other  
than having to go to the bathroom,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Korean Vets Can't Be Prosecuted </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writers    	
</P>
<P>
	Orders for U.S. troops to fire on civilians during the Korean  
War were illegal and the men who followed them at No Gun Ri could 
have faced court martial, legal specialists say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty simple: Soldiers are not allowed to shoot  
noncombatants,'' said Gary D. Solis, who teaches the law of war at 
the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecuting the gray-haired veterans today is a practical  
impossibility, experts say. And at the time in Korea, they say, 
such events apparently were ignored by officers up the chain of 
Army command. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't understand why I didn't know about it. I guess because  
it was kept quiet,'' Howard Levie, who was a top Army war crimes 
prosecutor in 1950, said of the No Gun Ri killings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press reported Wednesday that a dozen veterans of  
the 1st Cavalry Division, corroborating the accounts of survivors, 
said their unit killed a large number of South Korean refugees at 
No Gun Ri, a hamlet 100 miles southeast of the South Korean capital 
of Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	The survivors say 400 people were killed in the mass shooting  
and a preceding U.S. air attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The ex-soldiers say they shot the civilians because they feared  
disguised North Korean soldiers were among the group. Some veterans 
said they received sporadic gunfire from among the refugees. Others 
do not remember hostile fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The fear of enemy infiltrators led U.S. commanders in the early  
days of the Korean War to issue orders to fire on refugees, 
according to declassified documents found by the AP in the National 
Archives in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25th Infantry Division commander instructed his troops that  
civilians in the battle zone ``are to be considered as enemy and 
action taken accordingly.'' In the 1st Cavalry Division, the 
operations chief issued this order: ``No refugees to cross the 
front line. Fire everyone trying to cross lines. Use discretion in 
case of women and children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such orders are patently illegal, military law experts say.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have never heard of orders like this, not outside the orders  
given by Germans that we heard about during the Nuremberg Trials,'' 
said Scott Silliman of Duke University, a retired colonel and Air 
Force lawyer for 25 years. He referred to the prosecution of Nazi 
leaders after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1950-53 war, there were no prosecutions of anything  
more than individual murders of civilians by U.S. servicemen, the 
experts note. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, the Army's cadre of lawyers, the Judge Advocate  
Generals Corps, ``was relatively small when the Korean War broke 
out,'' said Joseph Kelly, a retired colonel who was a Pentagon 
lawyer during the Korean conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's now larger and permeates the structure more, and the  
officers tend to rely on them to keep out of trouble,'' said Kelly, 
a professor of international law at the Dickinson law school in 
Carlisle, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Levie, who headed a unit at the Army's Far East Command  
investigating North Korean war crimes, said Army officers must have 
kept No Gun Ri and similar incidents out of the records in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was in their unit, then for the sake of the unit they  
didn't want to report it,'' said the retired colonel of Newport, 
R.I., who eventually became chief drafter of the Korean armistice 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, for much of U.S. military history, ``we've done very  
badly in not trying cases. ... What bothers me most is the fact 
that the American public seems to take the side of the war criminal 
if he's American.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was not until the Vietnam War that the U.S. military issued a  
directive requiring all officers to report violations of the law of 
war up the chain of command. Officers involved in the cover-up of 
the My Lai massacre in 1968 were disciplined on that basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has given no answer to questions about legal action  
against soldiers involved in No Gun Ri. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting to the historical accuracy of things is the  
overarching goal here, and ... we don't know where the road will 
lead,'' said Pentagon spokesman Adm. Craig Quigley. 
</P>
<P>
	The experts see little chance for a My Lai-type prosecution  
today for war crimes that occurred during the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
	Until 1996, U.S. soldiers who committed war crimes and then left  
the service could not be prosecuted. In that year, Congress passed 
a War Crimes Act enabling the government to prosecute civilians for 
war crimes committed while in the service. But that law is not 
retroactive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Effectively speaking, there is no way to prosecute these  
offenses, even if you could get someone to admit they purposely 
engaged in this kind of conduct,'' said West Point's Solis. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States last year rejected an attempt to make American  
soldiers more broadly liable for war crimes when it declined to 
sign a treaty creating an international criminal court. American 
officials said they felt the final accord -- approved by 120 
countries -- left U.S. troops and citizens vulnerable to potentially 
unfair prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	American soldiers sent to Korea a half-century ago were issued a  
palm-sized booklet telling them the Hague Conventions of 1907 
forbid targeting civilians. ``Hostilities are restricted to the 
armed forces of belligerents,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in combat situations, the ``law of war'' was meaningless,  
said Korean War veteran Earl Frawley of Esmond, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	``In battle, you take those damn books and throw them so far  
maybe they'll hit the enemy,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Martinsville Big Hurdle for Jarrett </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINSVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Dale Jarrett could be excused if he  
shudders when he drives his personal car into Martinsville 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The nearly-flat, .526-mile oval in the hills of southern  
Virginia has not been a very welcoming place for the 
second-generation NASCAR driving star. 
</P>
<P>
	Since he ran his first race here in 1984, Jarrett has managed  
seven top-10 finishes in 26 starts, including two thirds. One of 
those third-place finishes came in the spring of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Jarrett has finished 42nd and eighth at Martinsville  
-- typical of his mixed results here over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still not as good at this track as we'd like to be,''  
said Jarrett, who holds a 257-point lead over Mark Martin in the 
season standings heading into Sunday's NAPA AutoCare 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett built most of his lead with 20 top-10 finishes --  
including 18 top-fives and all four of his wins -- in the first 22 
races of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he has been inconsistent, with two thirds and  
finishes of 38th, 16th and 18th in his last five races. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't been disastrous, but a championship that was  
practically conceded to Jarrett when he held a 314-point lead after 
the Michigan Speedway race Aug. 22, has at least been put in 
question with seven races remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinsville, with its reputation for fender-rubbing,  
brake-wearing competition, could be a key hurdle for Jarrett in the 
title chase. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a place where Jarrett, who will start 14th in the 43-car  
field, isn't confident of a good result. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still not to the point where we feel we can challenge  
those guys up front on the long runs, and that's usually our strong 
point,'' Jarrett said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a difficult track, but I think it's the challenge of  
Martinsville that makes me want to come here. There's only a few 
racetracks we haven't figured out and that makes me want to come 
here and get it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who won here in the spring of 1992 and has finished  
third and fifth in his last two Martinsville races, will start 
sixth Sunday. Going into the 500-lap race, he is only seven points 
ahead of third-place Bobby Labonte and 27 in front of rookie Tony 
Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Martinsville has never been a great track for me,'' Martin  
said. ``I've never run well at flat tracks, especially when they 
are this small. It they started 10 less cars, it would make a huge 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``But with 43 cars, if you start in back, you're nearly a lap  
down already. If you start up front, you're in traffic with a few 
laps. Given those choices, I'll take the spot up front.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte, who crashed his primary car in Friday's practice, will  
start his backup 25th, while his Joe Gibbs Racing teammate, 
Stewart, will start a season-worst 37th. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate we lost a car,'' Labonte said. ``It puts a lot of work  
on all the guys. I flat lost it on sticker (new) tires. I've been 
coming here long enough that I should know better. 
</P>
<P>
	``That put us in a little hole for Sunday.''  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who won the first of his two Winston Cup poles here in  
April and finished 20th in the race, said, ``We just haven't hit on 
the right set-up. This place has been tough on me this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pole-winner Joe Nemechek and Ted Musgrave will start from the  
front row, just ahead of Geoffrey Bodine, Kyle Petty, Jeff Gordon 
and Martin. Defending champion Ricky Rudd will start eighth, with 
spring winner John Andretti ninth.

 *Walter Bergman    	
</P>
<P>
	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Walter Bergman, a civil rights  
activist and a founder of the Michigan chapter of the ACLU and the 
Michigan Federation of Teachers, died Wednesday of congestive heart 
failure. He was 100. 
</P>
<P>
	A member of the Freedom Riders, Bergman was among those attacked  
on Mother's Day, 1961 by Ku Klux Klan members and other vigilantes 
in Anniston, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Bergman was knocked to the floor, pounded with fists and stomped  
on his head, neck and shoulders. Doctors believe a stroke he 
suffered months later stemmed from the beating. He was 61 at the 
time and spent the rest of his life in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, the ACLU sued the government on behalf of Bergman after  
it was learned the FBI was aware of -- but did not stop -- the 
planned attack on the Freedom Riders. 
</P>
<P>
	Bergman, a professor at Wayne State and the University of  
Michigan, devoted himself to activism after retiring from an 
academic career in the early 1960s.

<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Weldon W. Case, the former chairman and chief  
executive officer of Alltel Corp., died Thursday of heart failure 
in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Case was 14 when he started as a line crew member in 1934 with  
the company, then known as Hudson Underground Telephone Co. He 
worked his way up to general manager and to president of the 
company known as Western Reserve Telephone Co. 
</P>
<P>
	After making several acquisitions, Case founded Mid-Continent  
Telephone Co., which merged in 1983 with Allied Telephone Co. to 
form Alltel Corp. He was chairman and chief executive until he 
retired in 1991 at age 70.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dr. John J. Conley, a surgeon who developed  
operations for improving the speech of patients who lost their 
voice boxes to cancer, died on Sept. 21. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Conley, an otolaryngologist, also developed operations for  
rehabilitating the larynx, grafting facial nerves and 
reconstruction after the loss of the jaw to cancer. He developed 
the idea of single-stage rehabilitation after extensive head and 
neck surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	He pioneered reconstruction methods for the cheek and face as an  
Army surgeon in World War II, and developed further innovations in 
the 1960s and early 1970s. In the early 1990s, he founded the John 
Conley Foundation for Ethics and Philosophy in Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Conley retired at age 80, ending his long-standing professional  
ties to Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, 
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, and St. Vincent's Hospital 
and Medical Center.

</P>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Pat Davis, a popular broadcast  
journalist who covered California politics and national news for 
three decades, died Friday of a heart attack during a bicycle ride. 
He was 58. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4 Davis, an aggressive, physically imposing reporter  
with a skeptical demeanor and a biting sense of humor, often 
covered stories hundreds of miles apart in a day, feeding a stream 
of reports to his radio station as well stations in San Francisco 
and Los Angeles, and the CBS radio network in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who was born in Wichita, Kan., also appeared in a weekly  
political broadcast for public television on station KVIE in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' news reports were heard regularly on KFBK in Sacramento,  
his home station, as well as KNX in Los Angeles, KGO in San 
Francisco and on CBS and Associated Press Radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1970s, he has covered virtually every major national  
news story in northern and central California, as well as 
presidential, gubernatorial and U.S. Senate campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife and two children.

<P>
	MYSTIC, Conn. (AP) -- Charles A. Federer Jr., the editor in chief  
of Sky and Telescope magazine, died Tuesday. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Federer started the magazine for amateur astronomers in 1941 and  
retired in 1974. The magazine now has a circulation of about 
125,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Federer taught himself astronomy as a child growing up in  
Redding. He earned a physics degree from the City College of New 
York in the 1930s and founded his own magazine by combining two 
money-losing journals, The Sky and The Telescope.

	CROWN POINT, Ind. (AP) -- Former Bishop Norbert Gaughan, who  
fought the Vatican's move to scale back his duties as bishop of the 
Roman Catholic Diocese of Gary after suffering a series of strokes, 
died Friday. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaughan was installed as the second bishop of the Gary Diocese  
in July 1984. He moved the center of diocesan operations from the 
main cathedral in beleaguered Gary to a new $1.3 million ``pastoral 
center'' in nearby suburban Merrillville. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaughan suffered a stroke in April 1989, followed by a severe  
second stroke in February 1992 that kept him from his duties for 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
	That spring, Gaughan was visited twice by the late Cardinal  
Joseph Bernardin of Chicago. Bernardin assessed of Gaughan's 
abilities to administer to the diocese, which has about 181,000 
parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on those reports and medical reports, Pope John Paul II  
appointed Bishop Dale Melczek, then auxiliary bishop for the 
Archdiocese of Detroit, to handle the Gary diocese's administrative 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1993, Gaughan traveled to Rome to appeal to the pope  
for the ``complete reinstatement'' of his job, but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaughan retired from the active ministry on June 1, 1996.

73. 
</P>
<P>
	Born as Silvio Smiraglia, Salvador taught himself how to play  
guitar and became known as a be-bop improviser. 
</P>
<P>
	He performed with Stan Kenton, Bill Evans, Phil Woods and other  
jazz greats. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1970 until recently, Salvador taught jazz at the University

<HEADLINE> Underwood Has Trouble With Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Associated Press Writer-    	
</P>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Dimitrius Underwood is massive -- 6-foot-6,  
270 pounds of muscle -- but the powerful NFL player has had a hard 
time dealing with pressure, in the eyes of some who know him. 
</P>
<P>
	It's one reason a relatively minor ankle sprain kept him from  
playing at Michigan State his senior year. It might have 
contributed to his decision to walk away from a $5.3 million, 
five-year contract with the Minnesota Vikings the first day of 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	And it could be part of the reason the defensive lineman for the  
Miami Dolphins slashed at his neck with two steak knives last 
Sunday after pacing around his girlfriend's apartment yelling, ``I 
am not worthy of God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure has come from many places, said his high school  
pastor, the Rev. Moses Townsend, who visited Underwood Friday at 
the inpatient mental health clinic where he is being treated. 
</P>
<P>
	He felt pressure living up to football's demands while at  
Michigan State. He had trouble dealing with the media spotlight 
when he got the Vikings contract, then spent four days in a 
Philadelphia hotel deciding if he should play football or serve 
God. 
</P>
<P>
	And he felt pressure from an unidentified man from Immanuel's  
Temple Community Church in Lansing, Townsend said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was throwing him off course,'' Townsend said Saturday. ``He  
(Underwood) wasn't taking as much interest in his mother as he had 
in the past. Whatever this man said, that's what it looked like he 
wanted to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood's mother, Eileen Underwood, an ordained minister who  
lives in Philadelphia, first said her son was being affected by ``a 
cult that's posing as a church.'' Then on Friday, she said that she 
and Immanuel's Temple's pastor, the Rev. Phillip Owens, both are 
born-again Christians. 
</P>
<P>
	``So it goes without saying that we should both be on the same  
accord, rather than creating conflict caused by 
misinterpretation,'' she said in a statement released by her son's 
agent, Craig Domann. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood attended Immanuel's Temple on and off for about a  
year. He now has no interest in returning, Townsend said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who were around him seemed to have a lot of  
influence, and it didn't turn out well,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens has denied his church is a cult. He led a men's breakfast  
meeting Saturday but declined to speak to an Associated Press 
reporter about the church. He said a statement would be issued in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The church got more attention Friday when Michigan State  
University police said a 23-year-old former Spartans student found 
dead Sept. 22 in an unused cooler in a dorm basement also had 
attended Immanuel's Temple for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
	For Underwood, some of his turmoil might have shown up in a  
series of traffic tickets. He had a clean driving record until June 
1998, when he failed to pay a ticket for not wearing a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1998, he was ticketed for going 74 mph in a 45 mph  
zone in Georgia. This June, he was ticketed for speeding 91 mph in 
a 70 mph zone near Grand Blanc. He disobeyed a traffic signal in 
East Lansing in August, causing his license to be suspended 
indefinitely Sept. 16. He has no car registered in his name, but 
was driving a Lexus in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Townsend said Underwood's struggles with pressure occasionally  
caused him to back away from football but never diminished his 
desire to make it a career. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the junior was the co-winner of Michigan State's Iron  
Man Award for weight training. The telecommunications major from. 
Fayetteville, N.C., also had his best football year in 1997, 
starting all but one game and finishing second in tackles among 
defensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
	But he seemed not to like the constant demand to perform.  
</P>
<P>
	``They (the coaches) wanted him to eat football, sleep  
football,'' Townsend said. ``So he called me and I said, `Just back 
off a year.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	In August of his senior year, Underwood sprained an ankle at the  
beginning of two-a-day drills. Doctors cleared him to play against 
Indiana Oct. 10, but he never asked to be put in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's a guy who elected not to play football,'' John  
Lewandowski, Michigan State sports information director, said. 
``Once he made that decision, he wasn't around a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans red-shirted Underwood, expecting him to come back  
for a fifth year. But in late December, he said he wanted to be 
drafted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It caught all of us off guard,'' Lewandowski said. ``There  
aren't a lot of people who sit out their senior season, then go out 
for the draft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings surprisingly made him their second first-round draft  
choice, 29th choice overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dimitrius Underwood is one of the most impressive guys as far  
as his height, weight, quickness and speed,'' Vikings coach Dennis 
Green said in April. 
</P>
<P>
	But the pressure of being a first-round draft pick might have  
gotten to Underwood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing he accomplished on the field warranted him being  
thrown into the limelight,'' Lewandowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one from the Vikings organization contacted Michigan State  
coach Nick Saban, who would have told them of the concerns he had 
about Underwood's decision not to play after the ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dimitrius' behavior over a little time here was a little  
unusual,'' Saban said last week, adding that coaches had tried to 
help Underwood his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, his brush with death might bring Underwood the treatment he  
needs. He said Friday he wants to return to the Dolphins, who this 
week put him on the reserved-nonfootball injury list. 
</P>
<P>
	If it hadn't been for an immediate call to 911 by his girlfriend  
and quick action by Lansing police and emergency workers, Underwood 
could have ended up in worse shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirtless, barefoot and covered in blood to his waist, he told  
police: ``You are Satan and you are going to hell'' and ``I want to 
be saved, I want to meet God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He spent four days being treated at Sparrow Hospital. Now life  
appears better. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's up and around, he's talking and laughing,'' Townsend said  
Saturday. ``I encouraged him to fight and get himself together. I 
think he will.''

<HEADLINE> Metric Ignorance Caused Mars Mishap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- How does the United States measure up to the  
rest of the world in accepting the metric system? Look no farther 
than the doomed Mars Climate Orbiter, say proponents of meters, 
grams and liters. 
</P>
<P>
	The $125 million spacecraft was lost because NASA navigators  
mistakenly thought a contractor used metric measurements. The 
contractor had used English units, and the probe burned up in the 
Martian atmosphere Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``A stupid error like that could have been avoided if we had  
been on the metric system,'' said Valerie Antoine, executive 
director of the U.S. Metric Association. ``This is a very good 
reason Congress had better get busy and mandate we go metric.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1975, Congress approved a policy to ``coordinate and plan ...  
the voluntary conversion to the metric system.'' But it wasn't 
mandatory, and Americans still pump their gas in gallons and follow 
signs with distances marked in miles. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA went metric in 1996, and there have been other bumpy  
conversions. In 1983, a Canadian jetliner nearly ran out of fuel 
after someone pumped 22,300 pounds of fuel into its tanks rather 
than 22,300 kilograms. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver Leslie, chairman of the Americans for Customary Weight  
and Measure, says conversion to the metric system is a waste of 
money. People can guess the length of a foot. But a meter? It's 
3.28083989501312 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``NASA's interested in researching space and discovering the  
great unknown and getting there as safely as possible,'' he said. 
``We don't need errors created by people fumbling around with two 
measurement systems. 
</P>
<P>
	About 95 percent of the world uses the metric system. Some U.S.  
businesses that sell their products abroad relabel their products 
for overseas sales. Others, such as automakers, have switched to 
metric measurements. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other signs that the United States is inching toward  
acceptance of the metric system: supermarkets stock soda in 2-liter 
bottles, cameras take 35 mm film, and police regularly seize 
``kilos'' of drugs.

<HEADLINE> Indians' Smiley Throws Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- John Smiley played catch this week and kept the  
ball as a souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
	Smiley had been waiting two years for the chance to throw a  
baseball again after breaking his left arm while warming up before 
a game in Kansas City in September, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so juiced up I couldn't even go to sleep that night,''  
Smiley said of his Thursday workout. ``A year ago, it really didn't 
look to good. It's been a tough haul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smiley broke the humerus bone in his left arm while throwing in  
the visitors' bullpen at Kauffman Stadium before a scheduled start 
on Sept. 20, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The break was so severe that as he laid on the ground, Smiley  
remembered thinking his arm had fallen off and he searched in the 
dirt for it. It was the same injury sustained by former major 
league pitchers Dave Dravecky and Tom Browning. 
</P>
<P>
	Smiley, who won 20 games for Pittsburgh in 1991, decided to try  
and comeback from the injury and has spent the past two seasons 
undergoing extensive rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	He came to the ballpark everyday to lift weights, run and  
undergo treatments in the hopes he could one day return to the 
mound. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Thursday, he made 25 throws at a distance of 40 feet  
while playing catch with outfielder Jacob Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great.'' Smiley said. ``All the work has paid off. That  
was my goal before the end of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smiley played catch again on Saturday, throwing 25 more times at  
a distance of 45 feet. He hopes to back up five more feet next 
week, and another five a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today was even better than the other day,'' said Smiley. ``The  
ball came out nice and straight. I don't know if I could have 
broken a pane of glass though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smiley will continue to rehab during the postseason, and said if  
he can keep progressing, he could begin throwing off a mound after 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old Smiley's contract expires this year with the  
Indians. However, he said he wants to pitch for the Indians and is 
confident he can get a minor league deal with the club before 
spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been tough coming in here and not being able to help the  
team,'' he said. ``I just want to pitch again for this team. I 
don't care if it's out of the bullpen. It would sure be great to 
get out there one more time.''

<HEADLINE> Ovitz Pledges $25M for NFL Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hollywood dealmaker Michael Ovitz pledged $25  
million to demonstrate his interest in bringing an NFL expansion 
team to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz and partners Ron Burkle and Tom Cruise will forfeit the  
money if they are selected to own the expansion franchise, but fail 
to hold up their end of an agreement with the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	League officials originally suggested a down payment of $100  
million. But they lowered their request after meeting with Ovitz 
and said they were impressed with the group's commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to respect their resolve and responsiveness in the  
past few days,'' said Roger Goodell, the NFL's vice president of 
football operations. ``We will just have to see now how things play 
themselves out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burkle cut short a vacation to meet with FBI agents Friday as  
part of the NFL's background check in preparing to select an owner 
for the league's 32nd team at Tuesday and Wednesday's meetings in 
Atlanta. The league has finished its investigation of Ovitz's 
background. 
</P>
<P>
	Burkle, a self-made billionaire who owns supermarkets, is one of  
several backers Ovitz brought together for the deal. Another is 
Cruise, an actor. The group holds an option on a 97-acre parcel of 
land adjacent to Hollywood Park racetrack as a possible location 
for a new stadium. The track is located southwest of downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's main opposition is Bob McNair of Houston, who said  
he would up his franchise bid, expected to be more than $625 
million, in response to Ovitz's offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz's bid is not expected to be much more than the $540  
million that the city of Cleveland paid for an expansion team.

<HEADLINE> Sharp Appeal Wins in Miami Mile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Sharp Appeal rallied to win the $255,000 Miami Mile  
Breeders' Cup Handicap on the grass at Calder Race Course on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Javier Castellano, Sharp Appeal caught Shamrock City --  
a 13-1 shot -- to win by 1 3/4 lengths. Shamrock City held on for 
second by a length over Hurrahy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharp Appeal ran the mile in 1:35.60, and the entry of the  
first- and third-place finishers paid $6.20, $3.40 and $3.40. 
Shamrock City paid $14 and $11. Unite's Big Red, the 8-5 favorite 
in the 11-horse field, was last on the backstretch and finished 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	On the first turn, Shamrock City, running on the inside, was  
head and head for the lead with Wertz. Sharp Appeal was seventh and 
Hurrahy was last. Unite's Big Red was ninth and dropped back 
entering the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
	On the far turn, Shamrock City and Wertz remained even, a length  
in front of Tekken. Sharp Appeal moved into fifth on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Shamrock City shook off Wertz on the last turn, but Sharp Appeal  
caught him in midstretch and won going away. Hurrahy made up 
considerable ground in the drive to finish third. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharp Appeal, a 6-year-old, Florida-bred son of World Appeal,  
failed to win in seven previous starts this year, but had finished 
in the money in three graded stakes. Last year, he won the Grade 
III Bougainvillea Handicap at Hialeah. 
</P>
<P>
	Owned by Martin Cherry and trained by Marty Wolfson, Sharp  
Appeal has won 10 of 36 starts, has been in the money 25 times and 
has earned $686,621.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Woos Christian Conservatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes  
asked Christian conservatives Saturday to follow him and not GOP 
front-runner George W. Bush. ``We don't have to settle for mush,'' 
Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes tried to rally support at the Christian Coalition's  
annual ``Road to Victory'' conference by painting his agenda as 
more conservative -- and more defined -- than that of Bush, the Texas 
governor who is the runaway favorite in polls and among Republican 
campaign contributors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The front-runner won't promise to appoint pro-life judges, but  
I have and will. The front-runner won't promise to appoint a 
pro-life running mate; I have and will,'' Forbes said to applause 
from some 3,500 coalition members at a downtown hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``George W. Bush, it's time to debate. ... The Republican Party  
deserves to know its nominee,'' Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	He reiterated his support for school vouchers, school prayer and  
a flat tax. He stressed repeatedly that he would appoint to the 
federal bench only those judges ``who believe in the sanctity of 
the Constitution and in the sanctity of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said, without elaboration, that he would have ``no  
litmus test'' for judicial appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very tempting, with an election coming up, to muffle our  
principles,'' Forbes said Saturday. ``We don't have to settle for 
mush. We don't have to abandon the party of Reagan'' in order to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	The wealthy publisher, his wife, Sabina, and three of their five  
daughters then mingled with coalition members over a picnic lunch 
paid for by Forbes. Members of his small army of young volunteers 
wore matching denim shirts with red bandannas knotted around their 
necks. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes also castigated Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, a former  
professional wrestler, for his published comments last week against 
organized religion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bullies end up belittling themselves,'' Forbes said. ``Faith  
is not a crutch for the weak. It is a wellspring of hope and 
comfort for the humble.''

<HEADLINE> NHL Returns to Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Alan Cowart wanted to wear his old Atlanta Flames  
jersey to the Thrashers' inaugural game Saturday night. 
Unfortunately, 19 years had passed since the city's last NHL game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He tried to put it on, but it was too small,'' said Cowart's  
wife, Cindy. ``So I wore it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Cowart, who settled for a new Thrashers jersey as his  
attire, reminisced about his hockey roots before heading into the 
$213 million Philips Arena, where the Thrashers opened their first 
season against the New Jersey Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devils won 4-1, but the sellout crowd of 18,545 seemed happy  
just to have a team again, saluting the Thrashers with a standing 
ovation in the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	As a child, Cowart lived across the street from Cliff Fletcher,  
the Flames' general manager, and was a friend of Fletcher's son, 
Chuck. 
</P>
<P>
	``We used to go to the games together,'' Cowart recalled. ``I  
have all the sticks from all those old players in the '70s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flames moved to Calgary in 1980 after eight years in  
Atlanta, leaving a void in Cowart's life that wasn't filled until 
Saturday night. He is hopeful that this second foray into the NHL 
will last a lot longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The expectations are high,'' he said. ``Everyone here wants a  
winner. We've got to give them a chance. But it's great to have 
hockey back. This is very exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't the only one sharing that feeling. The cheering  
started as soon as the Zamboni drove on the ice and it took less 
than a minute for the first ``Let's go, Thrashers'' chant to 
reverberate through the spectacular new arena. 
</P>
<P>
	New York native Gary Colangelo watched from the top row, having  
convinced two of his friends to take in their first NHL game. They 
paid $10 for their seats and considered it a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't beat it,'' Colangelo said. ``There's not a bad seat  
in the arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two seats away, Ted Charette sipped on a beer and pondered the  
view. He joked about needing to bring a tissue to deal with his 
nosebleed, but actually was surprised by how close the ice seemed 
from so far away. Also, there are benefits to sitting in the cheap 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``More money for beer,'' Charette said.  
</P>
<P>
	After a raucous pregame ceremony augmented by rock music,  
fireworks, lasers and team mascot ``flying'' in on a cable from the 
roof of the building, the Thrashers gave a nod to the city's hockey 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernie Geoffrion, the beloved first coach of the Flames, was  
invited to take part in the ceremonial puck drop. Still an Atlanta 
resident, the Boomer received a standing ovation as he strolled to 
center ice for the ceremony with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, 
Atlanta mayor Bill Campbell and team officials. 
</P>
<P>
	When the new team was introduced, the biggest cheers were  
reserved for goaltender Damian Rhodes, captain Kelly Buchberger and 
first-round pick Patrik Stefan. 
</P>
<P>
	After the introductions were finished, the announcer induced  
even more cheers when he proclaimed, ``Atlanta, you now live in a 
hockey town!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Rosenzweig, a Boston native who is moving to Atlanta in  
January, purchased a pair of the high-priced club seats and brought 
his fiance, Christine Kostos, to her first hockey game. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is so exciting,'' she said, adjusting a new Thrashers cap  
her fiance had just purchased for her. ``I had it written into the 
pre-nups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenzweig wasn't aware of Atlanta's hockey history.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't remember the Atlanta Flames at all,'' he said. ``The  
Calgary Flames came from Atlanta? I had no idea. Wow.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Balks on Benefit Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid opposition and confusion in their own  
ranks, congressional Republicans are shopping for alternatives to 
their plan to delay income-support payments to working poor 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders backed away from the idea Friday as a second of  
their party's presidential contenders criticized the proposal, and 
House GOP moderates and Senate Republicans predicted its demise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to knee-jerk anything right now,'' House Speaker  
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., acknowledged after meeting with 
rank-and-file lawmakers. ``We need to assess, to see where we're 
at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal, approved Thursday by the House Appropriations  
Committee, would change the lump-sum payment that nearly all 20 
million recipients of the earned-income tax credit now get into 12 
monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old tax credit program is aimed at helping  
low-income people avoid falling into welfare. The credit averages 
$1,890 annually for families with children, and will cost nearly 
$32 billion next year, the Treasury Department estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Without referring to the proposal specifically, Sen. Slade  
Gorton, R-Wash., used the weekly Republican radio address today to 
emphasize the GOP's commitment to protect Social Security 
surpluses, oppose tax increases and expand local control of federal 
education aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We Republicans intend to accomplish our goals without shutting  
down the federal government,'' Gorton said. 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, Republicans were focusing on limiting damage from  
the plan to delay income-support benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans feared that the idea, and the negative reaction  
it has sparked, would overshadow the party's high-profile goal of 
protecting Social Security surpluses and be used against them by 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Republicans  
could be hurt by ``the image that we're changing a program that 
primarily benefits the lowest-income people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``In the end ... we'll decide not to do that.''  
</P>
<P>
	The decisive blow seemed to have been dealt Thursday by Texas  
Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP's leading presidential contender, when 
he said Republicans shouldn't ``balance their budget on the backs 
of the poor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless he says, 'I had this all wrong,' then I think it's dead  
on arrival,'' said Rep. James Greenwood, R-Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert said the plan had been described to the campaigns of  
Bush and other GOP candidates before it was introduced, and that 
congressional Republicans got no response. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope that we'd have a future dialogue on these kind of  
issues,'' he said in a hint of pique. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., another presidential candidate, added  
his own criticism on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If our goal is to have lower-income Americans lifted up into  
the middle class, this is the wrong way to do it,'' said McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said each beneficiary would receive the same amount  
of money as now. But opponents said the change would deny 
recipients the big cash infusion many now use to buy expensive 
items. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they propose to do is unconscionable,'' President Clinton  
said Friday, reiterating his promise to kill the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawmakers and aides said the proposal might gain public  
acceptance -- and House votes -- if they did a better job of selling 
it. They said they had to emphasize that benefits from Social 
Security and many other income-support programs are already paid 
monthly. 
</P>
<P>
	But underlining the GOP's disarray, House Majority Whip Tom  
DeLay, R-Texas, the plan's sponsor, said of Republicans at the same 
meeting, ``I didn't think they understood it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though not yet jettisoning the proposal, lawmakers and aides  
acknowledged they were looking for other ways to raise the $8.7 
billion they had expected the plan to save in the budget for fiscal 
2000, which began Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said other savings options they were exploring  
included making their plan to switch from lump-sum to monthly 
payments optional and cutting spending bills across the board. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, most of the money under the program is paid early in  
the year, when beneficiaries file income-tax returns. Under the 
plan, the payments would be spread out so that $8.7 billion would 
be paid after Sept. 30, 2000 -- spilling into fiscal 2001, and out 
of the books for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile Friday, the House approved two more compromise  
spending bills for the new fiscal year, readying them for Senate 
action and Clinton's expected signature. A $69 billion agriculture 
bill was passed, 240-175, and a $51 billion transportation measure 
was approved, 304-91.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Tops U.S. in Rugby 53-8 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Ireland's Keith Wood grabbed four tries  
in a 53-8 victory over the United States to open Group E on 
Saturday at the Rugby World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish scored seven tries in a tuneup up for next week's  
defining group match against Australia. Wood took over the World 
Cup scoring lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. fielded just four players who earn a living from the  
sport, compared to the fully professional Irish squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrations boiled over at the finish as players from both  
teams threw punches. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish went 10-0 ahead after seven minutes when they opted to  
kick for the sideline instead of goal after winning a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans were unable to settle down and found it hard to  
hang onto the ball as they sent it along the backline. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. kept Ireland's lead to 24-8 at halftime but some hard  
tackling and strong running, particularly by captain Dan Lyle and 
center Juan Grobler, was being squandered through poor discipline 
and ball control. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans had an improved effort following a 106-8 loss to  
England in a tuneup game.

<HEADLINE> Revolution 2, MetroStars 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- The New England Revolution kept their  
flickering playoff hopes alive Saturday night with a 2-1 victory 
over the New York/New Jersey MetroStars. 
</P>
<P>
	A first-half goal by Joe-Max Moore and a second-half goal by  
Jeff Daicher gave New England only its second victory in regulation 
in the past 14 matches. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was the Revolution's first since goalie-coach Walter  
Zenga was fired on Thursday. Steve Nicol -- a former star on the 
Scottish national team -- replaced Zenga as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	New England (11-20) moved into fourth place in the Eastern  
Conference, two points ahead of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	New England has one match remaining, while Miami has two, in the  
bid for the fourth and final playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore scored his 14th goal, a career-high, at 23:46 of the first  
half. Daicher scored the game-winner on a 27-yard drive at 52:48, 
his first goal in nine matches since being traded to New England 
from San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Lozzeno scored for the MetroStars (7-25) off a corner  
kick by Mark Chung at 69:21. It was the eighth straight 2-1 game 
that the MetroStars have played, winning just two. 
</P>
<P>
	New England, 6-10 at home, snapped a three-game losing streak  
and beat the MetroStars for the fourth time this season.

<HEADLINE> McHale, Thompson Head to Hoops Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- As part of a frontcourt that included  
Larry Bird and Robert Parish, Kevin McHale helped shape the 1980s 
as an era of greatness for the Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	They played with size, smarts and championship intensity,  
winning titles in 1981, 1984 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	At his induction Friday night into the Basketball Hall of Fame,  
McHale tipped his hat to his teammates on those championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so effortless when you play the game and you play the  
game properly,'' McHale said. ``Playing with those guys was never 
an effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McHale, who as a player drove himself to edge, shared honors  
with John Thompson, a coach who pushed others to the limit, and 
sometimes beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always thinks about what he says,'' Hall of Fame coach  
Clarence Gaines said of Thompson, the Georgetown coach. ``Then he 
goes ahead and says it anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's other inductees were former NBA star Wayne Embry,  
women's college coach Billie Moore and the late NBA pioneer and 
owner Fred Zollner. 
</P>
<P>
	McHale arrived in 1980 from Minnesota as a gangly, 6-foot-10  
sixth man. He transformed himself into one of the most feared 
attackers in the game with his jump hook, fadeaway jumper and agile 
moves. He shot 55 percent from the field in 13 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of the best low-post scorers in the NBA I've ever  
seen. There were times he was unstoppable,'' Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always a lot more concerned with how good I could be,''  
said McHale, who used to spend 10-15 minutes after each game going 
over his performance. ``I was always self-analyzing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McHale also borrowed inspiration and ideas from Bird and others  
on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Larry helped everyone improve their games,'' McHale said. ``As  
you saw him do things, you thought, maybe I'm going to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Bird, McHale was ready to play despite pain. In the 1987  
playoffs against the Los Angeles Lakers, McHale played despite a 
foot so badly battered he sometimes needed to lean on furniture to 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Another habitue of postseason play, Thompson was the backup  
center for Bill Russell on the Celtics championship teams of 1965 
and 1966. Later, with the hulking Thompson draping a towel over his 
shoulder, his 27 Georgetown teams made 24 postseason appearances. 
They went to three NCAA tournament Final Fours and captured the 
national championship in 1984, the first time a black coach won the 
national basketball title. 
</P>
<P>
	During his induction, Thompson again had a towel draped over his  
shoulder. As he got up on stage, he wept and waved his fist. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not my image,'' he said. ``But who the hell cares  
about image today?'' He wiped the tears away from his eyes with the 
towel. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson's unyielding standards for basketball and academics  
challenged and sometimes frustrated his players. His demands for 
greater minority access in sports gave him more than a few 
detractors. 
</P>
<P>
	He endured racial taunts when he first fielded a predominantly  
black team at Georgetown. He later boycotted two games in 1989 to 
protest NCAA Proposition 42, saying its financial limits hurt 
minority athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	He thinks such views hurt his two earlier nominations to the  
Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody asked me what I think I'll be remembered most for,''  
he said Friday before the induction ceremony. ``I said, `The things 
that kept me out of the Hall of Fame.'''

<HEADLINE> Rabbit Discovery Spurs Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Dr. Judah Folkman remembers well the moment the  
idea that became his life work first dawned on him. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 1961. Folkman was a physician draftee at the Navy  
hospital in Bethesda, Md. His duties included experiments on 
rabbits and mice. 
</P>
<P>
	Thyroid glands were kept alive outside the rabbits' bodies. One  
day, Folkman and his lab mate wondered: Would tissue grow in them? 
So they tried a small experiment, implanting bits of cancer into 
the glands. It turned out the cancers would grow, but not very 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``They never got beyond the size of a pinhead,'' Folkman  
recalls. ``They all stopped at the same size. We thought they had 
died. But when we moved them back to a mouse, they grew huge and 
killed the mouse. It was one of those 'aha!' moments you don't 
forget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now the question was why. His colleague noticed that the mouse  
tumor was full of blood vessels. But there were none in the tiny 
cancerous growth in the thyroid. The thyroid tissue was just not 
healthy enough to respond to the cancer's call for new blood 
vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we did not know that,'' he says. ``For the first time, we  
were looking at tumor growth that was halted, and the only thing we 
could see was no blood vessels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Folkman put this exploration aside to do his residency training.  
Then, in the mid-1960s, he began working on a paper 
</P>
<P>
	to lay out his theory about the importance of new blood vessels  
to cancer. After several rejections, it was published in the New 
England Journal of Medicine in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time, nobody believe that, that I knew of,'' he says.  
Folkman went to work trying to prove this at Harvard-affiliated 
Children's Hospital in Boston, where he was a surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
	The big breakthrough came in 1983, when his team discovered  
basic fibroblastic growth factor, the first natural substance shown 
to trigger blood vessel growth. ``After that, I would say that 
overnight, my critics were converted to competitors,'' Folkman 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other teams began researching the basic machinery of  
blood vessel growth. However, the field became especially crowded 
about five years ago, when drug companies started to research 
chemicals that might stop the process as possible cancer 
treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	In the mid-1980s, about 40 or 50 scientific papers on the  
subject were published annually. During the past 12 months, Folkman 
counted almost 900. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he is credited with founding and nurturing the field  
of angiogenesis research, Folkman is meticulous about crediting 
others outside his lab who have made key discoveries. Among 
colleagues, Folkman often seems to be mentioned as much for his 
approachable, down-to-earth manner as he is for his science. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a wonderful man, and there are very few people I can say  
that about,'' says Dr. Dennis Lund, chief of pediatric surgery at 
the University of Wisconsin, who worked in Folkman's lab for two 
years. ``He is exactly what he appears to be -- very 
straightforward, very honest, very low-key and very willing to give 
credit where credit is due, which is a rare thing among 
scientists.''

<HEADLINE> Teachers Back to School After Floyd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINETOPS, N.C. (AP) -- Like thousands of others, fourth-grade  
teacher Delores Porter lost everything but the clothes on her back 
in the catastrophic flooding caused by Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Her two sisters and a brother also lost their homes to the  
floods. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, when Carver Elementary School Principal Rubin Thompson IV  
called her last week to see if she was ready to return to work, she 
didn't hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him I'll be there,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite her personal tragedy, Porter was back at work Friday  
with the rest of her colleagues, cleaning up from storm damage in 
preparation of the 650 youngsters who will return to school Monday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Her eyes became moist when she thought about what she planned to  
say to her 25 students on Monday, several who also were forced out 
of their homes by the catastrophic flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be emotional,'' she said, dressed in borrowed  
jeans and a blue shirt. ``This is not one of those times when you 
tell someone, 'I know how you feel,' but you really don't. I'm 
experiencing it. I know how it feels to leave your home in the 
middle of the night with only the clothes on your back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the flooding may not be over yet.  
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina's coastal plain braced for more high water this  
weekend from 8 inches of rain that followed the disastrous deluge 
from Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd dumped 20 inches on eastern North Carolina Sept. 16.  
Another 8 inches fell on the same region this week, delaying 
recovery efforts and keeping the Neuse and Tar rivers above flood 
stage. Both are expected to crest this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's rough,'' said Kinston resident Thomas Ingram, standing in  
his only recently dry driveway. ``There's nothing you can do about 
it. You've just got to accept it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flooding already has caused students over many parts of  
eastern North Carolina to miss nearly three weeks of school. 
Canceled classes could shorten holiday vacations and extend the 
school year to make sure children get the 180 days and the 1,000 
hours of instruction required by law. 
</P>
<P>
	In Edgecombe County, some 8,000 students were affected. Schools  
in Lenoir, Jones and Pitt counties also were hit hard by the 
floods. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage estimates were not available for the schools, but repairs  
were expected to reach into the millions of dollars. Much of that 
money will come from federal disaster aid, and some will come from 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Classes will resume in 12 of 14 schools on Monday in Edgecombe  
County. Two schools, including one in Princeville, were completely 
destroyed by the floods. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials are moving temporary trailers near two other schools  
to take in the 300 students from Princeville Montessori and another 
250 from Pattillo Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
	But it will be at least a week before they are ready.  
</P>
<P>
	For now, students whose families were forced to relocate will  
have to find new bus stops or perhaps even change schools 
temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile Friday, state agencies were ordered to reduce their  
spending by 1 percent and freeze most money earmarked for 
construction and equipment in an effort to raise about $200 million 
in matching money for hurricane recovery efforts.

<HEADLINE> Journeyman Beats Julio Cesar Chavez </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- If Julio Cesar Chavez needed any further reason  
to retire, Willy Wise gave it to him Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The journeyman boxer made Chavez look like the aging fighter he  
is, battering him for 10 rounds to win a lopsided decision and 
putting plans by Chavez to fight for a title again in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, fighting for the 108th time as a pro, was slow and  
couldn't counter the faster Wise, who boxed him at will from all 
angles to score an upset decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very surprised at how poorly I performed,'' Chavez said.  
</P>
<P>
	Chavez went into the fight on the comeback trail, planning to  
use Wise as a tuneup to get a title fight against WBC super 
lightweight champion Kostya Tszyu. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 37-year-old, former three-time champion may have lost  
his chance at another title fight with a performance that put a 
spotlight on his failing reflexes inside the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no excuses. He beat me really good,'' Chavez said.  
``Willy Wise was a great fighter tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, though, did offer an excuse. He said he trained poorly  
for the fight and planned to keep fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I prepared for a very easy fight, but in the ring it wasn't  
easy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wise (24-6-4) had only seven knockouts as a pro, but it was Wise  
who was banging shots to the head of Chavez late in the eighth 
round before the former champion wobbled back to his corner on 
shaky legs. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez was cut on the nose in the fifth round, and after each of  
the late rounds sat on his stool until the bell rang, with his 
mouthpiece hanging out. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez won only one round on one scorecard, two on a second and  
three on a third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I had him every round,'' Wise said.  
</P>
<P>
	It was only the second fight for Chavez since he was beaten in  
September 1998 for a second time by Oscar De La Hoya. He fell to 
102-4-2 in a pro career that began in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1994, though, Chavez' record is 12-4-1.  
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, 146 1/2 pounds, received $400,000 for the bout, while Wise,  
146, of Westbury, N.Y., got $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In a woman's bout, Christy Martin earned $100,000 by stopping  
Daniella Somers in the fifth round of their scheduled 10-round 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin (38-2-2) dominated from the opening bell, controlling the  
fight with big right hands. Referee Kenny Bayles finally stopped 
the fight after one of those big right hands turned Somers around 
and left her hanging on the ropes at 1:37 of the fifth round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe it was this easy,'' Martin said. ``I knew I  
had her from the very first punch I threw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, of Orlando, Fla., weighed 140 to 138 1/2 for Somers, of  
Belgium. Somers fell to 9-3.

<HEADLINE> General Assembly Closes Debates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Two weeks of debate at the U.N. General  
Assembly ended Saturday with one question emerging as the most 
contentious: Which is more important, human rights or sovereignty? 
</P>
<P>
	More specifically, leaders from all over the world discussed  
whether regional or international organizations like the U.N. 
should have the right to send troops or unleash bombs against a 
country to end genocide, ethnic cleansing and other ills -- or is 
such intervention an unacceptable violation of sovereignty? 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the General Assembly debate ended Saturday  
afternoon, many of the 144 speakers -- including 36 heads of state 
and 19 prime ministers -- had weighed in, and deep dividing lines 
had been drawn. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate continued during the entire opening talkfest, with  
Secretary-General Kofi Annan raising the issue of ``humanitarian 
intervention'' in his opening speech to the annual General Assembly 
talkfest on Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Against a backdrop of NATO airstrikes to halt violence against  
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and the deployment of a multinational 
peacekeeping force in East Timor, two schools of thought emerged. 
</P>
<P>
	While the United States, its European allies and the  
secretary-general argued that human rights should take precedence 
over sovereignty, a host of countries including China, India, 
Malaysia, Iraq, North Korea and Libya insisted that sovereignty 
remains paramount and that human rights are an internal affair. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end, most delegates agreed the issue needs further  
in-depth discussion, said Namibia's Foreign Minister Theo-Ben 
Gurirab, the General Assembly president. U.N. spokesman Fred 
Eckhard said the secretary-general felt the debate was ``healthy 
and good'' and was ``pleasantly surprised at the amount of 
reaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With ethnic minorities and innocent civilians increasingly the  
targets of warring parties, Annan said the United Nations, and the 
Security Council in particular, must be willing to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	The Netherlands' Foreign Minister Jozias Van Aartsen noted that  
since the United Nations was created in 1945, respect for human 
rights has become ``more and more mandatory and respect for 
sovereignty less and less stringent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But large Asian countries like India and China with domestic  
insurgencies fear any legitimization of international interference. 
And smaller countries worry that military intervention on 
humanitarian grounds could threaten the survival of their 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh said sovereignty needs to  
be strengthened, ``not weakened.'' And China's Foreign Minister 
Tang Jiaxuan insisted human rights were ``an internal affair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi and Libyan officials dismissed humanitarian-based  
intervention as a new form of colonialism. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is, in fact, the most untenable pretext because those who  
perpetrate it, would not, if they truly cared for humanity, produce 
and stockpile all kinds of mass destruction weapons or commit 
aggression against others,'' said Libya's U.N. Ambassador Abuzed 
Omar Dorda.

<HEADLINE> Lott Brings Bacon Home to Miss. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an era of military cutbacks, Trent Lott's  
Mississippi is on a roll. A storm-chasing Reserve squadron in 
Biloxi is getting 10 new C130-J aircraft. A $1.5 billion ship that 
would be built in Pascagoula is cruising through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force and Navy say they will not need these projects for  
years. But Lott, the Senate majority leader, wanted them now. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican is a driving force behind Mississippi's military  
success. He has used his powerful office to persuade the Pentagon 
to change priorities, even butting heads with fellow Republicans to 
boost his state's defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
	His announcement of new projects for Mississippi in 2000 is so  
big he separates them by regions of the state. Among them: new 
destroyers, ship berthing facilities, classrooms, barracks, flight 
simulators, hangars, computer software, crash seats and a 
tank-firing range. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott has no qualms about steering every military dollar he can  
to Mississippi. It is the 31st most populous state but ranked 15th 
in per capita defense spending last year, said the National 
Priorities Project, a nonprofit research group. 
</P>
<P>
	With Lott's help, the state expects to get about $8 billion in  
the fiscal 2000 defense appropriations bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a fierce competitor,'' said former Rep. Bob Livingston,  
R-La. Livingston sided with Lott on most issues, but he recalled a 
tough battle with Lott in 1997 over whose shipyard would get the 
contract to build an amphibious ship. 
</P>
<P>
	``All's fair in love and war,'' Livingston said, ``and in that  
instance it was war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott spokesman John Czwartacki said the majority leader is ``a  
very proud senator from the state of Mississippi, a state that has 
certain economic disadvantages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Lott fights for his state to build the best, 21st  
century equipment for the armed forces,'' Czwartacki said. ``He 
doesn't make apologies for his advocacy on behalf of his own 
state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott was angered when the shipyard where his father once worked  
as a pipefitter, Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, lost a 
contract to build an assault ship to a partnership between the 
Avondale, La., shipyard and the Bath Iron Works in Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	To compensate, Lott tried to take other vital business away from  
the Maine shipyard. Stunning the state's two Republican senators, 
Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, Lott proposed backing out of a 
deal he had brokered for the Maine and Mississippi shipyards to 
each build six new destroyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott demanded the Ingalls shipyard get to build seven or eight  
of the 12 destroyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Snowe and Collins protested. The dispute was settled when  
Defense Secretary William Cohen, a former senator from Maine, 
agreed to support construction of up to two additional destroyers, 
to be built at Ingalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Snowe and Collins will not discuss the incident. But another  
member of the Maine delegation, Democratic Rep. Tom Allen, said 
Lott was unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed overreaching to me, and after 2 1/2 years it still  
does,'' Allen said. ``We ought to be arguing from the evidence and 
not making the case based on raw political power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's influence placed the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron  
in Biloxi -- the ``hurricane hunters'' who fly through storms -- 
immediately in line for the new C-130Js. Without the insistence of 
Lott and other lawmakers, the plane, partially built in 
Mississippi, would not roll off the assembly line at all this year. 
The Air Force does not want the aircraft for regular units until 
2006. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Gen. Arthur J. Lichte, director of global reach programs  
for the Air Force, said the service was not ready to retire older 
C-130s because they still have a useful life and ``we try to live 
within our budgets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Czwartacki said the majority leader ``believes the unit is so  
critical and flies extremely dangerous missions, it should have the 
safest, newest, front-line planes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott also persuaded Senate defense appropriators to add $500  
million for the LHD-8 mini aircraft carrier for Marines. The Navy 
did not want funding to start building the $1.5 billion ship, to be 
constructed in Pascagoula, until fiscal 2005. Congressional 
officials expect the money to be approved. 
</P>
<P>
	When House appropriators asked the Navy -- which had not sought  
any money -- how much it could use toward advance work on the ship, 
the Navy returned an estimate of $295 million. 
</P>
<P>
	T. Eric Womble, Lott's senior military aide, sent the service a  
handwritten note that $295 million was the ``wrong answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have worked too hard to give up on the $500 M now,'' he  
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Czwartacki said Lott would save taxpayers between $700 million  
and $1 billion by allowing Ingalls Shipbuilding, now a division of 
Litton Industries, to retain workers and contractors now 
constructing the carrier in Pascagoula. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott has fought off cutbacks, and then helped add money, to  
speed up the Pentagon's Space-Based Laser project, the last vestige 
of President Reagan's ``Star Wars'' missile defense system. Lott 
touted the mothballed Mississippi Army Ammunition Plant complex to 
become its headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force planned for a low-level test in 2012, about six  
years too slow for Lott and others. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority leader also promoted the former ammunition complex  
as the site for a regional Navy Human Resources Service Center to 
serve seven states. When Mississippi was chosen in 1997, Republican 
Rep. Joe Scarborough of Florida -- whose district lost the project -- 
contended the Navy ``ignored the criteria they set forth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Czwartacki produced a Navy report that rated Mississippi as the  
best site for the center.

<HEADLINE> Khumba Mela Wins at Belmont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Khumba Mela, an Irish-bred, turned what had been  
a closely contested race into a rout with a strong stretch run 
Saturday to win the $112,900, Grade III Noble Damsel Handicap at 
Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner reached the wire five lengths ahead of Uanme who was  
a neck ahead of Cyrillic in the field of eight fillies and mares 3 
years old and up. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Jose Santos and carrying 118 pounds, Khumba Mela  
covered one mile in 1:34:2 on a firm turf course and earned $67,740 
for Haras du Mezeray. It was the second win in five starts this 
year for the 4-year-old filly by Hero's Honor. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also the second lifetime graded stakes win for Khumba  
Mela who took Chantilly's Grade III Prix Chloe on July 17, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Khumba Mela returned $5.60, $3.20 and $2.50 as the second choice  
in the betting. Uanme paid $11 and $5.40, while Cyrillic was $3.40 
to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Chasin' Wimmin came from off the pace to provide an upset in the  
co-featured $57,600 Ashley T. Cole Handicap for 3-year-olds. The 
4-year-old gelding by Belong to Me carried 113 pounds and Jean-Luc 
Samyn over one mile in 1:34:4 on the turf. Pebo's Guy was runner-up 
in the 11-horse field, another three-quarters of a length before 
Currency Arbitrage. 
</P>
<P>
	Chasin' Wimmin returned $58 and earned $34,560 for Seymour Cohn  
with his first win in four starts this year.

<HEADLINE> IOC Suspends Afghan Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- The IOC on Saturday suspended  
Afghanistan's Olympic Committee on grounds that it can no longer 
function under the Taliban regime in Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
	Francois Carrard, director general of the International Olympic  
Committee, said another organization with headquarters in Kabul, 
under Taliban rule, claims it is recognized as a national Olympic 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The old committee, ``does not control the sport anymore,''  
Carrard said. ``It's practically disbanded. Its president is in 
exile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban-run committee does not meet IOC requirements for  
recognition, he said. Among other things, the committee bans women 
from competing in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard said the suspension did not mean the IOC had withdrawn  
its recognition of Afghanistan. He said the IOC would try to find a 
formula to help any Afghan athletes compete in next year's Sydney 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban, or the students of Islam, are Sunni Muslims and  
mostly Pashtuns -- Afghanistan's majority ethnic group. They rule 90 
percent of the country, including Kabul, and are battling the 
opposition alliance in a bid to capture the remaining parts of 
Afghanistan. The Taliban took over Kabul in September 1996.

<HEADLINE> Letters Show Gore's Vietnam Dilemma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A series of letters written 33 years ago by a  
teen-age Al Gore reveals the inner conflict he felt over whether to 
serve in Vietnam amid a near-consensus on his Harvard University 
campus that the war was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout much of the vice president's political life, he has  
been dogged by criticisms that he entered the Army to help his 
anti-war father's failing bid for re-election to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	But the writings offer a look at the decision-making process of  
a young man agonizing over a conflict between a gut feeling that 
the war was wrong and a sense that commitment to the war effort 
might be the right thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore offered the letters, written in 1966 to future wife Mary  
Elizabeth ``Tipper'' Aitcheson, for review by historian Douglas 
Brinkley of the Eisenhower Center for American Studies at the 
University of New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Brinkley has written an article on the letters, being published  
next week in Talk magazine, and The Boston Globe reported the story 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brinkley did not return a message left Saturday at his  
Mississippi home. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the letters Saturday, Gore spokesman Chris Lehane  
said: ``They're accurate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letters track Gore's thoughts as he moved from an outspoken  
war critic to a military enlistee. He also spoke of the ``courage 
and rashness'' of fellow Harvard freshman Denmark Groover III from 
Macon, Ga., who left school to join the military despite almost 
universal opposition to the war from Harvard's student body. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure he didn't do the right thing,'' Gore wrote. ``I  
admire him a great deal; I admire his courage and rashness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old Gore assailed the ``intellectual smugness'' on  
the Harvard campus and said he would be prepared to enlist at the 
end of the school year if he could be convinced that the war was 
righteous. 
</P>
<P>
	One letter said Gore's Harvard colleagues ``seemed so smug and  
confident'' in belittling Groover's ``faith and sacrifice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It made me furious,'' he wrote.  
</P>
<P>
	Gore wrote he was stymied in determining his fate because of his  
fundamental belief the war was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's hard is to reconcile my understanding and admiration of  
Denmark with my belief about the war. It's wrong, we're wrong. A 
lot of people won't admit it and never will, but we're wrong,'' 
Gore wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also had conflicts within his family about the war.  
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Sr. was so outspoken against  
America's role in Vietnam that his opponent, Bill Brock, dubbed him 
``the third senator from Massachusetts.'' The other two were 
liberals Edward Kennedy and Edward Brooke. 
</P>
<P>
	In the article, Gore told Brinkley his mother, Pauline, urged  
him not to let his father's flagging campaign influence his 
decision to enlist. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-war position of the elder Gore was anathema to many  
Southerners who supported the U.S. intervention in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	After three terms in the Senate, he was defeated in 1970 shortly  
before Gore left to serve in Vietnam. Gore spent five months in the 
war zone, working as a journalist for military newsletters.

<HEADLINE> Probe Checks Mental Hospital Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- No one knows how many patients have died at  
mental health facilities after being restrained or put into 
seclusion because most centers are not required to report such 
deaths, congressional investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, said  
in a report released Friday it determined that at least 24 people 
died and 1,000 were injured or abused in 1998, but the actual 
numbers probably are much higher. Only 15 states have reporting 
systems, it said, and most facilities are not required to report. 
</P>
<P>
	``While restraint and seclusion use can injure patients and  
staff, the full extent of that risk is not known because reporting 
is so fragmentary,'' the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers in the House and the Senate, following Hartford  
Courant investigative articles in Connecticut, have introduced 
bills that would require better reporting, better training of 
mental health care workers and a doctor's authorization before a 
patient is restrained. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate will hold hearings on the issue before Congress  
adjourns for the year, said Sen. William Roth, the Delaware 
Republican who chairs the Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have to tell you that hospitals should be places of  
safety and healing,'' Roth said. The GAO report and the newspaper 
articles suggest an urgent need to ``rededicate ourselves to 
continued improvement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mental health experts generally agree that a patient must be  
restrained or put into seclusion on an emergency basis when he is a 
danger to himself or to others, the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Far less agreement exists about the use of restraint and  
seclusion in any other situation,'' such as punishment or staff 
convenience, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The random use of restraints cited by the GAO suggests bad  
luck, more than medical science, determines which patients end up 
restrained, secluded or even dead,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, 
D-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO said 240,000 people require either inpatient treatment  
in mental hospitals or residential treatment in centers or group 
homes each year. About 120,000 people with mental retardation lived 
in intermediate care facilities and 240,000 others lived in smaller 
residential settings in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	No federal regulations governed the use of restraint and  
seclusion in those facilities until July 1999, when the Health Care 
Financing Administration put new restrictions on hospitals that 
received federal Medicare money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although this is a positive step, people in residential  
treatment centers and group homes participating in the Medicaid 
Home and Community-Based Waiver program have limited federal 
protection,'' the GAO report said. ``While some states have 
regulations in place governing the use of restraint and seclusion, 
often these regulations do not apply to privately operated 
facilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about protecting our loved ones from deadly  
restraint,'' said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. ``They should not fear 
for their lives -- and their families should not fear for their 
lives -- when they check into a hospital.''

<HEADLINE> Mormon Head Opposes Gay Marriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Gay marriage is morally wrong and Mormons  
should feel compelled to oppose it, church President Gordon B. 
Hinckley told the faith Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some portray legalization of so-called same-sex marriage as a  
civil right,'' Hinckley said at the faith's 169th Annual General 
Conference. ``This issue has nothing to do with civil rights. For 
men to marry men, or women to marry women, is a moral wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley said the church's support of California's Knight  
Initiative, which would only allow marriages between men and women, 
is an attempt to safeguard God-sanctioned marriage -- and the moral 
fiber of society -- from forces trying to undermine it. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before Hinckley addressed the subject, local gay-rights  
groups announced plans to protest outside Temple Square during the 
second day of the conference Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of  
Latter-day Saints sent a letter to branches in California asking 
them to urge their 740,000 members ``to do all you can by donating 
your means and time to assure a successful vote'' on the March 2000 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The church conducted similar efforts in Alaska and Hawaii last  
year, and members raised $1.1 million for the successful campaigns 
to block same-sex marriages in those states. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley made it clear to the conference's priesthood session  
Saturday night that the money going to California has come from 
individual members; gay-rights groups have threatened to fight the 
faith's tax-exempt status if church institutions or foundations get 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Hinckley celebrated the growth of the  
church, announcing that it will nearly double its number of temples 
by the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ground will be broken in Nauvoo later this month, Hinckley said,  
and seven other temples will be dedicated before the end of the 
year, bringing the total to 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Temples, where marriages and other ordinances considered sacred  
to Mormons are performed by worthy members, are different from the 
12,000 chapels used for weekly worship. As many as 42 more could be 
complete by 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Hinckley's guidance, the church has also constructed a new  
21,000-seat assembly hall in downtown Salt Lake City, which leaders 
decided Friday will be named the Conference Center. It is set to 
open by April to host the next conference, which has been held in 
the smaller Tabernacle for more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all of the church's growth involves new edifices,  
Hinckley said. It has also expanded its genealogical work, much of 
it via computer. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the church opened its new genealogical Web site, which  
was so inundated, IBM had to shut it down for six hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's interesting to think we've all reduced ourselves to  
dot-coms,'' the 89-year-old church president joked in the afternoon 
session.

<HEADLINE> Health Care Union Endorses Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An edgier, more combative Al Gore -- who cast  
Democratic rival Bill Bradley as disloyal to the party -- won 
endorsement Saturday from an important health care workers' union. 
</P>
<P>
	``I respect Bill Bradley. I'm not downgrading him. But I've been  
fighting for working families for almost a quarter-century now as a 
public servant,'' the vice president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently referring to Bradley's retirement from the Senate in  
1996, and his brief talks around that time with independents 
pushing to build a third party, Gore continued: 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been tempted to leave the Democratic Party. I've  
never been tempted to turn my back on the Democratic party. I've 
never been tempted to run as an Independent and divide the 
progressive coalition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In turn, Bradley had argued to union members they should endorse  
him because Gore cannot win without the independent and Republican 
support that Bradley appears to enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The objective of nominating somebody is to win in the fall,''  
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	AFL-CIO officials were watching the straw vote of Local 250 of  
the Service Employees International Union, the nation's 
second-largest health workers union with 46,000 members in Northern 
California, for signs of Gore's strength going into next week's 
crucial AFL-CIO convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Gore was the clear winner, taking 55 percent to Bradley's  
38 percent of the vote by some 500 elected leaders in Local 250, 
union president Sal Rosselli credited Bradley with surprising 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was closer than I imagined. Here in California, our members  
don't know Bill Bradley,'' Rosselli said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Bradley, the former senator from New Jersey, and Gore made  
presentations to the group on Friday. Bradley's was pre-recorded 
while he was in California on Thursday. Gore spoke via satellite 
link. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their positions were comparable,'' Rosselli said. ``I would  
guess that Gore got the majority simply because he's the vice 
president and he's better well-known.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Rosselli said, Gore's ``live interaction'' was perhaps  
more exciting than Bradley's taped presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to the Bradley campaign's stealthy buildup of credibility  
among union leaders and in broader public opinion, the vice 
president, once considered a shoo-in for the Democratic 
presidential nomination, has been stymied in his bid for an early 
nod from the labor federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Gore turned his campaign inside out, declared himself  
the underdog and promised to aggressively beat back Bradley's 
insurgency. 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks to Local 250, Gore enunciated points against  
Bradley's record that, previously, his aides would only quietly 
identify for reporters ``on background,'' including Bradley's vote 
for President Reagan's 1981 budget cuts to Medicaid, welfare, food 
stamps and school lunches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stood up to the Reagan budget cuts in 1981 you know they  
hurt working families quite a bit, they hurt health care workers 
quite a bit -- I stood up to them,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, a former New York Knick and nine-year shop steward for  
the NBA players' association, won huge favor by proposing that 
employers who illegally fire workers for organizing unions be 
forced to pay triple back-pay plus punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore promised that, as president, he would guarantee to veto any  
``anti-union or anti-worker'' legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by a union member why she should pick him over Gore,  
Bradley cited their different histories and approaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a life before I got into politics,'' Bradley said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've gone to work many years in my life and never thought of  
the federal government and I think the vice president has a life 
that's been primarily based in Washington and I think that gives us 
a different idea of who the American people are and what we can 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Using their rival health reform plans as an example, Bradley  
said his aims to cover 95 percent of the nation's uninsured while 
Gore's mostly covers just children. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's incremental around the edges, helping here and there,''  
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore countered that his own approach ``is realistic and  
achievable and can be passed into law.''

<HEADLINE> Skipping Around Wins Pa. Cotillion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENSALEM, Pa. (AP) -- Long shot Skipping Around came out a pack  
and took the lead going around the far turn, then dug in with a 
determined effort to win the $200,000 Cotillion Handicap at 
Philadelphia Park on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Michael McCarthy and carrying 114 pounds, Skipping  
Around took a short lead during the 3-year-olds' first pass in 
front of the stands. Favorite Strolling Belle dueled with Awful 
Smart for much of the 1 1-16 miles before Skipping Around pulled 
around the outside of the leaders to win by a half-length. 
</P>
<P>
	Skipping Around, who won the Silver Spoon Stakes at Delaware  
Park in her last outing, was timed in 1:43.4 and paid $33.80, 
$11.40 and $7.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Strolling Belle paid $3.60 and $3, while 40-1 shot Waltz was  
third and paid $13.80 to show.

<HEADLINE> Daughter Convicted in Father's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIMA, Ohio (AP) -- A woman who claimed she shot her father in the  
back after years of abuse was convicted of aggravated murder after 
a third trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Mindy Berenyi, 20, was convicted Friday and sentenced to life in  
prison in Allen County Common Pleas Court. She will be eligible for 
parole in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Berenyi had admitted that she used a 12-gauge shotgun to kill  
her father four years ago, but said the killing was prompted by 
years of being abused as a child. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Joseph Burkard said there was no evidence of abuse  
and Berenyi never told friends or family she had been abused until 
after the shooting. Her two brothers also testified that their 
father never was abusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Burkard said she killed him because she did not want to live by  
his rules and wanted to move in with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Berenyi appeared stunned as the verdict was read.  
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Larry DiLabbio, fell back into his chair and onto  
the floor, then had to be helped to his feet. He said he was 
``devastated'' and planned to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	DiLabbio had described William Berenyi as a ``classic batterer''  
with a temper and a jealous streak that came out when his daughter 
spent time with friends. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury deliberated for 12 hours over two days before reaching  
its verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Berenyi was convicted in 1996 of murder and was sent to prison,  
but the conviction was overturned because she didn't receive a 
physical examination after her arrest, as required by law for a 
juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
	A mistrial was declared because of alleged jury tampering at a  
second trial in June.

<HEADLINE>  Rockets Trade Pippen to Portland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Trail Blazers were thrilled to get  
him, the Rockets were equally glad to get rid of him. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Scottie Pippen himself, others were left to do the  
talking. 
</P>
<P>
	In a deal that had been rumored for days, the six-time NBA  
champion and seven-time All-Star was traded to Portland on Saturday 
for Kelvin Cato, Stacey Augmon, Walt Williams, Ed Gray, Brian Shaw 
and Carlos Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	Blazers president and general manager Bob Whitsitt said Pippen  
was ``extremely excited'' about the deal, and Pippen's agent, Jimmy 
Sexton, concurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, however, said nothing publicly from his home in  
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't read anything into that,'' Sexton said of Pippen's  
silence. ``After Scottie evaluated the situation in Portland, 
looked at their roster, what they did last year and the pieces 
they've added, he was excited. They'll have a legitimate chance to 
win the NBA championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen's first choice for a new team was the Los Angeles Lakers,  
where he would have rejoined former Bulls coach Phil Jackson. There 
was speculation that Portland might turn around and trade Pippen to 
the Lakers for Glen Rice and other players -- speculation that 
figures to continue through the season -- but on Saturday the 
Blazers were talking about Pippen being a part of their drive for a 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked with Scottie on the phone, and he said, 'That L.A.  
stuff was blown out of proportion. I love Portland and I like 
what's going on,' '' Whitsitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, finalized Saturday morning during a conference call  
with the Rockets and the NBA, was hastened when Pippen lambasted 
Barkley in an ESPN interview aired Wednesday. Pippen called his 
teammate ``fat'' and ``selfish,'' and said he wanted out of Houston 
because Barkley didn't have enough desire to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Other teams, including the Milwaukee Bucks and New Jersey Nets,  
made late offers that were rejected. The Lakers considered offering 
Rice, Robert Horry and Travis Knight, but ultimately declined. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're moving forward,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.  
``I think we've taken a negative situation and tried to turn it 
into a positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, 34, signed a five-year, $67 million contract with the  
Rockets before the lockout-shorted 1999 season began. But he never 
fit into Houston's low-post oriented offense, and competed with 
stars Hakeem Olajuwon and Barkley for looks at the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you play that style of basketball (with the Bulls), I  
understood it would take some time to adjust,'' Tomjanovich said at 
a news conference in Houston. The coach said he talked with Pippen 
on the phone and told him he was sorry it didn't work out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very professional. We wished each other luck,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen is due to make $14.8 million this season, which nearly  
equals the combined salaries of the six players Portland traded. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season Pippen averaged 14.5 points, his lowest output since  
1988-89, his second season with the Bulls and two years before the 
Bulls won the first of their six titles. He also shot a career-low 
43 percent, but averaged 6.5 rebounds and 5.9 assists and made the 
NBA's All-Defensive first team for the eighth straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers, already loaded with talented players like Brian  
Grant, Rasheed Wallace, Damon Stoudamire and new acquisitions 
Detlef Schrempf and Steve Smith, don't care if he ever returns to 
the scoring level that made him a selection on the NBA's 50 
all-time greatest players. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Scottie averages 14, seven rebounds, seven assists and two  
steals ever year for the next four years, perfect,'' Whitsitt said. 
``We'll take that in a heartbeat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen has been one of the NBA's most dominant forwards the last  
decade, but he has not proved he can effectively lead a team 
without Michael Jordan around. In the 1994 playoffs, with Jordan 
off playing minor-league baseball, Pippen refused to enter a game 
in the final seconds against the Knicks when Jackson had drawn up 
the final shot for Toni Kukoc instead of him. 
</P>
<P>
	In Houston, it was clear from Wednesday's interview, Pippen did  
not get along with Barkley, his teammate on the Dream Team that won 
the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. Pippen complained that he was not 
getting the ball enough, and Barkley complained that he had given 
up part of his salary so the Rockets could afford Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
	The falling out between the two intensified over the summer when  
they traveled together on a tour for Nike, the athletic footwear 
maker. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no telling how Pippen will fit in with the Blazers, who  
are deep at every position despite unloading six players. Last 
season, Stoudamire groused about not getting enough minutes, even 
during the Blazers' four-game series loss to San Antonio in the 
Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets, meanwhile, likely will jettison at least three of  
their new players. The team had 18 players under contract without 
Pippen before the trade. Tomjanovich sounded most interested in 
Williams, a good outside shooter, and Cato, a 6-foot-11 center who 
showed promise backing up Arvydas Sabonis. 
</P>
<P>
	That means the Rockets could cut Augmon, Gray, Shaw and Rogers  
during training camp, which begins Tuesday. The Blazers might be 
interested in re-signing Augmon, a defensive specialist, to a 
contract considerably less than his $3.2 million salary.

<HEADLINE> Budget Maneuvers Reach Overtime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ronald Reagan once called it a Mickey Mouse  
system, and said his chimpanzee co-star in ``Bedtime for Bonzo'' 
made more sense than the way a divided government was setting its 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Republican Congress and the Democratic White House argue  
into overtime, as usual, on financing the government, the 
maneuvering would fit a comedy script. 
</P>
<P>
	--The idea of a 13-month year, for example, and the designation  
of so predictable an expense as the 2000 census as a $4.1 billion 
emergency to avoid counting it against spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	--The repetitive debate in which each political side accuses the  
other of doing what it denies. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Democrats' pleasure at watching the Republican majority  
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	--Or the Republican resolution the House approved declaring that  
it should not consider spending any of the Social Security surplus 
for anything else, and should keep trying to reduce the national 
debt. It did not -- could not -- bind Congress to do what the 
resolution said it should do. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans accused the Democrats of trying to raid Social  
Security funds to cover spending President Clinton wants. They 
countered, with a report from the Congressional Budget Office to 
back them, that spending the Republicans favor would cost about $18 
billion in Social Security surpluses next year. 
</P>
<P>
	White House Chief of Staff John Podesta said the whole budget  
process was headed toward chaos. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he didn't want a fight with the Republicans, but he  
does not sound conciliatory. Signing a resolution to keep the 
government from running out of money because of deadlines that 
passed Friday without appropriations to keep things going, he 
accused the Republicans of resorting to ``gimmicks and 
gamesmanship'' instead of passing a responsible budget. 
</P>
<P>
	By responsible, of course, he means one that fits his  
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	That is no more likely in this divided government than it was  
for Reagan, in 1982, when his Republican administration had to deal 
with a Democratic Congress, and he made his remarks about Mickey 
Mouse and Bonzo. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, the system looks logical and orderly. But that's on  
paper, without factoring in competing spending priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The process itself is the product of budget reform 25 years ago,  
when Congress set up a series of deadlines for action -- and almost 
immediately began missing them. It begins with a president's budget 
in the winter, a congressional budget in the spring, to be followed 
by action on the 13 appropriations bills to fill in the blanks, 
which is supposed to be done by mid-September but never is. Then, 
in time for the Oct. 1 budget new year, there is supposed to be a 
final measure covering both spending and the tax revenues to pay 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Signing the extension Congress passed to keep federal agencies  
from running out of funds until Oct. 21, Clinton said he didn't 
want to but ``it was the only way to prevent another government 
shutdown,'' a reminder of the 1995 budget mess that resulted in 
partial shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	That year, the Republicans, newly in control of Congress, let it  
happen instead of compromising to avoid Clinton vetoes, figuring he 
would get the blame. Instead, they did. 
</P>
<P>
	They want no replay, but neither do they want a budget deal like  
the one they made last year, which still rankles conservatives for 
the spending Clinton won. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has vetoed one 2000 appropriation bill, and there  
are veto threats against five more because of GOP cuts he won't 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest is against a plan by House Republican leaders to  
delay payments to about 20 million low-income working families, 
which would push $8.7 billion in spending into the next budget 
year. It wouldn't save any money, but it would make the 2000 
numbers look better. Clinton said if they do it he won't sign it. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, they'll come to terms. And the cycle will begin  
again, next time to be settled in the midst of the 2000 election 
campaign.

<HEADLINE> Ryder Loss Blamed on James  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European Ryder Cup player Jean Van de Velde has  
blamed European captain Mark James for last weekend's stunning loss 
to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of lashing out at the behavior of the American team and  
their fans, Van de Velde said it was ``morally wrong'' that three 
players were left on the sidelines by James until the singles 
competition on the final day. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't make good use of nine players and put three in the  
bin,'' Van de Velde said in Saturday's The Daily Telegraph. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I'm not the best player in the world, but I did finish  
ninth on the Ryder Cup points list, and if you qualify you should 
play,'' added Van de Velde, who blew a three-stroke lead on the 
72nd hole of this year's British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Van de Velde said James did not speak to him after the match.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would expect him to come to me in the near future and talk  
about it,'' Van de Velde said. 
</P>
<P>
	Van de Velde, who spoke openly after he lost the British Open,  
said Europe lost the Ryder Cup because its top players were 
exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has been focusing on the Americans' bad behavior,''  
he said. ``But to me the result had nothing to do with that. We 
lost because we asked too much of most of the guys and because we 
didn't put enough trust in three.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Van de Velde, Jarmo Sandelin and Andrew Coltart  
also sat out until the final day. 
</P>
<P>
	Van de Velde was beaten easily, 6 and 5, by Davis Love III in  
Sunday's singles. Sandelin and Coltart also lost their matches. 
</P>
<P>
	The Frenchman, a member of the European Tour Players' committee,  
said he would suggest that European players in future Ryder Cups 
play every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I haven't really taken part in the match. It has made  
me feel so bad.''

<HEADLINE> Mormon Temples To Double by 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Mormon church will nearly double its  
number of temples by the end of next year, church President Gordon 
B. Hinckley announced Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If present plans materialize, we will have not only the one  
hundred which we have striven for, but even more than that,'' 
Hinckley said as he opened the faith's 169th Semi-Annual General 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Just six months ago, Hinckley surprised members of The Church of  
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by announcing plans to rebuild a 
historic temple in Nauvoo, Illinois, that was destroyed after the 
Mormons moved west. 
</P>
<P>
	Ground will be broken in Nauvoo later this month, Hinckley said  
Saturday, and seven other temples will be dedicated before the end 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Temples, where marriages and other ordinances considered sacred  
to Mormons are performed by worthy members, are different from the 
12,000 chapels used for weekly worship. Eight new temples opened in 
the first nine months of this year, and by January 1 there should 
be a total of 68 operating. As many as 42 more could be complete by 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Hinckley's guidance, the church has also constructed a new  
21,000-seat assembly hall in downtown Salt Lake City, which leaders 
decided Friday will be named the Conference Center. It is set to 
open by April to host the next conference, which has been held in 
the smaller Tabernacle for more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all of the church's growth involves new edifices,  
Hinckley said. It has also expanded its genealogical work, much of 
it via computer. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the church opened its new genealogical Web site, which  
was so inundated, IBM had to shut it down for six hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's interesting to think we've all reduced ourselves to  
dot-coms,'' the 89-year-old church president joked later in the 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	While Hinckley celebrated growth, other speakers urged members  
to shore up the walls of their own families and communities, or 
strengthen the faith by drawing inactive Mormons back into the 
fold. 
</P>
<P>
	Sister Sharon G. Larsen, second counselor in the Young Women's  
General Presidency, said choosing the path ordained by the church 
is more difficult than it once was in the face of modern-day 
options. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today there are infinite telephone numbers, movies of all  
kinds and colors, E-mail at our fingertips 24 hours a day, and many 
roads that relentlessly call for our judgment,'' she said. ``Our 
environment is flooded with choices.''

<HEADLINE> Alleged Child Abductor Held in N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A man who allegedly told his wife he was taking  
their three children to an amusement park and then sent them to 
Syria was deemed a flight risk and a threat to the community by a 
judge who ordered him held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Viktor Petrov was charged Friday in a complaint under the  
International Parental Kidnapping Act of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The children, ages 11, 6 and 5, were returned from Syria late  
Tuesday after a trip that began when they were flown to Turkey on 
June 26, according to the FBI complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Family Court of Westchester County ordered Petrov jail Aug. 19  
when he refused to return the children to the United States. The 
federal charges were brought just as he was about to be released 
because the children had been returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Petya Petrov, the children's mother, came home June 26 and  
found a telephone message from her husband saying he had taken the 
children on a two-day trip to a New Jersey amusement park, 
according to the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, Petrov left a message saying he had brought the  
children to Turkey to be turned over to his parents in his native 
Syria with instructions not to allow them to talk to their mother, 
the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrov later told the mother she would never see her children  
unless she agreed to let him manage all of her income except $5 per 
day. He also insisted that she find him a job as a medical 
resident, and that she not make long distance phone calls, use the 
Internet or meet friends. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview after the return of the children, Mrs. Petrov  
described their return as ``the happiest thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jessica, 6, said she was glad to be home instead of in Syria.  
</P>
<P>
	``I like it here more than there because I have my mommy,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Davison, a lawyer for Petrov, did not return a telephone  
message for comment Friday.

<HEADLINE> Report Says Coelho Abused Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tony Coelho, Vice President Al Gore's campaign  
chairman, approved questionable contractor payments, hired his 
niece for a job and made the government liable for a $300,000 
personal loan while directing the U.S. pavilion at the 1998 world's 
fair in Portugal, State Department investigators found. 
</P>
<P>
	Their report said Coelho and his staff also misused $210,000 in  
donated airline tickets, hired two stepsons of the U.S. ambassador 
to Portugal and had the government reimburse $26,000 in 
questionable expenses to a consultant who worked in Coelho's New 
York City office. Coelho's rental of a chauffeur-driven Mercedes 
``was especially troublesome'' because the cost exceeded a $500 
ceiling while a fleet of six vans for the pavilion were underused. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general's report was released by the Center for  
Public Integrity, a nonprofit organization that tracks government 
fraud, waste and abuse and ethical conflicts involving public 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The center said Coelho's actions may have violated federal laws  
governing use of federal funds for international expositions. 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho got strong support in a statement issued by Kiki Moore,  
Gore's campaign press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony Coelho does a great job as general chair of Gore 2000,''  
the statement said. ``Day in and day out he makes a tremendous 
contribution. Under Tony's leadership, the campaign will continue 
to advance an agenda that will improve the lives of America's 
working families -- fighting to protect Social Security and preserve 
Medicare, making health care available to all of our children and 
calling for revolutionary change in our public schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Brand, Coelho's personal lawyer, said his client did not  
violate any laws in a job that did not pay him a salary. ``He 
devoted two years of his life and spent substantial amounts of his 
own money,'' Brand said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand acknowledged ``there may have been management lapses'' as  
in many government contract programs, but contended most of the 
negative conclusions were aimed at United States Information Agency 
officials rather than Coelho personally. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations surfaced at a difficult time for the Gore  
campaign. Reeling from Democratic presidential challenger Bill 
Bradley's surge in the polls and fund raising, Gore several days 
ago shook up his campaign and moved it to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho, then House Democratic whip, left Congress in 1989 amid  
questions about his personal financial dealings. A legendary 
fund-raiser, Coelho once headed his party's congressional 
money-raising operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho was appointed U.S. commissioner general for the world's  
fair in Lisbon in June 1996, with responsibility for fund raising, 
as well as the design, fabrication and operation of the U.S. 
pavilion. The expo was estimated to cost $8 million, but the figure 
jumped to $9.8 million and ``will likely cost more'' because of 
pending lawsuits, the inspector general said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law says government funds should not be spent unless  
``expressly authorized and appropriated'' for pavilions at the 
international fair. The report said no authorization was granted 
for Expo 98, ``yet U.S. government funds accounted for over 80 
percent of the total U.S. pavilion funding...'' The report 
concluded the USIA ``may have violated the spirit, if not the 
letter'' of that law. 
</P>
<P>
	That agency, the report said, turned over control of the  
operation to Coelho who, the Center for Public Integrity reported, 
lived in an $18,000-a-month luxury apartment billed to the USIA and 
used free donated airline tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general said Coelho obtained a personal loan of  
$300,000 from a Portuguese bank so a private foundation could 
construct a memorial wall in the shape of a wave. 
</P>
<P>
	The loan was listed on pavilion records as a liability and the  
foundation had not made any payments as of December 1998. The U.S. 
government could be obligated to pay for the sculpture, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Answering some of the specific questions raised in the report,  
Brand said the $300,000 loan ``was paid off with donations from 
people donating to the memorial (sculpture), including a large 
contribution from Tony himself. The government was never involved 
nor was any of its money at risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho's niece was hired by his deputy, Brand said, adding, ``I  
think USIA was aware of it and said it did not violate the nepotism 
statute.'' Hiring the ambassador's stepsons did not violate any law 
or rule, Brand said. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the Mercedes, Brand said, ``Maybe that was a  
screw-up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report and further information developed by the center said  
that Coelho and his staff: 
</P>
<P>
	--Directed the USIA to reimburse a New York contractor $26,000  
even though officials ``could not find a legal basis'' for expenses 
such as travel, office space and relocation. The contractor was 
project manager for the pavilion. Other ``questionable payments'' 
initiated by Coelho included dinner for Portuguese guides, laundry 
services, the luxury apartment, and a dry-run reception that cost 
$294 for food and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Hired his niece, Debra Coelho, in violation of USIA  
regulations, at $2,500 a month as an assistant to his deputy. He 
also hired two stepsons of Gerald McGowan, the U.S. ambassador to 
Portugal, at inflated salaries. One stepson received $2,700 a month 
and the other $3,200 a month. The contract ``did not identify any 
duties'' for McGowan's stepsons, the IG said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Did not ``adequately manage and control'' use of airline  
tickets, hotel accommodations and other lodging, free Expo tickets, 
motor vehicles, computers and VIP gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Elaborating on the IG's report, the center reported that Coelho  
also was involved in business ventures in Portugal with at least 
three corporate underwriters of the U.S. Pavilion. Ethics rules 
prohibit special government employees from working on matters that 
would affect their financial interests. 
</P>
<P>
	The center also described Coelho's efforts to gain public  
funding after private fund raising failed. 
</P>
<P>
	It said Coelho first secured support of a friend, then-Navy  
Secretary John Dalton. A House-Senate conference report strongly 
suggested that the service participate as a sponsor of the U.S. 
exhibit on ocean research and technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho then worked out a pledge from the National Institute of  
Environmental Health Sciences. As in the Navy's case, a paragraph 
in a conference report urged NIEHS ``to lend its expertise and 
provide technical assistance'' to the exposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before the Expo opened, the IG said the two agencies --  
armed with the legislative encouragement -- kicked in some $6.5 
million, or 82 percent of the funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Samuel Wilson, the institute's deputy director, said the agency  
originally wanted to contribute $500,000 -- not the $4 million 
donated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know the origin of the idea of our involvement,''  
Wilson told the center. ``It's safe to say it wasn't an 
institute-developed idea.''

<HEADLINE>  Japan Lifts Nuclear Plant Advisory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKAIMURA, Japan -- Life began returning to normal Sunday for  
townspeople living next to the site of Japan's worst nuclear 
disaster, with most spending the night at home after the government 
lifted an evacuation order. 
</P>
<P>
	The streets were quiet early Sunday, with a few couples taking  
morning strolls through the center of this mostly farming community 
under partly cloudy skies and occasional sprinkles of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Saturday, more than two days after the accident sent three  
workers to the hospital, the government lifted an evacuation order 
for the more than 160 residents who had been holed up in a 
community center. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in Tokaimura, a town of 33,000 about 70 miles northeast of  
Tokyo, were still not convinced that it was safe to go home. 
</P>
<P>
	Their fears were far from put to rest as more unsettling details  
of the accident emerged, highlighting the shoddy safety precautions 
at the plant and its astonishingly primitive methods. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of relying on the high-tech equipment expected at a  
nuclear facility, the workers were using their hands to pour the 
potentially deadly material into a bucket-like container, said 
officials of JCO Co., the private company that runs the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	They mistakenly put in too much uranium, setting off an  
uncontrolled atomic reaction that continued for hours, sending 
radioactive particles into the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said 49 people were exposed to the radiation,  
although none other than the three workers required 
hospitalization. One of the three, Hisashi Ouchi, was transferred 
to the University of Tokyo Hospital on Saturday to receive a blood 
transfusion. Ouchi had been exposed to about 17,000 times what is 
normal for annual exposure, Kyodo News said. 
</P>
<P>
	JCO had been ignoring the procedures set by Japanese law for the  
last four years, and was using its own manual to speed up the 
processing, the national Asahi newspaper reported in its Sunday 
editions, citing company official Hiroyuki Ogawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese media reports also said that the workers had never  
received proper training. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is unforgivable. That's all I have to say,'' Masaru  
Hashimoto, the governor of Ibaraki prefecture, or state, told 
reporters. ``I'm outraged, and it's an insult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said he was astonished by what had  
been happening at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The workers had used their hands and a stainless steel bucket  
or something,'' Kyodo reported Obuchi as saying. ``This is 
inconceivable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Saturday, when JCO President Hiroharu Kitani visited the  
evacuation center, he was showered with shouts of anger. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit-clad Kitani got down on his knees on the wooden floor  
in front of the villagers and the media, and bowed deeply in 
apology. All he got were more shouts that an apology just wasn't 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have begun an investigation into the company for possible  
negligence. 
</P>
<P>
	``This accident contradicts what Japan is renowned for and its  
standing as a leader in technological development,'' top government 
spokesman Hiromu Nonaka said in a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The government was, however, quick to distance itself from the  
cause of the accident and push blame onto the company as well as on 
human error. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo has said that Japan's overall nuclear power policies stand  
unchanged despite the Tokaimura accident. Japan has few natural 
resources, and it relies on atomic energy for about a third of its 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the accident has shattered the myth of Japan's supersafe  
nuclear technology, and opposition is likely to grow, even in a 
harmony-oriented nation where loud, aggressive protests tend to be 
rare.

<HEADLINE> Farm Aid Spurs Look at New Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It is harvest time again, and Congress is  
passing another multibillion-dollar bailout to keep farmers in 
business. Many lawmakers say it also is time to find a cheaper, 
more effective way to support farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea getting the most attention is a new subsidy program  
proposed by Rep. Charles Stenholm of Texas, the senior Democrat on 
the House Agriculture Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	His plan would provide payments to farmers when prices for crops  
fall significantly below average. The size of the checks would be 
tied to local crop yields. The idea is to guarantee farmers a 
minimum level of income each year, and ensure the cash goes to 
farmers, not landowners, as some subsidies now do. 
</P>
<P>
	``The payments would go directly to actual producers in time of  
need,'' Stenholm said. ``It's the kind of long-term approach we 
should be using to address agriculture's cyclical problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 ``Freedom to Farm'' law was supposed to wean growers  
from their dependence on government programs. But market prices 
collapsed last year and economists see little improvement ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers rushed out $6 billion in emergency relief last fall,  
and the Senate is expected to give final approval this week to $8.7 
billion more. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our current farm law doesn't provide the necessary safety net  
for our producers,'' said Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo. Stenholm's 
plan deserves ``close scrutiny,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law provides growers with crop subsidies that are tied  
to fluctuations in prices, not yields, and fixed ``market 
transition'' payments that decline each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Groups such as the National Farmers Union that think the  
government should do more to assist smaller-scale farms are 
interested in Stenholm's idea because it would provide more 
protection when prices are low or crops are poor. 
</P>
<P>
	The much bigger American Farm Bureau Federation and others like  
Stenholm's plan because it would not require controls on 
production, a key feature of the Depression-era farm policy 
Congress tossed out in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like an idea that has strong possibility and merit,''  
said Dick Newpher, executive director of the Farm Bureau's 
Washington office. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Agriculture Committee chairman, Republican Larry  
Combest of Texas, also has expressed interest. He plans a 
comprehensive review of government farm programs next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman wanted to use something like  
Stenholm's plan to distribute $5.5 billion in emergency relief 
included in the latest bailout. Farm groups balked at that 
suggestion because they feared it would delay the assistance. 
Instead, the money will go to recipients of the market transition 
checks, some of whom are not farming anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Stenholm's plan, which was originally proposed by economists at  
the Agriculture Department and Ohio State University in the early 
1990s, is not without its critics. 
</P>
<P>
	The payments could worsen the worldwide grain glut by  
encouraging farmers to plant crops in areas where they do not do 
well, such as parts of Stenholm's west Texas district, said Neil 
Harl, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University. The 1996 
farm law was designed to do just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
	Harl, who believes the government should go back to controlling  
production and paying farmers to hold grain off the market, said 
the law is ``fatally flawed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., wonders where the government would get  
the money for Stenholm's payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, ranking Democrat on the House  
agricultural appropriations subcommittee, is concerned that the 
program could wind up steering still more farm subsidies to Texas 
to the detriment of other regions.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested in University Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A white man who reportedly admitted  
making a phone call tinged with racial slurs and profanity after 
two bombings at a black college has denied making either of the 
explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence M. Lombardi, 41, an unemployed, married father of two,  
was arrested Friday and held without bail on two counts of making 
bombs. He could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The first bomb exploded Aug. 31 in the restroom of an  
administration building at Florida A&AMP;M University. The second went 
off Sept. 22, damaging a restroom surrounded by classrooms and 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI officials said Lombardi admitted making a telephone call to  
a Tallahassee TV station after the second bomb, and warned, ``this 
is just the beginning, brother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm telling you, these ... n------ ... I've had enough of  
this,'' the caller said. ``They got no business having a college 
when there ain't nobody there smart enough to ... get a degree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lombardi's attorney, R. Tim Jansen, said, ``He is absolutely  
innocent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were confident they had their man.  
</P>
<P>
	``FAMU today does not face the threat that it did yesterday,''  
said U.S. Attorney Michael Patterson, when Lombardi's arrest was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured in either blast, but the explosions spread  
fear across the 12,000-student campus. Dozens of police officers 
searched every campus building each morning, and everyone had to 
show ID to enter. Surveillance cameras were installed at state 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of that security will remain intact, campus authorities  
said. The school has a big football game tonight -- and hundreds of 
parents are on campus for parents' weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like our nightmare may be over,'' FAMU President  
Frederick S. Humphries told students at a rally Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they matched bomb fragments with an uncommon  
type of heavy-duty PVC pipe that Lombardi bought at a Lowe's home 
improvement store the day before the first explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said three former co-workers identified Lombardi  
from a store surveillance tape and recognized his voice on a 
recording of the threatening phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	One former co-worker told investigators Lombardi had talked  
about finding bomb-making instructions on the Internet, the FBI 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lombardi worked for a vending company and his route had included  
machines at the two buildings where the bombs exploded, the FBI 
said. An employee told investigators that Lombardi had been issued 
a university ID card and that he did not surrender the card when he 
left the company in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vending company employee described Lombardi as having no  
personality and as an individual who did not like blacks and has 
used the `N' word,'' the FBI wrote in its affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	Jansen said that was not true. ``They did not find any  
identification card at his house. He did not have one at the time 
of this event,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Governor Explores Ticket Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- A traffic ticket-fixing scandal that  
forced the head of Alabama's state troopers to quit widened 
Saturday with Gov. Don Siegelman suspending three top aides and 
ordering an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Members of the governor's staff will be asked point blank:  
Have you engaged in this activity and what were the 
circumstances?'' the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman said he expects every part of state government to  
participate in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press reviewed dozens of traffic tickets and  
payments of fines over two years and interviewed drivers who said 
their fines disappeared after they asked for help. It found 
requests for favors with traffic tickets linked to the governor's 
office, legislators, and acquaintances of former Public Safety 
Director Mike Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman said Saturday he suspended three members of his staff  
-- executive secretary Nick Bailey, constituent services aide Josh 
Hayes and deputy policy director Sabra Barnett -- without pay 
pending the outcome of the review. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will pay and they will be punished,'' Siegelman said.  
</P>
<P>
	Fixing a traffic ticket or asking an official to do so is a  
misdemeanor under Alabama law. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Siegelman said he had asked for and received  
Sullivan's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anyone, anywhere in this government is involved, they will  
have their ticket reinstated, they will pay the fines and they will 
be punished,'' the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman wouldn't say what punishment he would recommend for  
state government officials or employees who admit they have been 
involved in asking for favors with traffic tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said any state employee who lies when questioned about  
ticket fixing would be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman said Sullivan was ``very forthright, very  
forthcoming,'' when asked about the ticket fixing. 
</P>
<P>
	And he said Sullivan, who had worked at the Department of Public  
Safety since 1966, was resigning from state government, not just 
the director's post. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman named Jim Alexander, a 27-year-veteran of the  
Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, to be acting public safety 
director. Alexander has been chief of the governor's security 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan could not be reached for comment Saturday. He  
accompanied the University of Alabama football team to a game at 
Gainesville, Fla.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Patients' Rights / Presidential Speech  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Praising broad protections written into  
California's new health care reform law, President Clinton urged 
voters Saturday to press Congress to ``do the same for every 
American'' as the House votes this week on a national patients' 
bill of rights. 
</P>
<P>
	In his weekly radio address, Clinton decried as ``simply  
unacceptable'' a provision in a Senate budget bill that effectively 
would take away the right to a timely appeal when a health plan 
denies coverage. He urged the House to reject the provision, which 
he said lawmakers are likely to do if their constituents speak up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm convinced the votes are there to pass this patients' bill  
of rights this week,'' Clinton said. ``But we need your help to 
make it clear to the Republican leaders that we can't tolerate any 
attempt to kill this bill with legislative poison pills. Together, 
let's tell them to give this legislation the straight up or down 
vote it deserves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also announced that later this month, the Department of  
Health and Human Services would propose rules extending protections 
for poor children under the Children's Health Insurance Program. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes would require health care providers participating in  
the program to ensure their patients' access to specialists, 
emergency room services and unbiased, timely appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The children are from some of our hardest-pressed working  
families,'' Clinton said. ``That's why I feel so strongly about 
giving them not only access to health care, but also the guarantee 
of quality care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton noted that California Gov. Gray Davis signed an  
ambitious health care reform package that extends ``strong and 
enforceable'' patients' rights to the state's 20 million residents, 
and that he extended such protections to 85 million Americans 
covered by federal health care plans. Still, he said, those steps 
are not enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, it's time to do the same for every American,'' Clinton  
said. ``For all of the steps this administration and many states 
have taken to extend patient rights, we don't have the authority to 
protect every family unless Congress acts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Rep. J.C. Watts, chairman of the House Republican  
Conference, said the president is pushing for a quick vote on 
health care ``just to get it done. The Republicans want to get it 
done right, not fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watts said it's more important to get out of the way  
appropriations bills to keep the government running before turning 
to health care. ``We too are committed to meaningful reforms,'' 
Watts said in a statement. ``But as the president says, first 
things first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton taped his remarks in the midst of a three-day West Coast  
fund-raising swing that was expected to bring in $2.5 million for 
Democratic candidates. He also planned to spend time with daughter 
Chelsea, who is beginning her junior year at Stanford University in 
Palo Alto, and do some preparation work for his presidential 
library in Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	The health legislation coming before the House is sponsored by  
Reps. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., and John Dingell, D-Mich. Among other 
things, it provides the right to coverage for emergency room care 
and to see specialists and allows patients to refuse to change 
doctors during pregnancy or cancer treatment.

<HEADLINE> GOP Sets Budget Priorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans stressed their commitment Saturday  
to protecting Social Security, opposing any tax increase and giving 
schools more money with fewer strings. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Slade Gorton said the GOP will stick to those priorities  
and ensure that government keeps running during budget battles with 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``A government shutdown is not necessary,'' Gorton, R-Wash.,  
said in the party's weekly radio address. ``We do have the time to 
roll up our sleeves and finish the job. The American people sent us 
to the nation's capital not to argue constantly but to work 
together for the common good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many blame shutdowns in the winter of 1995-96 during budget  
fights with President Clinton for the president's re-election 
victory and for the GOP's poor showing in House elections last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress did not complete work on 13 overall spending bills  
before Friday's start of the federal fiscal year. But the president 
signed legislation Thursday keeping the government financed through 
Oct. 21. That gives all sides three more weeks to work through 
dozens of disputes ranging from public housing to mining on federal 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
	In the radio address, Gorton said basic differences exist  
between Clinton and the Republicans on all three GOP priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides want to spend more for better schools, he said, but  
``the debate is between Republicans who want to change federal laws 
so that those dollars go directly to states and local schools, and 
President Clinton, who wants more federal strings on education 
dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For decades Washington, D.C., has taken more and more control  
of your local schools. The federal government sends a little bit of 
money but a truckload of rules and regulations,'' Gorton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans believe the one-size-fits-all federal education  
regulations are a relic of the past. They haven't worked,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton said Republicans are committed to protecting Social  
Security, ``a sacred contract between the federal government and 
those who count on it for tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While ``the Democrat in the White House proposes raiding Social  
Security for $158 billion over the next five years,'' he asserted, 
``we won't tolerate any invasion of the Social Security trust fund 
-- period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton admitted that his appeal for a budget without mentioning  
a tax cut ``might sound odd'' in light of the $792 billion 
reduction the GOP passed but Clinton vetoed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton wants to raise taxes, he charged, and ``at the very  
least we will insist that the president back off his higher taxes 
plan and hold onto the possibility of reducing taxes on hardworking 
Americans in the future.''

<HEADLINE> Controversial Art Attracts Hundreds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If you build it -- even with elephant dung,  
bisected pigs and a severed cow's head -- and call it art, they will 
come. 
</P>
<P>
	They did by the hundreds Saturday at the Brooklyn Museum of Art,  
where the much-maligned and mega-hyped ``Sensation'' exhibit drew 
an overflow crowd of art lovers, scene makers and the merely 
curious -- all at $9.75 a head. 
</P>
<P>
	By 7 p.m., more than 7,000 people had toured the show, filling  
the space to capacity. The lines persisted through the evening, and 
police planned remain on site until the museum closed at 11 p.m., 
though authorities said the scene was calm. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd began queuing up three hours before the opening, which  
attracted scores of angry protesters upset by art that was deemed 
religiously offensive or pro-animal cruelty. Several museum 
visitors said that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's bitter opposition to 
the show had actually prompted them to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rudy got me here,'' Marvin Schneider said after checking out  
the controversial British show. ``I was interested in seeing this 
after what he said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy began Sept. 22 when the mayor announced that he  
was cutting off the museum's $7 million in annual funding unless 
the exhibit was pulled. Giuliani attacked the exhibit with 
escalating insults: ``sick'' ``Catholic bashing,'' and finally 
``pedophiles on parade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Museum officials in turn sued Giuliani. The city responded by  
suing the museum in an effort to evict it from the city-owned 
building where it's resided for more than a century. Both lawsuits 
are pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Cora Ferrer, 54, said the furor also brought her to the show.  
</P>
<P>
	``The mayor did me a favor,'' she said. ``If he kept his mouth  
shut, I never would have heard of this show. If I listened to him, 
I would have missed all the beauty inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The beauty included a dissected cow and pig, castrated male  
dummies lashed to a tree, and the infamous painting ``The Holy 
Virgin Mary'' with its splash of elephant dung. 
</P>
<P>
	A police sergeant somberly stood watch alongside the painting by  
artist Chris Ofili. The exhibit, which consistently stopped 
visitors in their tracks, was also protected by a plastic screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``What if this was done to your mother?'' asked a sign held by a  
protester outside the museum, which has generally kept a much lower 
profile since opening in 1823. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit opened promptly at 11 a.m., with ticket buyers  
passing through just-installed metal detectors as the sound of 
protesters reciting the ``Hail Mary'' echoed across the museum's 
plaza. 
</P>
<P>
	A sign outside the museum cautioned, ``Sensation. Be Warned.''  
The line to get inside stretched past the museum's property, with a 
steady stream of visitors pouring inside. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 supporters of The Catholic League protested the  
opening, singing hymns and praying the rosary. League President 
William Donohue handed out complementary ``vomit bags'' to people 
waiting to see the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is hate speech, people,'' Donohue told his troops. ``This  
is not art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gareth Brown disagreed. He came with his 7-month-old son, whose  
stroller carried a small sign reading, ``Pro-art, anti-Giuliani.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Art should provoke discussion and controversy, and this  
does,'' Brown said while waiting in line. ``Controversy is not a 
bad thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Museum director Arnold Lehman opted not to dump fuel on the fire  
Saturday. ``There has been a lot of comment on all sides over the 
past few days,'' Lehman said. ``Today's the day to let the art 
speak for itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was just a single arrest for disorderly conduct when an  
anti-Giuliani protester refused police orders to stop blocking a 
sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
	One question that became almost an afterthought in the flap  
remained unanswered: was the exhibit any good? 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some obviously shocking things,'' said patron  
Schneider. ``I thought some things were beautiful. But there was a 
lot of art that I wouldn't hang in my living room.''

<HEADLINE> Controversial NYC Art Exhibit Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At last, the day of reckoning.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sensation,'' the controversial art exhibit that set New York  
on its ear even before it arrived, opened today at the Brooklyn 
Museum of Art amid cheers of First Amendment advocates and jeers of 
disgusted detractors. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors lined up this morning to get into the museum, and about  
three dozen protesters showed up, too. They included protesters 
from the conservative Catholic League and from animal rights 
groups. One demonstrator protesting Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's 
efforts to stop the show was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mayor Giuliani should be arrested!'' yelled Robert Lederman, a 	
longtime critic of the mayor who was wearing a T-shirt that said 
</P>
<P>
     ``Giuliani  police state.'' He was arrested after police asked him 	
to move and he  
refused.	   Giuliani has called the show ``sick'' and has vowed to cut the 
city's $7 million annual contribution to the museum because of it. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit includes a painting of the Virgin Mary decorated  
with elephant dung; another of a serial child-killer whose face is 
formed with hundreds of children's handprints; and a bisected pig 
floating in formaldehyde. 
</P>
<P>
	As they waited in line, some visitors held mimeographed sheets  
that said: ``Hey Rudy, I'm a taxpayer too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a very provocative, enduring show,'' said  
Mimi Zahka, who viewed the exhibit in advance, and was among about 
600 pro-museum demonstrators that formed a sometimes raucous crowd 
at a rally in Brooklyn on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Katie Browning said the exhibit is ``a little bit shocking,''  
adding: ``Some of the pieces made me feel kind of queasy -- (but) 
not in a moral way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But hundreds voiced support of the museum, both in public  
opinion polls and at the rally. Homemade signs there featured 
pointed statements about the mayor's purported lack of respect for 
the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Actress and activist Susan Sarandon saluted the large crowd,  
urging them: ``don't roll over on this one, this is really a big 
deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani was unmoved.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want any money coming out of my pocket to pay for this  
kind of sick demonstration of clear psychological problems,'' he 
said at City Hall. ``This should happen in a psychiatric hospital, 
not in a (city-funded) museum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both BMA and the city have filed lawsuits over the conflict. The  
museum filed suit in federal court, responding to Giuliani's threat 
to withhold the museum's funding, which is about one-third of the 
museum's annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The city later filed a lawsuit in state court in an effort to  
evict the museum from its building for violating its lease. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest addendum to the legal battle, attorneys for the  
museum filed papers Friday accusing Giuliani of violating the 
museum's equal protection privileges under the Fourteenth 
Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	The papers also said the mayor isn't entitled to withhold funds  
already authorized by the city Council, named the mayor as an 
individual defendant and sought punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an outrageous, frivolous act,'' said Michael Hess, the  
city's top lawyer. ``It's a mean-spirited, outrageous maneuver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several demonstrations were expected today and police were to be  
in the vicinity of the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	But travel to and from the museum might not be as easy as usual.  
Due to work on three subway lines, the three stops closest to the 
museum will not have service on the Manhattan-bound tracks. Shuttle 
buses from the museum are scheduled to run to the nearest station 
with regular service. 
</P>
<P>
	``These things are planned months in advance. It in no way has  
anything to do with the museum,'' said Melissa Farley, Transit 
Authority spokesperson.

<HEADLINE> Missile Interceptor Passes Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -- A prototype national  
missile defense system passed a critical test on Saturday, 
intercepting an unarmed missile on a 16,000-mph collision course 
over the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a successful intercept,'' said Sheryl Irwin,  
spokeswoman for the Department of Defense. 
</P>
<P>
	An unarmed Minuteman missile launched just after 7 p.m. on a  
flight over the Pacific to the Marshall Islands, where the ``kill 
vehicle'' missile intercepted it. The interceptor collided with the 
intercontinental ballistic missile at a combined speed of 16,000 
mph about 140 miles above the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	The Minuteman was configured with a dummy warhead and a decoy  
balloon. 
</P>
<P>
	The defender was the Raytheon-built Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle,  
a 55-inch-long, 120-pound device carried aloft on a booster rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	The system is designed to destroy missiles launched by rogue  
states or terrorists, not a multimissile barrage from a major 
nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
	The system is designed to destroy missiles launched by rogue  
states or terrorists, not a multimissile barrage from a major 
nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics have faulted the test plan as unrealistic and too  
limited to make a sound decision, while peace activists who 
demonstrated outside the base a week ago denounced the testing as 
preparation for war. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials played down expectations, saying that even a  
miss would have been considered a success -- as long as the reason 
was known. 
</P>
<P>
	The test, however, is the first of three before a readiness  
review scheduled by the Pentagon for next June. To proceed with 
broader testing, at least two of the tests must result in an 
interception. A White House decision on initial deployment is 
expected after the June review. 
</P>
<P>
	The test comes as nations such as North Korea, Iran and Syria  
are, according to the CIA, developing long-range missiles that 
could hit the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Unarmed U.S. ICBMs are routinely tested in launches from  
Vandenberg to a Marshall Islands target range about 4,200 miles 
across the Pacific.

<HEADLINE> Bavasi Resigns As Angels GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Bill Bavasi asked his boss to lunch the  
other day with one thing in mind -- to resign as general manager of 
the Anaheim Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	Resignation accepted.  
</P>
<P>
	``At lunch, it became apparent that we had different ways and  
different philosophies about how we were going to win,'' team 
president Tony Tavares said. ``Obviously, this is not a happy day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The change we're looking to cause is to try and get a team  
that's competitive year in and year out. We look at getting there 
in different ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was announced at an Edison Field news conference  
Friday night -- an hour before the Angels faced the AL West champion 
Texas Rangers; a day after Bavasi and Tavares got together, and 
four weeks after manager Terry Collins resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very relieved,'' Bavasi said. ``The season has been a  
disappointment, this change is not. When you get to this point, you 
know you're at a point where you should take your leave, you feel 
good. You move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bavasi, 41, will become a special assistant to Tavares, who said  
he planned to start a search for a new general manager immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll put a list together (today), get on the phone, ask for  
permission to talk to people,'' Tavares said, adding he hoped to 
have a new GM in place as soon as possible, and that one will be 
hired before a new manager is selected. 
</P>
<P>
	Bench coach Joe Maddon replaced Collins on an interim basis.  
Collins had signed a two-year contract extension in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Tavares said he didn't meet with Bavasi convinced he would be  
changing GMs, but admitted he was considering such a move. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels have endured a miserable year, falling below .500 for  
good on April 18, and dropping out of contention in the AL West 
when they lost 11 straight games starting July 16 to fall 16 games 
out of first place. 
</P>
<P>
	They have a 68-92 record and trail the Rangers by 27 games with  
two remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels entered the season with high hopes after signing  
high-priced free agent Mo Vaughn to a $80 million, six-year 
contract last November and making a couple other offseason moves. 
</P>
<P>
	But several injuries before the season and early in the year  
contributed to their problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Bavasi was appointed to the GM job on Jan. 12, 1994. His father,  
Buzzie, was executive vice president-general manager of the Angels 
from 1977-84, and held the same position with the Brooklyn and Los 
Angeles Dodgers before that. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Bavasi began his career with the Angels in 1980 as a  
minor league administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a crime to have different styles of management, and  
we do,'' he said. ``I have a lot of faith in the players we put 
together here. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have had nothing but fun here. It was the best time you  
could possibly have in this game. This is the best job you could 
have. 
</P>
<P>
	Bavasi, the eighth general manager in club history, said he was  
uncertain as to his future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will look in baseball, but mostly I will look outside of  
baseball,'' he said. ``I love living here. I'm wide-open to 
anything, including staying with the Angels. I don't have any 
preconceived notion. I'm just going to take it as it comes.''

<HEADLINE> $20M Needed To Keep Reds Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- On the day Marge Schott became a part of the  
Cincinnati Reds' past, general manager Jim Bowden issued a grave 
warning about his overachieving team's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden, in Milwaukee on Friday to watch the Reds attempt to  
clinch a playoff berth in a three-game series with the Brewers, 
decried the gaps in baseball's economic structure while praising 
his current team's improbable run to the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden thinks Cincinnati would need a $20 million payroll  
increase to keep the current team intact for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``A small-market team just can't do what we've done,'' Bowden  
said. ``What we've done doesn't change the economic problems of 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds' payroll is $35 million and is the lowest among the  
nine teams still in contention for a postseason berth. That bottom 
line was even lower before Bowden acquired starting pitcher Juan 
Guzman at the trading deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden figures he would need at least a $55 million payroll to  
keep intact the solid nucleus he has built in the past 18 months 
through trades, the maturation of young players and good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds would be able to generate a large amount of revenue  
with an extended postseason run, but even a trip to the World 
Series and the resulting increases in season-ticket sales for 2000 
might not bring in the funds Bowden said he will need. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything's possible, but right now it's unlikely,'' he said.  
``It's almost impossible to keep all these elements together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden has ample experience in building teams and watching them  
be destroyed. His Cincinnati teams in 1994 and 1995 won NL Central 
Division championships, but the team's payroll edged up higher than 
the small-market Reds could afford, particularly when the 
free-spending Schott was forced to stop running the team. 
</P>
<P>
	So Bowden dismantled the Reds, jettisoning Ron Gant, David  
Wells, Benito Santiago, Tony Fernandez and Mike Jackson, among 
others. He tried to patch the lineup with fill-ins like Eric Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cincinnati fell to .500 in 1996, and played 1997 and 1998 at  
18 games under .500, not finishing higher than third place in the 
division. So the Reds decided to tear down the team and rebuild, 
starting with the trade of starter John Smiley to Cleveland in July 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to turn it over to young, talented kids, and we had to  
do it at the expense of our best players,'' Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next 16 months, Jeff Brantley, Dave Burba, Jeff Shaw,  
Mike Remlinger, Paul Konerko and Bret Boone left as Bowden built a 
core of youngsters for the future. But even Bowden couldn't have 
predicted how quickly the team would come together -- and how much 
fun they would have doing it. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of veterans Greg Vaughn, Denny Neagle and others  
have complemented and provided leadership to Cincinnati's 
youngsters such as Sean Casey and Pokey Reese. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen a team that has such a good time,'' Bowden  
said. ``In '94, '95, we had trouble in the clubhouse. This year 
we've had nothing but peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden had no intention of tracing that peace back to Schott's  
departure from involvement in the day-to-day operations of the 
club, though he did praise the limited partnership controlled by 
Carl Lindner and two others which formally took over the team 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This ownership group lets employees do their jobs,'' Bowden  
said. ``How much revenue we generate will determine what kind of 
team we can put on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he's perennially a contender for other jobs in bigger  
markets, Bowden thinks his future is in Cincinnati. He and Reds 
managing executive John Allen appear to have smoothed over any 
differences they might have had, and the once-dismal farm system 
finally is showing promise. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden, who was a candidate for GM jobs in Los Angeles and  
Baltimore during the last offseason, signed a three-year contract 
extension last October that will keep him in Cincinnati through 
2003, the same year the Reds' new ballpark is scheduled to open. 
</P>
<P>
	And though he doesn't expect his surprising team to return  
intact in 2000, he'll go back to work anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll try to figure out another way to win,'' Bowden said.

	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis on Saturday signed  
legislation to outlaw the harassment of gay students and teachers 
in public schools and colleges, calling the action an attempt to 
``beat back the forces of hatred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic governor also signed into law a new state  
domestic partners registry for couples who are gay or over age 62, 
extending to them hospital visitation rights and allowing state and 
local government workers to get health benefits for their partners. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the third of three gay-rights bills, the governor signed  
legislation to block job and housing discrimination on the basis of 
sexual orientation. The bill places authority over the cases in the 
state's Fair Employment and Housing Department, a key state civil 
rights agency. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the legislation banning discrimination against gay  
students and teachers that drew the most attention. Three other 
states -- Wisconsin, Massachusetts and Connecticut -- have similar 
antidiscrimination rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, a political leader has taken meaningful action. This  
is the most important piece of legislation ever passed in regard to 
gay-lesbian youth rights,'' said Kevin Jennings, executive director 
of the national Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network.

<HEADLINE> Red Wings 2, Sabres 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Chris Osgood earned the 24th shutout of his  
career and Detroit got goals from Kris Draper and Tomas Holmstrom 
as the Red Wings beat the Buffalo Sabres 2-0 in the opener for both 
teams Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres, who lost in last season's Stanley Cup finals to the  
Dallas Stars, struggled with Detroit's defense which was bolstered 
by the trade late last season that brought Chris Chelios and the 
acquisition just before training camp of Steve Duchesne. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit outshot the Sabres 44-22.  
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo goaltender Dominik Hasek, who played sparingly during  
the exhibition season while recovering from a hernia operation, was 
sometimes brilliant, even in defeat. The two-time MVP and five-time 
Vezina Trophy winner, who turns 35 in January, has announced he 
will retire at the end of this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was a fast-paced affair dominated by sometimes  
spectacular goaltending at both ends until Draper's goal gave 
Detroit a 1-0 lead with 1:28 left in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal was mostly the result of Draper's tenacity. He made a  
nice move around a defenseman to get the shot off from the right 
circle, then chased the puck to the other circle, wheeled and 
flipped in his own rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	Duchesne, looking perfectly comfortable in his new surroundings,  
rifled a shot from just inside the blue line that Holstrom -- at the 
edge of the left circle -- redirected under the crossbar before 
Hasek could react. That gave Detroit a 2-0 lead at 5:15 of the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
	Chelios also got an assist on the goal, leaving him just one  
point shy of 800 for his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Osgood, who had three shutouts last season, made two good saves  
to frustrate Geoff Sanderson, once in the first period and again 
with 6:27 in the second when Sanderson broke in alone while the 
Sabres were shorthanded. 
</P>
<P>
	Osgood scrambled to cover up a loose puck with Michal Grosek  
bearing down on the crease at 4:31 of the third period. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek made a diving glove save on a blistering shot by Nicklas  
Lidstrom at 6:21 of the first period and came up big to rob Sergei 
Fedorov at close range 40 seconds into the second period. Hasek 
made another good save to prevent a second goal by Draper 5:21 into 
the third period. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, after fending off a rapid succession of shots, got a  
laugh and a round of applause from the 19,983 fans at Joe Louis 
Arena with 10:36 left in the third period. Immediately after a 
whistle that stopped the barrage, Hasek picked up the puck and 
tossed it out to the blue line. He then raised his arms -- palms up 
-- as if to say, ``What else can I do?''

<HEADLINE> Bauer Beats Bush in Straw Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- GOP presidential candidate Gary Bauer  
edged out front-runner George W. Bush in a Minnesota straw poll on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, the only presidential candidate at the Minnesota  
Republican Convention, captured 294, or 36.6 percent, of the 803 
ballots cast in the nonbinding straw poll. Bush came in a close 
second with 291 votes, or 36.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote has no bearing on the 33 delegates the party will send  
to the national GOP convention next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyday, my candidacy gains momentum as American working  
families add their support for my unapologetic pro-family, pro-life 
Reagan-Republican message,'' Bauer said after hearing the results. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the votes were tallied, the conservative activist had  
told reporters he hoped to place in the top three. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, former Green Bay Packers defensive lineman Reggie  
White, keynote speaker at Saturday night's gala Christian Coalition 
dinner in Washington, threw his endorsement to Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have been unflinching in your defense of the family,  
consistent in your commitment to the sanctity of life and reliable 
when the battle has been toughest,'' White wrote Bauer in a letter 
released by Bauer's presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer aides eagerly circulated the letter at Christian Coalition  
meetings Saturday, one day after coalition founder Pat Robertson 
dismissed Bauer's candidacy as ``a lost cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer has raised about $5.4 million so far for his campaign.  
Bush has grabbed a whopping $56 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Sutton, executive director of the state Republican Party,  
said Bauer's first-place finish in the straw poll should tell other 
candidates something. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means that if you show up, it helps your campaign,'' Sutton  
said. ``You can't underestimate the power of being in the room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sutton admitted that the straw poll of 803 people may not  
accurately represent how most Minnesota Republicans would vote, but 
added ``you win a straw poll, it can't help but help your 
candidacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No other candidates placed even close to Bauer and Bush. Forbes  
came in third with 68 votes, or 8.5 percent, and Alan Keyes had 40 
votes, or 5 percent.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Endorses Cardinals Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Tony La Russa is expected to sign a contract  
extension with the St. Louis Cardinals in the next few days, and 
Mark McGwire is a big supporter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not his fault we're playing the way we are,'' McGwire  
said. ``The media and the public's jumping on Tony and the coaching 
staff and they have nothing to do with it. It's the players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into the season finale the Cardinals are 74-86, their  
third losing record in La Russa's four years with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching injuries have hampered the team the last two years.  
This season the Cardinals lost two starters early and then their 
bullpen, expected to be a strength, collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	They've also been fundamentally sloppy and set a team record for  
strikeouts for the second time in three seasons with 1,201 -- 10 
more than in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire said none of it was La Russa's fault.  
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, he's the most well-prepared manager in the game,''  
McGwire said. ``He gets his players to play, and we've had a lot of 
things happen this year that weren't expected, and this is where we 
are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks La Russa has talked a lot about the future of  
the team, but not about his future with the team. He's said he 
doesn't want to detract from the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll wait till the end of the season,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	La Russa is in the final year of a contract that pays him $1.5  
million per season. General manager Walt Jocketty said the 
extension, for two or three years, will be finalized soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just haven't had a chance to sit down and work out the  
mechanics of the contract yet,'' Jocketty said. ``I'll let you know 
when we do it.''

<HEADLINE> Ireland Tops U.S. in Rugby 53-8 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Ireland's Keith Wood grabbed four tries  
in a 53-8 victory over the United States to open Group E on 
Saturday at the Rugby World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish scored seven tries in a tuneup up for next week's  
defining group match against Australia. Wood took over the World 
Cup scoring lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. fielded just four players who earn a living from the  
sport, compared to the fully professional Irish squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrations boiled over at the finish as players from both  
teams threw punches. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish went 10-0 ahead after seven minutes when they opted to  
kick for the sideline instead of goal after winning a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans were unable to settle down and found it hard to  
hang onto the ball as they sent it along the backline. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. kept Ireland's lead to 24-8 at halftime but some hard  
tackling and strong running, particularly by captain Dan Lyle and 
center Juan Grobler, was being squandered through poor discipline 
and ball control. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans had an improved effort following a 106-8 loss to  
England in a tuneup game.
