<HEADLINE> Turkish DSP Leader Rejects Participation in RP's Coalition-Forming Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Democratic Left Party
(DSP) leader Bulent Ecevit today refused the invitation, proposed
by pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) Chairman Necmettin Erbakan,
to take part in a RP-led coalition government.
</P>
<P>
In today's meeting with Erbakan, who was seeking the support
from the DSP, Ecevit said that there was no "numerical
necessity" for his party's participation in such a government.
</P>
<P>
But he refrained from a categorical rejection of the support
Erbakan is seeking. "A civilized dialogue has been established
between the DSP and the RP. We shall look to see how it goes in
the coming term," Ecevit declared after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders said they had agreed on the necessity of a
quick solution to the government puzzle, criticizing True Path
Party (DYP) Chairwoman and caretaker Prime Minister Tansu Ciller
for insisting on her staying prime minister as a precondition
for entering a coalition.
</P>
<P>
In the December 24 elections, the RP won 158 seats in the
550-member legislature but its anti-secular and anti-West
campaign rhetoric compromised its chances of finding government
partners although the Islamic party later moderated its position.
</P>
<P>
However, Ciller has rejected outright the offer of
partnership, while Motherland Party (ANAP) leader Mesut Yilmaz has
told Erbakan that he prefers a center-right coalition with the
DYP although he stopped short of shutting the door completely
on a partnership with the RP.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Ecevit, Erbakan said he would complete
the first round of exploratory meetings by talking with
Republican People's Party (CHP) leader Deniz Baykal on Tuesday
and start the real efforts toward forming the government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ciller caused fresh controversy on Saturday in an
already uncertain political environment by suggesting that instead
of a lasting coalition government between the DYP and the ANAP,
these two parties should form a temporary government to take the
country to early general elections in six months' time.
</P>
<P>
Responding to this suggestion angrily, Yilmaz said on Sunday
that to bring the idea of early elections to the agenda at
the present time amounted to "trying to sabotage the efforts
to form a government."
</P>
<P>
Erbakan and Ecevit also came against Ciller's preference for
another election as the way out of the deadlock.

<HEADLINE> US to Begin Training Bosnian Muslim Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- United States civilian
contractors will begin training Bosnian Muslim soldiers in the
next 60 days, the New York Times quoted Clinton administration
officials as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. plan, which identified the Bosnian military's strength
and weaknesses and the priorities for training and equipment, was
presented to Bosnian officials last week in Sarajevo by a team of
Pentagon and State Department officials.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Bosnian Muslim troops would be trained in
Bosnia and perhaps a NATO country such as Turkey, Pentagon
officials said. The United States and Turkey have reportedly
reached an agreement on helping train the Bosnian Muslim troops.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the training would cost no more than 100
million U.S. dollars and the equipment about 400 million U.S.
dollars, depending on whether the Bosnian army received
American-made weapons or East European equipment similar to that
is used by the Bosnian Serb armed forces.
</P>
<P>
But Western European officials fear that arming the Bosnian
Muslims will undermine the impartiality of the NATO peacekeeping
troops in Bosnia and their efforts to promote arms control in the
Balkans. The U.S.-brokered Bosnian peace agreement, signed by the
presidents of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia in Paris on December 14,
calls for the three former warring parties in the former Yugoslav
republic to reduce their weapons.
</P>
<P>
European officials also worry that this approach could
encourage the Muslims to fight to regain control over all of
Bosnia. This in turn could promote a strategic alliance between
Croatia and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
However, the Pentagon has said that the plan will be the first
step towards insuring that the Bosnian Muslim troops can defend
themselves after NATO peacekeepers leave the country.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has repeatedly assured the U.S.
Congress that the 20,000 American peace implementation troops will
stay in Bosnia no longer than 12 months.

<HEADLINE> Make-up of Future Iranian Government Disclosed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The make-up of the future
Iranian government to be headed by 53-year-old clergyman Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri was disclosed in a newly-launched Persian
biweekly published here today.
</P>
<P>
The biweekly, called Omid-e Javan (the Hope of the Youth),
revealed that present Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri
could be the next president, according to its own reliable sources.
</P>
<P>
An editor of the paper told Xinhua in a telephone call that the
news sources are reliable, saying "you can count on us."
</P>
<P>
The 16-page paper said that the only candidate for presidency
now was Nateq-Nouri, who has said that he will run for presidency
if his right-wing faction, the Society of Combatant Clergy (SCC),
nominates him.
</P>
<P>
"All those who were said to be possible candidates by morning
and evening papers have denied their candidacy except for
Hojjatoleslam Nateq Nouri," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It said that Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati will be
Nateq-Nouri's first-vice president.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with foreign reporters late December,
50-year-old Velayati said that he did not want to run for the next
presidency because he did not want to "change jobs."
</P>
<P>
The paper also predicted that Mohammad Javad Larijani, the
U.S.-educated MP, could be Nateq-Nouri's foreign minister. Now he
serves as vice-chairman of the Parliament Foreign Policy
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The paper also said a former presidential candidate who is now
studying in Britain will return to Iran to become Nateq-Nouri's
finance minister.
</P>
<P>
"Ahmad Tavakkoli, former economic editor at Resalat Daily...who
is now said to be studying outside of Iran will be the economic
and finance minister," it said.
</P>
<P>
Tavakkoli has close links with Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei. He was the toughest rival for Rafsanjani in the 1993
elections. He is now studying in Britain to get his Ph.D. in
economics.
</P>
<P>
The paper also predicted that Hassan Rowhani, parliament
vice-speaker and secretary of the Supreme National Security
Council, will be elected as the future parliament speaker.

<HEADLINE> PAC Denies Makwetu Abandoning Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (Xinhua)-- The Pan Africanist
Congress (PAC) of South Africa today denied its President
Clarence Makwetu had abandoned the party amid a leadership
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Cape Town, leading PAC activist
Patricia De Lille said Makwetu had not abandoned the party,
saying "as far as I know he is still the president."
</P>
<P>
De Lille said Makwetu was leaving for the United States and
Canada this evening together with members of the Parliamentary
Committee on Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
She said the PAC National Executive Committee (NEC) would meet
on January 27 to discuss the resignation of Maxwell
Nemadzivhanani as secretary-general, who stepped down yesterday
citing intense criticism from colleagues in the party.
</P>
<P>
However, Makwetu, appearing on South African Broadcasting
Corporation's television this evening, denied any knowledge of
Nemadzivhanani's resignation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, a senior PAC official, who declined to be
named, said in Johannesburg that Makwetu had abandoned the party,
leaving unpaid bills and other debts behind him.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed source said Makwetu, having taken all his
belongings to Cape Town, leaving his "presidential car" behind
and his Johannesburg home empty, failed to turn up at a meeting
here with the party's NEC.
</P>
<P>
"He has left his responsibilities," said the official.
</P>
<P>
It is widely reportedly that Makwetu's unexpected departure
had sent morale among party executive committee members
plummeting and was the reason for Nemadzivhanani's resignation.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Makwetu's departure, the PAC source said Makwttu
was "destroying the image of the PAC", and he should have
resigned and made way for someone else.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu had apparently lost enthusiasm after PAC's poor
showing in the recent local government elections had diminished
his popularity within the upper echelons of the party, added the
source. enditem

<HEADLINE> Mandela: Moshoeshoe II's Death, A Great Loss To Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The untimely and tragic
death of Lesotho's King Moshoeshoe II was a great loss to the
Basotho nation, the people of South Africa and the whole
continent, South African President Nelson Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
Moshoeshoe II was killed in a car accident in the Maluti
mountains earlier this morning when his car veered off the road
and went down the hillside.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Pretoria, Mandela said King
Moshoeshoe II was a great friend of the people of South Africa,
an able leader and one of the world's reigning monarchs who
unequivocally embraced democracy within the context of the
history and traditions of their nations.
</P>
<P>
Mandela praised Moshoeshoe II for being instrumental in the
Basotho nation's struggle for independence and in their
resistance to the policies of apartheid regimes aiming to
undermine the kingdom's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said Moshoeshoe II was considerate, sensitive to the
interests of his people, rational and capable of rising above
narrow personal interests, especially during the past months when
southern African leaders sought to help resolve Lesotho's
constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
He also reaffirmed the South African government's commitment
to its agreements with and obligaitons toward the Lesotho people
and government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the African National Congress, the National Party
and the Pan Africanist Congress all expressed shock at
Moshoeshoe's death and expressed their condolences to queen
Mamohato, the royal family, the Lesotho government and the
Basotho nation.

<P>
SARAJEVO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian government today
refused to release Serb prisoners of war (POWs) as planned for
today and tomorrow, an International Red Cross official said in
Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Jacques de Maio told reporters the Red Cross felt regretful
that the Bosnian government "did not follow our plan which allows
for the comprehensive release of prisoners which was an important
step for building confidence."
</P>
<P>
The government officials, however, argued that they would not
release the Serb prisoners unless 4,000 Muslims, instead of only
200, must be set free.
</P>
<P>
A total of 900 prisoners of war were arranged to be exchanged
today and tomorrow in various parts of the country. The Serb
authority said they would free all the 200 remaining Muslim
prisoners under Red Cross and IFOR auspices.
</P>
<P>
Under the Bosnian peace accord, all prisoners of war must be
released by January 19, one month after IFOR officially take
command from the U.N. protection force.

<HEADLINE> Israel Accused of Interfering in Palestinian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Hanan Ashrawi, an independent
candidate in Jerusalem district for Palestinian Council elections,
today strongly accused the Israeli authorities of interfering in
the elections and preventing campaigning activities in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi, former spokeswoman for Palestinian peace delegation to
Madrid and Washington conferences, has been turned back at the
entrance from Ramallah to Jerusalem by Israeli soldiers for a
number of times and prevented from campaigning in east Jerusalem
neighborhoods, reported Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Maj.-Gen. Oren Shahor, Coordinator of Israeli government
activities in the occupied territories, Sunday accused Ashrawi of
provocation and of infringing agreement between Israel and the
Palestinian Authority concerning elections in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing the charges, Ashrawi noted that what she has done
is completely in conformity with the regulations of the
Palestinian Central Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Israeli authorities have allowed clear
threats made by people in the Likud and other opposition groups
to intimidate the Palestinian public in Jerusalem. Candidates can
not reach them to talk to them freely about the reality and truth.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi stressed that this is entirely illegal and
unacceptable and Israel should be responsible for the action.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service in
east Jerusalem, the Likud Party plastered posters throughout east
Jerusalem Sunday night threatening to revoke the Jerusalem ID cards
of all Jerusalemites who vote in the Palestinian elections on
January 20.
</P>
<P>
The poster is in black and white, and was glued on top of the
posters of Palestinian candidates in prominent places in the city,
especially the main Salah a-Din Street near the post office and
central court.
</P>
<P>
It has the word, "caution," in Hebrew in the large letters on
the bottom, saying that "Any resident of Jerusalem who votes in
the (Palestinian) Authority elections might lose his Israeli ID
card."
</P>
<P>
The poster is signed by Danny Danun, head of Likud Youth
Party.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rejects Iranian Remarks on War Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today rejected statements
made by Iranian general Meir Fasal Bakher Zadeh concerning Iraq's
"non-cooperation" in search of Iranian people who died during the
1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war, saying Iran is using humanitarian issues
for achieving certain political goals.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted by the Iraqi News
Agency as saying that the Iranian general's statement Saturday
contradicted all facts and covered its violations of the 1949 Geneva
Agreement on the treatment of prisoners of war (POWs).
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran and Iraq have signed a joint committee
meeting minute on exchanging POWs and issues concerning the war
dead. During the the committee's two meetings held in September
and October last year, both sides agreed on keeping search of war
dead and preparing for holding a third meeting to exchange their
findings, he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Iraq is very surprised and rejects the
Iranian statements which reveal the truth behind airing such
statements as part of the Iranian policy of using humanitarian
issues for achieving certain political goals.
</P>
<P>
He said that the possibility of Iranian delivering the found
corps of Iraqi war victims to their concerned without passing them
through the Iraqi authorities, as stated by Iranian general,
showed the unseriousness of the Iranian side on implementing what
both sides have agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, he said, has released all Iranian prisoners detained
since 1980 and the Iraqi government confirms its commitment to
implement what had been agreeed upon with the Iranian side. He
added it not only covered the exchange of the bodies of war
victims but also the solution to all humanitarian issues,
including freeing Iraqi POWs still held by the Iranian side.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Revenue Collections Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Revenue Authority
(ZRA) collected a total of 546 billion kwacha (574.7 million US
dollars) in 1995 exceeding the government target of 530 billion
kwacha (557.8 million dollars) by three percent, ZRA chief
announced today.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing here, ZRA Chairman Patick Chiumya said the
success was achieved due to ZRA's enhanced efforts in revenue
collections and an expansion of the tax base in the country.
</P>
<P>
The successful implementation of value added tax (VAT) in July
1995 made a further and most significant contribution to the
improved tax yield in the year, he indicated.
</P>
<P>
The total revenues collected in 1995 reflected an increase of
145 percent over the 1993 revenue figure, he added.
</P>
<P>
The ZRA's consistent success in revenue collection has played
a significant role in enabling the government to fulfill its
national and international obligations and implement its policies
for the future development of the nation, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, many people particularly those in business community have
reportedly complained that the newly-introduced VAT, which is pegged
at 20 percent, is too high.

<HEADLINE> International Seminar on OSCE Opened in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- An international seminar
opened here today to discuss the contribution of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to the security of
smaller states.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Cyprus Foreign Minister Alecos
Michaelides urged the OSCE to play an important role in the
implementation of President Glafcos Clerides' proposal for the
demilitarization of this east Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides has proposed the island's complete
demilitarization provided the 35,000-strong Turkish force
withdraws from the island and the Republic's National Guard is
dismantled simultaneously. A multinational force could be formed
to keep peace on the island.
</P>
<P>
"No doubt, the OSCE can play an important role in the
promotion of the implementation of this proposal," the Cypriot
Minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The Cyprus experience is a frightening signal for the small
states," Michaelides said, adding that "when small states are
faced with aggression and threat to their territorial integrity
and sovereignty they are unable to face it."
</P>
<P>
The island has been divided since 1974 when Turkey militarily
intervened and seized the northern third of Cyprus following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Nicosia seminar as of great interest, Peter
Bloetzer, a representative of the OSCE presidency, noted that
"small states are often more vulnerable and thus their demand for
security is often greater."
</P>

LAGOS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian army has introduced
new methods for checking fraudulent claims of those who applied

The Director of Defence Information Fred Chijuka said that
some parents who failed to bring up their children properly

<HEADLINE> French Defense Minister Ends Visit to Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 15 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister
Charles Millon ended his visit to Kuwait and left here today,
calling on Iraq to implement all U.N. Security Council resolutions
related to Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq must comply with all U.N. Security Council resolutions,
foremost the resolution that demands the release of all kuwaiti
POWs," French Defense Minister Charles Millon said in a departure
statement.
</P>
<P>
Millon arrived in Kuwait Sunday and met with Kuwaiti Amir
Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, Crown Prince and Prime Minister
Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah and First Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference before his departure, Millon
said, "There could be no development in France's relations with
Iraq until it complies with all the U.N. resolutions, and until
the weapons of mass destruction are all revealed and until the
issue of the Kuwaiti missing and POWs is resolved."
</P>
<P>
On France's relations with Iraq, Millon said, "The reason
behind a French parliamentary delegation's visit to Baghdad
headed by the former French Foreign Minister was to confirm and
repeat the French stance to the Iraqi officials and it had no
other goal."
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit to Kuwait by a French minister since
the new government took office.
</P>
<P>
The French minister expressed his satisfaction with the results
of the discussions he had with Kuwaiti officials and said there
were "identical" points of view over the issues.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Millon pressed Kuwait to buy French-made
MM-15 anti-ship missiles and reaffirmed his country's support for
the emirate's security.
</P>
<P>
He also said he was not in Kuwait "just to sell equipment,
but...to confirm" friendship and cooperation between France and
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
France is competing with Britain for the Missile contract.
</P>
<P>
British Defense Secretary Michael Portillo was in Kuwait
Saturday, the day before Millon arrived.
</P>
<P>
During the talks between Millon and Kuwaiti Defense Minister
Sheikh Ahmed al-Humoud, the latter said that Kuwait will obtain
French patrol boats in 1998, but he added a decision on the
purchase of missiles will be taken later after thorough studies.
</P>
<P>
Humoud described the British and French missiles as "the best
in the world."
</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 Gulf War, when Kuwait was liberated from a
seven-month Iraqi occupation, Kuwait has signed 10-year defense
agreements with its major allies, the United States, France,
Britain and Russia. These cover weapons purchases and joint
maneuvers.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Foreign Minister Leaves for Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati today left here for Kuwait to hold talks with
Kuwaiti officials on strengthening bilateral relations and
exchange views on the latest developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA in a short report said
Velayati's two-day visit is taking place at the invitation of his
Kuwaiti counterpart Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah. His last trip
to Kuwait was in May 1993.
</P>
<P>
Some diplomats believe that Velayati is on a secret mission to
ask Kuwait for mediation between his country and the United States.
</P>
<P>
In their opinion, the Iranian foreign minister is trying to
convince the U.S. officials to soften their anti-Iran policy with
the help of Kuwaiti officials.
</P>
<P>
Some observers here even said that there is a likelihood of
secret contacts between Iranian officials and American officials
in Kuwait because of the good relations between Kuwait and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Despite the hostile relations between Iran and the U.S., the
two government officials have kept secrete contacts.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani sent
a message to U.S. President Bill Clinton's Administration,
urging Americans to be more rational and well-informed with
regard to Iran.
</P>
<P>
"I do not see any reason for the U.S. action except their lack
of information about Iran. They were not informed about Iran
before or after the revolution," Rafsanjani said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Rafsanjani is trying to cool down the
growing tension between the United States and Iran by calling the
U.S. to be more rational on one hand and telling his citizens that
the U.S. threat is insignificant and they should not resort to
radical stands on the other.
</P>
<P>
In this way, Iran could avoid the danger of potential military
confrontation between the two sides.

JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Swazis are stocking up
essential foodstuffs this week in preparation for a planned
strike, the South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision to stage a national strike on January 22 was made
by the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU) yesterday
after the Swaziland police stopped a mass meeting of workers in
Manzini, the second largest city of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The aborted meeting, also attended by a large number of
anti-government political movement members, was called by SFTU's

Prime Minister Prince Msilini that it would be illegal.
</P>
<P>
The SFTU is trying to force the government to scrap a ban on
public meetings and to end the non-party system of Swaziland
government.

Msilini recently announced that no public meetings be held
during the two-month "Incwala" period.
</P>

He said that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher came

<P>
For the first time, the Syrians are voicing interest in
economic subjects, he said.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho's King Moshoeshoe Killed In Car Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The death of Lesotho's
head of state King Moshoeshoe II was announced in a radio
broadcast to the Basotho nation this afternoon by Prime Minister
Ntsu Mokhele.
</P>
<P>
He said the king was killed in a road accident in the Maluti
mountains this morning, but gave no details.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred between the villages of Ha Noha and
Marakabei in the Mantsonyane area of the Maseru district, after
the king visited some of his cattle posts in the mountain
area, according to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mokhele announced the lowering of flags at half
mast at all public buildings in Lesotho and declared the country
to be in a state of mourning until the king's burial.
</P>
<P>
A date for the funeral has not been announced.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the heir apparent to the Lesotho throne,
Crown Prince David Mohato, will succeed his father as king.
</P>
<P>
The king's wife, Queen Mamohato Seeiso, will act as regent
until the college of chiefs has appointed a successor.
</P>
<P>
News of the tragedy was also conveyed officially to foreign
diplomats to the mountain kingdom.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese diplomat told Xinhua on telephone he had officially
been informed by Lesotho authorities about the accident, adding
the king's chauffeur, so far unidentified, had also been killed
when the car they were travelling in veered off the road and went
down a hillside.
</P>
<P>
He said the king had risen early and had left his residence
before 1 am for Thabatseka to inspect cattle posts he owned
there.
</P>
<P>
It was still dark when the king started the return journey.
Near Marakabei, the car failed to make a corner and veered out of
control and went down a hill. The king and his driver were killed
instantly, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
King Moshoeshoe is survived by Queen Mamohato and two sons,
Crown Prince Mohato and Prince Seeiso.

<P>
He married Princess Abitha Masentle, daughter of late chief
Lerotholi Mojela, in 1962.

<HEADLINE> UN Talks on Land Mines Resume in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. conference on limiting or
banning the use of land mines resumed today in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is a follow-up to the first session of the
conference from September 25 to October 13, 1995 in Vienna, which
aims to revise a 1980 convention that bans or limits such weapons
like land mines which are estimated to kill or injure about 20,000
civilians worldwide each year.
</P>
<P>
During the Vienna session, a number of proposals had been made
ranging from a total ban on production and use of land mines to
measures to toughen existing restrictions. However, due to
disagreements over numerous technical details, the delegates
failed to reach a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
Johan Molander, chairman of the conference, told a background
briefing Monday in Geneva that a total ban of land mines is still
unacceptable to the majority of parties.
</P>
<P>
During the Geneva session, which will be held on January 15-19
and reconvened from April 22 to May 3, attention is expected to
center on proposals to extend the scope of the treaty to internal
conflicts, to ban mines like plastic mines that are extremely
difficult to detect.
</P>
<P>
The delegates from the 50 member states of the 1980 convention
would also make efforts to agree on a time limit within which
mines should be designed to self-destruct.

<HEADLINE> Mandela To Meet Zulu King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (Xinhua)-- South African President
Nelson Mandela today confirmed that he would hold talks with Zulu
King Goodwill Zwelithini on January 19 in a bid to end violence
in Kwazulu/Natal Province.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement from the Presidential Office in
Pretoria, the one-to-one meeting between Mandela and the king was
broached at and unanimously supported by the consultation the
president held on December 15 last year with Kwazulu/Natal
traditional leaders.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Friday's meeting, proposed by the king,
would likely to be part of a "gathering of Zulus".
</P>
<P>
However, Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi would not attend the proposed meeting.
</P>
<P>
Mandela intended, after this meeting, to hold further
discussions with Buthelezi and the leader of the African National
Congress (ANC) in Kwazulu/Natal Jacob Zuma on the steps required
to normalise the situation in the province, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The president hopes to meet the king once more, accompanied
by Mangosuthu Buthelezi," it added.
</P>
<P>
Mandela and Buthelezi reportedly discussed the gathering of
Zulus at a recent meeting, raising hopes of renewed efforts to
promote national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he was confident the meeting and other
initiatives would help bring an end to the violence in
Kwazulu/Natal, ensure free political activities and the optimum
implementation of reconstruction and development projects in the
province.
</P>
<P>
He also repeated his call on the people of Kwazulu/Natal to
embrace peace and tolerance.
</P>
<P>
While commending the security forces for the work they had
done thus far, Mandela further called on them to intensify the
program aimed at eradicating the violence, including systematic
action to bring the perpetrators to book.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the political violence in Kwazulu/Natal
between the supporters of the ANC and the IFP had claimed lives
of more than 14,000 people in the past few years. enditem

SINGAPORE, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Diplomats in Singapore can
communicate with the Foreign Ministry of Singapore electronically
through a new computer network called the Diplomats Network
starting Tuesday, the ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The Diplomats Network, or "Dipnet" for short, is the electronic
linkage between diplomatic missions in Singapore and the Foreign
Ministry and serves to enhance communication links between the
diplomatic missions and the ministry, it said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to being an electronic mailing system, special
features have been created to allow the diplomatic missions to
transmit via the Dipnet various requests to the Protocol
Directorate, such as booking airport VIP rooms and seeking private
aircraft clearance to overfly or land in Singapore, the ministry
added.
</P>
<P>
Besides being the link between the diplomatic missions and the
Foreign Ministry, the Dipnet can also function as an electronic
link among the diplomatic missions themselves, it said, adding
that now diplomatic missions can look forward to greater ease of
communication with all or individual members of the diplomatic
corps.

<HEADLINE> Two Shuttle Astronauts Perform Spacewalk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- For six hours and a half
earlier today, two astronauts imitated the assembly of an
international space station in open space in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
The first spacewalk, during the first space shuttle flight of
the year, took place about 320 kilometers above the Earth while
Endeavour was flying some 28,000 kilometers an hour.
</P>
<P>
Leroy Chiao and Daniel Barry unfolded and mounted a 5.3-meter
hinged aluminum beam across Endeavour's open cargo bay to serve as
a cable try, and then attached a 6-meter cable to the beam.
</P>
<P>
The two first-time spacewalkers were evaluating new
construction tools and modified spacesuits designed for the Alpha
international space station to be constructed from November 1997.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
has planned 250 hours of spacewalks per year, mainly by American
astronauts, in the peak of the assembly work around 1999.
</P>
<P>
Chiao will go outside Endeavour on Wednesday with Winston
Scott, another member of the shuttle's six-member crew.
</P>
<P>
But before the second spacewalk, the crew will have to retrieve
a 10-million-dollar NASA satellite released early Sunday for
nearly 48 hours of free flight and experiments.
</P>
<P>
Endeavour and its crew will return to Kennedy Space Center in
Cape Canaveral, Florida, on January 20, or nine days after the
spacecraft took off from the shuttle home base.

<HEADLINE> Rains Expected To Save National Crop In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Although most parts of Zimbabwe
received low rains in the past two days, these were enough to
save crops from severe moisture stress, a meteorological office
official said today.
</P>
<P>
The official said that most parts of Zimbabwe received rains
of below 10 millimetres, with some areas in the eastern highlands
reporting a rainfall of 109 mm on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The tropical cyclone, which was confined to the Mozambique
channel, has now moved inland into Tete Province, causing some
heavy rains over the eastern highlands of Zimbabwe, according
to the official.
</P>
<P>
Indications are that it will continue to be cloudy and wet
over the eastern highlands while the rest of the country will
continue to get low rains, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe desperately needs good, widespread rains to ensure
farmers do not lose most of their crops.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean farmers warned last week that unless it rained in
the next fortnight, most of the early planted crops would be a
write-off, forcing many farmers to embark on an expensive
replanting exercise.

<P>
SINGAPORE, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Ministers, international
business leaders and trade experts are to gather in Singapore on
April 24-26 for the first world trade congress to discuss world
trade issues, organizers of the congress said here today.
</P>
<P>
At the world trade congress, the international business
community will be given a rare opportunity to lend its voice on
the future of world trade, the organizers, the International
Herald Tribune (IHT) and the Singapore Trade Development Board
(TDB), said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong will open the congress
with participants coming from the World Trade Organization (WTO),
the United States, Canada, Sweden, the European Union, Brazil,
Australia, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Brunei, and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The IHT and the TDB said the world trade congress is to be held
with an aim at helping shape the World Trade Organization's agenda
before its inaugural ministerial conference in Singapore in
December this year.
</P>
<P>
Topping the congress agenda are post-Uruguay Round issues and
concerns such as the prospects for trade in an era of
multilateralism, the practical implications of trading in the
post-GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) order, the
challenges faced by the WTO and the exciting business
opportunities opening up in the fast growing Asia Pacific region,
according to the organizers.

<HEADLINE> Makwetu Reportedly Leaves PAC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (Xinhua)-- The President of the Pan
Africanist Congress (PAC) of South Africa, Clarence Makwetu, had
abandoned the party, leaving unpaid bills and other debts behind
him, a senior PAC official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu had taken all his belongings to Cape Town, leaving his
"presidential car" behind and his Johannesburg home empty, said
one of the PAC National Executive Committee (NEC) member who
refused to be named.
</P>
<P>
"He has left his responsibilities," said the official.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu's unexpected departure had sent morale among party
Executive Committee members plummeting and was the reason for
yesterday's resignation of Secretary-General Maxwell
Nemadzivhanani and Administrator Irene Khumalo.
</P>
<P>
PAC's NEC members had tracked Makwetu to Cape Town and had
asked him to meet them at the party's Johannesburg headquarters
at 10 am today. Makwetu had not arrived by 3 pm.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Makwetu's departure, the PAC official said Makwttu
was "destroying the image of the PAC", and he should have
resigned and made way for someone else.
</P>
<P>
Makwetu had apparently lost enthusiasm after PAC's poor
showing in the recent local government elections had diminished
his popularity within the upper echelons of the party, added the
official. enditem

Earlier today, Dutch Foreign Minister Hans Van Mierlo opened

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Industrial Body Accuses S.Africa Of Insincerity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's largest industrial body
today accused South Africa of acting in bad faith by delaying to
agree to proposals aimed at rescuing current trade talks from
collapse.
</P>
<P>
Confederation of Zmbabwe Industries (CZI) Chief Executive Joe
Foroma said that hopes for an early conclusion in talks, which have
been held for the past two years, had been dashed by lack of progress
since the collapse of the round of negotiations last November.
</P>
<P>
"These discussions have virtually come to a nought and we are not
likely to have an agreement in the near future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that to reach a trade agreement with South Africa
appears to be something in the distance. The South African
partners have not displayed in the discussions good faith, Foroma added.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have battled for more than two years to update
the 1964 trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
Among other concessions, Zimbabwe reportedly wanted duty free
status and reduced tariffs for a range of locally made goods.
</P>
<P>
But South African manufacturers -- led by those in the textile and
clothing sector-- have vehemently resisted any attempts to give
preferential treatment to their Zimbabwean counterparts, he said.
</P>
<P>
''We have to take immediate steps to address the situation, to
help local industries and explore new markets,'' Foroma said, adding
moves by the government to rationalise the tariff system would go a
long way towards assisting manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's manufacturers are complaining of punitive tariffs on
raw materials and spares, which they say were higher than those
levied on imported finished goods.

BRUSSELS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A Europe-Asia forum to

this year.
</P>
<P>
The two-day forum in Venice, Italy, organized by the European

closer by "identifying how their ties can be strengthened on the
political, trade, economic and cultural fronts," said a EU
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Talks will be held on issues including the exchange of
technology, solutions to problems in Asia, unity and diversity in
Asia, understanding of Asian values and religion and progress.
</P>
<P>
The forum will pave the way for the first summit meeting of
European and Asian nations in Bangkok in March.
</P>
<P>
The EU spokesman said that this unprecedented initiative was
part of the European Union's new Asia strategy endorsed by the
European Parliament last June.
</P>

<HEADLINE> EC Report on Environment Program Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Manufacturing industry has
made most progress on the environment, while agriculture and
tourism have made the least, a European Commission report says.
</P>
<P>
Progress has also been made on the reduction of ozone depleting
substances, emissions of heavy metals and sulphur dioxide,
improvements in human approach to nature protection, surface water
quality, industry-related risks and wastes, says the report on the
EC's Policy Program on the Environment and Sustainable Development.
</P>
<P>
Awareness of exhaust emission and fuel quality in transport
is increasing but progress has been offset by the rise in the
number of vehicles on the road.
</P>
<P>
But the report says special attention still needs to be paid to
improving the human approach to climate changes, acidification,
noise pollution and air quality as well as to mapping out a
comprehensive strategy for underground and surface water resources.
</P>
<P>
The EC's Program, known as the "Fifth Action Program", covers
the period 1992-2000 and forms the basis of the environment policy
for the European Union.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Sheikh Hasina, president of the
largest Bangladeshi opposition party -- the Awami (people's)
League, today reiterated her demand for immediate resignation of
the prime minister and a congenial atmosphere for general
elections with the constitution of a neutral caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a big public meeting at Kanchan, several dozens of
kilometers south of Dhaka, the former opposition leader in
parliament said, "We want peace and stability in the country and
the accountability of the party in power."
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday, Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia had an
emergency meeting with government ministers and decided on a
proposal for setting up an advisory council headed by the
president in a bid to resolve the country's political crisis.
</P>
<P>
But the meeting agreed that if the opposition finally stays out
of the upcoming elections, the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP) will have no option but to join the February 15 election to
maintain the constitutional and democratic process in the country.
</P>
<P>
Hasina said that the Awami League would continue its movement
till the realization of the demand for elections under a neutral
caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
The Awami League and other mainstream opposition parties have
announced a dawn-to-dusk general strike across the country on

<HEADLINE> mee011514hke --Mubarak: Egypt, U.S. to Speed up Joint Efforts to  Promote Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
who met with U.S. Vice President Al Gore here today, said the two
countries have agreed to speed up joint efforts to promote
bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak called on Egyptian and U.S. businessmen to cooperate to
facilitate the transfer of American technology to Egypt, which he
described as the the essence of the Partnership for Economic
Growth and Development, initiated by Mubarak and Gore in September
1994.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with Gore, Mubarak said that
several hurdles that were hindering foreign investment in Egypt
have been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to iron out all other obstacles within the
coming few months," the president said after his meeting with
Gore. The meeting later was attended by members of the
Egyptian-U.S. Presidential Council, an offshoot of the partnership
agreement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak expressed hope that there will be more U.S. investment
in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Gore, who arrived here early this morning on a one-day visit,
told the press conference that the leading political role played
by Egypt in the region necessitates it to assume a leading
economic role.
</P>
<P>
He praised Mubarak for his efforts to develop the Egyptian
economy and speed up the process of privatization, pledging
U.S. support for Egypt's economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Egypt reshuffled its cabinet in a move
apparently aimed at quickening the pace of the economic reform.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet led by Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri
promised to increase production and create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency quoted an official source at the
Foreign Ministry as saying that the Egyptian-U.S. Presidential
Council have put forward proposals to Mubarak and Gore on the
future economic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Edward Walker said Sunday that joint
investment projects are expected to increase and the size of
U.S. assistance to Egypt will remain unchanged within the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the second-biggest recipient of assistance extended by
Washington, receives 2.1 billion U.S. dollars in aid a
year. Egypt is a main U.S. ally in the region.
</P>
<P>
Gore, who also met with Prime Minister Ganzouri today, will
leave for Israel later today. He then travels to Tunisia.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Names Yegorov as Top Aide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today named his personal aide Nikolai Yegorov as director of the
presidential office.
</P>
<P>
The presidential press service said Yegorov, sacked by Yeltsin
as nationalities minister after mishandling a Chechen
hostage-taking raid in southern Russia last June, had replaced
Sergei Filatov as director of the presidential office. Filatov
quit the influential post last week.
</P>
<P>
Yegorov's appointment was announced the same day Russian
troops stormed a village in southern Russia, in which some 200
Chechen rebels were holding about 100 hostages.
</P>
<P>
Yegorov, 44, was made Yeltsin's personal aide on national
policy after he lost the post of nationalities minister. He had
kept a low profile since then.
</P>
<P>
The director of the presidential office, or chief of staff,
has huge influence in the Kremlin and the post's importance will
increase if Yeltsin decides to run for re-election in the June 16
presidential election.

<HEADLINE> '96 College Graduates Face Better Job Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Some 866,000 students to
graduate from universities and colleges this summer face better
employment opportunities than those who graduated last year,
sources at the State Education Commission (SEC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The SEC made this remark based on an analysis made at a
coordination meeting on exchanging information concerning college
graduates and job opportunities, held January 13 and 14 in Wuhan
City in central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by representatives of more than 200
universities and colleges and nearly 1,000 employers. It also
discussed demands for college graduates by some key state-owned
large and medium-sized enterprises, scientific research institutes
and universities.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 6,000 college graduates will work in more than
400 of the above-mentioned units, according to the SEC plan.
</P>
<P>
Each province, municipality and autonomous region will hold
meetings to help job-seeking college students meet employers
during the winter vacation, which will falls in January and
February.
</P>
<P>
The SEC Deputy Director Zhou Yuanqing said the government will
basically be responsible for job assignment this year, as most '96
college graduates have received their college education at state
expense.
</P>
<P>
There should be rules to guide the activities of would-be
college graduates in the job market, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Tuition fees used to be paid by the Chinese government, which
assigned jobs to college graduates. But some students had to pay
the fees from 1994. Freshmen in over 30 colleges and universities
in that year became the first group of students in China who had
to pay part of their college education costs. Students who pay are
allowed to seek their own jobs when they graduate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, nearly 20,000 college seniors visited the Capital
Stadium in Beijing a couple of weeks ago to take part in a talent
fair designed to link job seekers and potential employers.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 students who expect to graduate in 1996 from
93 Beijing-based institutions of higher learning took part in
civil service examinations held by the Beijing Municipal
Government yesterday.
</P>
<P>
A record 895,000 students graduated from colleges and
universities in 1995. Almost all of them had found jobs before
graduation.

<HEADLINE> Social Sciences Face Chance and Challenge: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior official said here
today that China's social sciences sector is facing tough
challenges, though its future is rosy.
</P>
<P>
Wang Renzhi, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences (CASS), which has long been guided by Marxism, admitted
that the basic theories of Marxism are being challenged by many
factors, and urged scholars to strengthen their studies in various
fields in an effort to uphold and carry forward Marxist doctrine.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at CASS's annual working meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting received telephone congratulations from Ding
Guangen, head of the Propaganda Department of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Wang asked research fellows to produce convincing research
results which can solve problems emerging in the reform and
opening-up drive, a great experiment being carried out by a
socialist country.
</P>
<P>
An urgent job to be done is to organize a group of scholars to
strengthen the study of Marxist basic theories as well as the
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics set
forth by Deng Xiaoping, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed that CASS will encourage bold exploration in
academic fields, and always distinguish between political issues
and academic ones, so as to safeguard academic freedom.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, Wang reiterated the famous slogan of "Letting
A Hundred Flowers Blossom And A Hundred Schools of Thought
Contend", which was a policy of the late Chairman Mao Zedong for
promoting the progress of the arts and sciences, and for the
development of a flourishing culture.
</P>
<P>
CASS, the country's top liberal and social sciences research
center, has also promulgated a development plan for the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the institute will build itself into a
stronghold of Marxism, and will serve as an assistant and advisor
to the Party Central Committee and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
To reach this goal it will carry out 178 research programs in
the fields of the basic theories of Marxism, Deng Xiaoping's
theories, and the theories regarding reform and opening-up,
socialist ethics building, international affairs and other basic
subjects.
</P>
<P>
Wang revealed that the fund for CASS is expected to rise by
10 to 15 percent annually in the coming five years.

experts will be trained and a high-speed information network will
be built at the academy.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the social sciences sector has an arduous task
of providing theoretical and intellect support for the socialist
material and ethics progress.

JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- King Moshoeshoe II of
Lesotho was killed in a car accident this morning, diplomats from
the country's High Commission in South Africa confirmed this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The car accident occurred in the Maluti Mountain at about 9:00
am when the 58-year-old king was traveling from his royal village
in Matsieng to Maseru, said the high commission spokesman Tsaka
Semoko.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen to Enhance Economic Ties with Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The city government of this
first special economic zone in China, located in the southern
province of Guangdong, is working on a new plan to boost economic
co-operation with Hong Kong, a senior city official said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the second council meeting of the Foundation for
Promoting the Economic Development of Shenzhen and Hong Kong,
Vice-Mayor Li Decheng called on advisers and members of the
council to take an active part in improving the plan.
</P>
<P>
The foundation, set up by Hong Kong businessmen with 10 million
Hong Kong dollars, has become a very influential non-governmental
organization. More than 60 Hong Kong celebrities and specialists
are acting as its advisers. Li was elected president of the
foundation
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting will mainly discuss ways to step up
economic expansion along the Shenzhen River.
</P>
<P>
Li said growing personnel and material exchanges between
Shenzhen and Hong Kong have made his city the busiest port in
China, and, as a result, the country is getting more closely tied
in with the world economy.
</P>
<P>
He noted that sustained economic co-operation between the two
cities will help maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability as
well as the momentum of economic growth of Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s Shenzhen has been grown into a "backyard
factory" for Hong Kong in terms of its industrial development, and
investment from Hong Kong has become a major source of funds for
Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Besides, there are broad co-operation ties in the fields of
trade and infrastructure such as ports, transportation, energy and
telecommunications.

<HEADLINE> Israel Weighs Results of Christopher's Shuttle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres held a meeting Sunday night of the eight-member Political
Forum to weigh the results of U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher's achievements in his renewed efforts to push Israel
and Syria to reach an early agreement.
</P>
<P>
Christopher concluded his four-day Middle East shuttle
diplomacy Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Although Christopher left behind his assessment that he was
confident in a peace deal this year, senior officials here seem in
doubt. Yossi Beilin, minister at the Prime Minister's Office,
expressed reservations about the chances of an early peace with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
If a breakthrough with Damascus is not achieved within the
next two weeks or so, Beilin said in a television interview Sunday
night that there will not be peace this year.
</P>
<P>
Major Israeli newspapers also express their skepticism about
the real intentions of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz, in a commentary published Sunday, said al-Assad sent
Christopher from Damascus back to Israel with what it called
"three no's", namely, no accelerating the pace of the talks, no
holding of meetings at the senior political level, and a partial
no to the format suggested by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Ahronot, another Hebrew daily, said that Christopher had
returned from Damascus with a vague summary statement and very few
achievements in hand.
</P>
<P>
As if to confirm Israel's belief, Syria's official Al-Thawra
daily said Sunday that Syria would not be pressured by the
approach of Israel's general elections to accept a peace deal that
did not meet its full demands.
</P>
<P>
"We (Syrians) are not governed by the time factor, nor will work
under pressure to rush after solutions which are mutilated or not
well-cooked," it said.

HAIKOU, January 15 (Xinhua) -- South China's Hainan Province
will take a series of measures to expand its agricultural
co-operation with Taiwan, said Du Qinglin, vice-secretary of the
provincial Party committee and chairman of the Provincial People's
Congress Standing Committee at a meeting held here recently.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the province has attracted large numbers of

date, the total sum of investment has surpassed 100 million US
dollars in 150 agriculture enterprises funded by Taiwanese.
</P>
<P>
Du also said that in the future co-operation, the province will
mainly introduce fine seed strains and the advanced techniques of
raising seedlings and sugarcanes from Taiwan and carrying out
flower and vegetable projects, while sparing no efforts in
training farmers, agriculture technical staffs and officials at
the grassroots level.
</P>
<P>
Through agricultural co-operation, sectors of tropical crops
planting, poultry raising, marine breeding and fishing, and farm
products processing are all expected to be improved, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Strengthens Inspection of Export Coal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINHUANGDAO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- China has spared no efforts
to strengthen the inspection of coal for export to help promote
its quality over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, some 65,000 tons of coal for export were found to be
below standard and barred from export.
</P>
<P>
This city in north China's Hebei Province is China's largest
coal export port. Some 14 million tons of coal, or more than 70
percent of the country's total, are exported through the port
annually.
</P>
<P>
"The inspection level will have a direct impact on China's
image in the world coal market and on the image of its quality
inspection worldwide," said an official with the local bureau for
the inspection of import and export commodities.
</P>
<P>
The local inspection bureau has imported advanced sampling and
analyzing equipment from abroad, and actively trained and
introduced professionals to make sure China's inspection level
attains the advanced world level.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, foreign companies have raised objections
to the country's inspection findings in this respect nine times,
but China won all the nine lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
China's inspection bureau has also provided improved services
for the companies over recent years by decreasing unnecessary
processes and introducing computers to the field.
</P>
<P>
An ambitious plan forecasts that by the end of this century,
the Qinhuangdao port will handle 35 million tons of coal for
export every year.

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM Predicts Progress in Months if Israel is Serious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara said here today that the Middle East peace process would
proceed on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks in months if "Israel is
serious and committed to the basis of the peace process."
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Lebanese leaders, al-Shara told a press
conference that the Syrian and Lebanese tracks are "interlocked
and inseparable."
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on a statement made by Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres about possible early elections in the Jewish
state, al-Shara noted that this issue is an "Israeli affair," and
the Syrian leaders did not discuss the Israeli elections with
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher who visited Damascus
last week.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the American side, as one of the co-sponsors of the
(Middle East) peace process, is serious in accelerating the peace
process and intensifying the negotiations between the Syrian and
Israeli sides," the Syrian minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We also sensed from the Israeli side, especially from the
statements made by Peres, that it still gives the priority to the
peace much more than what is given to the elections," he added.
</P>
<P>
On relations between the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, he
reiterated that Lebanon is negotiating by itself and there is no
others negotiating on behalf of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian minister arrived here earlier in the day to brief
Lebanese leaders on the outcome of Christopher's Middle East
tour.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President and Chairman
of the Central Military Commission Jiang Zemin has signed a decree
putting into effect the Regulations on Military Supplies of the
Chinese People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
The regulations are the first comprehensive law on military
supplies since the founding of the People's Republic in
1949. Earlier, China had enacted some partial provisions to ensure
military supplies.
</P>
<P>
However, military supplies have to meet the demand of strategic
military principles in the new era and the development of a
socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the theories of Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping and
Jiang Zemin on the building up of the armed forces, the
regulations stipulate the basic tasks and principles of military
supply work as well as the responsibilities of military supply
departments.
</P>
<P>
The basic tasks of military supply work are to ensure supplies
of military materials and food for the armed forces, organize
agricultural and sideline production, and improve the relevant
training, scientific research and equipment.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Chinese king Wearing Gold, Jade Garments Unearthed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists have unearthed a
Chinese king wearing jade garments sewn with gold thread from a
2,170-year-old royal tomb which was chiseled deep into a rocky
mountain in China's eastern province of Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
The clothes made of 4,000 pieces of extremely thin jade
plaques, sewn with gold thread and decorated with gold flowers and
gold buttons was worn by prince Liu Wu, the third king of the
State of Chu in the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-24 AD) when he was
buried in a tomb which was dug 117 meters inside Lion Mountain on
the outskirts of Xuzhou, a city in northern Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists said that they had to clear away 16 heavy rocks
-- each of which weighed seven tons and used as deterrents to tomb
robbery -- before they were able to enter its 70-meter-long tomb
tunnel.
</P>
<P>
Passing through the tomb tunnel, archaeologists entered a patio
about 20 meters long, 13 meters wide and 11 meters high. "It was
the first time a large patio had been found in a Han tomb."
Researchers held that the patio was built to prevent tomb robbery.
</P>
<P>
"The jade clothes were the finest and the most precious shroud
ever excavated in the world," researchers from the State Bureau of
Cultural Relics said.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists found four huge buttons made of pure gold on the
belts of the jade clothes. "The heaviest gold button weighs 390
grams," a researcher noted.
</P>
<P>
Researchers have been fascinated by the exotic artistic design
on the gold buttons, which features two greedy bears tearing a
galloping horse. "This indicates that the gold belts originated in
Central Asia -- new evidence of early exchanges between Central
China and Central Asia," a researcher said.
</P>
<P>
Buried along with the jade clothes, archaeologists also found
in the tomb chamber 176,000 ancient coins, more than 200 official
seals, 200 jade objects, a hoard of ancient weapons and about
1,500 gold, silver, copper, iron, jade, pottery, lacquer, bone and
other kinds of ancient relics.
</P>
<P>
Among the 200 official seals were 150 made of copper, five made
of silver and over 90 made of clay."It is rare that so many
official seals and stamps were excavated in such large quantities
in China," researchers said. "We will learn a lot about the
political system, history and geography of the period from the
seals."
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists said the unearthed 200 jade wares include discs,
rings, pillows, dancers, cicadas and leopards, all made of jade.
</P>
<P>
Over 10 years ago, archaeologists excavated two huge pits
containing some 3,000 terracotta soldiers and horses about 500
meters east of the tomb. "It is the second largest terracotta army
next only to the terracotta army of China's first emperor Qin Shi
Huang's tomb near the ancient Chinese capital city of Xi'an,"
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
Around the Chu royal tomb, archaeologists have discovered more
pits containing pottery soldiers, chariots and royal family
members, which await excavation in the future.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Chechen rebels, in apparent
support of their besieged comrades holding hostages in the
Daghestani village of Pervomaiskoye, launched attacks against
government buildings and a hospital in Grozny today.
</P>
<P>
A powerful explosion rocked central Grozny, the capital of the
breakaway Russian republic of Chechnya, this afternoon but there
were no immediate reports of casualties or damage to property.
The explosion reportedly took place near the Kosmos cinema.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Russian Interior Ministry said that armed
Chechen rebels penetrated Grozny and attempted to attack Interior
Ministry buildings and the No.9 hospital in the Promyslovksy
district of the city.
</P>
<P>
He said all Interior Ministry forces had been mobilized to
guard public buildings.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Russian troops began a storm operation to
free some 100 hostages held by Chechen rebels in the southern
Russian village of Pervomaiskoye near the Chechen border with the
Russian autonomous region of Daghestan.
</P>
<P>
Government sources said that the first phase of the storm
operation had been completed as government troops forced their way
into the village proper after breaking through the rebels'
defenses on the outskirts.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin held a special
meeting to discuss the situation at Pervomaiskoye and the storm
operation with Oleg Lobov, secretary of the Russian Security
Council and presidential envoy to Chechnya, Defense Minister Pavel
Grachev, Finance Minister Vladimir Panskov and other senior
officials.
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, Yeltsin hoped the storm
operation will be over within the day and won't lead to the loss
of civilian lives.
</P>
<P>
More than 120 people died last June when Russian troops twice
tried to storm a hospital in Budennovsk, a town in southern
Russia, to iron out another hostage crisis caused by the Chechen
rebels.

<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
told a group of US senators here this afternoon that China and the
United States should build a normal, stable and constructive
relationship.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Jiang said, the two countries should first
strictly observe the three Sino-US joint communiques, secondly
adhere to the principles of mutual respect and equality and of
seeking common ground while reserving differences, and thirdly
handle the Taiwan issue with great care.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks when receiving US senators
Dianne Feinstein, Sam Nunn and John Glenn at Zhongnanhai,
headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee
and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that, as two large countries of major importance in
the world, China and the United States should handle their
relations from a strategic height and the perspectives of the
overall world situation and the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to see a new development of its relations with the
United States in the new year, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Jiang extended a welcome to the senators
and expressed his appreciation for their long-term support for the
growth of Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
The US Congress plays a very important role in making US
policies concerning both domestic and foreign affairs, Jiang said,
and it can also do a great deal to help improve Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
The president said that more and more US congress members have
come to understand the importance of Sino-US relations. China
welcomes more members of the US Congress to visit China and do
more to help promote bilateral relations, and mutual understanding
and friendship among the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said that the US and China share many common
interests, and they should strive to build up a positive strategic
framework for bilateral relations. They should have more contacts
and dialogues so as to increase mutual understanding, and reduce
and remove misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
Nunn said the US people support the development of US-China
relations. They are pleased with the achievements the Chinese
people have made and they do not favor imposing any containment
policy on China.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite differences on some issues, the US and
China share broad common interests on many major issues, which are
far more important than the differences between them.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the two countries should try to expand
their common interests and keep their differences from obstructing
the progress of bilateral relations. He said that this is in line
with their fundamental interests.
</P>
<P>
Glenn said he hoped that US-China relations would achieve
further and continued growth.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meeting, Chi Haotian, state councillor and
minister of national defence, also met with the delegation, which
arrived here January 13 at the invitation of the Chinese People's
Institute of Foreign Affairs.

<HEADLINE> Britain May Join U.S. Spy Satellite Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain is planning to join the
United States in developing a new range of spy satellites designed
to improve the detection of military threats, according to a local
press report.
</P>
<P>
But the 100 million pound (150 million U.S. dollars) entry fee
the Americans are asking could be a barrier to Britain joining the
U.S. project quickly.
</P>
<P>
Top secret discussions have been underway for some months
between senior British and American military officials, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
British defense and intelligence chiefs believe the new
satellites, which will provide color pictures, are the key to
protecting national security in the next century, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The British government hopes that participation in the
U.S. project will give Britain instant and automatic access to the
best satellite imagery available, an intelligence source said.
</P>
<P>
"This will not just help us deal with the new threats that are
emerging all over the world," he said, "it will also keep us as a
major player on the international scene."
</P>
<P>
The new range of satellites, codenamed the 8X, can cover eight
times more territory in a single sweep than the current system.
</P>
<P>
As the project is short of money, the Americans are expected
to welcome British investment. But the 100 million pounds (150
million U.S. dollars) cost could be a barrier to swift agreement,
it added.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian troops who stormed the
village of Pervomaiskoye early today to rescue some 100 hostages
held by Chechen rebels, have forced their way into the village.
</P>
<P>
The storm operation started at 09:00 Moscow time (06:00 GMT)
and airborne assaults were followed by missile and artillery
attacks, according to reports reaching here.
</P>

Aircraft and special task units of the Federal Security Service
and the Interior Ministry are cutting short all attempts by the
terrorists to break through to the mosque and the school where
hostages are kept."

<P>
But the Chechen rebels, estimated at about 250, "are putting up
fierce resistance", he said.

reports about the execution of (Russian) policemen and
(Daghestani) elders had been confirmed," the spokesman said.

Earlier reports said that one Russian serviceman was killed
during the operation, but there were no reports about the level of
hostage or rebel casualties.

<HEADLINE> Bank of China Unveils Plan for 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China, the
country's major foreign exchange bank, will make greater efforts
this year to bring its practices more in line with accepted
international standards, a top bank official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national meeting attended by the heads of the
bank's subsidiaries, President Wang Xuebing said that his bank
will this year opt for intensive growth in both capital and assets.
</P>
<P>
"We will strive to cut our bank's proportion of bad loans in
yuan, the local currency, by one percentage point and that in
foreign exchange by 0.5 percentage points this year so as to
create conditions for the introduction of the asset-liability
management mode," Wang told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The bank will also take measures to reform its credit
management system in a bid to guard against risk exposures, the
president said, adding that a credit management department will be
established this year at the head office in order to separate
financial business activities from supervision.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that efforts will also be made to set up a safe,
efficient and unified payment and settlement system as well as a
risk-proof internal capital highway.
</P>
<P>
Also this year, the bank will draft detailed rules on
foreign-funded ventures being integrated into the foreign exchange
surrender system, whereby domestic enterprises are obliged to sell
all of their foreign exchange earnings to the central bank,
according to the president.
</P>
<P>
Wang pledged that his bank will this year continue to support
the reform of state-owned enterprises, especially large ones
and enterprise groups. He also said that the preparatory work for
establishing subsidiaries in Africa will be launched this year.
</P>
<P>
Data released over the weekend show that the bank's annual
profits reached 10.5 billion yuan (about 1.26 billion US dollars)
last year. Total deposits in yuan and foreign currencies by the end
of December were worth 390.4 billion yuan and 27.09 billion US
dollars, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The bank currently has 519 overseas subsidiaries in 19
countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> UK Business Calls Time on GMT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- British mornings could get
darker but evenings brighter as business leaders back a
parliamentary bill to bring the time into line with European
partners.
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) reported today that
75 percent of its 1,200 member-firms support the shift from GMT to
Western European Time, which will eliminate the time difference
with the country's continental trading partners.
</P>
<P>
But as the change will add an hour of daylight in the evenings
but make the mornings dimmer, firms north of the border in
Scotland are against the move.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders in Britain believe the country suffers heavily
as the existing time difference makes contracts, deals and
business negotiations needlessly more difficult.
</P>
<P>
CBI Director-General Adair Turner said bringing Britain's time
into line with the rest of Europe will be a "boost to
competitiveness and business efficiency".
</P>
<P>
Turner backs the bill, put forward by Bournemouth West MP John
Butterfill, to effect the switch to European time. The bill is
expected to get a second reading this week.
</P>
<P>
In addition to easing communications with countries across the
English Channel, where half of Britain's business activities are
located, lighter evenings will also give the leisure industry a
lift, according to a CBI spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
But the CBI survey found that further north, the support for
the bill is weaker.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of the businesses surveyed in the south
were in favor of the switch whereas in the north, on average 70
percent were for the change.
</P>
<P>
Firms in Scotland, where businesses will be more seriously
affected by the time switch, were 72 percent against, with 28
percent in favor.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Australia Hope for Ties to Be Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today assured his Australian counterpart Paul
Keating that Malaysia would play its part in developing a climate
of cooperation beneficial to both sides and expressed confidence
that Australia would do the same.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner in honor of Keating, Mahathir said the
relations between Malaysia and Australia should be further
developed, and both sides should avoid or at least limit the type
of hiccups which off and on bedevil the ties.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the principle of mutual respect should be adhered
to by all parties if Malaysia and Australia wanted to build and
maintain a strong relationship.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Malaysia and Australia were strained on many
occasions, notably when Keating described Mahathir as
"recalcitrant" for not attending the Seattle APEC informal
Leaders' meeting in 1993.
</P>
<P>
However, Mahathir said he agreed with Keating that there was
need for both sides to remove whatever preconceptions which could
impede a clear view of each other.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Keating's visit represented an important
milestone in the bilateral relations and it also expressed the
common desire of both sides, despite their occasional differences,
to maintain close and cooperative relations.
</P>
<P>
In his turn, Keating said, "The past can no longer be the
primary source of understanding between us. We must work hard to
understand the modern face of our two countries."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his desire to create a new level of mutual
understanding between the peoples of Australia and Malaysia and to
forge a rich and rewarding friendship which will endure into the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
Keating arrived here this afternoon for a three-day official
visit, his first visit to Malaysia since he became prime minister
in 1991, and was officially welcomed by Mahathir at the parliament
square.
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow, the two leaders will hold official talks followed by
witnessing the signing of some agreements and memoranda of
understanding between the two countries' private sectors.

Premier Li Peng have given instructions to the metallurgical
industry on separate occasions.
</P>
<P>
This industry has made marked achievements over the past five
years, Jiang said, attributing this to the efforts of all the

<P>
He expressed the hope that the workers, technicians and
officials in the sector would give full scope to their initiative
and creativity, and make greater contributions to the socialist
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the sector should make a good start in the
upgrading of both its managerial mechanism and mode of growth
in 1996, the first year of the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The sector should accelerate the reform and management of
enterprises, put more emphasis on science and technology to
increase varieties of products, improve quality, lower costs and
consumption, and improve the environment, he said. He added that
priority should be given to major state-run enterprises to improve
the situation of the state-run economic sector.
</P>

has been established in the past five years.
</P>

<HEADLINE> PICC Reports Big Business Growth in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The People's Insurance Company
of China (PICC), China's No.1 insurer, reported a remarkable
business growth over the past year, partly thanks to its improved
management and smooth operation of its restructuring program.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the company show that the PICC posted a total
premium income of 47.623 billion yuan in 1995, a rise of 20.79
percent over the previous year, or 110.34 percent of the year's
target.
</P>
<P>
The figure includes 24.994 billion yuan in domestic property
insurance premium income, 377 million yuan in agricultural
insurance premium income, 15.726 billion yuan in life insurance
premium income and 6.526 billion yuan in overseas business premium
income.
</P>
<P>
The same year also saw a 37.41 percent growth of profits to 884
million yuan. Meanwhile, the company paid a total of 27.487
billion yuan in indemnities.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year the PICC posted a gain of 25.23
billion yuan in premium income.
</P>
<P>
Dai Fengju, the PICC's vice-president, said that in the wake of
intensified competition both at home and abroad, the company
stepped up the reform of its internal structure in the second half
of 1995, and the restructuring is expected to be completed in the
coming summer.
</P>
<P>
According to Dai, who is also the spokesman for the PICC, the
company will be restructured into a state insurance group in line
with international practice, under which reinsurance, life
insurance and non-life insurance will be conducted separately by
three subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
"The subsidiaries, which will start business in the near
future, will take the form of limited-liability companies," Dai
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the PICC will not consider in the near future
accepting overseas insurance companies as its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
He also indicated that the PICC's overseas branches and
institutions will not join the restructuring program.
</P>
<P>
"China has a vast potential insurance market, and the national
premium income is expected to reach 200 billion to 250 billion
yuan by the end of this century," Dai said, "However, the maturing
of the market means that the competition will become stiffer."
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the market share claimed by the PICC, which
used to be more than 90 percent, will gradually shrink as more and
more domestic and foreign insurers join the field.
</P>
<P>
He said that in order to further expand the company's business
and stay on top of the development trend, the PICC will focus its
efforts this year on strengthening management and upgrading its
operational system so as to ensure a further growth of
profits.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Khmer Rouge has moved
several hundred guerrillas to areas around Cambodia's second
largest city in a bid to launch preemptive attacks against an
expected government offensive, the Cambodia Daily reported today .
</P>
<P>
About 300 guerrillas have turned up in the past few days in Ek
Phnom district, northeast of Battambang in western Cambodia,
demanding food and other supplies from villagers, the paper quoted
military intelligence sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
In addition, smaller groups of 40 to 50 guerillas have moved
into Bavel and Banan districts, west of Battambang, and begun
sporadic shelling and sabotage attempts against both military and
civilian targets, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to villagers approached by the Khmer Rouge, the
guerillas said they planned to attack government positions early
next week.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, doctors in government hospitals have been
asking relief agencies to collect and stockpile blood to prepare
for an upcoming offensive, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Many believed that the government operation against the
guerillas will involve nearly all of the 26,000 troops stationed
in Battambang and other northwestern provinces of the country.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands Opens Embassy in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands opened its
embassy in Jordan today, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch embassy was opened by Dutch Foreign Minister Hans Van
Mierlo with the presence of Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok, who is
here on a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch foreign minister praised the kingdom's role and its
continued efforts in establishing peace and stability in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Wim Kok met his Jordanian counterpart Sharif Zeid
Ben Shaker and signed with him a joint declaration on land
transportation and a letter of intent for agreement on protecting
investments in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch Prime Minister also offered a Dutch donation of
medical equipment worth 12 million dollars during his visit to Al
Amar Cancer Center in Amman. Part of the equipment has been
transported here and the remainder will come soon.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein met with the Dutch prime minister and conferred on
him an Al Nahda Medal late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's national news agency, Petra, said Kok's visit
indicates the Dutch willingness to contribute to stability and
peace along with boosting investment in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is among the first Western countries that
launched joint ventures in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
In 1955, Jordan Brewery, which produces Dutch beer Amstel,
was the first commercial venture between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1960, KLM, the royal Dutch airline, was the first
international European airline to embark on a direct flight to
Amman.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch prime minister, who is on the second-leg of his
Middle East tour, will also visit Israel and the Palestinian
self-rule area.

<HEADLINE> One Serviceman Dies As Government Troops Storm Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 15 (Xinhua) -- At least one Russian soldier was
killed today when the government troops tried to storm the Chechen
rebels holding hostages in a southern Russian village.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news service quoted an interior ministry officer
as saying the serviceman was killed more than three hours after
the attack began in Pervomaiskoye to free the hostages who have
been held for almost a week.
</P>
<P>
But the officer gave no detail about casualties among the 200
rebels or the hostages now numbering around 70.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said that the focus of the airborne assault
shifted from the center to the outskirts of Pervomaiskoye, in the
Russian autonomous region of Daghestan.
</P>
<P>
Masked commandos were ferried in by armored personnel carriers
to reinforce the storm operation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian President Boris Yeltsin met his top security
officials and government leaders to discuss the assault by Russian
armed forces on the Chechen rebels, according to Itar-Tass.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the Kremlin meeting ended at noon but gave no
further details.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov and Federal Security Service
Director Mikhail Barsukov are now at Pervomaiskoye in charge of
the storm operation.
</P>
<P>
A presidential spokesman said earlier in the day that the
assault on Pervomaiskoye had had to be launched because any
further delay would have endangered the lives of the hostages held
for almost a week.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen rebels raided a hospital and three apartment
buildings in neighboring Daghestan, an autonomous region of the
Russian Federation, where they rounded up some 3,000 civilians as
hostages.
</P>
<P>
The rebels later released 2,000 hostages and began to retreat
to Chechnya when their convoy of buses was halted by the Russian
troops.
</P>
<P>
This isn't the first time the Chechen rebels have initiated a
hostage crisis in their fight for independence. More than 120
people died last June when Russian troops twice tried to storm a
hospital in Budennovsk, a town in southern Russia, where rebels
had taken hostages captive.

<HEADLINE> Wuxi Sets Out to Clean Taihu Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Wuxi City in east China's
Jiangsu Province has worked out a 10-point program to clean the
nearby Taihu Lake, according to a report in the "China Environment
Journal".
</P>
<P>
The lake, a major tourist attraction, faces a growing threat of
pollution from industrial waste, including domestic sewage.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the discharge of industrial waste
water and domestic sewage will be halted if it does not comply
with the state standard after treatment.
</P>
<P>
No such discharge will be allowed within five km from the
shore where rivers flow out of the lake.
</P>
<P>
Where rivers flow into the lake, the required setback distance
will be 10 km.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the construction of new projects which may pollute
the lake will be stopped. Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces share the
lake.
</P>
<P>
Among the measures, sanitoriums, hotels and other institutions
near the lake will be required gradually to reduce their discharge
of sewage until it reaches the standard level.
</P>
<P>
The variety of farm crops near the lake will be coordinated to
reduce pollution from agricultural chemicals.

<HEADLINE> Goldlion Pins Growth Hopes on Chinese Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Goldlion Holdings expects the
China market to become increasingly important as the Hong Kong and
Singapore markets remain sluggish, according to a local newspaper
report today.
</P>
<P>
Louis Lau, financial controller of the Goldlion group, said the
Chinese mainland was expected to contribute 85 percent of the
group's total revenue during the fiscal 1996, up from 80 percent
the previous year, the Hong Kong Standard reported.
</P>
<P>
Local and Singapore operations both registered single-digit
decreases in sales over the past few months, Lau said. Hong Kong
and the Lion city currently account for about 12 percent of the
group's total sales.
</P>
<P>
One of the strongest brand names in clothing and clothing
accessories industry, Goldlion operates through a wholesale
distribution network of more than 720 outlets in Chinese
mainland. The group's strategy is to increase sales by 10 to 12
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Apart from such major Chinese cities as Shanghai, northern
China is to be the group's major marketing focus this year.
Goldlion is also eyeing the Japanese and Southeast Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
The lowering of import duties in China would help Goldlion's
mainland operations, Lau said.
</P>
<P>
He forecast the group's profit world grow at a rate of 30
percent over the next few years as China sales would steadily
increase, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, Canada Sign Deals of 2 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Business representatives of
Pakistan and Canada signed here today 20 new business deals worth
2.1 billion US dollars as Team Canada, a large Canadian trade
delegation, made its historic visit to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, visiting Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Chretien and seven provincial premiers from Canada
witnessed the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The business deals include 926 million dollars in commercial
contracts and 1.2 billion dollars in agreements in principle,
including memoranda of understanding and letters of intent.
</P>
<P>
"Team Canada's historic presence in Islamabad is testimony to
the large role we want to play in the economic development of
Pakistan," said Chretien.
</P>
<P>
"Through this Team Canada visit, we have been able to showcase
the skills and know-how of Canadian businesses of all sizes. And
the signings today show that Pakistan is taking notice - and that
means jobs and growth in both our countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The signings would help the development of Pakistan," Benazir
Bhutto, who lauded Chretien for leading the large delegation to
visit Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In addition to today's commercial signings, the provincial
government of New Brunswick signed a memorandum of understanding
with the Pakistan government for a 10-year dairy and meat project
that would see the export of 50,000 cattle. The project would mean
hundreds of millions of dollars in the Canadian agricultural
sector.
</P>
<P>
The two-way trade between Canada and Pakistan totaled only 260
million dollars in 1994 - with only 62 million dollars in Canadian
exports.
</P>
<P>
Over the last 12 months, Canadian companies have concluded
sales worth more than 400 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Canadian investment has increased from virtually zero in 1993
to an estimated 10 million dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Today's signings in the Pakistan capital bring the amount of
business deals signed so far during Team Canada's visit to South
Asia to 5.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed six memoranda of understanding (MOU)
on cooperation in the fields of environment, agriculture, air
services, spectrum management, trade and legal assistance earlier
today.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers had a 40-minute meeting followed by an
one-hour plenary session of the visiting Canadian delegation and
Pakistani ministers and senior officials today.
</P>
<P>
Team Canada visited India before coming to Pakistan. It is
expected to visit Indonesia and Malaysia later.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara arrived here today to brief top Lebanese leaders on the
results of a recent tour in the region by U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher and his talks with Syrian leaders in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Shara told reporters at the Syrian-Lebanese border that he
was carrying a message from President Hafez al-Assad to Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian foreign minister is expected to hold talks with
Hrawi, House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Rafik
al-Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources here said the visit by Shara will lead
to a meeting of the Syrian-Lebanese Higher Council.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the meeting will be held after the next round
Syrian-Israeli peace talks, which will start in Maryland,
the United Stated, on January 24.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Lebanese Higher Council was set up under the
"Treaty of Brotherhood, Cooperation and Coordination" signed
between the two countries in May, 1991.
</P>
<P>
The members of the council include the two countries'
presidents, house speakers, and other key senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Syria has 40,000 troops stationed in the Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
A breakthrough on the Syrian-Israeli track would help resume
Lebanon's negotiations with Israel which were suspended more than
18 months ago, observers here noted.

<HEADLINE> Steel Output in Developed Countries Likely to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Steel production in Europe, the
United States and Japan is likely to fall by five percent this
year, as mills cut output to cope with a declining demand,
according to a leading forecaster.
</P>
<P>
The demand in the developed world will be sluggish because
users are likely to continue running down their excessive
inventories in the first half of 1996, the Financial Times quoted
a Sheffield consultancy as saying.
</P>
<P>
Steelmakers have been hit by the slowdown in car production in
the U.S. and Europe and they are also suffering from a weak demand
for construction steel in some developed countries, the
consultancy said.
</P>
<P>
However, once the adjustments in production and stock levels
are completed, probably in the first half of the year, there could
be a partial recovery in the second half of 1996, it added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Steel has reportedly predicted strong demand
from China and other Asian countries to compensate for weaker
growth in Western countries.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: ADB Ends 1995 with Strong Performance (by Ding Zhaolin) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The year of 1995 has seen a
strong performance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) with its
total volume of bank operations reaching a record 5.6 billion US
dollars, but it's still facing great challenges in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The past year was one of considerable achievements for the
ADB," said Mitsuo Sato, president of the multilateral financing
institution, at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
According to latest statistics, the total volume of the ADB's
bank operations during the year 1995 amounted to 5.615 billion US
dollars for 81 projects.
</P>
<P>
This is a 50 percent increase from 3.737 billion US dollars in
1994, raising its cumulative lending to nearly 57 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the bank had approved public and private
sector loans for 1,295 projects in 34 developing members.
</P>
<P>
With the 110-million-US-dollar equity investments in the
private sector in 1995, the bank's equity operations, which began
in 1983, reached a cumulative total of 400 million US dollars in
direct investments and underwriting commitments.
</P>
<P>
The bank also performed strongly in terms of co-financing,
which amounted to 2.5 billion US dollars, and the provision of
technical assistance, which reached 144 million US dollars in a
total of 293 projects.
</P>
<P>
During the year, the ADB has also made strenuous efforts to
improve the quality of bank projects to better meet its
development objectives and priorities.
</P>
<P>
To consolidate the social thrust of its operations, the bank
adopted a number of new policies in areas of governance,
involuntary resettlement and the establishment of an inspection
function.
</P>
<P>
In addition, new policies covering private sector operations
and the agriculture and energy sectors were approved. The bank has
also adopted a new co-financing and guarantee strategy in a bid to
intensify its role in resource mobilization.
</P>
<P>
The progress has been achieved by the bank amid prevailing
budgetary restraints, according to Sato.
</P>
<P>
Sato indicated that the most immediate and critical challenge
facing the bank is the replenishment of the concessional Asian
Development Fund (ADF).
</P>
<P>
According to Sato, the overall trend for ADF is clearly towards
a shrinking of the total volume of concessional resources for
development assistance.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the bank will continue to emphasize project
quality and portfolio management, improve its business processes
and meet many varied needs of its developing members in 1996,
according to the president of the ADB.

<HEADLINE> De Klerk Denies National Party To Be Dissolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (Xinhua)--South African Deputy
President and National Party (NP) leader F W De Klerk yesterday
denied reports that the NP was on the verge of dissolution,
saying this was a "total misrepresentation of steps the party
planned to change its image."
</P>
<P>
A local daily "The Citizen" today quoted De Klerk as saying
that a name change of the NP and the abandonment of its
organisational identity was by no means under consideration of
dissolution.
</P>
<P>
However, in a statement issued last night, De Klerk admitted
that a secret document leaked to the press had been discussed on
the highest level in the NP, but said no decision had been taken
on it.
</P>
<P>
According to the Afrikaans Sunday newspaper "Rapport", the
executive committee of the NP Federal Council had decided last
Monday to disband the party and spearhead the formation of a new
Christian Democratic Political Movement.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the reports, De Klerk said the person or persons
who leaked the information to "Rapport" apparently endeavoured
maliciously to sabotage a comprehensive long-term initiative of
the NP for which the support of the national caucus had been
obtained.
</P>
<P>
The document upon which the "misinterpretation" was based is a
working document in respect of which no final decision had been
taken, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said, as a non-racial and the second largest political
party in South Africa, the NP saw for itself a leading role with
regard to the stimulation of fundamental transformation of the
political scene.
</P>
<P>
The NP believed that a broad approach was necessary and that
ways and means had to be found to involve in any new politicl
dispensation for the millions of south africans who were
dissatisfied with the present political dispensation, the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rate Falls to 121-Week Low in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The annual rate of inflation
slithered to a 121-week low touching 6.03 percent for the week
ended December 30, the Financial Express reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decline, for the eighth consecutive week, was followed by a
decrease in the wholesale price index (WPI) for the fourth week in
succession.
</P>
<P>
The annual rate of inflation which averaged 9.4 percent during
the calendar year 1995, stood at 10 percent during the last week
of 1994 when the average rate of price rise was 10.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate has shed 1.5 percentage points during the
last four weeks even as it continued its single-digit run for a
record 40th consecutive week.
</P>
<P>
The lowest inflation rate recorded was during May 1, 1993 when
it was 5.98 percent.
</P>
<P>
The 0.25 percentage point decline in the WPI (base 1980-82 =
100), which came down from 297.8 to 297.4, was caused by lower
prices of commodities such eggs, tea and coffee.

The television said Goh was quoted by the newspaper as saying,
"We see Australia playing an important role (in ASEAN) and
certainly would like to encourage Australia to do so."

are small enough to be considered as possible members one of these
days," Goh reportedly said.

invest in the country.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Iran, Turkey Fail to Ink Gas Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Turkey failed to reach
a 20-billion-dollar agreement on transferring Iran's gas to Turkey
for the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
According to a Turkish diplomat here, Turkish Minister of
Energy and Natural Resources Sinasi Altinar said that the two
sides had agreed on 99 percent of the agreement, but there is
still one percent left unsolved.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish minister left here this morning, but is expected to
return to Tehran this week after consultation at home, the
diplomat told Xinhua in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
However, the diplomat declined to elaborate on the differences
between the two countries, saying that there are only technical
problems.
</P>
<P>
Turkey offered to pay 20 billion dollars for buying gas from
Iran in the next 25 years, he noted.
</P>
<P>
But he did not specify the cost of building a
1,319-kilometer-long gas pipeline from Iran to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers today also said that the Turkish minister
would be back to Tehran in a few days to ink the finalized version
of the agreement after consultations at home.
</P>
<P>
The papers quoted Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as
saying that the finalization of the agreement may take a little
bit more time due to its sensitive nature.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the contract, Iran will start in 1999 to export
some 2 billion cubic meters of gas to Turkey annually, and will
increase the volume to 10 billion cubic meters by 2006.
</P>
<P>
Last April, Iran and Turkey signed a memorandum of
understanding for sale of Iran's gas to Turkey as well as
setting up a gas pipeline between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, Canada Hold Investment Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani and Canadian
commerce ministers stressed here today the need to enhance trade
and commercial cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"There is a significant opportunity for expanding economic
relations between the two countries," said Canadian Minister for
Commerce and Trade Roy Maclaren at a Pakistan-Canada investment
conference organized by the Investment Board of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"We want a new economic partnership with Pakistan under the
GATT (General Agreement on Tariff and Trade) and WTO (World Trade
Organization) agreements," he said.
</P>
<P>
Roy said that private investors would focus on cooperation in
transport, energy, telecommunication, information technology,
financial services, agricultural and food processing, environment
and education.
</P>
<P>
He said Canada considers Pakistan as an important and integral
part of the Asia Pacific community and that Pakistan's
determination to privatize public sector projects has generated
tremendous interest in foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The stage is now set for a new, productive commercial and trade
relationship between Pakistan and Canada, he added.
</P>
<P>
Canadian firms were awarded contracts of 400 million US dollars
during the past four months.
</P>
<P>
Canada's exports to Pakistan in six months of 1995 surpassed
the total exports of the year 1994, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the conference, Pakistan Commerce Minister Ahmad
Mukhtar said that the present level of economic cooperation still
needs to be raised although the two-way trade between Pakistan and
Canada during last five years has increased manifold.
</P>
<P>
"In a liberal investment environment, now foreign entrepreneurs
have equal and free access to Pakistan's markets," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no restriction on the repatriation of principal,
dividends and profits. There is no restriction on foreign equity
share-holding. No permission is required for joint venture
projects. The government of Pakistan has provided statutory
provision to guard against expropriation," he added.
</P>
<P>
A 170-member Canadian delegation of officials and business
representatives of big companies is currently visiting Pakistan
with Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Pakistan and Canada reached 260
million dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In the past 12 months, Canadian companies have concluded sales
worth more than 400 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Canada's investment in Pakistan increased from virtually zero
in 1993 to an estimated 10 million dollars now.
</P>
<P>
Canada, which joined the Aid-to-Pakistan Consortium in 1950,
has provided economic assistance to Pakistan worth 1.270 billion
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
A Canadian delegation of investors visited Pakistan in December
1995, resulting in the signing of two agreements with Pakistan's
private sector for the construction of a 150-room hotel and export
of 200,000 tons of rice to Canada.

<HEADLINE> Afghanistan's Peace Pact Still Far </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Some top aides close to
Rashid Dostum, leader of the Afghan Uzbek Militia, dashed the hope
of an imminent peace pact with the Afghan government, reports from
Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan, said today.
</P>
<P>
Mazar-i-Sharif is the headquarters of Dostum who, a major rival
of Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani, controls seven provinces
in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Rasool Palawan, Dostum's influential second-in-command, was
quoted as saying that "a peace agreement is not yet close."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Rabbani had expressed willingness to visit
Mazar-i-Sharif to talk with Dostum in a bid to settle disputes
between them.
</P>
<P>
"Rabbani and his top commander Ahmed Masood have lost
credibility among the people here as they have killed too many
people over the years and have declared a holy war on us," Palawan
said.
</P>
<P>
"Kabul is under siege from the Taliban and Rabbani now needs
our help to open up the supply routes to the capital," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But as far as I'm concerned, there can be no peace until
Rabbani steps down," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dostum's assistant Aziz Kargar was quoted as saying
that "it's not yet clear whether the time is right for us to
broker a peace deal with Rabbani."
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, it's too early to start preparing peace
documents until more talks on more issues take place," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, there has so far been no report on Dostum's own
opinions on the issue.
</P>
<P>
An analyst was quoted as saying that Dostum was under a lot of
pressure from his traditional allies of Russia and Uzbekistan as
well as from Iran to come to a reconciliation with Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
"But I can't see a pact being signed as long as Palawan remains
so powerful and opposes such a deal," the analyst said.
</P>
<P>
One of the key components of any agreements between Rabbani and
Dostum would be the opening of the strategic Salang pass, a
crucial supply route linking the embattled Kabul with Uzbekistan
and Tajikistan, the analyst added.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan government lately reached an agreement with
Hezb-i-Wahdat, another anti-government force, on reopening the
supply route between Kabul and Bamyan province.

<HEADLINE> Changing Gift Trends in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese usually exchange gifts
during the new year, but the traditional way of presenting gifts
has changed in recent years in Shanghai, China's largest
metropolis.
</P>
<P>
Wu Huijuan, 18, received a well-known novel "Vanity Fair" and
an anthology of violin works as birthday gifts from her parents
and relatives. She treasures these gifts and values their love for
her more highly.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of people like to get subscriptions to
newspapers or periodicals as gifts for their loved ones. In a post
office on Huaihai Street, one girl got a subscription to "The
Football Newspaper" as a birthday present for her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
Books and periodicals have gradually taken the place of fruits,
cakes, and tonics, which people often brought with them as gifts
when they visisted friends or colleagues in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
"Gifts on the air" is another popular way of presenting a gift,
with radio or TV stations offering listeners or audiences specific
programs such as "choosing a song for loved ones", a fashionable
way for people to express their feelings for each other.
</P>
<P>
Even the elderly have been attracted to gift giving in this
manner. One grandmother living in a suburban area would go to a
television station to ask that a particular song be played for her
grandson's birthday.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the now commonplace congratulatory telegrams,
cards, and flowers, there are now computer software and compact
discs being chosen as presents.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the cost of presenting gifts accounts for
10 percent of total expenditures of a family in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Keeps 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangkok, three-time Asian Games
host, will stage the 1998 Asiad as scheduled with the consent of
the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA), a government official said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Pongpol Adireksarn, minister responsible for Thailand's sports
affairs, told a news conference that they endeavored to convince
the OCA of Thailand's readiness.
</P>
<P>
Pongpol led the Thai delegation to report their preparations on
the Games to the OCA in Kuwait last week after a threatening from
OCA officials, who said they may look for a new host, due to
their not being satisfied with Thailand's preparations.
</P>
<P>
Their last-ditch effort ended up in a January 5 deadline
granted by the council to prove it would be organised and ready to
run the Games held every four years.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has made hasty matchups by setting up six
committees and a permanent secretariat at the Olympic headquaters.
</P>
<P>
One of the key next steps will be to work on funding, said
Pongpol. Many sponsors had been cautious of investing until they
were sure the Games would be held in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Sports facilities and athletes' accommodation are also to be
constructed and improved well ahead of the Games to meet OCA
deadlines.
</P>
<P>
Besides, an expressway is being built to ease Thai's notorious
heavy-loaded traffic, which would help spectators and participants
reach venues on time.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Rapid sustained economic growth
in east China's Fujian Province has shown just how far behind
railway transport is, so the province is now more involved in
railway building.
</P>
<P>
Quanzhou, home of a large number of overseas Chinese, was
reached by a rail line, in October of last year, coming from
Zhangping.
</P>
<P>
A railway line from Nanping to Hengfeng, in Jiangxi, involving
a total investment of 3.18 billion yuan, is expected to open for
service by the end of this year, becoming the second line out of
Fujian, after the Yingtan-Xiamen line, built in 1958.
</P>
<P>
Planned railways include those from Longyan to Meizhou, Fuzhou
to Xiamen, Wenzhou to Fuzhou, Zhangzhou to Chaozhou, and Ganzhou
to Longyan.
</P>
<P>
Construction work on the Longyan-Meizhou line will start this
year, while that on the Fuzhou-Xiamen and Wenzhou-Fuzhou lines is
being prepared, and that of the Zhangzhou-Chaozhou and
Ganzhou-Longyan lines will begin somewhere between the yeat 2000
and 2005.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Gets Largest Bezoar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A bezoar weighing 2.85 kg, was
recently obtained in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region, and is the largest ever seen in China.
</P>
<P>
Bezoar is a substance much prized in traditional Chinese
medicine that, comes from the gallbladder of cows, occurring
either naturally inside the animals' body or by being planted into
the animals' body by means of an operation.
</P>
<P>
An operation was performed on a cow in 1991 to produce
bezoar. Last year the cow died and the "king bezoar" was taken out
from inside its body.
</P>
<P>
This technique of producing bezoar inside cows' bodies by means
of an operation was initiated by professors from the Inner
Mongolia Institute of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry and was
responsible for this record-breaking bezoar.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated to be worth many thousands of yuan at the very
least.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- China's fledgling advertising
industry made some headway during the Eighth Five-Year-Plan
(1991-1995), recent statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The number of advertising agencies listed for 1995 is expected
to reach 49,000, an annual 63.4 percent growth for the five
years. Business volume is estimated to top 28 billion yuan (3.37
billion US dollars), ten times 1990's figure, preliminary figures
released by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce
(SAIC) show.
</P>
<P>
An SAIC spokesman told reporters that the five-year period also
saw an acceleration in the amount of advertising legislation.
</P>
<P>
The country's first advertisement law went into effect on
February 1, 1995, followed by a series of regulations on medicine,
medical equipment, foodstuffs, cosmetics, liquor, tobacco, and
financial market advertisements.
</P>
<P>
A number of legal documents on qualifications for advertisers,
on management of ad businesses involving overseas investment,
temporary ads, and outdoor advertising also took effect.
</P>
<P>
The China Advertising Association has also promulgated basic
principles concerning self-regulation in the business.
</P>
<P>
In a move to crack down on false advertising, market watch-dogs
dealt with an estimated 25,000 cases over the past five years.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, Canada Sign Six Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and Canada signed
here today six memorandums of understanding (MOU) on cooperation
in the fields of the environment, agriculture, air services,
spectrum management, trade and legal assistance.
</P>
<P>
The MOUs were signed by ministers and officials of the two
countries in the presence of visiting Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien and his Pakistani counterpart Benazir Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
Before the signing ceremony, the two prime ministers had a
40-minute meeting followed by a one-hour plenary session of the
visiting Canadian delegation and Pakistani ministers and senior
officials.
</P>
<P>
The talks covered a wide range of subjects including the
Kashmir and Afghan issues, Pakistani Foreign Secretary Najmuddin
Sheikh told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Admitting the complexity of the Kashmir issue, the Canadian
prime minister "promised to examine and look into the contribution
Canada can make to help resolve the dispute."
</P>
<P>
Later answering questions from newsmen, Benazir said Pakistan
is committed to the plebiscite in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
She said Pakistan does not oppose close trade and commercial
relations between Canada and India.
</P>
<P>
"Although Pakistan and India have differences in Kashmir, they
should not spill over to the trade and commercial areas," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan opposes any move which would harm peace and stability
in the region, Benazir told the Canadian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Briefing Chretien on the situation in Afghanistan, Benazir
stressed the need for all countries, particularly Western
countries including Canada and the U.S., to be actively engaged in
peace efforts and to support the UN attempt in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Chretien expressed his concern about the arrest of a Canadian
after the bomb blast in the Egyptian embassy here in November.
</P>
<P>
"The Canadian is in judicial custody," Benazir said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed the prospects of economic cooperation
between the two countries and identified areas for cooperation on
energy, solar, fishing, communication, transport, power plants,
etc.
</P>
<P>
Chretien arrived here Sunday with a large 170-member delegation
of officials and business representatives of big companies for a
two-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
His entourage includes some 150 business representatives of 141
companies, seven provincial premiers, two central government
ministers and several senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that Chretien's trip to Pakistan, India,
Indonesia and Malaysia reflects Canada's new aggressive policy
aimed at securing its share in the South and South-East Asian
countries in terms of trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
Chretien is the first Canadian prime minister to visit Pakistan
since 1971.
</P>
<P>
The volume of bilateral trade between Pakistan and Canada
reached 260 million US dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In the past 12 months, Canadian companies have concluded sales
deals worth more than 400 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Canada's investment in Pakistan increased from virtually zero
in 1993 to an estimated 10 million dollars at present.
</P>
<P>
Canada, which joined Aid-to-Pakistan Consortium in 1959, has
provided economic assistance to Pakistan worth 1.27 billion
dollars.

CAIRO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
met with visiting U.S. Vice President Al Gore this morning for
discussion on promoting economic, technical and trade cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Gore, who arrived here early this morning, and Mubarak are
expected to co-chair a meeting of the Egyptian-U.S. Presidential
Council following their meeting.
</P>
<P>
The council meeting will mainly focus on projects of technology
transfer and means of encouraging joint investments and trade as
well as increasing the volume of Egyptian exports to the United
States within the framework of the Partnership for Economic Growth
and Development, which was initiated by Gore and Mubarak in
September 1994.
</P>
<P>
Gore, during his one-day visit to Egypt, will also meet with
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri and Speaker of the
People's Assembly Ahmed Fathi Sorour.
</P>
<P>
U.S. ambassador to Egypt Edward Walker said Sunday that joint
investment projects are expected to increase, and the size of
U.S. assistance to Egypt will remain unchanged in the forthcoming
years. Egypt receives 2.1 billion U.S. dollars in aid annually
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Both sides apparently have attached great importance to Gore's
short visit, which received wide coverage by the Egyptian
media.

<HEADLINE> State to Strenghthen Control of Pharmaceutical Marketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The State Pharmaceutical
Administration (SPA) plans to reduce the number of pharmaceutical
commodity wholesale outlets from the current 15,000-plus to
between 5,000 and 8,000 by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The figure will be further reduced to 1,500 to 2,000 by the
year of 2010.
</P>
<P>
A State-managed retail network will be constructed in rural
areas, especially in remote and poverty-stricken places, according
to a draft programme of the SPA.
</P>
<P>
The programme is aimed at rationalizing circulation of
pharmaceutical commodities and guaranteeing high-quality and safe
medicines.
</P>
<P>
As part of the programme, the administration will take tougher
measures in the next five years to crack down on sales commissions.
</P>
<P>
the draft programme was discussed at a national conference on
pharmaceutical last week and will soon be put into effect after it
is revised.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the administration, the country
currently has more then 15,000 wholesale dealers and more than
50,000 retail shops that sell some 20,000 varieties of
pharmaceutical commodities.
</P>
<P>
Last year, some 61.2 billion yuan (about 7.2 billion US
dollars) of medicines and pharmaceutical products were sold
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The large number of pharmaceutical commodity trade outlets
enables the public to get medicine conveniently. Yet it also
provides opportunities for profiteering from producing and
marketing fake and substandard medicines.
</P>
<P>
In addition, sales commissions have boomed in the
pharmaceutical trade circle in recent years, going as high as 20
to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the programme, the state will monopolize the right
to approve new pharmaceutical wholesale units, and the unlicensed
pharmaceutical trade units will be rooted out by the end of the
century.
</P>
<P>
During the next five years, one or two national pharmaceutical
commodity exchanges will be set up, officials said.

JINAN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Shandong, one of China's leading
grain bases, is increasing efforts to raise grain output to 42.5
million tons by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The province leads the country in wheat output, and in fruit,
oil-bearing crops, vegetable, and aquatic products. In 1995, both
total grain output and per unit yield was at an all time-high.
</P>
<P>
As a result, farmers' annual net income increased by 330 yuan
to 1,650 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Governor Shao Guifang says that his province will expand
the acreage for grain growing to eight million ha. and raise
farmers' annual income to 2,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The province is set to invest 22 million yuan in building a
fine-strain development system, setting up seven experimental
districts for new technology development, and in popularizing ten
new agro-techniques, including those for water-saving and
fast-growing, Shao said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 396 million yuan will be used to improve 66,600 ha
of low to medium-yield fields and to exploit virgin land, while
development of agriculture-related industries and raw material
production is being speeded up.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the vice-governor noted, average per capita
consumption of grain in Shandong is expected to reach 500 kg.

He said that so far there had been lack of full cooperation in
turtle management and preservation among Southeast Asian countries
and that any effort by a single country in the area would be
futile if other countries did not do the same.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Malaysia was the first country in the region to
have a comprehensive turtle management and preservation, Shaharom
called for stronger ties between scientists and turtle managers of
the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that cooperation in turtle research must be enhanced to

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Two astronauts entered the
open space outside space shuttle Endeavour today in preparation
for the construction of an international space station.
</P>
<P>
The spacewalk, which began around 1:00 U.S. Eastern Standard
Time (6:00 GMT) while Endeavour was flying some 320 kilometers
above Australia, was planned to last six hours and a half.
</P>
<P>
Leroy Chiao and Daniel Barry took the first turn to test new
construction tools designed to help assemble the Alpha
international space station beginning November 1997.
</P>
<P>
Also as test subjects were connectors and modified suits being
readied by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) for keeping astronauts warm in the rigid cold of space.
</P>
<P>
Over the course of the spacewalk, for several times, the two
astronauts were reportedly marveled by the spectacular views of
sunrise on the Earth's horizon beneath the spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
The Ground Control at NASA's Johnson Space Center near Houston,
Texas, has been instructing step by step on the activities through
radio contact. NASA TV has broadcast the footages live.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Chiao will group with Winston Scott, another
member of Endeavour's six-member crew to carry out the tests.
</P>
<P>
The three men are all first-time spacewalkers, but the current
nine-day flight, started on January 11, is Chiao's second time to
be aboard a space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
During the first four days of this year's first shuttle flight,
astronauts have already retrieved a Japanese research satellite
and released an American research satellite.
</P>
<P>
American satellite, worth 10 million U.S. dollars, will be
retrieved on Tuesday after about 48 hours of free flight and
experiments on spacecraft contamination, laser and amateur radio.
</P>
<P>
Endeavour and its crew will return to Kennedy Space Center in
Cape Canaveral, Florida, on January 20.

FUZHOU, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Southeast China's Fujian
Province has built four regional centers, each catering to the

</P>
<P>
In the landlocked mountainous areas an edible fungus production
center has been formed, bringing provincial output of dried
mushroom to 15,000 tons a year.

As the country's largest grower of bamboo, Fujian has built a
72,000-ha experimental plot for bamboo in five central and
southern areas over the past few years, to aid development of the
local bamboo industry.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of its plentiful water resources, the province
has given energetic support to aquatic production, especially
value-added products such as river eels, grouper, prawns, and
scallops. Annual output of river eels exceeds 30,000 tons, with an
average output value of 3 billion yuan.
</P>

KUALA LUMPUR, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Technology and

should not ignore the peaceful utilization of nuclear technology
to increase the country's competitiveness.

Opening a seminar on industrial sterilization, Law said that
nuclear technology could promote the nation's socio-economic

"It would be most unfortunate if, in voicing our objections to

</P>
<P>
Law said that there was a tendency among certain segments of
the public to lump nuclear weapons together with the peaceful
utilization of nuclear technology.
</P>
<P>
He said that radiation processing technology, including
radiation sterilization, could benefit the development of
industries such as wire and cable manufacturing, medical product
manufacturing, agro-waste treatment, sewage treatment and effluent
treatment.

MOSCOW -- Russian military representatives resumed talks today
with a group of Chechen rebels holding dozens of hostages in the
southern region of Dagestan, Itar-Tass news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which took place at the village of Pervomaiskoye at
7 a.m. local time (0400 GMT) near the border with Chechnya, seemed
to be a last-ditch effort to avoid a bloody showdown between the
two sides. Russia extended the deadline of its previous ultimatum
from Sunday to Monday for the rebels to "think things over." "The
demands on the terrorists remain the same -- free the hostages and
surrender weapons," Dagestani Interior Ministry said.

Roh is the first former head of state of South Korea ever to
stand trial. The first trial was held on December 18 last year.
</P>
<P>
Also standing trial at the same court are 14 business tycoons
and former public officials charged with bribing Roh or being
involved in raising Roh's slush funds.
</P>
<P>
Judge Kim Young-il of the Seoul District Court presided over
the trial of the graft scandal, in which Roh was indicted on
December 5 last year for receiving 370 million U.S. dollars during
his 1988-1993 presidency from major business tycoons.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bombing Exercises to Be Held Off South Korea's East  Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States Air Force will
hold two bombing exercises involving B-1 and B-52 bombers off
South Korea's eastern coast next month, according to U.S. Forces
Korea (USFK) here today.
</P>
<P>
The drills are to be conducted at the training grounds of the
South Korean Air Force, a USFK source said.
</P>
<P>
B-1 bomber exercise is expected to be held on February 13,
while B-52 bomber exercise will be conducted on February 15, the
source said, adding that the planes participating in both
exercises will return to the U.S. upon completion of the exercises.
</P>
<P>
The B-1 and the B-52, which can be refueled during flight, have
a cruising range of 12,000 kilometers. They are also capable of
carrying both nuclear and conventional bombs for strategic bombing
missions.
</P>
<P>
The source claimed that the planned exercises are related to
recent security concerns on the Korean Peninsula, which, South
Korea said, had been caused by the deployment of military aircraft
to positions near the Demilitarized Zone by the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
At present, some 37,000 U.S. soldiers are stationed in South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
In Pyongyang, the DPRK, in a press communique published Sunday,
condemned a series of U.S. military activities jointly conducted
with South Korea over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Despite its professed commitment to "improving U.S.-DPRK ties"
and "easing tensions" on the Korean Peninsula, the U.S. is hostile
to Pyongyang at heart and attempts to carry out its military
strategy in East Asia at the cost of the DPRK, said the
communique.

<P>
SINGAPORE, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government has
joined hands with two of Asia's largest and most powerful
corporate players to invest in the region's promising young
companies, informed sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
After signing a Memorandum of Understanding recently, the
Temasek Holdings, one of the two investment arms of the Singapore
government, has teamed up with Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan and
the Bangkok Bank of Thailand to form a joint venture for regional
investment, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture, known as MC Private Equity Partners Asia,
will have an initial paid-up capital of 100 million US dollars,
which is to be increased when additional partners join in or when
the need arises.
</P>
<P>
It will be headquartered in Singapore and is expected to start
operations next month.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the new venture was part of Temasek's new
strategy to seek out partners with capital to invest jointly in
high-yielding projects in the region.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the Temasek has been forming investment
ventures with foreign corporations, with a view to investing in
Asia's fast-growing and highly profitable business, mainly in
manufacturing and services, focusing especially on China,
Indochina, and the member nations of ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations), the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
They said that the investment would largely be made in unlisted
companies that could eventually go public. The potential targets
would include venture companies, real estate, privatization
projects, and infrastructure projects, they said.

Pakistan.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in south China has set annual economic growth at ten
percent for the next five years, a senior official has said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Fulin, secretary of the Regional Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), expressed confidence that by
making use of various advantages, the region's gross domestic
product (GDP) by the end of the century will be eight times 1980's
figure.
</P>
<P>
After six years in office, Zhao was appointed secretary again
at the recent Seventh Regional Congress of the CPC. He says that
he sees advantages for the region in the rapid expansion of high
technology and readjustment of industrial patterns in the world,
the economic prosperity of East and Southeast Asia, and the return
of Hong Kong and Macao to Chinese sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
In addition, labor-intensive and initial processing industries
in China's economically booming eastern part are seeking
opportunities in the middle and western parts of the country and
the state is taking steps to help develop poverty-stricken and
ethnic areas.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Zhao called on local government and party
officials to broaden their viewpoint and think of ways to use
potential advantages in a practical way.
</P>
<P>
During the country's Eighth Five-year Plan (1991-1995) period,
the central government decided to increase connections between
southwestern China and Southeast Asia through Guangxi, and the
region invested 14 billion yuan (1.68 billion US dollars) in
improving transportation and telecommunication facilities.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1994, the annual growth rate of the region's
GDP reached 17.02 percent, 5.3 percentage points higher than the
national level.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Stresses Talent Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The 70 talent markets and
those for increasing contact between entrepreneurs and township
business personnel have brought an influx of talented people into
east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang Wenchao, deputy director of the Zhejiang
Personnel Exchange Center, the markets have altered the use of
talented people by changing from centrally-planned allocation to a
market-oriented system.
</P>
<P>
As middle men, the talent markets serve employers and employees
by using a principle of competition, in a move to improve the
reasonable use of trained personnel, no matter what their academic
background, work experience, or personal traits.
</P>
<P>
In May, 1988, the first talent market was set up in Yiwu City,
Zhejiang Province, and since that time, such markets have become a
major channel in the flow of talented people in the province. In
the past seven years, 546 large and medium-sized events for
exchange of talented personnel have been held in the province,
with 570,000 people having been handled and 60,000 technical and
management personnel having found jobs.
</P>
<P>
Most of the job-seekers who found employment through the talent
markets were high- or middle-level professionals, such as
engineers and accountants. Their appearance not only helped meet
the needs of areas lacking talented people, but also increased the
total amount of talented people in the province.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Reclaiming Large Coastal Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 15 (Xinhua) -- East China's coastal province
of Zhejiang reclaimed 150,000 mu (10,000 ha) of land from the sea
during the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995).
</P>
<P>
Since 1949, a total of 2.27 million mu (150,000 ha) of land has
been reclaimed from the East China Sea by the province.
</P>
<P>
According to 1994 statistics, the province has gotten more than
one million tons of grain, cotton, oil, cocoons, fish, salt and
fruit, with total value of 1.2 billion yuan, from the reclaimed
areas. The large number of factories inside the reclaimed areas
are producing a large amount of output value for the province
annually.
</P>
<P>
More economic development zones have been built inside the
areas, attracting investors from both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Xiaoshan County, one of China's ten richest, attributes its
fast rural economic development to the reclamation work. Not only
are there a large number of farms, but 305 industrial enterprises
as well.
</P>
<P>
Another sea enclosure is under way in the Zhoushan area to
build an economic development zone. Upon completion, the zone will
be three times as large as neighboring Shenjiamen Port, China's
largest fishing port. The embankments have already helped to
reduce the number of disasters a great deal, and some islands have
become part of a peninsula by such enclosures.

<P>
FUZHOU, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Overseas businessmen have shown
an interest in developing coastal islands of Fujian Province,
because of ideal natural conditions and an improved investment
environment.
</P>
<P>
The province's islands, which total 1,418, have a high
development value because of moderate climate, abundant natural
resources, and a series of favorable policies that have been
adopted over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
The 1.2 sq km Fuying island has attracted Taiwanese investors
who plan on turning it into an entertainment base, while an island
close to it has been chosen by Mongolian and American businessmen
for tourism.
</P>
<P>
Another island, Dongshan, has not only made great efforts at
tourism development, but has intensified aquatic breeding. A
Taiwanese investor has built a 2,500-sq-m breeding pond there with
an investment of 12 million yuan (about 1.4 million US
dollars). The pond is expected to produce 130 tons of abalone
annually.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve development on Pingtan Island, the local
government has plans for a 3,200-meter cross-sea bridge with help
from a Hong Kong company. The bridge will be built from
Xiaoshandong in Fuqing to the island at a cost of 560 million yuan
(about 67 million US dollars), taking four years to
complete.

taking, or other violations.

MOSCOW, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian military representatives
resumed talks today with a group of Chechen rebels holding dozens
of hostages in the southern region of Dagestan, Itar-Tass news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which took place at the village of Pervomaiskoye at
7 a.m. local time (0400 GMT) near the border with Chechnya, seemed
to be a last-ditch effort to avoid a bloody showdown between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
Russia extended the deadline of its previous ultimatum from
Sunday to Monday for the rebels to "think things over."
</P>
<P>
"The demands on the terrorists remain the same -- free the
hostages and surrender weapons," Dagestani Interior Ministry said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Enforces New Rules on Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- New rules for foreign
investment come into force in New Zealand today, aiming to tighten
up on avoidance loopholes and allow scrutiny over sensitive
foreign purchases, especially for land.
</P>
<P>
Overseas Investment Commission (OIC) secretary Stephen Dawe
said a welcoming approach to foreign investment will still apply.
</P>
<P>
"The new regime leaves the process for non-land purchases
largely unaffected. Instead, it focuses mainly on altering the
approval process relating to foreign land purchases."
</P>
<P>
The new rules bring controls governing overseas investment
under one Act, meaning a foreign investment proposal will now
require just one application to one body, receiving one decision
based on one set of criteria.
</P>
<P>
The new law covers all offshore islands, and properties of more
than 0.4 hectares categorized as reserve, conservation land,
heritage and historic places, and adjoining the foreshore, or
adjoining lakes bigger than eight hectares.
</P>
<P>
They also cover all land of more than five hectares or other
assets worth more than 10 million NZ dollars (6.5 million US
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Court Trial of Former South Korean President Roh Resumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The second trial on the secret
fund scandal involving former South Korean President Roh Tae-woo
began at the Seoul District Court here today.
</P>
<P>
Roh is the first former head of state of South Korea ever to
stand trial. The first trial was held on December 18 last year.
</P>
<P>
Also standing trial at the same court are 14 business tycoons
and former public officials charged with bribing Roh or being
involved in raising Roh's slush funds.
</P>
<P>
Judge Kim Young-il of the Seoul District Court presided over
the trial of the graft scandal, in which Roh was indicted on
December 5 last year for receiving 370 million U.S. dollars during
his 1988-1993 presidency from major business tycoons.
</P>
<P>
Other defendants include former Presidential Security Force
Chief Lee Hyun-woo, incumbent ruling New Korea Party (NKP)
lawmaker Kum Jin-ho, former legislator Lee Won-joe, former
Presidential Economy Secretary Kim Chong-in, Samsung Business
Group Chairman Lee Kun-hee and Daewoo Business Group Chairman Kim
Woo-choong.
</P>
<P>
Today's trial will focus on determining whether the money was
given to Roh by the business tycoons.
</P>
<P>
In the first trial, prosecutors said during their questioning
of the defendants that out of the 571 million U.S. dollars Roh
amassed while in office, 370 million U.S. dollars came from bribes
in return for winning state projects or other favors from the
government.
</P>
<P>
Roh was taken into custody on November 16 after being arrested
on corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
The second trial on Roh's bribery case came three days after
another Army general-turned former president, Chun Doo-hwan, was
indicted for taking 270 million U.S. dollars in bribes from dozens
of leading businessmen as his successor Roh did while in office.
</P>
<P>
The two disgraced former presidents were earlier indicted for
masterminding the military mutiny on December 12, 1979.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul District Court has yet to decide whether to try Roh
and Chun on those charges together or separately.
</P>
<P>
Chun was arrested on December 3 last year on charges of leading
the 1979 military mutiny. He is currently receiving medical
treatment at the National Police Hospital here due to symptoms of
dehydration and malnutrition resulting from his three-week-long
fast protesting his arrest.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Dollar Expected to Appreciate Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore dollar, which
appreciated by three to eight percent against most currencies last
year, is expected to strengthen further but at a slow pace this
year, economists said.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey conducted and published today by
the Straits Times, most analysts predicted that the Singapore
dollar would appreciate to the range between 1.36 Singapore
dollars and 1.38 Singapore dollars to the US dollar by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the local currency strengthened about three percent
against the US dollar, with the exchange rate rising from 68.46 US
cents in December 1994 to 70.70 US cents in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
Or, the exchange rate was 1.46 Singapore dollars to the US
dollar in December 1994. Then the Singapore dollar appreciated to
1.41 to the greenback a year later.
</P>
<P>
The economists also expected the Singapore dollar to go
stronger against the Japanese yen to reach the range between 75
and 78 yen to the Singapore dollar, three to seven percent higher
than the exchange rate at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
They said that fundamentals such as Singapore's high economic
growth, low inflation, increasing foreign reserves and political
stability would support the local currency.
</P>
<P>
However, some other analysts predicted otherwise. They said
they believed in that the Singapore dollar would depreciate
against the US currency to between 1.43 to 1.45 this year.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, the US dollar is undervalued against currencies
like the yen and the Deutsche mark, and we will see an upward
correction this year," Merrill Lynch Vice President William
Belchere was quoted as saying.

<P>
ROME, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Italy has found 32,452 AIDS
patients and 95,000 HIV carriers by the end of 1995, ranking
itself third in Europe next only to France and Spain.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Health said there is one HIV carrier in
every 600 Italians, with Lombardias in northern Italy being the
worst-hit region.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that since Italy found the first AIDS case in
1982, AIDS patients have been increasing every year. There were
3,130 more cases in 1990, 5,704 more in 1994 and 8,000 more in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Females accounted for 18 percent of the AIDS patients in 1989.
The ratio rose to 24.6 percent last year, the report added. The
25-34 age group accounted for 59.3 percent of AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
AIDS is spread through needle injections among drug addicts,
sexual contacts and blood transfusion.

<HEADLINE> Bumper Harvest to Improve Economic Growth in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A good outlook of
agricultural production and some improvements in foreign trade are
expected to increase Nepal's gross domestic product (GDP) growth
in the current fiscal year, an official communique said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the press communique of Nepal Rastra Bank, the
country's central bank, available indications show that the
production of rice, the principle crop in Nepal, would grow about
20 percent this year thanks to the sufficient rainfall during the
Monsoon season.
</P>
<P>
The non-agricultural sector is also expected to perform
slightly better in the 1995-96 fiscal year beginning last July,
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal saw a gloomy 2.3 percent of GDP growth in last fiscal
year with the agricultural production registering a decline of 0.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
The improved export and some slowdown in import growth in the
past six months have helped reduce the momentum of the nation's
trade imbalance, according to the bank's report.
</P>
<P>
Total exports have increased 2.5 percent during the first five
months of the current fiscal year and the negative trend in export
growth in the past several years has finally reversed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, total imports during the same period increased 25.3
percent against 33 percent during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
But the country's overall foreign trade performance remains
sluggish with the total trade deficit up 35.2 percent to more than
384 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's total foreign exchange reserve at the end of last
December stood at 734 million dollars representing a decline of
more than one million dollars from the end of the last fiscal
year.

COLOMBO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Health Ministry is
planning to employ qualified foreign doctors on contract basis as
the country is currently short of doctors, official sources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
"There are many vacant specialist posts in hospitals at the
periphery, but concerned departments are helpless as there are no
qualified doctors to fill them," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They said that the general surgery is the most affected
specialty in the country's hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry is very much concerned over the
non-availability of doctors to man the specialized units at a
number of hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The Government Medical Officers' Association has urged the
government to negotiate with the World Health Organization (WHO)
to get down a team of UN volunteers specialists as an ad hoc

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet to Consider Opening Up Maize Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet is expected to
consider the opening up of the country's maize market to
international competition Tuesday, according to a news report
today.
</P>
<P>
Maize, used in the production of animal feed, is among 23 items
including rice, garlic and onions, that are now subject to import
controls.
</P>
<P>
This restriction ran against World Trade Organization
agreements requiring free trade among member countries, a
government house official said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand protects domestic maize production by allowing imports
only when there is a shortage.
</P>
<P>
When controls on maize and other items were lifted, Thailand
would apply an import quota system. Imports within the quota
system would be subject to low tax, but others would be taxed at a
high rate.
</P>
<P>
The duty rate to be applied to imports within the quota system
would hinge on the cabinet's decision Tuesday at its routine
weekly meeting, the official said.

BANGKOK, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Thai Defense Minister Gen.
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh will head a military delegation to Laos
later this month for talks on border problems, defense sources
said today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will include Supreme Commander Gen. Viroj
Saengsanit, Army Commander-in-Chief Gen. Pramon Palasin, Deputy
Army Commander-in-Chief Gen. Chetha Thanajaro and Navy
Commander-in-Chief Adm. Prachet Siridej.
</P>
<P>
Although the relations between the two countries have been
conflict-free for most of the time, problems remain over the
border demarcation at Ban Rom Klao, Pitsanulok, north Thailand,
said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Thailand wants to demarcate the entire border with Laos to
clear up the issue, but Laos wants to limit the demarcation to Ban
Rom Klao first.
</P>
<P>
The Thai navy chief is expected to discuss with Laos joint navy
patrols on the Mekong river, which serves as the border along a
long section between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Thai navy commander said that joint patrols will benefit
both countries by ensuring peace, suppressing contraband smuggling
and illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
The Thai side will also try to clear Laos' suspicion that
Thailand harbors right-wing Laotian groups hostile to Vientiane.
</P>
<P>
The Thai delegation is scheduled to make the visit on January
26-27.

<TEXT>

ISLAMABAD, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan government has
reconciliated with Hezb-i-Wahdat, one of its main rivals, which
led to reopening of a crucial supply route to Kabul, local press
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that a deal between the two sides had already
been signed in the past few days, which offered to cease
hostilities immediately, to open the road between Kabul and Bamyan
province, and to exchange POWs.
</P>
<P>
Hezb-i-Wahdat belonged to the three-party opposition alliance
which also included Junbush-i-Melli led by Rashid Dostum and
Hezb-i-Islami (Hekmatyar Group).
</P>
<P>
The report said that the accord between the former foes would
almost mean Wahdat's withdrawal from the alliance.
</P>
<P>
The balance of power in Afghanistan would be changed although
not enormously, it added.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the rapprochement to the mediation made
by Iran.
</P>
<P>
Several main roads to Kabul had been blocked due to the fierce
battles near the capital in recent months.
</P>
<P>
As winter came, the food and fuel supply became more and more
difficult for Kabul residents.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Ruling Party Plans New Formula to Resolve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) has decided on a new proposal for setting up an
advisory council headed by the country's president in a bid to
resolve the country's political crisis, sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the formula will be sent to the opposition
through US Ambassador to Dhaka David Merrill.
</P>
<P>
The opposition earlier pressed for a written proposal from the
BNP with a view to resolving the crisis through discussion on
written proposals put forward by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Under the new proposal, the president will enjoy the power of
the prime minister for an interim period after the resignation of
Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia, and head a 10-member council of
advisors to supervise the forthcoming parliamentary polls, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The council would be formed with an equal number of neutral
non-partisan personalities to be nominated by the ruling party and
the opposition.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that the prime minister held a three-hour
emergency meeting with her ministers on Sunday and made a decision
on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed that if the opposition finally stays out
of the election, the BNP will have no option but to join the
February 15 election to maintain the constitutional and democratic
process in the country.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream opposition parties have repeatedly stated that
they will boycott elections under the ruling BNP, and demanded
that a neutral caretaker government instead of the present
administration be set up to supervise the polls.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Tourism Hits New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Spain's tourist boom saw a new
upsurge in 1995 as 62.9 million tourists swarmed to the sunny
seashores of the European resort of 42 million people.
</P>
<P>
The record influx of foreign tourists last year, which equaled
one and a half times the country's population, was 2.8 percent
higher than the previous year's 60 million mark, said Secretary
General of Tourism Miguel Gongora.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the industry raked in 25.8 billion U.S. dollars in
revenue in 1995, up nine percent from the 23.3 billion dollars a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Tourism in 1995 accounted for nearly 10 percent of the
country's gross domestic product, an important contributor to the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
But the official deplored that robust though it was, the
industry failed to bring in the anticipated 63.1 million overseas
travelers and 26.5 billion dollars in revenue. He blamed the
failure on global competition.
</P>
<P>
To push the industry rolling further, said Gongora, traditional
tourist attractions like sunshine and fine beaches are simply not
enough.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Spain has to blaze a new trail by energetically
promoting cultural tourism and ecological tourism. Of course,
improving the quality of service is also essential, he said.

tourist missing in Thailand for over a month was found dead in a
cave near a temple in west Thailand, according to news reports
today.
</P>
<P>
The body of Johanne Masheder, of Cheshire, England, was found
badly decomposed in a small cave where monks of Wat (Temple) Khao
Poon in Kanchanaburi province dump their garbage.
</P>
<P>
At the temple, police arrested a Buddhist monk, Yodchat Suaphu,
21, on charges of robbing and murdering the foreign tourist. He
confessed to killing the woman.
</P>
<P>
Yodchat said that he offered to be Masheder's guide to show her
the caves in the area and pushed her down a 10-meter cave after
she resisted his robbery attempt.
</P>
<P>
He said that he wanted money to buy amphetamines because he was
a drug addict, according to police.
</P>
<P>
After her death, he went down the cave and took her valuables,
a camera and 600 baht (24 US dollars) in cash.
</P>
<P>
Police said the bruises found on her thighs suggested that the
suspect might have had sex with the corpse.
</P>
<P>
The murder suspect entered monkhood at the temple after his
release from jail eight months ago. He had served two years in
prison for rape, police said.
</P>
<P>
The finding was the result of a month-long manhunt after
Masheder's parents lost contact with her. Her father, Stewart
Masheder, flew to Bangkok early this month and lodged a complaint
with the Thai immigration police.
</P>
<P>
Police had traced her travels to various parts of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Several Western tourists have filed complaints against monks at
the temple.
</P>
<P>
Inge Holecek, an Australian woman, wrote to the Bangkok Post
saying that she had been raped by a monk at the temple ground on
December 7.
</P>
<P>
She claimed that she knew the same monk, whom she did not
identify, had sexually assaulted several other female tourists.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- While restricting credit to
curb inflation last year, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China and its branches at the same time channeled more funds into
key industries.
</P>
<P>
A larger proportion of loans were made in accordance with State
Council decrees to ensure the development of certain industries
and areas.
</P>
<P>
The bank's head office arranged for 23.1 billion yuan (2.78
billion US dollars) in loans, accounting for 13.1 percent of all
credit in 1995, 11.7 billion yuan of that being used for chemical
fertilizers, pesticides, railways, steel, coal, disaster relief,
and petrochemicals.
</P>
<P>
The bank made 100.3 billion yuan in loans, 53 percent of the
total in 1995, to 50 cities with a good efficiency rating to beef
up their future development.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they increased loans to key industrial and
commercial enterprises and key projects.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 1,000 key industrial enterprises got 23 billion yuan
in loans, accounting for 29 percent of all industrial loans. A
total of 1,200 large and medium-sized commercial businesses were
given 14 billion yuan in loans, accounting for 65 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 64.3 percent of the state's new fixed assets last
year went to 1,064 key projects.
</P>
<P>
The banking system made loans in co-ordination with the state's
reform efforts to optimize capital structure and establish a
modern enterprise system.

<HEADLINE> Hangzhou Residents Care for Orphans, Handicapped Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Ding hao, China's first
university student to come from a children's welfare institute,
often says: "I am grateful to the teachers and child-care workers
at my institute, as well as to thousands of people who cared for
me."
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the media in this capital of east China's
Zhejiang Province reported the story of Ding's enrollment in
Hangzhou University and lacking funds to pay for tuition, drawing
a great deal of attention to Ding and the Hangzhou Child Welfare
Institute, where he had been raised.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Hangzhou Electric Wheelchair Plant sent a
wheelchair to Ding and promised to be responsible for any repairs
for the wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
The Hangzhou Longchang Cereals and Foodstuffs Trading Company
donated 20,000 yuan to Ding to help pay for his studies in the
university.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xu, director of the institute, reported that, even after
Ding entered university, many Hangzhou residents continued to send
money or other items to him. She noted that, during those two
years, some 3,000 families or individuals and 30 enterprises have
donated nearly one million yuan to her institute.
</P>
<P>
"Some donors were women who had just given birth, some were
handicapped businesspeople, some were foreign investors in
Hangzhou, and others were senior citizens without children, living
on government allowances, while others were school children the
same age as those in my institute."
</P>
<P>
Hangzhou's Fangxie Real Estate Company has put a donation box
in full view of the public with the characters "Aixinyu"
(compassionate rain) printed on it. Every payday, the company's 16
workers put donations into the box.
</P>
<P>
They expressed the hope that their donations, though small in
amount, can help each child in the institute have one more pair of
socks, one more cup, or one more towel.
</P>
<P>
Hangzhou Vice-Mayor Xu Zhaoji says, "Orphans and handicapped
children need both material and spiritual assistance. Family
warmth and compassion are irreplaceable."
</P>
<P>
In the winter of 1994, a campaign of adopting orphans was
launched in Hangzhou, and seventeen families adopted 40 orphans at
the Hangzhou Child welfare Institute.
</P>
<P>
Li Dapeng, chairman of the Kangtelai Pharmaceutical Company, is
called "super father" by children at the institute. He adopted 28
orphans in the institute and pays for their food, tuition, and
child-care costs. The oldest child is 16 and the youngest is
three. Twenty of them have disabilities.
</P>
<P>
Although he's a very busy man, Li sets aside time during
holidays to visit the children and brings them books.
</P>
<P>
During holidays, Hangzhou city government officials and
provincial government leaders also come to the institute to extend
greetings to the children, and the Hangzhou newspaper, radio, and
TV stations often report news about the orphans and the
handicapped children.

<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Artist Wu Guanzhong won the
case he filed against the Shanghai-based Duoyunxuan Gallery for
attaching his name in a fake painting.
</P>
<P>
Wu is the first living Chinese artist to have had his paintings
exhibited in the British Museum. Two years ago, he was told by the
Gallery that his work "Bombardment of Bourgeois Headquarters" was
going to be auctioned in Hong Kong. Wu immediately notified the
Gallery that he had never painted such a work and asked that it be
withdrawn. However his words went unheeded and the fake painting
was sold to a Taiwanese Businessman for over 500,000 Hong Kong
dollars.
</P>
<P>
wu filed a case against the gallery in the Shanghai
Intermediate People's Court on September 28, 1995. the verdict was
meted out at last, the loser was ordered to make an apology to Wu
in People's Daily (overseas edition) and pay Wu 73,000 yuan to
compensate for the harm done to his reputation.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that artists are becoming increasingly concerned with
their own rights now. "My suit is the first ever of this kind in
the country. The correct handlng of it will have a positive
influence on the art market. The case has won back honour for us
artists and set a good example of protecting intellectual property
rights." Endiem

<HEADLINE> Singapore Supports Australia's Role In ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
of Singapore has expressed Singapore's support for Australia's
role in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the
Financial Review reported today.
</P>
<P>
Goh also described prospective Australian membership of ASEAN
as a "thinkable" idea, which was "to be put into the debate".
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Prime Minister made the remarks in an interview
with The Australian newspaper, which was made public today.
</P>
<P>
The interview was conducted on the eve of visits to Malaysia
and Singapore by Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, who left
here this morning for a three-day trip to the two nations.
</P>
<P>
This is Keating's first visit to Malaysia and third to
Singapore since he became prime minister at the end of 1991.
</P>
<P>
"We see Australia playing an important role (in ASEAN) and
certainly we would like to encourage Australia to do so," the
paper quoted Goh as reporting.
</P>
<P>
He said that "If you asked me now is it possible that Australia
and New Zealand may one day join ASEAN, I would say that both
countries are small enough to be considered as possible members
one of these days."
</P>
<P>
"But it depends again on the coinciding of interests, if there
is more trade between Australia and New Zealand with ASEAN
countries, more investments, more to-ing and fro-ing culturally,
people to people, then it is an idea which is thinkable...to be
put into the debate," he added.
</P>
<P>
Australia has given primary priority to South-East Asia, an
important component of its Asia-oriented foreign and trade policy.
</P>
<P>
Australia's exports to South-East Asia account for some 14
percent of its total now, with a growth rate of about 20 percent
over the past years.
</P>
<P>
In order to take advantage of Asia's booming economy, it has
left no stone unturned to try to set up links between the two
trade areas -- the ASEAN Free Trade Area, and the Closer economic
Relations (CER) made up of Australia and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of trade ministers from the two groups was
held in Brunei last September, marking the first step towards the
linkage between the two trade areas.
</P>
<P>
However, Australia's efforts to integrate into Asia have met
oppositions from Malaysia, which objects Australia's joining in
its proposed East Asian Economic Caucus and the Asia-Europe
Meeting to be held early this year.
</P>
<P>
Goh admitted that not every country like Singapore supports
Australia's integration into Asia. "Everybody knows that Malaysia
has some views on Australia joining the East Asian Economic Caucus
and the Asia-Europe meeting," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that "we will be supportive because Australia is
trading much more with Asia."

<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Socialist Jorge Sampaio defeated
former premier Anibal Cavaco Silva Sunday in elections to succeed
Mario Soares as Portugal's president.
</P>
<P>
Official figures of the election results showed Sampaio with
53.8 percent of the vote against 46.2 percent for Silva.
</P>
<P>
Silva lost his premiership in last October's parliamentary
elections when his Social Democrat Party was defeated by the
Socialists.
</P>
<P>
The election marked the first time that Portugal has chosen a
president and prime minister from the same party since democracy
was restored in 1974.
</P>
<P>
In a speech conceding defeat, Silva said, "My first words are
of congratulation to Jorge Sampaio for his election as president
of the republic. I wish him much success in his carrying out his
duties for the good of all Portuguese."
</P>
<P>
Soares has to step down after two consecutive terms in the
presidency. The 56-year-old Sampaio, former Lisbon mayor, is to
be sworn in March 9.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio pledged to work closely with the Socialist Prime
Minister Antonio Guterres and called for tolerance and unity in
the country.

<HEADLINE> China Resorts to Reclamation for More Arable Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- China will reclaim this year
more than 130,000 hectares of land left uncultivated mostly
because of construction and other man-made factors, today's "China
Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted an official with the State Land Administration
(SLA) as saying this is one of the government's moves to further
tap China's limited land resources.
</P>
<P>
Reaching the reclamation target will help roughly balance the
amount of newly-lost land with reclaimed land, the offical
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Under a plan released by the SLA, with the title of "the
National Programme for Land Reclamation in the Ninth Five-Year
Plan (1996-2000)," a total of 700,000 hectares of wasteland are
expected to be reconstructed for farming or other agricultural
purposes.
</P>
<P>
To minimize the loss of farmland due to industrial
construction, the government has decided to carry out a new cash
deposit system in which enterprises have to hand the State a
certain sum of money as funds for land reconstruction before using
the land, sources with the SLA disclosed.
</P>
<P>
It will compel industrial land-users to perform their
obligation of recovering damaged farmland, the sources said,
adding that the State land autorities would not approve projects
without a well-drafted reclamation scheme.
</P>
<P>
So far, the amount of wasteland caused by human activity totals
more than 13 million hectares. Of that amount, 60 to 70 percent
used to be well-cultivated of high-yield arable land, but only
some 533,000 hectares or four percent of the total has been
recovered, according to the latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
As a result, China's chronic problem caused by less arable land
and a large population is worse than ever before. Meanwhile,
persistent damage to farmland has already become a major factor
restricting the development of some local economies, with farmland
going out of cultivation or losing yield, water resources
declining, and the number of landslides increasing, the experts
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the experts were confident that more than 80 percent
of China's existing wasteland can be cultivated, which would
result in an increase of some ten million hectares of new land
capable of producing 28 billion kilograms of grain each year.
</P>
<P>
This, the experts said, will be a great task that not only
promotes a sustainable and co-ordinated development for the
economy and society today, but for the future as well.

<HEADLINE> 500,000-Year-Old Man's Tooth Fossil Unearthed in Shaanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
found a tooth fossil of a standing ape-man dating back to about
500,000 years ago, a Chinese newspaper has reported.
</P>
<P>
The tooth, as well as 26 ancient dwellings and caves and more
than 20,000 pieces of stonewares and animal fossils, were
unearthed in Shangluo area of northwest China's Shaanxi Province,
where a skull of 500,000 to 600,000 years old "Lantian Man" was
uncovered in Lantian County in 1964.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists of Shaanxi Archaeology Institute found the tooth
fossil when they excavated an ancient cave in Luonan County last
year, the overseas edition of "People's Daily" reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They also unearthed other remains of the ape-man dating back to
300,000 to 560,000 years ago, such as burned stones and bones,
stone and bone-wares, and more than 20 kinds of animal fossils,
including the giant panda, rhinoceros, bear, dear, horse and
cattle.
</P>
<P>
The new findings have provided further information about the
Early Stone Age in the region, including details on the lives and
skills of people at that time, the report quoted archaeologists as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The oldest ape-man so far found in China was "Yuanmou Man"
living in southwest China's Yunnan Province 1.7 million years ago,
who was thought the origin of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
The famous "Peking Man", whose skull was uncovered in suburban
Beijing in the 1920s, was 400,000 to 500,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi Province is also famous for its life-size terra cotta
warriors and horses left from the Qin Dynasty (221-207 BC)
discovered near its capital Xi'an.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Funds Needed for Urban Infrastructure Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- China will use more foreign
funds to speed up the construction of its urban infrastructure
facilities during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000) so
as to meet the need of the developing national economy, according
to a recent international seminar held here in Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
The three-day seminar, co-sponsored by the State Commission for
Restructuring the Economy, the World Bank and the French Ministry
for Public Projects, Transportation and Tourism, focused on
restructuring the investment system concerning the construction of
urban infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
From 1985 to 1993, China's investments in the construction of
urban gas and water supply projects rose to 3.4 billion yuan
(about 409 million US dollars) and 5.948 billion yuan from 750
million yuan and 558 million yuan, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, urban gasification has reached 57 percent and
93.1 percent of the urban households are now using running water.
</P>
<P>
And 47 percent of the 100 billion US dollars of foreign
government and commercial loans used by the Chinese government
between 1975 and 1994 were spent on urban infrastructure
construction.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to become the world's largest investment
market for developing infrastructure facilities in the next five
to ten years, according to experts attending the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that as many as 340 million people are now
living in urban China and the urban population is
expected to grow rapidly in the next ten years, with urban
population accounting for more than 50 percent of the total
population in China by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Investment in infrastructure will account for 7-8 percent of
China's gross domestic product (GDP), with total investment
hitting 280 billion US dollars in 1996-2000 if China maintains an
annual economic growth rate of 8-9 percent during the period, the
World Bank predicted.

<HEADLINE> Former Hunters Now Protecting Rare Wild Animals in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- In Nagqu Prefecture, home of the
Tibet Autonomous Region's largest nature reserve, local people who
had made their living from hunting for generations are now being
taught to protect rare wild animals.
</P>
<P>
Located on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, Tibet has very special
natural environment with more than a hundred species of rare birds
and animals and some unique species.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 30 years, the region has done research on rare
wild animals on a large scale. Scientists estimate that the region
has 20 species of rare animals and they have clearly identified 15
kinds of animals, such as the Yunnan snubed-nosed monkey and
sambur, and 39 rare birds, such as the black-necked crane, which
are under the state's highest level of protection.
</P>
<P>
Some 125 species of rare animals, or one-third of China's total
have been found in Tibet. An integrated natural protection
network, covering 90 percent of the region's rare wild animals,
has been set up.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the region's counties have designated
off-limits areas for hunting and species that cannot be hunted,
three of these having been set up in Markam County, mainly to
protect white lipped deer, blue sheep, and eared pheasants.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the number of the endangered species of wild
animals in the region have doubled. In Zayu and Medog counties,
the number of takin increased from several hundred to more than a
thousand after the the nature reserve was established.
</P>
<P>
Doctor George B Shailer from the US's Wildlife Conservation
Association, said, after visiting the nature reserve for
black-necked cranes in Tibet, that he never expected that Tibet
would have some 3,900 black-necked cranes, because it was
generally agreed that there were fewer than 1,000 black-necked
cranes in the world.
</P>
<P>
This change in people's attitude was the result of a
highly-publicized wildlife protection campaign carried out by
forestry departments and the mass media in the region.
</P>
<P>
An example of the co-operation occurred earlier this year, when
local people in Markam County in the region's Qamdo Prefecture
saved an injured pregnant wapiti (red deer) from wolves in an area
where they were working. After more than a month of nursing at the
county's Forestry Bureau, the animal was set loose in the
forest. And, in January of 1991, Gyalcan Norbu, chairman of the
Tibet autonomous regional government, set free a black-necked
crane, which was being kept by local departments.

<P>

1990s would lift the economy's "speed limits" and make the Federal

<HEADLINE> Enterprises in Heilongjiang benefit from Hi-tech Corners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Hi-tech corners have accelerated
the reform of large and medium-sized enterprises in Northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The department of science management began to establish hi-tech
corners last year for those enterprises, which have been suffering
from the stiff mechanism, low economic returns and a poor sense of
scientific progress.
</P>
<P>
The corners, though attached to the enterprises, are
comparatively independent economic entities, integrated with
scientific research, development, production and marketing.
</P>
<P>
They are under the leadership of the board of directors, with
the managers in charge. The science management personnel and
working staff are employed according to their ability, with the
payment and bonus linked to their contributions.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the contract, the corners should develop the
new products and make new contributions for the enterprises within
three or four years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that the hi-tech corners, set up in the
province's five enterprises last year, have developed new
competitive products, and brought them a combined output value of
91.86 million yuan (about 11.07 million US dollars) and a total
profit of 10.88 million yuan (about 1.31 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the hi-tech corners are playing an important
role in promoting the scientific progress of the enterprises,
restructuring their science institutes and in establishing a
modern enterprise system.

<HEADLINE> Zhou Enlai Fan Collects Memorabilia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Tienan, a machinist at a
textile plant in Beijing, never imagined he would turn out to be
so successful in his collection of materials on the late Premier
Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
But, after two decades of arduous effort he has collected some
1,000 books, 1,000 newspapers, and more than 10,000 pictures all
dealing with his beloved late premier Zhou Enlai. His collection
include the late premier's earliest and last pictures, as well as
publications from Indonesia, Malaysia, Japan and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The late premier is a great man of our time and a rare hero of
the Chinese nation," Zhou Tienan said.
</P>
<P>
He started collecting the items in 1973, and the premier's
death not long after that, in 1976, made it more worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
Although Zhou Tienan and his wife have a combined monthly
income of 1,000 yuan (about 119 US dollars), they spend 200 yuan
each month on various things dealing with the late premier.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Tienan has no video or CD players, but he has bought discs
that have to do with the late premier. "Someday, they will be very
useful," Zhou explained. He has walked all over the nation's
capital, to libraries, book stores, and through relics markets, in
support of his magnificent obsession.
</P>
<P>
The greatest sorrow that he feels for the late premier is that
he never visited America, though he visited Africa, Europe, and
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The great hope Zhou now has is that he can hold a personal
exhibition on the late premier on March 3, 1998 on the centenary
of the birth of the late Chinese premier.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't part with my collection even for one million yuan,"
Zhou said proudly, though it's not as if he couldn't use the
money.

<HEADLINE> UK Eager to Share Reconstruction in Former Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The British government is to
make a determined effort to ensure that British business wins a
share of the lucrative reconstruction work in former Yugoslavia,
according to a report in Financial Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
A number of British companies are concerned that they could
miss out in the same way as they did in rebuilding Kuwait
following the Gulf war, when U.S. companies took the lion's share
of the reconstruction work there.
</P>
<P>
In view of the fact that the U.S. and France are already
mounting strong campaign to win work for their companies in the
former Yugoslav states, officials of Britain's Foreign Office and
Trade and Industry Department will make visits to these states in
the next couple weeks to establish contacts with the authorities
responsible for awarding work.
</P>
<P>
The British officials will also try to identify contract
opportunities, estimated by the World Bank to be worth five
billion dollars in Bosnia alone.
</P>
<P>
At present, some UK companies have been working in former
Yugoslavia, including Amec, a construction group which since July
1992 has maintained a small group of engineers in Sarajevo working
alongside representatives of the British Overseas Development
Agency.

LONDON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Workers at the largest Ford
factory in Britain have stopped work while Vauxhall workers are
being balloted on whether to accept a 4.5 percent rise, according
to press reports.
</P>
<P>
Almost 300 workers involved in the truck fleet in a Ford
factory in east London that delivers parts to various plants and
suppliers have taken part in the stoppage as a reaction to the
management's refusal to improve its wages offer.
</P>
<P>
Management said that the strike could cost Ford 1.6 million
pounds (2.4 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The unions are demanding a 10 percent pay increase in
recognition of massive productivity rises to 130 percent over the
last eight years and a two-hour reduction in the working week.
</P>
<P>
But the company refused to improve on its offer of 4.75 percent
increase this year and 4.5 percent or inflation plus 0.5 percent
next year and insisted that there could be no cut in working
hours.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Ford's 22,000 production workers will soon
been balloted on whether to take industrial action over the offer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vauxhall workers at two factories in Bedfordshire
and Cheshire are being balloted on whether to accept a 4.5 percent
pay rise now, followed by an increase in line with inflation (at
present 3.1 percent) over the next two years, as well as a
one-hour cut in the 39-hour week.
</P>
<P>
Charles Golden, chairman and managing director of Vauxhall, has
written to all 7,700 production workers, stressing that the offer
was final.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the security of the workers' jobs would be
threatened if they did not accept the offer.

CAIRO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's current proven reserves of
crude oil amount to some 112 billion barrels and its future
reserves are estimated at 214 billion barrels, official statistics
have indicated.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports reaching here today, statistics

The Iraqi government intends, immediately after the lifting of
the international embargo, to return to the world oil market by
exporting 2 million barrels of oil a day.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Oil Ministry said that this amount will be
increased to 3.5 million barrels a day two years after the lifting
of the embargo, which the U.N. imposed on the country after its
1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Israel Wants to Market Water from Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel has expressed interest in
the international marketing of the waters of the Seyhan and
Ceyhan rivers in southern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The issue, brought on the agenda during the visit of Foreign
Ministry Undersecretary Onur Oymen to Israel last week, will be
discussed further at a technical level.
</P>
<P>
The initial Israeli proposal is to transport the water by
tankers to prospective buyers but now Israel calls for the
building of a station in the area.
</P>
<P>
The two rivers discharge into the Mediterranean, close to the
Turco-Syrian border.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is interested in the international marketing of
Turkish waters," Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Nurettin
Nurkan said here today.
</P>
<P>
Turkish sources said that the modalities would be discussed in
the coming days among experts.
</P>
<P>
The Seyhan and Ceyhan, which flow through Cukurova, were an
essential source of water in late President Turgut Ozal's "peace
pipeline project."
</P>
<P>
Under the project, Turkey is to link its Arab neighbors with a
"waterline" that would meet part of their needs, but the project,
which called for water pipelines throughout the Arabian Peninsula,
was dismissed as "economically and politically infeasible" by
Turkey's Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The average flow of the two rivers is 39.17 million cubic
meters of water per day. Planned Turkish use for those rivers is
about 23.04 million cubic meters per day thus leaving some 16.1
million cubic meters available.
</P>
<P>
Under the "peace pipeline project," Turkey planned to give 6
million cubic meters of water a day.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations will
soon launch a multi-million-dollar "special initiative" on
Africa, Executive Secretary of the UN Economic Commission for
Africa (ECA) K.Y. Amoako announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of a seminar organized by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) on the establishment of an
early warning system on conflict situations in Africa, Amoako

administative committee on coordination in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
"An intensive process of consultation is currently underway
with african leaders, countires and organizations as well as the
inter-national community" to ensure the implementation of the
initiative, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Amoako indicated that the UN special initiative will establish
a trust fund in support of the OAU's peace building
efforts.
</P>
<P>
"This fund, to be run by the United Nations Development
Programme, will be created on an endowment basis to ensure the
continuity of contributions to the OAU," he said.

The preliminary estimate of a meaningful endowment would be
100 million US dollars, to be contributed over a five-year
period, according to the ECA secretary.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister
All Akbar Velayati, who arrived here today on a two-day visit,
said that Iran and Kuwait are bound by good-neighborly relations.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait News Agency reported that Velayati, who was received
at the airport by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah
al-Ahmed al-Sabah, said in a statement to the agency that he would
convey a message from the Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani to
Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah.
</P>

The Iranian official said that the two countries are keen on
bolstering bilateral relations and asserted this has been
manifested by intensive exchange of visits by high-level officials
on strengthening these relations in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Iran and Kuwait were once strained
because of Kuwait's support of Iraq during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq
war.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said his talks with kuwaiti officials would cover
issues of mutual concern, ways of promoting bilateral relations
and mechanisms of cooperation in regard to regional issues and
developments.
</P>
<P>
It was Velayati's second visit to the country since May 1993.
</P>
<P>
Velayati's delegation groups Foreign Ministry officials and
Saeed Rajaei Kharasani, member of the foreign relations committee
of the Consultative Council, who advocates rapprochement between
Iran and the Arab Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti deputy prime minister, on his part, said "we are
happy at Velayati's visit to Kuwait," indicating that his
discussions with Velayati would cover bilateral relations, Gulf
and Arab matters.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pays Tribute to Late Civil Rights Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
led the nation Monday in commemorating the civil rights legacy and
contribution to peace of Martin Luther King Jr. on the anniversary
of his 67th birthday.
</P>
<P>
The president joined King's family at the Ebenezer Baptist
Church in Atlanta, where King and his father preached, according
to press reports.
</P>
<P>
"In this holiday we celebrate the life of a man who challenged
us to face our flaws and become a better nation," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was flanked by King's widow, Coretta Scott King, and
son, Dexter Scott King.
</P>
<P>
In a proclamation issued a few days ago, Clinton said that
King, who was assassinated in 1968, "focused attention on the
segregation that poisoned our society and whose example moved our
nation to embrace a new standard of openness and inclusion."
</P>
<P>
The ground of a former pencil factory was added today to the
Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site in Atlanta. The land
will be converted into a parking lot for a visitors center being
built by the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
The King Center, which is run by King's family, held its annual
march and rally today. Emory University showed a portfolio of rare
photographs taken during the last year of King's life.

<HEADLINE> Africa Faces Twin Challenges, Says Ethiopian Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Economic underdevelopment
and conflict are the twin challenges facing Africa, Speaker of
the Council of People's Representatives of Ethiopia Dawit
Yohannes said here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the opening session of an OAU-organised
seminar on the establishment of an early warning system on the
conflict situations in Africa at the Africa Hall here.
</P>
<P>
He said he deliberately referred to these challenges as twins
because there are clear linkages and inter connection between
them.
</P>
<P>
"The sharp economic decline that African countries went
through in the last three decades has not only eroded the social
values and norms upheld by communities, but has also created a
wide spread sense of hopelessness and frustration, thus creating
a fertile ground for conflicts," he said.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, conflicts that have now become
characteristic features of many countires in Africa, have been
the major cause for the perpetuation and further aggravation of
the economic backwardness and social chaos."
</P>
<P>
He said, "Africa has to assume the major responsibility in
overcoming its own problems".
</P>
<P>
"We have to bring our minds and resources together so as to
achieve the desired results in the shortest time possible," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The speaker said the issue of conflicts in Africa is now a
priority agenda item of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
The four-day seminar will discuss issues on the effects of
armed conflicts in Africa and the early warning networks in OAU.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Official on Possibility of Peace Accord between Israel and Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel has assured Turkey that
it will not sign a peace agreement with Syria as long as that
country continues to support terrorism, Turkish Foreign Ministry
deputy spokesman Nurettin Nurkan said here today.
</P>
<P>
Nurkan, talking on the visit of Turkey's Foreign Ministry
Undersecretary Onur Oymen to Israel last week, said that Ankara
had been told by Prime Minister Shimon Peres that a peace deal
between Syria and Israel could not be signed unless the support of
Damascus for terrorist organizations, which includes the illegal
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), was "completely cut."
</P>
<P>
Nurkan's declaration came after a report prepared by Greece
said that PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who lives in Damascus, and
Rifat al-Assad, brother of Syrian leader Hafez al-Assad, were
cooperating in drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Nurkan said, "However, we are aware of the Syrian support of
terrorism and clearly, this should be cut in line with Syria's
international obligations."
</P>
<P>
"Turkey and Israel have noted the regional danger posed by
terrorism and expressed full consensus that no credit should be
given to countries which see and use terrorism as a method to
further their political aims," Nurkan said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Orphanages Are Well Cared For,  Children's Bridge Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Children's Bridge, an
international adoption agency in Canada said in a memorandum that
Chinese orphanages including the disabled children are "well fed
and well cared for".
</P>
<P>
The memorandum dated January 12 and available here today forms
a sharp contrast with the allegations of abuse and deliberate
neglect resulting in death in Chinese orphanages as reported in
the British documentary, "The Dying Room" and recent reports from
the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
It said the Children's Bridge has been actively involved in
adoptions of Chinese children since 1991. "In the course of those
adoptions, approximately 200 persons involved with the Children's
Bridge have visited 18 orphanages in Central China. Several of our
parents have been health care professionals," it said.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum said "our parents have freely taken between 50
and 60 hours of videotape and hundreds of photographs. In the
course of their visits, they have had little or no restraints in
terms of their tours through the orphanages."
</P>
<P>
"In our involvement with these Chinese orphanages not one of
our parents has reported or filmed any evidence of mistreatment of
any of the children at any time," it said.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum said "over the course of these visits, we have
encountered many disabled children who appear clean, well fed and
well cared for."
</P>
<P>
The Children's Bridge has become increasingly concerned with
the allegations reported by the British Broadcasting Corporation
and the Human Rights Watch, the memorandum said. "It is essential
that our hundreds of positive contacts with Chinese orphanages be
balanced against the two reports."
</P>
<P>
It said "our interactions with the doctors, directors, nurses
and nannies associated directly with the orphanages and with the
officials of the China welfare ministry have, without exception,
been very positive and characterized by their genuine concern with
the well being and welfare of the children in their charge."
