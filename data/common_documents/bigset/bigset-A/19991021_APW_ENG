<HEADLINE> Car Bomb Kills Turkish Intellectual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- A prominent, pro-secular Turkish professor  
and journalist died today when a bomb left on his car exploded. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb was in a plastic bag left on the windshield of Ahmet  
Taner Kislali's car, which was parked in front of his suburban 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anatolia news agency said the bomb went off when he picked  
up the bag. 
</P>
<P>
	Private television NTV said a radical Islamic group, the Great  
Eastern Islamic Raiders' Front, had claimed responsibility. 
Authorities would not confirm the report. 
</P>
<P>
	An outspoken supporter of Turkey's secular regime, Kislali often  
used his column to criticize Islamic fundamentalism. 
</P>
<P>
	In a column this week, Kislali denounced Turkey's leaders for  
tolerating religious fundamentalism and touched on the case of an 
Islamic sect leader charged with inciting religious hatred for 
saying the August earthquake, which killed more than 17,000 people, 
was God's revenge for secularism. 
</P>
<P>
	A political science professor and columnist for the leftist  
daily Cumhuriyet, Kislali served as culture minister in the late 
1970s. He was a member of parliament from 1977 to 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	He is one of several pro-secular academicians and journalists  
killed in bombings this decade.

<HEADLINE> Report: Spy Network Eavesdropping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An ultra-secret spy network reportedly is  
eavesdropping on e-mails -- looking for words suggesting terrorist 
plots and other nefarious acts -- and prompting angry Internet users 
to try to overwhelm the listeners by flooding the system with 
fabricated messages. 
</P>
<P>
	In an attempt at electronic civil disobedience Thursday,  
organizers urged Internet users on dozens of Web sites and in 
discussion groups to bombard the U.S. National Security Agency with 
millions of e-mails with subversive-sounding language. ``Give the 
(NSA) their keywords!'' one person wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear who thought up ``Jam Echelon Day,'' as it was  
called in one message from an Australia-based Web site, but the 
intent was clear: Flood the NSA's powerful computers with enough 
suspicious traffic to crash them and disrupt the high-tech 
listening system, code-named ``Echelon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 report commissioned by the European Parliament described  
``routine and indiscriminate'' monitoring of fax, e-mail and 
telephone messages in Europe by the global spy network, which it 
said was coordinated by the NSA with the help of other nations' 
security organizations. A follow-up study for the European Union 
this year found the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., has said he supports congressional  
hearings to determine the scope of the spy network's capabilities 
and to prevent abuses. The network is said to include a listening 
station in Sugar Grove, W.Va., about 250 miles from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The NSA, which is barred by law from spying on U.S. citizens,  
declined to comment Thursday on its network or the potential impact 
of the day's e-mail campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agency doesn't discuss alleged intelligence operations,''  
NSA spokeswoman Judith Emmel said. ``It doesn't confirm or deny any 
Echelon-type technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even supporters of the jamming campaign were pessimistic  
that their efforts would have much effect. They suggested the spy 
network was smart enough to ignore the e-mails typically sent with 
lists of random words, especially since many of the messages were 
in English -- not in Arabic or Indonesian, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will cause a lot of laughter up at NSA, to tell the  
truth,'' said Wayne Madsen of the Washington-based Electronic 
Privacy Information Center, who tracks news about Echelon. ``If 
they seriously think they're going to bring the computers at the 
NSA to a grinding halt, they're going to be seriously 
disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It will not, in fact, have any effect on their operations,''  
agreed Duncan Campbell of Edinburgh, Scotland, who wrote the most 
recent report about Echelon for the EU. ``They're used to 
electronic warfare and screening out noise put up by enemies. This 
is noise from dissenting citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said even if their e-mail campaign didn't cause the  
NSA's computers to crash, it was important at raising awareness of 
the spy network's rumored abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Internet, where conspiracy theorists flourish, it was  
impossible to count how many e-mails protesters might actually have 
sent, much less determine their effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we'll ever know,'' said Simon Davies, who heads  
London-based Privacy International, a human rights organization. 
``I would guess maybe it will be 10 years before we understand the 
ramifications of any civil disobedience campaign.''

<HEADLINE> Astros' Caminiti Hurts Back in Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros third baseman Ken Caminiti, who  
missed 79 games this season with a calf problem, sustained three 
fractures in his lower back after falling from a deer blind during 
a South Texas hunting trip. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened early Wednesday near Laredo. Caminiti was  
expected to remain at Methodist Hospital in Houston through Friday, 
then spend the next eight weeks recuperating. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros used the disabled list 16 times during the season.  
The barrage began before spring training when outfielder Moises 
Alou sustained a season-ending knee injury after reportedly falling 
off a treadmill. 
</P>
<P>
	First baseman Jeff Bagwell and second baseman Craig Biggio were  
the only regular position players who missed no time because of 
injuries in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Thursday, team doctors said surgery successfully  
tightened ligaments in the throwing shoulder of right-handed 
starter Scott Elarton. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Caminiti and Elarton are expected to be ready for spring  
training.

<HEADLINE> NBA Resumes Drug Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Drug testing in the NBA was suspended for six  
days after the identities of two players who tested positive for 
marijuana were disclosed to a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	The testing resumed Wednesday, and all players will have been  
subjected to urinalysis by next week. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first season in which NBA players are being tested  
for marijuana and steroids. Veterans can only be tested once, 
unless they produce a positive sample. Rookies are tested 
throughout the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The players' union sent a letter to all players in September  
urging anyone who smoked marijuana to come forward and seek 
treatment if they feared they would produce a dirty sample. 
</P>
<P>
	A first-time offender must undergo mandatory counseling, and a  
second positive test would include a $15,000 fine. Subsequent 
positive tests would result in five-game suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They let us know about it, so it shouldn't be a problem,''  
Knicks forward John Wallace said. ``It's just a matter of doing 
what you've got to do to make sure that when the time comes you're 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The identities of two players who tested positive were revealed  
to The New York Times, although the newspaper did not name them. 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure clearly caused friction between the union and the  
league. The information is considered highly sensitive, and both 
sides were suspicious that the other had leaked the names. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the players themselves did not know they had tested  
positive until a reporter from The Times alerted them. The drug 
agreement says players who test positive will not be told so until 
all the testing is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times report also said that six players had tested positive  
for marijuana during the first week of testing, which began in 
early October. Teams are not notified in advance of the date of 
their tests, and players have typically arrived at practice to find 
representatives from the league and union waiting for them to 
produce urine samples. 
</P>
<P>
	``The press asked for it, the commissioner asked for it, we used  
it during the (collective) bargaining session to get something we 
wanted,'' union president Patrick Ewing said earlier this month. 
``We gave it up, that's it. No sense crying about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Houston of the Knicks welcomed the policy, saying it  
seemed overdue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just disappointed that it is treated so lightly in  
general, not just in our league,'' Houston said, referring to 
marijuana. ``That's the problem, it's not a problem of testing. 
You'd think it wouldn't be a problem because we are professional 
athletes, but the problem is that it's glorified in some areas of 
our culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember when I was in high school, I looked at that as  
crack. But now, it's like a cigarette, and I think that's why it 
has become what it is in our league,'' Houston said.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Court OKs Lump Tobacco Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- An appeals court has ruled that a lump-sum payment  
may be awarded to plaintiffs in a landmark suit against Big Tobacco 
-- a payment that lawyers for cigarette makers fear could cripple 
the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3rd District Court of Appeal ruled Wednesday that the same  
jurors who decided the nation's largest cigarette makers are liable 
for making a deadly product can decide on a single sum for punitive 
damages instead of on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco industry lawyer Dan Webb had warned the court that  
permitting such a lump-sum award for 500,000 sick Florida smokers 
could exceed $300 billion, which ``would destroy any industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The stakes have suddenly become humongous,'' said Northeastern  
University law professor Richard Daynard, head of an anti-tobacco 
clearinghouse. ``The fate of the industry rests on this jury that 
has already found that the industry has behaved outrageously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the jury found that the nation's five largest cigarette  
makers produced a product that causes emphysema, lung cancer and 
other illnesses. The same panel is to determine damages in the 
second phase of the trial, set to begin Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the appeals court agreed with the industry that  
damages should be decided one smoker at a time. Investors rejoiced, 
figuring the tobacco industry could more easily defend itself 
against lots of small awards than against one big 
multibillion-dollar verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	But the same appeals court withdrew its decision and agreed to  
reconsider. On Wednesday, just hours after hearing arguments from 
both sides, the three-judge panel issued an unanimous, 
one-paragraph ruling without explaining its reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
	Presiding Judge David Levy, who heard the case along with Judges  
Mario Goderich and Melvia Green, said the appeals court ``cannot 
micromanage what the trial judge does'' as long as he's not 
exceeding his authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for both sides are prohibited from discussing the case.  
</P>
<P>
	The defendants are Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, Brown &AMP;  
Williamson Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, the Liggett Group and the 
industry's Council for Tobacco Research-U.S.A and Tobacco Institute 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Feldman, a tobacco analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, said  
the ruling probably increases the chance that the industry will try 
to settle the case out of court. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. juries have awarded damages in smoking liability cases only  
five times -- twice in Florida and once in New Jersey, Oregon and 
California. The Florida and New Jersey verdicts were overturned on 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The $206 billion national settlement reached with the tobacco  
industry in November bars states from suing to recoup the costs of 
treating sick smokers but doesn't stop lawsuits by individuals.

<HEADLINE> Justice Department Sues Ohio City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The Justice Department on Thursday sued  
the city of Columbus, charging a pattern of civil rights violations 
by the police department. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations include excessive force, false arrests and  
improper searches. The Justice Department reviewed more than 300 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit comes the day after the local Fraternal Order of  
Police rejected an offer to settle the case. The city and Justice 
Department reached a tentative settlement agreement in August, but 
union approval was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus was only the third city in the United States to be  
threatened with such a lawsuit by the Justice Department's Civil 
Rights Division. Steubenville and Pittsburgh reached agreements -- 
known as consent decrees -- in which they promised to correct 
problems in the training, supervision and discipline of officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said it found a pattern of civil rights  
abuses in the 1,700-member Columbus police department. The 
investigation also included a review of recent lawsuits and records 
from a 1996 mayoral investigation of Police Chief James Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone messages were not immediately returned Thursday from  
the city attorney's office and police union President William 
Capretta. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, demands improvements  
in the training and supervision of police officers, and the 
investigation of civilian complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would still prefer to bring about needed changes in the  
police department through negotiations, rather than contested 
litigation,'' said Bill Lann Lee, acting assistant atttorney 
general for civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	In the proposed settlement, the city would not have admitted  
liability, and the police department and individual officers would 
not be penalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Provisions of the agreement included:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Appointment of an independent monitor, to be paid for by the  
city, to ensure that agreement requirements are met. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Increased training, including a requirement that new officers  
complete a four-month field training program. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The hiring of a deputy director of training, who will ensure  
that officer training meets police needs. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Establishment of reporting procedures for instances involving  
the use of force, serious law enforcement related injuries, 
warrantless searches and seizures and traffic stops. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement would have been in effect for five years. The city  
could ask that it be ended early if it establishes substantial 
compliance after two years.

<HEADLINE> IBM Stock Plunges on Y2K Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM's stock lost one-fifth of its value today,  
slicing more than 100 points off the Dow Jones industrial average, 
after the company warned that fears of the Year 2000 computer bug 
are hurting sales even more than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Although strong demand for software and systems support drove  
IBM's third-quarter profits 14 percent higher, matching most 
forecasts, the results reported late Wednesday weren't hearty 
enough to overshadow the accompanying warning from the company. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Year 2000 date change threatening to cause widespread  
computer failures, would-be buyers of IBM's powerful network and 
database servers are proving extremely hesitant about complicating 
matters by adding new systems, IBM said. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from that business dropped 40 percent in the third  
quarter compared with a particularly strong showing in the same 
period last year, and the weakness is expected to continue through 
the fourth quarter and into January, executives warned. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is more apparent that many customers had bought ahead to  
accommodate Y2K testing'' of their existing computer systems, and 
``slowed the deployment of more complex systems ... until after the 
millennium,'' said Doug Maine, IBM's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine noted that 70 percent of the world's business data is  
managed by IBM servers. Those machines, including banking and 
airline reservations systems, ``simply cannot go down,'' he said. 
But, Maine added, ``once we get past these lingering Year 2000 
effects, we should see an acceleration of demand'' for heavy-duty 
systems to meet the explosion of Internet-related commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the report was released Wednesday, IBM's stock had soared  
to $112.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. But when the report was 
released after the close of that exchange, the stock sank on other 
markets affiliated with the NYSE, closing at $107, and then 
continued to plunge in after-hours trading. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, IBM's shares opened at $90.12 1/2 on the NYSE, a drop  
of $16.87 1/2 from Wednesday's NYSE closing price and $22.62 1/2 below 
the 4 p.m. quote used to calculate the closing price of the Dow 
Jones industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
	A drop of $22.62 1/2 by IBM, one of the 30 companies that make up  
the Dow, is equivalent to 114-point loss by that famous market 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, the Dow had jumped 187 points on Wednesday as a strong  
profit report from Microsoft helped restore confidence following a 
weak third-quarter showing from Intel last week. It wasn't clear 
whether IBM's slowdown, possibly only temporary, would extinguish 
the market's renewed optimism or be treated as an isolated problem. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM also said its third-quarter results were hurt by shortages  
of flat-panel computer screens for its ThinkPad laptops, as well as 
price competition in the market for computer harddrives. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's third-quarter operating profit amounted to $1.69  
billion, or 90 cents per share, for the July-September period. 
</P>
<P>
	Those figures exclude a $366 million gain from the sale of the  
company's Web services unit to AT&AMP;T Corp. and other one-time 
factors that gave IBM a net profit of $1.76 billion, or 93 cents 
per share. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, IBM earned $1.49 billion or 78 cents a share in the  
year-ago period, when there were no one-time factors. 
</P>
<P>
	The operating profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 was in  
line with analyst forecasts, according to a survey by First 
Call/Thomson Financial, marking the 14th straight quarter IBM has 
met or exceeded expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, IBM's third-quarter revenues rose 5 percent to $21.14  
billion, up from $20.10 billion a year ago. Most of that gain came 
from the systems management unit, IBM Global Services, where 
revenues rose 12 percent to $7.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, IBM's net profit totaled  
$5.61 billion or $2.99 per share, including a one-time gain of $750 
million from the AT&AMP;T deal and other one-time factors. In the same 
period a year ago, IBM earned $3.97 billion, or $2.05 a share. 
Nine-month revenues totaled $63.37 billion, up 12 percent from 
$56.54 billion tallied at the same point last year.

<HEADLINE> Architect of Capitol Rebuked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Uncollected trash. Dirty restrooms. Leaky  
sinks and toilets. Bugs. Layers of dust. 
</P>
<P>
	A description of a decaying neighborhood?  
</P>
<P>
	Hardly.  
</P>
<P>
	These are complaints by the Senate's top two leaders about the  
``general state of uncleanliness'' on the Senate side of the 
Capitol complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader Tom  
Daschle, D-S.D., aimed a sharply written letter at embattled 
Architect of the Capitol Alan M. Hantman. Their complaints were 
read to Hantman during a hearing examining the upkeep of 
congressional buildings and treatment of Congress' work force. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate letter, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., demanded  
relief for Senate restaurant workers who were reporting ``verbal 
and physical abuse'' by supervisors in the architect's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides confronting Hantman with the letters, members of the  
Senate Committee on Rules and Administration told the architect he 
mismanaged construction of a new Senate day care center that had a 
potentially deadly mold -- and reminded him that in the past year, 
his office was formally cited for fire and worker safety 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some offices are so poorly cleaned that dust heavily  
accumulates, trash collection does not always occur on a daily 
basis, and internal stairs and hallways often are not vacuumed or 
cleaned,'' Lott and Daschle wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Hantman acknowledged to the committee that his office has had  
some maintenance problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think improvement is necessary in the cleanliness of the  
buildings,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He blamed delays with the child care center on contractors and  
said allegations of mistreatment of employees ``could not be 
substantiated.'' But he promised that any lack of respect for 
workers was ``not acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and Daschle, saying in their letter that other senators  
were complaining to them, cited ``unwashed windows, bug 
infestations and major plumbing leaks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Public restrooms and public eating areas are expected to be  
kept clean and sanitary, but we are told that is not always the 
case,'' the leaders wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., told Hantman that the problem  
might have something to do with a reduction in Senate custodial 
workers over the past six years from 130 to 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called the day care  
center delays ``a horror story.'' The facility, a new building, 
originally was supposed to open two years ago but was delayed 
largely due to the discovery of potentially deadly stachybotrys 
mold. 
</P>
<P>
	With the mold finally eradicated, the most recent planned  
opening on Sept. 1 has been delayed again, because new mold spores 
have been found -- less serious but enough to keep the children out, 
said Lisa Tuite, a Senate employee and president of the center's 
board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	``As one would expect, the cost of the mismanagement by the  
(Architect's) office is more than any nonprofit can stand,'' she 
wrote McConnell, citing a financial burden of $140,000 based on 
lost revenue and the hiring of a consultant to deal with the mold. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Senate is financing construction, parents pay $8,000  
to $9,000 annually for their children to receive day care, 
currently at an older, smaller building. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a bunch of employees here concerned about their  
children because you got this all fouled up,'' McConnell told 
Hantman, who estimated to the skeptical senators the center would 
be ready in three to five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a real crisis here,'' added Sen. Dianne Feinstein,  
D-Calif., who suggested to Hantman that ``we charge your budget'' 
for the parents' losses. Architect officials said they are formally 
seeking permission from the Senate to transfer money to the 
center's treasury. 
</P>
<P>
	Feinstein told Hantman that he should ``have someone down there  
full time to get this project finished,'' and added, after a pause, 
``How about you yourself getting down there.'' She attributed the 
problems to ``lack of oversight and leadership'' by Hantman's 
office.

	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A local law that would have stopped a  
Christian activist from displaying a creche outside the government 
center at Christmas time was overturned by a divided federal 
appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 9-3 that Fairfax  
County had no right to ban nonresidents from using an area 
designated for ``civic, cultural, educational, religious, 
recreational and similar activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rita Warren, who lives outside Fairfax County, had claimed that  
her due-process and free-speech rights were violated when the 
county refused to grant her a permit for the creche display. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so happy,'' Ms. Warren said after the ruling. ``The First  
Amendment has won, not Rita Warren. If we lose that, we lose 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III wrote in an opinion concurring  
with the full appeals court's majority decision: ``Speech in 
America cannot be that parochial. ... Surely a speaker is entitled 
to spread the faith or the political gospel beyond the community in

 *Rabbi writing Torah by hand for congregation    	
</P>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Temple Israel is getting a new Torah, but the  
scroll won't be ready for five years, which is how long 
Rabbi-scribe Moshe Klein will spend writing it by hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein, who plans to make periodic trips from New York City to  
Minnesota to complete the job, is using a turkey quill and natural 
ink made of vinegar and olives to write on the lambskin parchment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Torah consists of the five books of Moses, the first five of  
39 books in the Hebrew Bible.	   ''This is the most important document in the religion,'' said 
Roger Hork, president of the congregation on the city's south side. 
``It's being done in the old way. This is something that doesn't 
happen very often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jewish law requires the Torah to be handwritten by a scribe.  
Each one must have the same words in the same order as the ancient 
manuscript and has to be restarted if an error is made. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most scribes are in Israel,'' Klein said, estimating that only  
100 live outside the country. He moved to New York from Israel in 
1964 and is a fourth-generation scribe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Torah scroll will be the 19th Klein has written. He  
estimates it takes 250 eight-hour days to complete one.

 *Neighbor upset by huge religious shrine    	
</P>
<P>
	PEPPERELL, Mass. (AP) -- In a dispute that pits religious freedom  
against property rights, town officials have been asked to decide a 
neighborhood dispute over a 30-foot-tall religious shrine that a 
neighbor says is preventing the sale of her house. 
</P>
<P>
	Noel Dube, 79, a World War II veteran who believes the Virgin  
Mary saved him in battle, built the Our Lady of Fatima Community 
shrine in his yard about eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The shrine includes a 30-by-12-foot, gold-framed billboard of  
Jesus, and a 22-by-60-foot mural depicting holy visions over a 
Portuguese village in 1917. Dube also has erected 14 stations of 
the cross and white lights for night viewing. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbor Phyllis Symonds says the for-sale sign outside her  
19th-century colonial is no competition for Dube's lighted display 
and the crowds it attracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prospective buyers love my house and don't object to the  
price,'' Symonds told the Boston Herald. ``But they are afraid 
because of what's here, and the resale value for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Symonds complained to the town, and the building inspector  
determined that Dube's displays violate local rules that limit the 
size of signs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dube believes he should be regulated by a higher authority.  
</P>
<P>
	``We say they're not signs, they're religious paintings,'' said  
Dube's lawyer, Edward McCormick. ``Under Massachusetts General Law, 
land that is used for religious purposes is exempt from all zoning 
ordinances and bylaws.''

 *City orders removal of shrine honoring Virgin Mary    	
</P>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The city has removed a shrine built in  
Colt Park after a faith healer claimed to see a vision of the 
Virgin Mary in a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	The locust tree began attracting crowds in August when Roman  
Gordils said he saw Mary in the spaces between the branches of the 
tree. Since then, others have said they saw the vision. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordils built a shack at the site, which has been filled with  
candles, photos and statues. 
</P>
<P>
	The city originally said it would allow the shrine to remain if  
Gordils made improvements, including the installation of smoke 
detectors. But last week, the city manager's office ordered it 
taken down, citing a lack of building permits and city code 
prohibiting places of worship on public property. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city of Hartford is extremely sensitive to Mr. Gordils'  
good intentions and the message he brings to the public. However, 
we have a statutory responsibility to protect the general public 
and enforce public safety statutes evenly and fairly throughout the 
city,'' said Deputy City Manager James Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of people gathered at the site to pray and protest the  
city's action. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Virgin is here, and they destroy her,'' said Carmen  
Carrolla. ``What they are doing, they are destroying God.''

	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- A play written by Karol Wojtyla, now  
Pope John Paul II, will be performed at Santa Clara University. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our God's Brother,'' due to open November 12, focuses on the  
life of Adam Chmielowski, a Polish artist who loses his leg while 
fighting for Poland's freedom, according to the university. 
</P>
<P>
	He becomes a famous painter, and then turns his studio into a  
shelter for homeless strangers he meets on the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Pope John Paul II has written six plays, three after becoming  
pope, the university said. The director, Jagienka Zych-Drweski, a 
native of Poland, received the pope's blessing on the play.

	Stocks Fall on IBM Warning  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM led stocks lower on Wall Street today  
following a warning from the company that worries about the Year 
2000 computer bug are hurting hardware sales. Just before 3 p.m. 
EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 195.66 points at 
10,196.70. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 34.10 at 2,754.03.

	IBM Stock Plunges on Y2K Warning  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM's stock lost one-fifth of its value today,  
slicing more than 100 points off the Dow Jones industrial average, 
after the company warned that fears of the Year 2000 computer bug 
are hurting sales even more than expected. Although strong demand 
for software and systems support drove IBM's third-quarter profits 
14 percent higher, matching most forecasts, the results reported 
late yesterday weren't hearty enough to overshadow the accompanying 
warning from the company. With the Year 2000 date change 
threatening to cause widespread computer failures, would-be buyers 
of IBM's powerful network and database servers are proving 
extremely hesitant about complicating matters by adding new 
systems, IBM said. IBM stock was down 16 3/4 at 90 1/4 this afternoon.

	Jobless Claims Rise by 9,000

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for  
unemployment benefits rose by 9,000 last week after a sharp decline 
the previous week. The Labor Department reported today that 298,000 
persons filed new jobless claims for the week ending Oct. 16. The 
increase pushed the four-week moving average to 300,750, the first 
time it has been above the 300,000-level in three months. Even with 
the increase, the number of newly laid off workers remains at 
historically low levels. The unemployment rate in September 
remained at a 29-year low of 4.2 percent. Even though the number of 
payroll jobs actually fell slightly during the month, partly 
because of job losses blamed on Hurricane Floyd.

	Coca Cola Earnings Down 11 Percent

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Coca-Cola Co. reported an 11 percent drop in  
third-quarter earnings, citing economic troubles overseas and 
fallout from recalls of its products in Europe last spring. 
However, the world's biggest soft drink maker said today its case 
volume, an important industry measure, rose during the quarter 
after dropping in the first half of this year. Coca-Cola earned 
$787 million, or 32 cents per share, down from $888 million, or 36 
cents per share, in the same period last year. Coke said its 
per-share earnings were reduced by 2 to 3 cents because of the 
costs associated with the beverage recalls in Belgium and France.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Viacom Inc. posted a 28 percent increase in  
third-quarter profits today, crediting strong results from its 
cable networks group, which includes MTV, VH1 and Nickelodeon. 
Viacom earned $110.9 million, or 16 cents a share, from continuing 
operations. Excluding a one-time restructuring charge related to 
the merger of Spelling Entertainment, Viacom earned $159.6 million, 
or 22 cents per share, handily beating Wall Street estimates of 16 
cents a share. In the same period a year ago, Viacom earned $86 
million, or 10 cents per share.

its top-selling product, Gatorade. The Chicago-based food and 
beverage maker reported operating income of $245.5 million, or

	FCC To Increase Phone Subsidies

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission today  
increased subsidies that help make phone service affordable for 
people in rural and expensive-to-serve areas. The change is part of 
a broader effort to revamp the system in preparation for a day when 
there is widespread competition in the local phone market. The 
commission ``is taking another step forward in reforming universal 
service for a more competitive era,'' said FCC Chairman Bill 
Kennard. The FCC's action more than doubles the pot of money 
currently available in the program that goes to big telephone 
companies, such as the regional Bell companies and GTE, that serve 
rural customers and others living in high-cost areas. Those funds 
will now total $437 million but could eventually decrease.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merck &AMP; Co. met Wall Street's third-quarter  
earnings forecasts, but rivals SmithKline Beecham and Monsanto fell 
just short of expectations. Merck's third-quarter profit rose 13 
percent on earnings of $1.54 billion in the quarter, or 64 cents a 
share. British drugmaker SmithKline said it earned $486 million, or 
44 cents a share, compared to $441 million, or 40 cents a share, in 
the same quarter a year earlier. Results fell a penny short of 
forecasts of analysts. Sales rose 5 percent to $9.93 billion from 
$9.58 billion. Monsanto's operating earnings plummeted 33 percent 
as rising pharmaceutical sales could not overcome falling 
agricultural products sales. Excluding special charges, it earned 
$58 million, or 9 cents per share, a penny short of Wall Street 
expectations.

third quarter, hurt by higher cigarette prices and lower 
consumption. But the results reported Thursday were better than 
Wall Street expected from the nation's second biggest tobacco 
company, which makes Winston and Camels.	   Reynolds' share price fell, however, as the tobacco stocks

results. The nation's second-larger retailer said it had earnings 
of $265 million, or 69 cents a share, down 11 percent from $298 
million, or 76 cents a share, for the same period a year ago. That 
slightly exceeded the analysts' expectations. Sears said net

three months, General Motors Corp. finally has gotten rolling on a 
first-of-its-kind, Internet-based used car dealership here that 
could be a prototype for stores nationwide. ``We found a strong, 
unmet consumer need,'' said Roy Pikus, chairman of GM's DriverSite 
online used-car sales division. ``We were really looking for a 
nontraditional way to buy a used vehicle.'' Many dealerships, 
including national chains AutoNation Inc. and CarMax Group, already 
offer online inventories of used vehicles. GM is the first 
manufacturer to get into the business.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures prices fell sharply in early  
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade after weekly export 
sales came in lower than expected. Grains also were mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department said soybean weekly export  
sales, at 732,700 tons, dropped 35 percent from last week -- even 
further than investors had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans, which continued their tumble from Wednesday, also were  
pressured by the big drop in U.S. stocks.

<P>
	Corn futures nearly held their own despite those developments,  
buoyed by a 75 percent jump in U.S. export sales from a week ago.

<P>
	Wheat also was supported by higher-than-expected weekly export  
sales, although prices slipped with those of other commodities 
after opening unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery was unchanged in early trading at  
$2.57 3/4 a bushel; December corn fell 1/2 cent to $2.00 a bushel; 
December oats fell 1/4 cent to $1.09 a bushel; November soybeans fell 
5 cents to $4.83 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Barak Marks Rabin's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Standing before the granite tombstone of  
Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister who was assassinated after 
starting peace moves with the Palestinians, Prime Minister Ehud 
Barak Thursday pledged to follow Rabin's path toward peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Marking four years since Rabin was shot and killed by an  
extremist Israeli opponent of his peace policies, government 
leaders joined members of Rabin's family, the military, the 
judiciary and representatives of the parliamentary opposition for 
the annual ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Missing was former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was  
being questioned by police about alleged improprieties while in 
office. Rabin's widow, Leah, has accused Netanyahu of contributing 
to the atmosphere of violent incitement that preceded the 
assassination on Nov. 4, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	In a short speech, Barak related how he met with Rabin often in  
the prime minister's office, and now the office is his. He said 
that in electing him to replace Netanyahu, the Israeli people had 
given him a mandate to continue down Rabin's path toward full peace 
with the Palestinians and the rest of Israel's Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak's voice cracked as he spoke of entering the office of the  
prime minister in July after forming his government, but, this 
time, seeing Rabin's face in a picture on the wall instead of from 
across the desk. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak, who served under Rabin when Rabin was the army commander,  
and later became army chief of staff himself, considers himself 
Rabin's ideological successor. 
</P>
<P>
	``As one of your soldiers, I came to say to you that we are  
continuing exactly from the point of your actions when the three 
bullets hit you,'' Barak said, addressing the fallen leader from a 
cluster of fir trees beside the black and white tomb. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came to say to you that we raised the baton that fell from  
your hand in the relay race of peace,'' Barak added. 
</P>
<P>
	Israelis marked the anniversary according to the Hebrew calendar  
on Thursday with ceremonies at schools across the country, as the 
state radio stations broadcast solemn songs from the period after 
Rabin's death. 
</P>
<P>
	At the graveside ceremony, Shimon Peres, Rabin's foreign  
minister, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994 along with 
Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, said that Barak had 
many hurdles to overcome on the path to peace with Israel's 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	Peres, who serves as regional cooperation minister in Barak's  
government, was Rabin's rival for two decades before teaming with 
him to start the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look, with you it was very difficult,'' Peres said, addressing  
Rabin. ``Without you, it is even more so. Yet, we have to continue, 
and we shall.''

<HEADLINE> Berger Slams 'Isolationist Right' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- National security adviser Sandy Berger says  
the ``isolationist right'' in Congress risks squandering America's 
global leadership by opposing treaties and foreign aid and casting 
China as the new enemy No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	In a slashing attack on conservative Republicans who blocked a  
ban on nuclear weapons tests and are cutting back President 
Clinton's overseas programs, Berger said they are driven not only 
by political partisanship but by a ``distinctly defeatist'' view of 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Thursday to the Council on Foreign Relations, a private  
group that usually supports an activist U.S. foreign policy, Berger 
said congressional isolationists were consumed with an impulse ``to 
withdraw from the world in a way that would squander our 
advantages, alienate our friends, diminish our credibility, betray 
our values and discredit our example.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said most Americans, by contrast, ``understand that we  
are fortunate to be in a position of leadership, and that to 
maintain it we must continue to lead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His speech in New York was part of a campaign by the  
administration to rebut the Republicans who have dealt Clinton's 
foreign policy severe setbacks and to signal allies and other 
nations around the world that the president intends to fight on in 
his last 15 months in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Inhofe, a foe of the failed test ban treaty, said the  
notion of lost U.S. leadership ``absurd,'' adding that the treaty's 
defeat actually would help restore American stature. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will improve our international respect and leadership,  
because we said we are not going to unilaterally disarm any more,'' 
said Inhofe, R-Okla. ``We are going to gain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president is now giving priority to peacemaking in the  
Middle East and in Northern Ireland and to working with Russia on 
missile defenses while also supporting democracy and capitalism 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our leadership has never been more needed, or more in  
demand,'' Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Describing congressional conservatives as ``nostalgic for the  
good old days'' when the Soviet Union was a distinct adversary, 
Berger said some have designated China, with its growing economy, 
its nuclear program and its missiles aimed at Taiwan as the 
successor enemy No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger proposed another approach.  
</P>
<P>
	``We should not look at China through rose-colored glasses;  
neither should we see it through a glass darkly, distorting its 
strength and ignoring its complexities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	China, he said, is a country that has lifted tens of millions of  
its people from poverty and expanded personal freedoms. But it also 
is resisting political reform that is needed for long-term growth 
and stability. 
</P>
<P>
	And, if it chose, China could pour much more of its wealth into  
military might and try to dominate its region -- a decision it has 
not made. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our interest lies in protecting our security while encouraging  
China to make the right choices,'' Berger said. ``We can only do 
that if we continue a policy of principled, purposeful engagement 
with its leaders and people.''

<HEADLINE> Contractors Protest Federal Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Business groups on Thursday protested a  
Clinton administration proposal to toughen rules for companies that 
want to compete for the $170 billion awarded annually to federal 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents say the new rules amount to ``blacklisting.''  
Supporters say it ensures the government is doing business with 
good corporate citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is a proposed regulation ordering government officers  
to deny contracts to bidders who show ``persuasive evidence'' of 
noncompliance with tax, labor, employment, environmental, antitrust 
or consumer protection laws. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of minor technical violations could cost a company its  
federal contract, said Rep. Jim Talent, chairman of the House Small 
Business Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The end result is that a small business could be prevented  
from contracting with the government for the regulatory equivalent 
of a combination of parking and moving violations,'' said Talent, 
R-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``persuasive evidence'' standard does not exist in civil,  
criminal or administrative law, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Small firms would be hit hardest, Talent said, citing estimates  
that nearly three-quarters of all federal contracts went to small 
businesses in fiscal 1998. Those contracts totaled $33 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Deidre A. Lee, a procurement policy administrator for the Office  
of Management and Budget, told the committee that the proposal does 
not change rules or procedural appeals under current regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most importantly, we are not proposing to punish anyone by  
denying them federal contracts,'' she said. ``What we hope to do is 
protect the public's interest by having a greater assurance that 
the firms we deal with are responsible citizens.''

<HEADLINE> Forbes Releases Economic Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Steve  
Forbes unveiled his economic package Thursday at the home of a 
state employee and teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Stephen Frink said he liked Forbes and calculated that  
his family would save $1,000 under the proposed flat tax, he wasn't 
ready to sign on the dotted line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm seriously looking at Mr. Forbes,'' said Frink, who  
considers his family -- he has a wife and three children -- a typical 
middle class one. ``I am very glad he came.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said his plan -- a compilation of previously announced  
ideas -- would grow the economy by 75 percent, create more than 24 
million jobs, boost wages by two-thirds and cut the national debt 
by more than half. 
</P>
<P>
	A Virginia-based financial forecast firm run by former Reagan  
treasury officials calculated the plan's long-term effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Flanked by the Frinks and his wife Sabina, Forbes portrayed  
himself as the choice for conservative voters, saying he was a 
``true outsider'' with bold proposals in contrast to Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush, the front-runner the GOP presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have more substance on the table than all the other  
campaigns combined,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said this was the first time Forbes had pulled his  
proposals together and measured their effect. His plan includes: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Replacing the current tax code with a flat tax, allowing  
personal exemptions. A family of four earning $36,000 a year would 
pay no federal income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Allowing young workers to establish personal retirement  
accounts. By 2002, a worker could deposit 4 percent of their Social 
Security taxes into an account that would be invested in the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Limiting spending increases on discretionary, non-defense  
programs only to keep up with changes in inflation and population 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Consolidating and eliminating some government programs.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Creating a ``truly dynamic and competitive health insurance  
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Allowing parents to use government money to send children to  
the schools of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiscal Associates, the firm hired by Forbes, says the plan would  
increase economic growth from 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent -- 
increasing the U.S. economy from $9.8 trillion to $17.2 trillion. 
It says huge surpluses would result, allowing the $5.5 trillion 
federal debt to shrink by 60 percent in 2020. 
</P>
<P>
	But one economist said that while Forbes may have some good  
ideas, his projections are the product of ``wild guessing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers are kind of silly,'' said Russell Roberts of the  
Center for the Study of American Business at Washington University 
in St. Louis. ``There's no way to really assess whether the numbers 
are accurate or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kristen Tinsworth, spokeswoman for the Citizens for a Sound  
Economy, a pro-business, Washington think tank, said a flat tax 
would make the system less complicated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a simple, low, flat, fair way of doing things,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Forbes also announced that his campaign won support  
Thursday from backers of Elizabeth Dole in New Hampshire, Iowa and 
South Carolina. Dole pulled out of the race on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Marino's Replacement Nervous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Damon Huard hasn't started a game yet in the  
NFL, and he is already receiving awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Huard was chosen the Miller Lite player of the week Wednesday.  
In a brief locker room ceremony, he graciously accepted the 
souvenir football that goes with the award, then quickly set it 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was only one game,'' he said. ``The best quarterbacks in  
this league do it consistently week in and week out, and that's the 
challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huard, who came off the bench to beat New England, will likely  
make his first NFL start Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles in 
place of an ailing Dan Marino. That gives Huard a full week to 
develop butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're always a little nervous,'' he said. ``I think it's good  
to have some butterflies, but you also have to be confident, and 
I'm confident. I believe in myself and the guys around me. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the opportunity you shoot for. Hopefully, I'll make  
the most of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins (4-1) hope so too, because their lead in the AFC  
East may hinge on Huard. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino, sidelined by spasms and weakness in the muscle between  
his neck and right shoulder, received an epidural injection and 
planned to test his throwing arm today. He declined to speculate on 
his chances of playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling a little better,'' he said. ``We'll just have to  
wait and see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's no temptation to rush him back into action after the way  
Huard played Sunday. Marino's young understudy shook off nine sacks 
and a costly interception on his first pass, driving Miami 59 yards 
in the final two minutes for a touchdown and a 31-30 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Huard finished 24-for-42 for 240 yards and two scores. He added  
54 yards running. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jimmy Johnson, who created a controversy two weeks ago by  
criticizing Marino, can only rave about the 26-year-old Huard. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a great arm,'' Johnson said. ``He has great velocity on  
the ball. He's a very accurate passer. He has the best deep touch 
of any of the quarterbacks we have. He has a flair for the game. He 
can run. He can move around in the pocket. He can scramble. He 
makes a lot of plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huard's mobility gave the Dolphins a new weapon against New  
England. He ran 25 yards to set up a field goal and scrambled 
before throwing a 69-yard touchdown pass to Tony Martin. But his 
nine sacks were a team record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do need to learn to get rid of the ball quicker,'' he said.  
``But I didn't want to turn the ball over in the second half and 
change the momentum of the game, so I was real intent on not 
throwing an interception.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Savvy play is a reflection of Huard's football bloodlines. His  
dad coached him at Puyallup, Wash., High School. His brother Brock 
is a rookie quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks, and his brother 
Luke is a freshman quarterback at North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's grown up around football, being a coach's kid, and that's  
how he plays,'' Eagles coach Andy Reid said. ``He plays good, smart 
football and has enough athletic ability to make things happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huard started for three years at the University of Washington,  
but went undrafted and sat out the 1996 season after the Cincinnati 
Bengals cut him in training camp. He signed by Miami in 1997 and 
played well with Frankfurt of NFL Europe in the spring of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But until last week, his NFL experience consisted of nine passes  
in three games during mop-up duty. 
</P>
<P>
	``The No. 1 thing that developed Damon Huard is being able to  
play behind a Hall of Fame quarterback for two years,'' Johnson 
said. ``Playing behind Dan has really helped him mature.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Says He'll Strengthen Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AIKEN, S.C. (AP) -- George W. Bush said Thursday he would need a  
military stocked with more high-tech weapons, including a 
space-based antiballistic missile system and stealth ships to help 
him keep the peace if he is elected president. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who is ahead of his rivals for the Republican presidential  
nomination, also said he had yet to decide whether to participate 
in a debate sponsored by the state GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to keep the peace,'' Bush, the Texas governor, told  
abut 600 supporters at a rally in a state with a heavy military 
influence. ``It's important to use our technologies to help bring 
certainty to an uncertain world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Restating elements of an earlier speech on defense that he  
delivered at The Citadel in Charleston, Bush said he would let 
military experts decide which programs to promote to Congress, but 
singled out ``lighter, more lethal, more mobile, more 
cost-effective'' systems like stealth planes and ships as likely 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also said he was undecided about the upcoming Jan. 7  
debate. So far, rivals, Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes and Arizona Sen. 
John McCain, have agreed to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know yet. I haven't made up my mind yet,'' he said.  
``I am going to participate in debates in New Hampshire and Iowa. 
But as you know the process has become very compact. I'll just have 
to make up my mind later on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush will miss candidate forums Thursday and Friday night in New  
Hampshire. He declined an invitation to an Oct. 28 debate in New 
Hampshire because his wife is being honored in Dallas that night, 
but plans to participate in a Dec. 2 debate in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Bush were two state officials who had supported  
Elizabeth Dole but announced Thursday that they had joined Bush's 
team. Dole dropped out of the race Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> West Bank Factory Fire Kills 16 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEBRON, West Bank (AP) -- Palestinians and Jewish settlers came  
together in this tense, divided city Thursday in a rare show of 
cooperation to battle a raging fire in an illegal lighter factory 
that killed 16 women workers. 
</P>
<P>
	A Palestinian fire truck was the first to respond. But soon,  
Palestinian police realized they didn't have enough equipment and 
asked Israel for help. About 20 minutes later, a fire truck, 
paramedics and two ambulances from the nearby settlement of Kiryat 
Arba arrived at the factory. 
</P>
<P>
	``In such cases, there are no settlements, no walls,'' said the  
head of the Kiryat Arba fire department, Yinon Yitzhaki. ``Such 
operations have no borders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women who died were trapped in the factory, which was on the  
ground floor of an apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement  
issued a leaflet demanding the resignation of the mayor and the 
city council who, they said, had done nothing to enforce minimal 
safety features. 
</P>
<P>
	The lighter factory is one of scores of unlicensed enterprises  
operating in Hebron's crowded neighborhoods, businesses which 
usually employ women and children at low wages to make cheap copies 
of Israeli or foreign products. 
</P>
<P>
	Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natche ordered an investigation. He said  
the factory owner had permission to sell fruits and vegetables, not 
to make cigarette lighters. Police said the factory's manager was 
detained for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze highlighted the ambiguous relationship of disdain and  
occasional dependence between the 130,000 Palestinian residents of 
the city and the 500 Jewish settlers living nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire, which began with a morning explosion, raged out of  
control for more than two hours. Thick black smoke covered the 
neighborhood and flames shot several dozen feet into the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores of volunteers, including relatives of victims, were  
overcome by smoke after trying again and again to get into the 
burning building in a desperate attempt to free the women trapped 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	After the fire died down, rescuers retrieved the charred  
remains, carrying them in plastic bags and on blanket-covered 
stretchers. Some of the volunteers broke down in tears. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after the explosion, the scene still drew onlookers who  
sloshed through the water-flooded streets littered with thousands 
of cigarette lighters. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohammed Khalaf stood outside a Hebron hospital morgue,  
surrounded by family and friends, after identifying the body of his 
23-year-old sister, Suheila. Khalaf also lost four cousins who 
worked at the factory. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking stunned, Khalaf said that the family was not in economic  
difficulties. ``The girls just wanted to go out and do something 
with their spare time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were women ranging in age from 19 to 35, residents  
of villages surrounding Hebron, police said.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Serves to Renowned Chef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton won praise  
for courage Thursday after serving lunch to celebrated chef Julia 
Child, one of four women honored at the White House for advancing 
women's causes. 
</P>
<P>
	On the menu: chicken with pesto, potato and goat cheese puree,  
autumn greens with artichokes and pumpkin mousse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hillary, it takes a lot of guts to serve lunch to Julia  
Child,'' joked Labor Secretary Alexis Herman. 
</P>
<P>
	Honored for ``shattering glass ceilings'' were Herman, Child,  
University of Pennsylvania President Judith Rodin and Ann Fudge, 
Kraft Foods executive vice president Ann Fudge. Child was the first 
person to have a televised cooking show and to win an Emmy Award 
for her culinary expertise. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is exciting for me as I travel around to meet young girls  
who are no longer in any way limited by what they see as visions 
for their own lives and potential,'' thanks to women like the 
honorees, Mrs. Clinton told guests in the White House State Dining 
Room. 
</P>
<P>
	But the country still has ``work to be done'' to ensure equal  
pay for women, access to affordable child care and health care, 
Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sara Lee Foundation will make a $50,000 donation in each  
honoree's name to the nonprofit organization of her choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Past winners include poet Maya Angelou, Health and Human  
Services Secretary Donna Shalala and Martin Luther King's widow, 
Coretta Scott King. 
</P>
<P>
	Though lunch had yet to be served, Child said she was ``very  
much impressed'' by the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bon appetit,'' John Bryan, chief executive officer of Sara  
Lee, told the guests, borrowing Child's trademark line.

<HEADLINE> Martin Ousts Gustafsson in Lyon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYON, France (AP) -- The Lyon Grad Prix was already in bad shape,  
but that didn't stop Magnus Gustafsson from alienating fans. 
</P>
<P>
	He beat second-seeded Todd Martin 6-1, 4-6, 6-4 in the second  
round Wednesday, winning little support in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	On one occasion, he plopped down on the court waiting for  
spectators to sit before serving. Another time the Swede smacked 
the net with his racket in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	Six seeded players have lost in Lyon. One of them, Martin, was a  
U.S. Open finalists. Another, Tommy Haas, was a finalist in Lyon 
for two straight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranked 74th, Gustafsson was Martin's first opponent of the  
tournament. The American received a bye into the second round. 
Looking rusty, Martin put up little resistance in the opening set. 
</P>
<P>
	But then he seemed to refocus. With the crowd turning against  
Gustafsson, Martin rallied back to even the match at a set each. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third set, Martin had his ankle retaped and took a 4-1  
lead. But his game began to unravel and Gustafsson took the next 
five games, jumping in jubilation as Martin hit the ball into the 
net at match point. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov survived a similarly troublesome  
match, overcoming American qualifier Richey Reneberg 6-3, 3-6, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Haas lost 6-2, 7-6 (7-3) to Mikael Tillstrom of Sweden. Haas,  
seeded fifth, had been sidelined the past three weeks with a toe 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Swedes continued to wreak havoc in the second round, with Magnus  
Larsson toppling No. 16 Marc Rosset of Switzerland 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 3 Gustavo Kuerten was one of the few seeded players to  
advance to the quarterfinals Wednesday, defeating Spain's Fernando 
Vicente 6-3, 7-6 (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
	France's Sebastien Grosjean delighted home fans, defeating  
Jan-Michael Gambill 1-6, 6-3, 6-3. In the quarterfinals, he will 
face No. 6 Nicolas Lapentti, who scored a 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) 
victory over Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent Spadea defeated Dutchman Sjeng Schalken 2-6, 6-1, 6-4,  
setting up an all-American quarterfinal with Jim Courier.

<HEADLINE> Madagascar Dig Reveals Old Dinosaur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jawbones of two animals from before the  
Jurassic period may be the oldest dinosaur fossils ever discovered 
and could focus new light on an era when mammals, dinosaurs and 
reptiles were in a frenzy of evolutionary change. 
</P>
<P>
	The new fossils were found in an ancient riverbed in Madagascar  
mixed with the remains of other animals that are believed from 
earlier studies to have lived 227 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are probably the earliest dinosaurs known from anywhere  
in the world,'' said Andre Wyss of the University of California, 
Santa Barbara, co-founder of a research team that is excavating the 
Madagascar site. 
</P>
<P>
	A report on the fossil find appears Friday in the journal

Madagascar and Robin L. Whatley of the University of California, 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
	Dating of the fossils is based on the co-discovery of fossils  
from primitive forms of other animals, including a mammal-like 
reptile, that lived just before the age of dinosaurs. Fossils that 
had held the title as most ancient dinosaur were found in Argentina 
and age-dated using radioisotopes at 227 million years. The South 
American site included mammal-like reptiles that were more 
advanced, and therefore younger, than similar fossils found at the 
Madagascar site, said Wyss. 
</P>
<P>
	On this basis, he said, it is believed the Madagascar fossils  
are older than those from Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we are earlier than 227 million years, and these  
animals could be as much as 5 million years older,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new specimens consist of the upper and lower jaw bones of  
two dinosaur species never before seen, said Wyss. Based on the 
teeth and the characteristics of the jaw, the researchers 
identified them as prosauropods, primitive plant-eaters with small 
heads and long necks. The prosauropods are thought to be the 
beginning of an evolutionary lineage that eventually produced 
apatosaurus, a 36-ton plant-eating monster that was the largest 
animal ever to walk the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the animal that Fred Flintstone rode,'' Wyss joked.  
</P>
<P>
	The estimated age of the fossils would put the unnamed animals  
between the middle and late Triassic, the geologic period that 
ended 200 million years ago with the beginning of the Jurassic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dinosaurs didn't appear until the end of the middle  
Triassic,'' said Wyss. ``This find pushes that appearance deeper 
into the Triassic'' by about 5 million years. 
</P>
<P>
	The middle to late Triassic is a time little understood by  
researchers, said Wyss, but it was an age that helped set the 
course of life on Earth for millions of years. During this period, 
220 million to 230 million years ago, animals were evolving in many 
directions. The time marked the appearance of mammals, turtles, 
crocodiles, flying reptiles, frogs, many types of bony fish and, of 
course, dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
	The dinosaur went on to dominate until 65 million years ago when  
a major extinction, probably linked with a massive meteor collision 
with Earth, caused the huge lizards to disappear, allowing mammals 
to eventually dominate. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the newly discovered specimens are of animals that already  
were beginning to specialize, said Wyss, that means that they were 
not among the very first dinosaurs but were evolved from even more 
distant ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
	``That means that there must be even older dinosaurs out  
there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyss said the fossils come from an immense collection that is  
still being analyzed or dug out of quarries in Madagascar, an 
island off the southeast coast of Africa. The researchers are not 
naming the new animal species until more is known about them, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've undoubtedly got more pieces, but they are still entombed  
in rock,'' said Wyss. It may take years, he said, ``but eventually 
we'll be able to put together the bulk'' of a whole skeleton. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Shubin, a dinosaur researcher at the University of  
Pennsylvania, said that experts may argue about the age of the new 
specimens because it was not established by the accurate 
radioisotope method. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether you want to call this the earliest dinosaur or one of  
the earliest dinosaurs depends upon your interpretation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But whatever the case, said Shubin, ``this is really an  
important find'' because it sheds new light on a critical time in 
evolution when dinosaurs were dividing into the meat-eaters and the 
plant-eaters. 
</P>
<P>
	``This suggests that very early in the evolution of dinosaurs,  
these two major groups were already appearing,'' Shubin said.

<HEADLINE> What Jets Coach Parcells Faces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- The penalties keep piling up. So do the  
mental and physical mistakes. And, of course, the injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not at all what Bill Parcells envisioned for the New  
York Jets in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	He had another AFC East crown, a conference title and a Super  
Bowl trip in mind for his third season with the team. After that 
would be a triumphant ride into retirement -- a more permanent 
retirement than when he walked away from the Giants in 1990 for 
health reasons, only to return to coaching two years later in New 
England. 
</P>
<P>
	Retirement might have to wait. The championships and Super Bowl  
rings certainly will have to wait. Parcells' Jets are 1-5 and even 
the renowned coach is reeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are tough times now, men,'' Parcells said.  
</P>
<P>
	Some of those tough times are his own doing.  
</P>
<P>
	Parcells, who led the Giants and Patriots from the bottom to the  
Super Bowl before taking over the woebegone Jets, couldn't control 
the injury epidemic. But he surely could have gotten in better 
position to deal with it. Parcells the personnel director failed 
Parcells the coach with his decisions at backup quarterback, tight 
end and on the defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	Most hurtful has been Vinny Testaverde's torn Achilles' tendon  
Testaverde in the season opener. Parcells gambled the durable 
Testaverde, who missed eight games because of injury in his 
previous 12 seasons, would stay healthy and have another Pro Bowl 
year. After wasting several months with Scott Zolak, signed away 
from New England as a free agent, he cut Zolak on Aug. 20 when he 
acquired Rick Mirer from Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirer, who has flopped with three NFL teams, was woefully  
unprepared to take over when Testaverde went down. He's remained 
inconsistent and indecisive. On Sunday, Parcells went with untested 
Ray Lucas, a pet project, at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells made offers for Eric Zeier and Rodney Peete, veteran  
backups with far better resumes than Zolak, Mirer or Lucas carry. 
When he wouldn't part with a middle-round draft pick, he lost out 
on Zeier and Peete. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, his team is losing nearly every week, and Lucas is out  
three to four weeks with a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	In allowing strong-blocking tight end Kyle Brady to leave for  
Jacksonville as a free agent, Parcells opened a spot for Eric 
Green. So far, Green has played abysmally and the position has 
become a weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	An inability to sign a top defensive lineman has led to an  
over-reliance on the solid linebacking corps to apply pass-rushing 
pressure. That pressure hasn't come. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with all of that, Parcells usually can win. Not this year.  
</P>
<P>
	In the opener, he was forced to use punter Tom Tupa, whose last  
start at quarterback was in 1991, as Testaverde's replacement 
because Mirer was the emergency QB. Tupa played well for nearly two 
periods, but in the fourth quarter, when Mirer could come on 
without Tupa becoming ineligible, Parcells made the switch. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirer threw two interceptions, helping the Patriots win.  
</P>
<P>
	Always willing to gamble on fourth down, Parcells has seen his  
team convert three of 10, better than only three teams that have 
gone on fourth downs. No one has tried it as often. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells has tended to get cute with his play-calling, too. The  
most egregious example was in the most recent loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Tied 13-13 with Indianapolis, the Jets ran Curtis Martin five  
times and gained 47 yards to the Colts 3. On first down, Parcells -- 
who once had rookie running back Leon Johnson throw an option pass 
in a similar situation against Detroit with a playoff spot on the 
line; the pass was intercepted -- called for a dangerous pass into 
the left corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Colts cornerback Jeff Burris read it, picked it off and ran 55  
yards, leading to the winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had problems with short-yardage and goal-line  
consistently,'' Parcells said in a lukewarm defense of the 
strategy. ``At that point in time, I thought it might be a pretty 
good chance for a play-action pass. ... It didn't turn out, so it 
was the wrong call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So many of them have been this season.

<HEADLINE> Justice Department Sues Ohio City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The U.S. Justice Department sued the  
Columbus police department Thursday, accusing it of a pattern of 
civil rights abuses that included excessive force, false arrests 
and improper searches. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said it reviewed more than 300 complaints before  
making Columbus only the third U.S. city to be threatened with a 
lawsuit by the department's Civil Rights Division under a 1994 
federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	Steubenville, Ohio, and Pittsburgh reached agreements known as  
consent decrees in which they promised to correct problems in the 
training, supervision and discipline of officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit against the 1,700-member Columbus force demands  
improvements in the training and supervision of police officers and 
the investigation of civilian complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the Justice Department accused the Columbus  
department of falsely arresting or charging people who saw police 
misconduct or were believed likely to complain of misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are serious allegations, but that's all they are,'' said  
city attorney Janet Jackson. She said she doesn't believe the 
Justice Department can prove a pattern of abusive conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraternal Order of Police President William Capretta said the  
union is willing to negotiate a settlement, but not in the form of 
a consent decree -- an agreement that would grant the federal 
government oversight authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``A consent decree is the federal government running our police  
department,'' Capretta said Thursday. ``They need to prove to us 
Columbus is such a bad town that they have to watch us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed the day after the local Fraternal Order of  
Police rejected a settlement proposal approved in August by the 
city and the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department asked the court to take no action until  
Dec. 20 to allow time for negotiations with the union. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would still prefer to bring about needed changes in the  
police department through negotiations, rather than contested 
litigation,'' said Bill Lann Lee, acting assistant attorney general 
for civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	In the proposed settlement, the city would not have admitted any  
wrongdoing. Among other things, the settlement called for improved 
police training and appointment of an independent monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Before passage of the federal Violent Crime Control and Law  
Enforcement Act of 1994, the Justice Department could bring 
criminal charges against individual officers for civil rights 
violations, but it could not sue a whole department for misconduct 
under civil law.

<HEADLINE> Italy, Netherlands: Nukes Necessary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Italian and Dutch government officials said Thursday  
that Europe should keep some U.S. nuclear weapons on its soil to 
guarantee the security of NATO countries and maintain peace in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering the ``potential risks that NATO countries face,  
conventional weapons on their own are not enough to fully deter 
aggressions,'' Italian Defense Minister Carlo Scognamiglio said in 
a briefing to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently declassified Pentagon papers have revealed the presence  
of 150 U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe. Half of those were in six 
NATO countries -- Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands 
and Turkey, according to the article in the Bulletin of the Atomic 
Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Scognamiglio's support for maintaining some of the  
arsenal on Italian soil, Environmental Minister Edo Ronchi demanded 
the warheads be removed. Italy has no nuclear arsenal of its own, 
and Italians voted in a 1987 referendum to ban nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
	``The warheads should absolutely be eliminated in all of  
Europe,'' Ronchi told the ANSA news agency. ``There's no reason to 
keep them after the end of the Cold War.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many Italian politicians said they knew about the arsenal, but  
did not realize it was so large. Experts who studied the Pentagon 
document said 20 nuclear warheads were at the American base at 
Aviano, and another 10 were at the Italian base at Ghedi Torri, 
near the northern city of Brescia. 
</P>
<P>
	The article said U.S. nuclear weapons were first deployed in  
Italy in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman for the Dutch foreign affairs ministry, Arjen  
Lekkerkerker, also advocated keeping the arsenal in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``In guaranteeing the collective safety of Europe, nuclear  
possibilities play an important part,'' Lekkerkerker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Details about locations of American nuclear weapons abroad are  
among the most closely protected Pentagon secrets. Today the only 
remaining full-time U.S. nuclear deployments outside the United 
States are in Europe, where bombs are stored for potential use by 
U.S. Air Force planes based there. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon also has U.S.-based submarines, aircraft and  
missiles armed with nuclear warheads.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Most Want Rose Reinstated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- By a 2-1 margin, most people think Pete Rose  
should be reinstated to baseball, even though many believe he did 
gamble on his sport, according to an Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-six percent of those surveyed said Rose should be  
reinstated, while 29 percent said he should not, according to the 
poll, conducted for the AP by ICR of Media, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven out of 10 said baseball's career hits leader belongs in  
baseball's Hall of Fame, while almost two out of 10 said he 
doesn't. Rose is not eligible for the Hall of Fame as long as his 
lifetime ban remains in effect. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 78 percent to 15 percent margin, people said commissioner  
Bud Selig made the correct decision to invite Rose to the World 
Series ceremony Sunday honoring the sport's All-Century team. Rose 
was among the 25 players elected in fan balloting in the second 
half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the AP poll showed slightly higher support for  
Rose's admission to the Hall of Fame than four polls conducted from 
1989 to 1991 for the Roper Center at the University of Connecticut. 
Those polls showed support ranging from 47 percent to 58 percent 
for Rose's admission to Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other polls -- one done for Roper in 1990 and another by  
Gallup in 1989 -- found almost identical support for Rose as the AP 
poll, which was conducted earlier this month. The 1990 Roper poll 
found 68 percent supported of Rose's admission to the Hall of Fame, 
and the 1989 Gallup poll found 66 percent of respondents favored 
his being in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who think Rose should be allowed to appear at the  
series was Levona Walker, a communications specialist in her 40s 
from Bainbridge, Ga. The decision to let Rose appear with the 
All-Century team at the World Series is a good one, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a great player,'' said Walker, who considers herself a  
big baseball fan. ``Everybody has faults, so why blame him for his 
faults?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, more people who were asked in the AP poll don't believe  
Rose's gambling denial than believe him. Forty percent don't 
believe Rose is telling the truth about betting on baseball, while 
30 percent believe him. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Murray, a 55-year-old retiree from Tonawanda, N.Y., says he  
thinks the example Rose set on the field far outweighs the charge 
of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the greatest baseball players,'' said Murray. ``He  
was a great example through his hustle -- he showed a lot of hard 
work and hustle. He was a good example of youth of that day and 
this day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray said he doesn't know whether Rose bet on baseball or not,  
``But I like him, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey of 1,012 adults was taken Oct. 1-5 and has  
a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, then manager of the Cincinnati Reds, agreed to a lifetime  
ban from baseball in August 1989 following an investigation of his 
gambling. He applied for reinstatement in September 1997, and Selig 
has not ruled on the request, saying he sees no reason to chance 
the ban originally imposed by commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who describe themselves as following baseball  
closely, Rose got even higher backing, with 67 percent saying he 
should be reinstated and 29 percent saying he shouldn't. 
Seventy-two percent say he belongs in the Hall of Fame and 79 
percent said he should be invited to the All-Century team ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	But 49 percent think he's lying when he says he didn't bet on  
baseball, with 36 percent believing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Among casual fans, those who say they follow baseball but not  
closely, 64 percent say he should be reinstated, 79 percent say he 
belongs in the Hall of Fame and 84 percent agree he should be 
invited to the All-Century team festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	This group was about evenly split, with 40 percent saying they  
think he's lying about gambling on baseball and 36 percent 
believing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Carbonneau, a 66-year-old retiree from Champaign, Ill.,  
is a lifetime baseball fan who thinks some officials in the sport 
may not have a good historical perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless they could prove he was throwing Reds games, they  
should let him back in,'' Carbonneau said. ``The Babe wasn't 
exactly a saint.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Honors Police Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton honored nearly three dozen  
police officers for outstanding service to their communities 
Thursday, and he used the Rose Garden ceremony to press Republicans 
to pass his crime-fighting measures this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Trumpeting the decline in violent crime during his  
administration and linking it to his program to put 100,000 
community police officers on the streets, the president lambasted 
GOP lawmakers for resisting his proposal to continue the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now this doesn't make any sense to me. If you've got a problem  
that you're solving ... and we've got the money to do it, why would 
you choose to spend the money on something else instead of making 
America the safest big country in the world?'' Clinton said. ``If 
Congress sends me a crime-fighting bill that's a crime-spending 
bill that doesn't have the right priorities, I will have to veto 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke at a ceremony honoring the 32 recipients of  
this year's National Association of Police Organizations sixth 
annual ``Top Cops'' award. The honorees included officers who 
rescued fellow officers while under fire, subdued assailants after 
being shot and wounded and evacuated 200 people from an apartment 
building before a gas explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have performed astonishing acts of valor and humanity,''  
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the guests was actor Yaphet Kotto, who played a commander  
on the TV drama ``Homicide.'' Kotto's son, Frederick Samuel Kotto, 
30, a police officer in San Jose was named for Kotto's uncle, who 
was killed in the 1950s while on duty as a New York City police 
detective. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a son out there driving a police car, and I don't  
want anything to happen to him,'' he said, urging lawmakers to fund 
Clinton's anti-crime proposals. ``This is not a game out there. 
These guys, while they're sitting around politicizing it, people 
are out there actually risking their lives. I don't want to go to 
my son's funeral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The honorees were: Alaska State Trooper Barry Croy; Los Angeles  
police officers Andy Azodi, Jude Bella, Ryan Clark, Chris Dunn, 
Kevin J. Foster, Craig Schofield Hewitt and Chris Yzaguirre; 
Connecticut state troopers Michael Allard, Michael J. Hoague, Mark 
Pelletier and James E. Reidy Jr.; Chicago police Sgt. James 
McMullin; Detroit police officers James Henry Lightfoot Jr., Gasper 
Rossi and Steven Louis Sosa, and Sgts. Michael Stefani and James 
Tolbert and Lt. Arthur McNamara; St. Joseph, Mo., police Sgts. 
Terry R. White, Steven Gumm and Billy Paul Miller, and officers 
Rebecca Caton, Roy W. Wedlow Jr., Henry Castaneda Pena and Shawn 
Hamre; Jersey City, N.J., police Sgt. Heriberto Carattini; 
Poughkeepsie, N.Y., police Sgt. Karl Skip Mannain; Johnston, R.I., 
police Sgt. Michael Calenda and officer Thomas H. Dolan; U.S. Park 
Service police officers Robert Louis Freeman III and Kevin J. 
Nieves.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal Returns Home From Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John J. O'Connor returned home  
Wednesday after being hospitalized for two days with side effects 
from radiation treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The spiritual leader of New York's 2.2 million Catholics missed  
Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral the last two Sundays. His 
spokesman, Joe Zwilling, said he did not know when O'Connor would 
resume his public schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor had a brain tumor removed in September, followed by  
five weeks of radiation therapy. Doctors said he was ``recovering

<HEADLINE> Attorney: Bartender Was Raped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Police are investigating a bartender's  
claims that she was raped by more than one person at a police 
social club where she worked, a business run by retired law 
enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman was assaulted early on Sept. 25, said her attorney,  
Steven Holden. He would not identify her alleged attackers but said 
they could be Oklahoma City police officers or others who were in 
the Glitter Dome at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The same people who raped her are the very people who are  
supposed to be protecting her,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A police spokesman, Capt. Charles Allen, declined to comment on  
Holden's statements but said the investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sex crimes investigation right now,'' Allen said. ``And  
we're good at doing those, whether it involves us or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the night of the alleged attack, Oklahoma City Police Capt.  
Bill Martin called 911 and reported that the woman was nude, drunk 
and ``going crazy'' in the club. Holden said she was not drunk. 
</P>
<P>
	A police report said that when she was questioned, the woman  
denied being involved in any sexual activity. Three days later, 
police said, she said she had been undressed against her will but 
did not believe she had been sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said she did not make the assault allegation until she  
was interviewed again. 
</P>
<P>
	Holden denied that the woman's account has changed since she was  
originally interviewed, and he questioned why police waited several 
days to launch an investigation.

	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Salvos of rockets slammed into a crowded  
open air market and other parts of Grozny, including a maternity 
hospital, on Thursday, killing at least 118 people and injuring up 
to 400, a Chechen official said. Chechnya said the rockets were 
fired by Russian forces moving in on the capital. The Russian 
Defense Ministry in Moscow denied responsibility. Russia has been 
waging an offensive in Chechnya to eliminate Islamic militants who 
invaded neighboring Dagestan this summer.

	Study: Early Care Helps Adult Life  
</P>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Poor infants and toddlers who get  
high-quality child care are more apt to graduate from high school, 
attend college and delay having children, according to a new study 
released today. Researchers believe their results are the first to 
definitively link high-quality child care, beginning as early as 6 
weeks of age, with a better adult life. The Abecedarian Project -- 
named after a word formed from the first letters of the alphabet 
and meaning novice or elementary -- tracked 111 children from 
infancy through age 21, beginning in 1972.

Sukarnoputri was named vice president, a move that bodes well for 
the future of Indonesia's fledging democracy. The vote of the 
People's Consultative Assembly came one day after Megawati lost the 
first free and contested presidential race in the country's 54-year 
history. Tens of thousands of Megawati's disillusioned supporters 
went on a rampage after she was defeated by new President

going after Serb forces if permitted by NATO politicians. Lt. Gen. 
Michael C. Short, the Air Force general who ran the 78-day air war, 
said he said would have waged a massive air campaign against 
Belgrade. ``I'd have dropped the bridges across the Danube. I'd hit 
five or six political and military headquarters in downtown 
Belgrade,'' Short told the Senate Armed Services Committee, which 
is reviewing the Kosovo campaign and lessons learned from it.

poor. Bradley proposed automatic, annual increases in the minimum 
wage and expanded tax credits and child care subsidies. He also 
called for government programs to recruit 60,000 teachers into poor 
school districts and give children an after-hours school hangout 
seven days a week. An estimated 13.5 million American children live 
in poverty, defined by the government as a yearly income of $16,400

Jervey was suspended for four games by the NFL for violating its 
policy on anabolic steroids and related substances. Jervey cannot 
return to the 49ers until Nov. 22, the day after the team plays the 
St. Louis Rams. He is expected to be out four weeks anyway, while 
recovering from ankle surgery. The NFL did not specify how Jervey 
had violated the policy.

<HEADLINE> Woman Beats Man in Kickboxing Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- A 24-year-old woman scored a first-round  
technical knockout over a 39-year-old man in a kickboxing match 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The scheduled three-round bout was stopped at the 1:20 mark  
after Sunshine Fettkether dropped Randy Pittman with a kick to the 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittman got up, staggered back to his corner, sat down and was  
counted out over the cheers and jeers of the standing room only 
crowd of 500 at the Nile Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Both fighters were taken to their locker rooms and not  
immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second man vs. woman match this month in the United  
States. 
</P>
<P>
	On Oct. 10 in Seattle, Margaret McGregor dominated Loi Chow for  
four rounds. That was believed to be the first time a man fought a 
woman in a sanctioned boxing match. 
</P>
<P>
	Fettkether, who won a silver medal at an amateur boxing  
tournament last year, claimed she couldn't find a female opponent 
for this anything-goes event. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittman, also of Mesa, listed brawls in bars as his only  
fighting experience. 
</P>
<P>
	The kickboxers wore gloves similar to boxing gloves and fought  
in accordance to Muay Thai rules, which permit punches and kicks to 
the head and body. 
</P>
<P>
	Mesa Mayor Wayne Brown tried unsuccessfully to stop the match --  
billed as Cage War II -- calling it distasteful and unsportsmanlike. 
Maricopa County officials said the bout did not appear to violate 
state law.

<HEADLINE> Rockies Ring in The Bell Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Despite a career winning percentage of .399 as a  
manager, Buddy Bell was the No. 1 choice of Colorado Rockies 
general manager Dan O'Dowd from Day One. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Rockies made it official, introducing Bell as  
the third manager in the team's seven-year history, succeeding Jim 
Leyland, who retired after the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Under orders from the commissioner's office to consider minority  
candidates, the Rockies had discussions with four minorities -- 
Arizona coach Carlos Tosca, Cincinnati coach Ken Griffey, Florida 
minor league manager Lynn Jones and New York Yankees coach Willie 
Randolph. Colorado had a black manager, Don Baylor, the first six 
years of the franchise's existence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I interviewed four minorities who were very impressive,''  
O'Dowd said, ``but none of them impressed me as much as Buddy Bell. 
He is the perfect fit for this ballclub.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, 48, who managed the Detroit Tigers from 1996-98, described  
himself as a player's manager who will emphasize defense and team 
chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell -- who has worked for the Cincinnati Reds the past year,  
most recently as director of player development -- signed a 
three-year contract believed to be worth about $2.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dowd, named the Rockies general manager a month ago, said Bell  
``knows the game. He knows how it should be played, and he will 
demand that from every one of our players. He understands the 
importance of creating an atmosphere where every player has the 
potential to play to the best of his ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dowd also promised to acquire talent ``to give Buddy the  
chance to put the kind of product on the field to realize our 
mission: having a championship-contending ballclub each and every 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denied those assurances in Detroit, Bell guided the Tigers back  
to respectability but was fired late in his third season. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished runnerup in the 1997 AL Manager of the Year  
balloting after leading the Tigers to a 79-83 record, a 26-game 
improvement over the previous year. But the Tigers cut their 
payroll for 1998, and Bell was fired on Sept. 1, 1998, after a 
52-85 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``My run in Detroit was great as long as it lasted,'' Bell said  
at a news conference. ``I think it taught me I could manage. It 
also taught me about getting along with people in the organization, 
how important scouting and player development are, the business 
side of things. Everybody has to work together. When you're a 
player, you don't necessarily understand that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the best fielding third basemen of his generation, Bell  
played 18 seasons in the majors for Cleveland, Texas, Cincinnati 
and Houston. A five-time All-Star, he hit .279 for his career with 
201 homers and 1,106 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell worked with O'Dowd when the pair were in the Cleveland  
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``My initial appeal for this job, obviously, was because of Dan  
O'Dowd,'' Bell said. ``I trust Dan's leadership, I enjoy his 
aggressiveness and I understand his plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``But Dan O'Dowd is not the only reason that I'm here. I had  
other opportunities. I am not going to pick up my family and move 
to Colorado if I didn't think this was a great move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the negotiating process for Bell's contract, one of the final  
pieces to fall into place was Bell's willingness to move to Denver 
from his home in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies, who finished 72-90 this season, want to avoid a  
repeat of this summer when Leyland lived in the Colorado clubhouse 
while his family stayed in Pittsburgh. The Rockies also want their 
new manager to be more involved in the community and to have input 
in trade discussions and free-agent decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like players,'' Bell said. ``I prefer to give them the  
benefit of the doubt. I can be demanding at times, but I also 
understand how hard this game is to play. And I think that gives me 
a little edge on some other people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said getting adjusted to the high-altitude dangers of Coors  
Field will take some time, but he has some theories. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an offensive ballpark,'' he said. ``Defense has to be  
a priority. You can't walk people, you can't make errors, you can't 
give up the extra base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell is expected to retain Rockies hitting coach Clint Hurdle  
and third base coach Rich Donnelly from Leyland's staff. The team 
also has had discussions with Marcel Lachemann about becoming the 
pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need good people around me,'' Bell said. ``There are some  
guys I want to bring over here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said chemistry ``is a major part of any successful team.  
Look at the Yankees. They might not have the best talent, but they 
have the best team because they have guys who can play together. I 
prefer that.''

<HEADLINE> School Bus Hits Dump Truck in N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CENTRAL BRIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- A bus transporting elementary school  
pupils on a Halloween-time field trip collided with a dump truck 
this morning, injuring dozens of youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	The students were first- and second-graders at Albany school No.  
118. They were being taken to visit a pumpkin patch in Schoharie 
County, about 30 miles west of Albany, when the crash happened 
shortly after 10:30 a.m., school spokesman David Albert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two students were listed in critical condition after being  
airlifted to Albany Medical Center, and an adult with grave 
injuries also was being transported via helicopter for treatment, 
hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 41 other people were taken to hospitals in Albany and  
elsewhere, authorities said. Two were in stable condition and two 
were listed as fair, said hospital officials. The conditions of the 
rest were not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a room full of kids here, and we are currently in the  
process of preparing a list and notifying parents,'' said Tina 
Swayze, spokeswoman for Bassett Hospital in Cobleskill. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 44 pupils, plus teachers and parent chaperones, on  
the bus, which was traveling south across an intersection when it 
was hit in the right rear by the dump truck and spun 180 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus rolled to a stop in grass about 500 feet away from the  
point of impact. The hood of the bus was ripped off by the impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Albany school officials told parents to meet at a local school  
so they could be transported to whichever hospital their children 
were taken. Crisis counseling teams were on hand.

<HEADLINE> Woman Cleared in Preschool Sex Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- A woman convicted in one the most lurid  
mass child-molestation cases of the 1980s will not have to serve 
any further time in prison, a judge ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Paul Chernoff allowed the time Cheryl Amirault LeFave had  
served on an eight- to 20-year sentence to stand after prosecutors 
did not oppose her motion to reduce her sentence. She had already 
served more than eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are extremely pleased Cheryl will not have to return to  
prison, not today, not ever,'' defense lawyer James Sultan said. 
``She will now have the opportunity to go on with her life without 
having the sword of Damocles hanging over her head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. LeFave, 41, appeared overcome with emotion after the ruling.  
She did not speak to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. LeFave, her brother Gerald Amirault and their late mother,  
Violet Amirault, were convicted of sexually assaulting young 
children at their day care center in Malden, the Fells Acres Day 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amiraults have insisted they are innocent. They say they are  
the victims of a sex abuse hysteria that swept the country in the 
1980s, and that prosecutors relied on the questionable testimony of 
child witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge overturned the convictions of Ms. LeFave and her mother  
in 1995, setting them free. But the state's highest court 
reinstated the convictions of Ms. LeFave in August, meaning she 
faced a return to prison under her original sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernoff today granted a request by lawyers for Ms. LeFave that  
her sentence be revised to the time she already had served, 
effectively freeing her. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Lynn Rooney said it was in the interest of justice  
not to oppose the request. She said prosecutors also had the 
victims' interests in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``This ordeal has been going on for them 15 years and it's time  
that it ends,'' Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
	In agreeing to the request, Rooney said LeFave cannot contact  
the victims or their families, can have no unsupervised contact 
with children, and that she must agree not to profit as a result of 
her crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Violet Amirault died two years ago and Gerald Amirault is still  
in prison, having lost his appeal requests. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said there were about 40 victims between the ages of  
2 and 4. Middlesex District Attorney Martha Coakley has long 
maintained that the children told the truth when they described 
being tied to trees, sexually penetrated with knives and tortured 
by a ``bad clown'' in a ``secret room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No corroborating physical evidence and no testimony from a  
teacher or visitor at the school supported the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Other high-profile abuse cases that surfaced in the 1980s and  
'90s have fallen apart, including the McMartin Preschool case in 
California, the Little Rascals case in North Carolina and the 
Margaret Kelly Michaels case in New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Merck Meets Earnings Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Merck &AMP; Co. met Wall Street's third-quarter earnings forecasts,  
but rivals SmithKline Beecham and Monsanto fell just short of 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	A look at the companies' results:  

</P>
<P>
                            *Merck &AMP; Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	Merck's third-quarter profit rose 13 percent, driven by rising  
sales of its top-selling prescription drug, the 
cholesterol-lowering pill Zocor. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck, the world's largest pharmaceutical company, reported  
Thursday it earned $1.54 billion in the quarter, or 64 cents a 
share, compared to $1.37 billion, or 56 cents per share, a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Results matched forecasts of analysts surveyed by First  
Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 20 percent to $8.2 billion from $6.84 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Zocor rose 17 percent to $1.16 billion, an improvement  
from the drug's recent growth rate of 11 percent to 12 percent. 
Although Zocor is the second best selling drug in the world it has 
lost market share in the United States to Lipitor, a cholesterol 
drug co-marketed by Warner-Lambert and Pfizer. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck's double-digit sales growth was also attributed to the  
hypertension drug Cozaar and companion Hyzaar, which together had a 
sales increase of 27 percent, to $350 million. Sales of Fosamax, an 
osteoporosis drug, rose 44 percent to $280 million. 
</P>
<P>
	On the downside, Merck's other hypertension drug Vasotec and  
companion Vaseretic together had a sales increase of just 5 
percent, to $485 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck's heavily advertised male baldness pill Propecia had flat  
sales of $45 million. Propecia sales have been flat the past three 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Vioxx, the company's new arthritis pain drug introduced  
this summer, came to $111 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, Merck earned $4.32 billion or  
$1.79 per share, compared to $3.85 billion or $1.57 per share, a 
year ago. Sales rose 23 percent to $23.75 billion from $19.37 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Whitehouse Station, N.J.-based Merck rose $2.93 3/4 to  
$78.62 1/2 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                        *SmithKline Beecham    	
</P>
<P>
	British drugmaker SmithKline Beecham PLC said its third-quarter  
profits rose 10 percent, driven by sales of its new diabetes drug 
Avandia, its antibiotic Augmentin and new vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
	But even as the company reported good sales for Avandia,  
SmithKline said the drug was given a negative opinion by a European 
advisory panel. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline said it earned $486 million, or 44 cents a share,  
compared to $441 million, or 40 cents a share, in the same quarter 
a year earlier. Results fell a penny short of forecasts of analysts 
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell 6 percent to $3.05 billion from $3.27 billion,  
largely related to the company selling its laboratory and pharmacy 
benefits businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline, whose U.S. headquarters are in Philadelphia, said  
the sales and profit figures excluded a $238 million special charge 
during the third quarter relating to a restructuring earlier in the 
year.

<HEADLINE> Drug Overdose Killed Rock Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Bobby Sheehan, the bassist for the  
Grammy-award winning rock band Blues Traveler, accidentally 
overdosed on a combination of drugs, a coroner has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheehan, 31, found dead two months ago in his home, had heroin,  
cocaine and Valium in his system, toxicology tests showed. 
</P>
<P>
	Coroner Frank Minyard classified Sheehan's death as an  
accidental overdose. 
</P>
<P>
	``He lost his life at a very early age,'' Minyard said  
Wednesday. ``It's very sad. This guy had a bright future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheehan and three high school friends formed Blues Traveler in  
New York in the mid-1980s. Led by harmonica virtuoso John Popper, 
they build up a national following. The hit single ``Runaround,'' 
which won a Grammy in 1995, catapulted sales of the band's album 
``Four'' past the 4 million mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheehan moved in 1996 to New Orleans, where Blues Traveler had  
performed at the Jazz and Heritage Festival. Sheehan performed at 
this year's Jazzfest with blues guitarist John Mooney's band. 
</P>
<P>
	Popper said recently that he and the other two surviving members  
of the band plan to carry on without Sheehan.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Offers Youth Poverty Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Calling child poverty a hidden, ``slow-motion  
national disaster,'' Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley 
offered a $9.8 billion prescription today to lift family incomes 
through automatic, annual increases in the minimum wage and 
expanded tax credits and child care subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	He also proposed new government programs to recruit 60,000  
teachers into poor school districts and give children an 
after-hours school hangout seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do not look to raise the poorest children among us we  
have no heart. And if we do not nourish the spirit of our children, 
we have no soul,'' Bradley said in remarks prepared for delivery at 
a Brooklyn, N.Y., church. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 13.5 million American children live in poverty,  
defined by the government as a yearly income of $16,400 or less for 
a family of four. That population has shrunk from 15.3 million when 
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore took office in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``Child poverty is a kind of slow-motion national disaster,''  
Bradley said. ``We don't see it because it is usually hidden.'' He 
optimistically committed to halving the number of impoverished 
children by the end of his second term, if elected. 
</P>
<P>
	With the speech, Bradley and Gore, his rival for the Democratic  
presidential nomination, continued to circle each other. Gore 
jumped ahead of the former New Jersey senator Wednesday by 
announcing his own ideas on child poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	Both candidates also were giving environmental speeches this  
week, eager to air their positions on their own terms before their 
first debate next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore argued that the best way to reduce poverty is to enforce  
child support and get more fathers involved in parenting. Echoing 
his common criticism of Gore's proposals as small and ``timid,'' 
Bradley cast his anti-poverty plan as more comprehensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only in an indifferent moral universe can we feel satisfied  
with ourselves for lifting a small percentage of children out of 
poverty,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's office said Bradley was offering warmed-over Clinton  
administration proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Bradley is choosing to be an echo to Al Gore's voice  
in proposing policy that Al Gore has already been fighting -- the 
minimum wage increse, more teachers and tax credits for working 
poor,'' spokesman Chris Lehane said. The vice president has been an 
advocate for all three issues, though the administration's minimum 
wage proposal is not as sweeping as Bradley's. 
</P>
<P>
	As with the massive health insurance plan he proposed earlier,  
Bradley's poverty plan, priced at $9.8 billion annually, would be 
paid for out of the federal budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	To end the predictable political fight over the minimum wage, he  
proposed increasing it by $1 over two years -- a position he shares 
with Gore -- but then writing into law an automatic annual increase 
indexed to growth in the nation's median wage. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who voted against the Republicans' 1996 welfare  
overhaul that President Clinton signed into law, also proposed 
``fixing'' the provision requiring welfare mothers to let states 
collect and keep due child support. He would give welfare 
recipients whatever child support is collected from fathers who 
don't pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Over accusations by the Gore campaign that Bradley stood in the  
way when the Clinton administration tried in 1993 to expand the 
Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income working parents, Bradley 
suggested making more families eligible for the credit and 
increasing the amount of the credit due them. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, he proposed:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Making the popular Dependent Care tax credit (for up to $1,440  
in annual child care expenses for a family with two children) fully 
refundable so that poor parents owing little or no income tax get 
the full amount of the credit as a cash refund. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Expanding by $1 billion -- to $4.3 billion each year -- the  
child care subsidies available through a block grant program that 
currently reaches just 1 in 7 eligible children. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Allowing people eligible for food stamps to apply for them at  
more accessible locations, such as grocery stores, and during more 
convenient ``off'' hours. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Boosting funds for Head Start to enroll an additional 400,000  
children. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Creating a ``Teach to Reach'' program of student loan  
forgiveness for 60,000 college students, high school graduates and 
mid-career professionals who certify as teachers and commit to 
serving in poor urban or rural schools. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Starting national programs of after-school community centers  
to keep kids safe and productively occupied outside the normal 
school day, and ``second-chance homes'' where teen mothers can 
learn parenting skills and get job training and housing referrals, 
meant to reduce the teen pregnancy rate.

<HEADLINE> Quaker Oats Earnings Rise 9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Quaker Oats Co. reported Thursday its  
third-quarter operating income jumped 9 percent as the company 
benefited from a strong cereal showing and booming summer sales of 
its top-selling product, Gatorade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago-based food and beverage maker reported operating  
income of $245.5 million, or $1.01 a share, up from $226.2 million, 
or 90 cents a share, for the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings topped a consensus of analysts by First Call/Thomson  
Financial who had forecast 95 cents a share. Quaker stock fell 
$1.37 1/2 to $66.62 1/2 a share on the New York Stock Exchange in an 
overall bleak day on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the third quarter in a row in which they've blown away  
earnings estimates,'' said Craig Albert, an analyst for Sanford C. 
Bernstein &AMP; Co. Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Quaker, which also makes Cap'n Crunch and Quaker cereals and  
Rice-a-Roni side dishes, said its net earnings were $137.3 million, 
or 98 cents per share, up from $107.8 million, or 75 cents per 
share, for the third quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	That includes a previously announced restructuring charge in  
1999 and special charges in the same quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell to $1.38 billion from $1.41 billion for the same  
period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Momentum continued across the portfolio,'' said Robert S.  
Morrison, chairman, president and chief executive officer. ``We're 
particularly pleased with U.S. and Canadian Foods, which delivered 
strong volume and sales growth with solid operating income 
increases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cited Gatorade's summer season, during which the company  
added new flavors of the thirst quencher. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide Gatorade sales rose 4 percent to $593.3 million,  
including a 6 percent gain to $498.7 million in the United States 
and Canada. Gatorade profits were $124.4 million, up 9 percent from 
$113.7 million in the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Quaker's hot and cold cereals also posted strong growth -- within  
the United States; hot cereal sales were up 7 percent and cold 
cereals increased 5 percent. That offset a 1 percent decline in the 
snacks business that was blamed on poor sales of rice cakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most impressive thing is that they're able to use cost  
savings to drive top-line growth in the food portion of Quaker's 
business, which has been widely criticized as being the weak 
link,'' Albert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Quaker disclosed plans to streamline U.S. and  
Canadian operations as part of a three-year project it said could 
result in the loss of 1,200 jobs -- a tenth of its work force. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month earnings were $392.7 million, or $2.81 per share,  
compared to $208.8 million, or $1.47 per share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month sales were $3.78 billion, down 2.7 percent from $3.88  
billion.

<HEADLINE> Rhodes Seeks To Rebuild Colossus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RHODES, Greece (AP) -- The Colossus of Rhodes, a huge statue  
considered one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world, may once 
again rise above the island. 
</P>
<P>
	A project made public Thursday seeks to construct a new giant  
sentinel for the millennium dedicated to international peace and 
cooperation at a historic crossroads between Europe, Asia and the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was an unanimous decision ... for the idea to go ahead  
with the construction of a monument for the new millennium,'' 
Rhodes Mayor George Yiannopoulos said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wants the new statue to ``draw inspiration'' from the  
original Colossus, which was believed destroyed by an earthquake 
2,200 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	However, no one has any precise idea what the original looked  
like. It's been portrayed by modern artists and filmmakers as 
straddling the island's main harbor. But that design has been 
questioned as improbable considering ancient construct methods, 
experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Historical records suggest the Colossus was about 100 feet high.  
It was completed around 290 B.C. from melted down weapons left by 
enemies who tried to capture the island, documents say. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials on Rhodes have presented their idea to Greek officials  
and plan a worldwide fund-raising effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The government must give final approval for the new creation,  
which supporters hope to have finished before the 2004 Olympics in 
Athens. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the Seven Wonders listed by ancient Greeks, only the pyramids  
of Egypt remain.

<HEADLINE> 'Earth Religions' Week Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- A mayoral proclamation recognizing Earth  
Religions Awareness Week, is being criticized by local ministers 
who say the event invites witchcraft into town. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Leni Sitnick has apologized to offended clergy, but says  
the designation for the week of Oct. 25 will not be rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't tell anyone how to believe, but I support everyone's  
right to freedom of religion,'' she said. ``Being aware of 
different religions, of all religions ... should not be feared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's proclamation says pagan religions, or Earth-centered  
beliefs, are ``among the oldest spiritual systems on the planet'' 
and practitioners ``have given us practical knowledge of herbal 
remedies, midwifery and alternative forms of healing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Local ministers were among a group of 25 people who protested  
the mayor's decree at City Hall on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just wanted to counter that by making a positive statement  
that we believe Jesus is Lord,'' said Pastor Ken Lewis of the West 
Asheville Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Rev. Jim Dykes, chairman of the Community Council for Biblical  
Values, asked Sitnick to designate ``Lordship of Jesus Christ 
Week'' instead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Christian group also plans to ask city and county school  
systems for permission to present a ``historical account'' of the 
Christmas story in schools. State law allows for programs about 
religious holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	The call for a Christmas presentation was formed days after a  
Wiccan priestess presented a program at an area elementary school 
designed to dispel witchcraft myths -- something she's done every 
October for the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wicca religion celebrates seasonal and life cycles using  
rituals from pre-Christian Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Minister Albert Bishop of the Riverside Baptist Church said he  
was concerned that students might get curious about witchcraft and 
experiment with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they see these things happening, they may see it as  
exciting, and that may send them to hell,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Utes Standout Drums Defenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Utah running back Mike Anderson is so  
good, he could rush for 100 yards and even march with the band. 
</P>
<P>
	No, really.  
</P>
<P>
	Anderson is one of football's oldest cliches come to life. Back  
in high school in Winnsboro, S.C., he developed a passion for the 
drums, playing with the Fairfield Central marching band instead of 
playing football. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just fell in love with it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Anderson now plays for the Utes (5-1, 2-0 Mountain West) but he  
didn't follow a conventional recruiting trail. The 26-year-old 
senior spent four years in the Marines and two years at a 
California junior college. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel blessed,'' Anderson said. ``I got a late start, but I  
got a second chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He never lost his love for music. When Utah's band plays the  
fight song in the stands, Anderson often keeps rhythm on the 
sideline, tapping the beat and thinking of his buddies on the drum 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get gigged up hearing the band,'' Anderson said. ``I was  
once one of them, sitting in the stands and having a good time at 
the football games. It's like a big family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Anderson leads Utah against San Diego State (3-4,  
1-2). 
</P>
<P>
	After missing one game with an injured foot and gaining a  
season-low 51 yards in a snowy 21-15 victory at Air Force last 
weekend, Anderson is averaging 87.6 rushing yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
	With two 100-yard games this fall, he's the No. 2 rusher in the  
Mountain West. Last season, he averaged 106.6 yards a game to lead 
the old 16-team Western Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	As a high school freshman, Anderson was torn between the drums  
and football. He longed to carry the ball, but chose band when his 
coach put him on the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I decided I wouldn't benefit the team, or myself, playing a  
position I didn't enjoy,'' he said. ``Not that I'm a quitter. I 
just didn't think I could give 100 percent to football in that 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After high school, Anderson joined the Marines and played  
football on base teams. He was discovered by a retired colonel with 
ties to Mount San Jacinto Junior College, where Anderson later 
enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where the Utah coaches found him.  
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I saw him run, I knew he was for real,'' said  
Utes coach Ron McBride. ``He's got good speed, good power. He 
really wants to be good and he's always trying to get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After he arrived on campus, Anderson made friends with the  
marching band drummers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I showed them some things. They showed me some things,''  
Anderson said. ``They all know me. I haven't had a chance to play 
lately, but I've still got it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah marching band director Scott Hagen soon got word of  
Anderson's musical talent. Hagen has repeatedly invited Anderson to 
play with the band after a home game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could put him in formation and do some songs as the crowd  
is leaving,'' Hagen said. ``It would be great if he could come out 
and play with us after they won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McBride rejected the request, saying Anderson plays football  
now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too bad,'' Anderson said, smiling and shaking his head.  
</P>
<P>
	Anderson is majoring in sociology. He considered music but  
decided it would distract him from football. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd want to get out there and play with the band,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Recruiting unknowns like Anderson, McBride has quietly produced  
a string of solid running backs. Jamal Anderson of the Atlanta 
Falcons and Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala of the Pittsburgh Steelers 
played at Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	McBride said Mike Anderson compares favorably.  
</P>
<P>
	``These backs we've had here weren't nationally recognized, but  
now they're playing in the NFL,'' McBride said. ``They're making 
big money and this guy's as good as any of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson knows NFL teams will have concerns about his age. He  
wants a shot at the pros anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``All players who play at this level have dreams about the  
NFL,'' he said. ``I just look at it one day at a time. I don't want 
to get too far ahead of myself.''

<HEADLINE> Financial Overhaul Bill in Limbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate negotiators pressed ahead  
Thursday with major legislation reshaping the financial services 
industries despite a near-certain veto by President Clinton over 
community lending rules for banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, chairman of the Senate Banking  
Committee, announced his intention to continue pushing the measure 
after he and top administration officials, including Treasury 
Secretary Lawrence Summers, failed to reach agreement after days of 
intense closed-door negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is there is no agreement,'' Gramm told  
reporters. ``In the end, the president will have to make a 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Clinton vetoes the legislation, Gramm -- a strong supporter of  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush in his presidential quest -- said he still 
would be hopeful for its prospects because ``We'll have a new 
president in 15 months and I know who that new president is. ... I 
think we could have a great bill with a new administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the White House rejection of his proposal on community  
lending rules for banks, Gramm later presented it to House and 
Senate lawmakers drafting the financial overhaul legislation, which 
would lift Depression-era legal barriers and allow banks, brokerage 
firms and insurance companies to merge and sell each other's 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	His proposal was rejected in a mostly party-line vote Thursday  
evening by the lawmakers, who have been blending two separate 
versions of the legislation passed by the House and Senate earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration supports the legislative package in  
principle but has threatened a veto over provisions it says would 
weaken the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to 
make loans in low-income and minority areas in which they operate. 
Gramm, who drafted the provisions, is an outspoken conservative and 
longtime critic of the 1977 law and has blocked efforts to expand 
its reach in the new legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm said Thursday he had shown willingness to compromise on  
the issue but would not abandon his core requirement that community 
groups receiving money from banks under the law be compelled to 
disclose how they spent the money. 
</P>
<P>
	For the administration and key Democratic constituencies, the  
community lending law is a cherished icon that they credit with 
having boosted the renewal of inner-city areas in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are communities that are moving forward now because (the  
Community Reinvestment Act) ... was the economic engine,'' Rep. 
Bobby Rush, D-Ill., said during debate on Gramm's proposal in the 
drafting session. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street and the banking and insurance industries, meanwhile,  
have spent millions of dollars in recent years pushing for the 
financial overhaul legislation, insisting it would help consumers 
by providing one-stop financial shopping and saving them money. 
</P>
<P>
	This year Congress has come closer than ever to enacting  
legislation, but industry lobbyists have watched the prospects slip 
away in recent days as the administration officials, Gramm and 
other key Republican lawmakers struggled to reach an accord. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're dealing in hundreds of billions of dollars, people  
care,'' Gramm remarked wryly, 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, consumer advocates and lawmakers pushing for  
stronger consumer privacy protections have criticized the financial 
overhaul legislation as inadequate in that area and put additional 
pressure on Clinton to veto the bill in its current form. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the issues of poor people and privacy left over  
because all the big boys have already gotten what they want,'' said 
Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Releases Economic Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Steve  
Forbes unveiled his economic package Thursday at the home of a 
state employee and teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Stephen Frink said he liked Forbes and calculated that  
his family would save $1,000 under the proposed flat tax, he wasn't 
ready to sign on the dotted line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm seriously looking at Mr. Forbes,'' said Frink, who  
considers his family -- he has a wife and three children -- a typical 
middle class one. ``I am very glad he came.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said his plan -- a compilation of previously announced  
ideas -- would grow the economy by 75 percent, create more than 24 
million jobs, boost wages by two-thirds and cut the national debt 
by more than half. 
</P>
<P>
	A Virginia-based financial forecast firm run by former Reagan  
treasury officials calculated the plan's long-term effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Flanked by the Frinks and his wife Sabina, Forbes portrayed  
himself as the choice for conservative voters, saying he was a 
``true outsider'' with bold proposals in contrast to Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush, the front-runner the GOP presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have more substance on the table than all the other  
campaigns combined,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said this was the first time Forbes had pulled his  
proposals together and measured their effect. His plan includes: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Replacing the current tax code with a flat tax, allowing  
personal exemptions. A family of four earning $36,000 a year would 
pay no federal income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Allowing young workers to establish personal retirement  
accounts. By 2002, a worker could deposit 4 percent of their Social 
Security taxes into an account that would be invested in the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Limiting spending increases on discretionary, non-defense  
programs only to keep up with changes in inflation and population 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Consolidating and eliminating some government programs.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Creating a ``truly dynamic and competitive health insurance  
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Allowing parents to use government money to send children to  
the schools of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiscal Associates, the firm hired by Forbes, says the plan would  
increase economic growth from 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent -- 
increasing the U.S. economy from $9.8 trillion to $17.2 trillion. 
It says huge surpluses would result, allowing the $5.5 trillion 
federal debt to shrink by 60 percent in 2020. 
</P>
<P>
	But one economist said that while Forbes may have some good  
ideas, his projections are the product of ``wild guessing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers are kind of silly,'' said Russell Roberts of the  
Center for the Study of American Business at Washington University 
in St. Louis. ``There's no way to really assess whether the numbers 
are accurate or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kristen Tinsworth, spokeswoman for the Citizens for a Sound  
Economy, a pro-business, Washington think tank, said a flat tax 
would make the system less complicated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a simple, low, flat, fair way of doing things,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Forbes also announced that his campaign won support  
Thursday from backers of Elizabeth Dole in New Hampshire, Iowa and 
South Carolina. Dole pulled out of the race on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Young Champ Wants To Impress Deion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Washington Redskins rookie Champ Bailey is  
the youngest player ever to return an interception for a touchdown 
in an NFL game. His teammate, Darrell Green, is the oldest. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bailey's career goal isn't to be like Darrell. It's to be  
like Deion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey, who turned 21 in June, was named the NFC's defensive  
player of the week Wednesday for his three-interception performance 
-- including one returned 59 yards for his first NFL score -- in the 
Redskins' 24-10 victory at Arizona. Nothing would make him happier 
than a similar performance Sunday against Deion Sanders and the 
Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a guy that capable of doing things like that,'' Bailey  
said. ``And if I can get out there and do it again with him on the 
field that would make it that much more special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 7 overall draft pick who played both cornerback and  
receiver at Georgia, Bailey is expected to be Sanders' successor as 
the league's next two-way star. Going into training camp, coach 
Norv Turner conservatively suggested that Bailey should learn 
defense first and then maybe get some receiver work once the season 
was under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Such an experiment has been placed on hold, probably until next  
year. The Redskins offense, with Michael Westbrook and Albert 
Connell ranked fourth and fifth in the NFC in receiving yards, is 
doing fine just as it is. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a lot of improvement to do on the defensive side,''  
Bailey said. ``The offense is playing too well to just stick 
somebody in like that. I don't think I would hurt the offense, but 
I don't think I would make any big improvements. The offense is 
ranked No. 1 in the league right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey's receiving talents aren't going to waste, however. On  
one of his three interceptions Sunday, he chased down the pass as 
if he were the intended receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old Green, by contrast, is a great cover man who has  
been known to drop the occasional would-be interception, including 
one against the Cardinals. And strong safety Sam Shade has only 
four interceptions in his four-year career -- while Bailey has four 
in his first five games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every now and then if you drop a ball, he'll say something to  
you,'' Shade said. ``Like, `You could've had that one.' From Day 
One, I knew he was special, watching him move around and watching 
his hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey has a shot at Dan Sandifer's 51-year-old team record of  
13 interceptions in a season, if only because quarterbacks see him 
as the lesser of two evils. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think quarterbacks will shy away from me,'' Bailey  
said, ``because then they got to go to Darrell Green. Then you're 
looking for bigger trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which leaves Bailey on pace for rookie of the year honors,  
assuming he can stay on the field. His biggest embarrassment this 
season came not from being beat on a pass play, but rather in the 
first game against the Cowboys when he got cramps in the fourth 
quarter and had to watch from the sidelines as Dallas overcame a 
21-point deficit to win in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be very hydrated for this game,'' Bailey said.  
``I'm not going to let it happen again.''

<HEADLINE> A Bit of History in the Bowden Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Ann Bowden could be hiding in the Memorial Stadium stands  
Saturday night. What's on the field might be just too much. 
</P>
<P>
	On one sideline, Bobby, her husband of 50 years, will be going  
for career win No. 300. On the other, son Tommy will be trying to 
stop him. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I see that, I think I'm going to retreat up to the end  
zone in a high seat and sit there so I can kind of let my emotions 
hang out,'' Ann Bowden said of the milestone matchup of No. 1 
Florida State (7-0) at Clemson (3-3). 
</P>
<P>
	``If there wasn't so much at stake in this ball game, like our  
chance for a national championship,'' she added, ``I probably 
wouldn't think too much about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there sure is a lot to think about, especially for Ann  
Bowden and the rest of the Bowden clan, more than two dozen strong. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be so different from anything that has ever  
happened to us,'' Ann Bowden said. ``I don't think we'll realize it 
until the time comes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The time has just about arrived.  
</P>
<P>
	At Clemson's Death Valley, 69-year-old Bobby Bowden applies for  
membership in the exclusive 300 Club, which consists of Bear 
Bryant, Pop Warner, Amos Alonzo Stagg and Joe Paterno among 
Division I-A coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be excited, and Tommy will be excited,'' Bobby Bowden  
said. ``But I don't think it will have one bit of an effect in the 
game. We're going to do what we're going to do anyway. We might 
have a trick or two up our sleeve. I'm going to have one for him, 
and I know he's going to have one for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Bowden, in his first season at Clemson after leading  
Tulane to a perfect record in '98, is playing it cool. He's putting 
all the pressure on his father. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they lose, they lose a national championship,'' Tommy said.  
``If we lose, we're 3-4.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Penn State's Paterno reached 300 last season in a rout of  
Bowling Green, a packed Beaver Stadium crowd chanted, ``Joe 
Pa-terno, Joe Pa-terno,'' and the coach broke down and cried, the 
memories of nearly 50 years in Happy Valley too much to contain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just overwhelmed with how much everyone wanted us to win  
the 300th game,'' Paterno said. ``I'm sure Bobby will go through 
the same kinds of emotion. You don't really think about it until it 
happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Bowden gets No. 300, it will be on the road and against his  
son. And for Ann Bowden it's very conflicting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she wants Florida State to win the game because we've  
got so much riding on it,'' Bobby Bowden said. ``But she wants her 
son to make it as tight as he can make it, a close game. She'd be 
very happy if it's a one-point win for Florida State.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The events that led to this moment are as unique as the matchup  
itself -- the first time a father has coached against his son in a 
major college game. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Bowden was supposed to have the honor of coaching against  
his father, in Auburn's season opener. But he resigned near 
midseason last year, and the school then bought its way out of the 
game against the Seminoles, creating bitter feelings between the 
Bowdens and Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame for Auburn that the game wasn't played,'' said  
Terry Bowden, an ABC college football analyst and one of the few 
Bowdens unable to attend the game. ``I guess with Tommy, it's a 
pretty good second choice. It's not so bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And who's Terry rooting for? ``I want a close victory for my  
dad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It may be fitting for Bowden to secure No. 300 on the road.  
Nearly two decades ago, the fun-loving and folksy coach earned the 
nickname ``King of the Road'' by taking his not-so-well known 
Seminoles almost anywhere to play. Unlike other supposed patsies, 
Bowden's boys were ready. 
</P>
<P>
	In his now infamous ``Octoberfest of 1981'' -- he went 3-2 in  
road games against the glamour teams of the decade, beating Ohio 
State, Notre Dame and LSU, and losing at Nebraska and Pittsburgh. 
He calls it the turning point for Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	While coaching greats such as Bryant, Paterno, Nebraska's Tom  
Osborne, Ohio State's Woody Hayes and Michigan's Bo Schembechler 
inherited highly successful teams, Bowden started from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Bowden, a wide receiver for his father at West Virginia in  
the 1970s, remembers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went to what used to be an all girls school, and one that  
just started playing football 20 years ago,'' Tommy said of Bobby, 
who resigned at West Virginia to take the Florida State job in 
1976. ``He didn't play for a Bud Wilkinson or Bear Bryant, or 
someone who could pick up the phone and give their assistants a 
pretty good recommendation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No, Bobby Bowden, son of a Birmingham, Ala., banker during the  
Depression, was a quarterback at Alabama for one year before he met 
his wife, then he transferred to Howard College (now Samford). He 
spent four years as coach at Samford, six years at West Virginia, 
and is in his 24th season at Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	Once, in 1986, he almost left. To return to Alabama.  
</P>
<P>
	``If they'd have offered it to me, I'm afraid I would've gone,''  
Bowden said. ``It was my home and I felt like I probably ought to 
go back home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure glad I didn't. The good Lord took care of me there.''  
</P>
<P>
	And the Seminoles have taken care of him in Tallahassee. Along  
the road to 300, Bowden has set standards that will be difficult to 
match: 
</P>
<P>
	--12 seasons and counting with a top four finish in the AP poll.  
</P>
<P>
	--12 seasons and counting of 10 or more wins.  
</P>
<P>
	--103 wins in the 1990s -- and counting.  
</P>
<P>
	--14 bowls without a loss (13-0-1 from 1982-1995).  
</P>
<P>
	--Five preseason No. 1 rankings.  
</P>
<P>
	--One national championship (1993).  
</P>
<P>
	Through the years, Bowden, like Paterno, has been able to relate  
to players, regardless of the cultural changes. Former Seminoles 
range from outspoken All-American Deion Sanders to soft-spoken 
Heisman Trophy winner Charlie Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden is now awaiting word on the future of Peter Warrick. The  
star receiver is trying to work out a plea agreement in connection 
with a department store scam, but he probably won't play against 
Clemson. Already, Warrick's suspension has kept him from two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Bowden says his father's flexibility across the decades is  
one of his great strengths. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has made philosophy changes in X's and O's,'' he said.  
``But to me it's the ability to relate to players and those 
changes. The earrings, the hair, things like that. He has adjusted 
with the times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And now, for all the Bowdens, it's a time like no other.

<HEADLINE> IBM Stock Plunges on Y2K Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM's stock lost one-fifth of its value today,  
slicing more than 100 points off the Dow Jones industrial average, 
after the company warned that fears of the Year 2000 computer bug 
are hurting sales even more than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Although strong demand for software and systems support drove  
IBM's third-quarter profits 14 percent higher, matching most 
forecasts, the results reported late Wednesday weren't hearty 
enough to overshadow the accompanying warning from the company. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Year 2000 date change threatening to cause widespread  
computer failures, would-be buyers of IBM's powerful network and 
database servers are proving extremely hesitant about complicating 
matters by adding new systems, IBM said. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from that business dropped 40 percent in the third  
quarter compared with a particularly strong showing in the same 
period last year, and the weakness is expected to continue through 
the fourth quarter and into January, executives warned. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is more apparent that many customers had bought ahead to  
accommodate Y2K testing'' of their existing computer systems, and 
``slowed the deployment of more complex systems ... until after the 
millennium,'' said Doug Maine, IBM's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine noted that 70 percent of the world's business data is  
managed by IBM servers. Those machines, including banking and 
airline reservations systems, ``simply cannot go down,'' he said. 
But, Maine added, ``once we get past these lingering Year 2000 
effects, we should see an acceleration of demand'' for heavy-duty 
systems to meet the explosion of Internet-related commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the report was released Wednesday, IBM's stock had soared  
to $112.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. But when the report was 
released after the close of that exchange, the stock sank on other 
markets affiliated with the NYSE, closing at $107, and then 
continued to plunge in after-hours trading. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, IBM's shares opened at $90.12 1/2 on the NYSE, a drop  
of $16.87 1/2 from Wednesday's NYSE closing price and $22.62 1/2 below 
the 4 p.m. quote used to calculate the closing price of the Dow 
Jones industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
	A drop of $22.62 1/2 by IBM, one of the 30 companies that make up  
the Dow, is equivalent to 114-point loss by that famous market 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, the Dow had jumped 187 points on Wednesday as a strong  
profit report from Microsoft helped restore confidence following a 
weak third-quarter showing from Intel last week. It wasn't clear 
whether IBM's slowdown, possibly only temporary, would extinguish 
the market's renewed optimism or be treated as an isolated problem. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM also said its third-quarter results were hurt by shortages  
of flat-panel computer screens for its ThinkPad laptops, as well as 
price competition in the market for computer harddrives. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's third-quarter operating profit amounted to $1.69  
billion, or 90 cents per share, for the July-September period. 
</P>
<P>
	Those figures exclude a $366 million gain from the sale of the  
company's Web services unit to AT&AMP;T Corp. and other one-time 
factors that gave IBM a net profit of $1.76 billion, or 93 cents 
per share. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, IBM earned $1.49 billion or 78 cents a share in the  
year-ago period, when there were no one-time factors. 
</P>
<P>
	The operating profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 was in  
line with analyst forecasts, according to a survey by First 
Call/Thomson Financial, marking the 14th straight quarter IBM has 
met or exceeded expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, IBM's third-quarter revenues rose 5 percent to $21.14  
billion, up from $20.10 billion a year ago. Most of that gain came 
from the systems management unit, IBM Global Services, where 
revenues rose 12 percent to $7.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, IBM's net profit totaled  
$5.61 billion or $2.99 per share, including a one-time gain of $750 
million from the AT&AMP;T deal and other one-time factors. In the same 
period a year ago, IBM earned $3.97 billion, or $2.05 a share. 
Nine-month revenues totaled $63.37 billion, up 12 percent from 
$56.54 billion tallied at the same point last year.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen early  
Friday in quiet, pre-weekend trading. Japanese stocks rose 
slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 106.16 yen, up 0.04 yen from late Thursday in  
Tokyo and also above its level of 105.86 yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 24.21  
points, or 0.14 percent, to 17,422.48 in the first 30 minutes of 
trading. On Thursday, the average closed down 86.44 points, or 0.49 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar nudged higher as some investors  
covered short, or oversold, positions ahead of the weekend amid a 
lack of market-moving news, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 114.08 yen, down  
from 114.36 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices in Tokyo opened little changed  
despite a decline earlier on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said they expected the Tokyo stock market to remain  
quiet as investors were still trying to confirm the direction of 
the U.S. stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be difficult for investors to take positions ahead of  
the weekend,'' said Kazunori Jinnai, deputy general manager at 
Daiwa Securities SB Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell  
94.67 points to 10,297.69, hurt by a pessimistic profit outlook 
from IBM late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 3.73 points, or 0.25 percent, to 1,507.67. The 
TOPIX closed down 3.37 points, or 0.22 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond  
stood at 1.8700 percent, unchanged from Thursday's finish. Its 
price remained at 99.40.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Questioned Over Valuables </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and  
his wife Sarah were questioned by police today after officers 
seized dozens of valuable items the couple is suspected of having 
kept illegally after he left office. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu waved briefly before he and his wife entered the Fraud  
Squad headquarters in the Tel Aviv suburb of Bat Yam. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu's lawyer, David Shimron, said his client had not done  
anything wrong and accused police of conducting a politically 
tainted investigation. Shimron said the items were in storage to be 
sorted. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the searches were connected to an ongoing  
investigation into allegations that Netanyahu accepted illegal 
favors from a contractor, Avner Amedi, while in office. In that 
case, Netanyahu and his wife were questioned for more than seven 
hours last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedi's lawyer, Yaron Rabinovitch, said the contractor had  
promised to provide information on the Netanyahus to the police as 
part of a plea bargain deal. According to Israel army radio, Amedi 
will admit to bribery, but not serve jail time. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, police investigators searched Netanyahu's  
Jerusalem apartment, his office and a storage room he uses. 
Journalists were tipped off in advance, while the Netanyahus were 
taken by surprise, prompting accusations that the police were 
treating the couple unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could have been handled in an entirely different way,''  
said Shimron. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said dozens of items were seized, including pictures and  
gold and silver utensils. They did not say whether the pictures 
were works of art or photographs, or whether the items were 
official gifts he was given while in office. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Israeli law, gifts received by a prime minister are  
property of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Shimron said the storage room was a government facility and that  
the items were being held there, along with some of the Netanyahus' 
personal property, so they could eventually be sorted out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was for temporary storage, between the phases of official  
and private life,'' Shimron told Israel army radio. 
</P>
<P>
	The Netanyahus have been interrogated in the past about a bill  
for $100,000 submitted by Amedi for work he did for the couple 
while Netanyahu was prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Amedi's work was at Netanyahu's private home. An Israeli  
newspaper, Yediot Ahronot, reported that Amedi polished the floors 
weekly, though the Netanyahu family was living in the official 
prime minister's residence at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedi submitted bills for moving furniture from the apartment.  
Because Amedi was never paid, police suspect that he was expecting 
to receive some sort of improper payment. He later submitted the 
bill to the prime minister's office after Netanyahu lost the 
Israeli election in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other former officials from Netanyahu's office have also  
been questioned in the affair, but no formal charges have been 
brought. 
</P>
<P>
	Police earlier warned Netanyahu and his wife that they might be  
charged with criminal offenses in the case. Wednesday's statement 
was the first indicating police suspicion that the couple also took 
presents home illegally.

<HEADLINE> FBI Warns of Millennium Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI wants state and local police to be on  
the lookout for possible attacks at the turn of the millennium by 
hate or apocalyptic groups or lone wolf members of them. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau intends to distribute a 40-page research report,  
entitled Project Megiddo, that analyzes ``the potential for 
extremist criminal activity in the United States by individuals or 
domestic groups who attach special significance to the year 2000,'' 
according to an FBI written statement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no specific threats, but we often alert law  
enforcement agencies about impending dates with significance for 
potential terrorists,'' FBI spokesman Bill Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, the FBI annually reminds state and local law  
enforcement that April 19 is the anniversary of the 1995 bombing of 
an Oklahoma City federal building and the 1993 federal assault on 
the Branch Davidian sect outside Waco, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The research report, named after an ancient battleground in  
Israel cited in the Bible's New Testament as the site of a 
millennial battle between forces of good and evil, examines 
ideologies ``which advocate or call for violent action beginning in 
the year 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Such ideologies motivate violent white supremacists who seek  
to initiate a race war; apocalyptic cults which anticipate a 
violent Armageddon; radical elements of private citizen militias 
who fear that the United Nations will initiate an armed takeover of 
the United States and subsequently establish a One World 
Government, and other groups or individuals which promote violent 
millennial agendas,'' the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also outlines indicators of potential violence,  
possible preparations for violence and possible targets of 
millennial extremists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern is with fringe, hate or apocalyptic groups or lone  
wolf members of them who may pose a threat,'' Carter said. ``We're 
not focusing on militias.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Oklahoma City bombing, the FBI has asked its 56 field  
offices to meet militia groups in their regions periodically to 
foster communication and explain that the FBI is not targeting 
``the majority of militia members (who) engage in law abiding 
activities,'' the bureau statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some militias ``have taken positive steps toward ridding  
themselves of violent extremist elements,'' the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These extreme members will splinter from more established  
groups and engage in violence autonomously,'' the bureau said. 
``More mainstream militia groups have been helpful in identifying 
the more extremist elements of the militia who may resort to acts 
of violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, some militia figures have been brought in to help the  
FBI negotiate with the Freemen group under siege in Montana and to 
help try to locate accused Olympic bomber Eric Rudolph. 
</P>
<P>
	The lone wolf threat was exemplified by Buford Furrow Jr., who  
surrendered in August to face charges of killing a 
Filipino-American mail carrier and wounding four children and woman 
at Jewish community center in California. Furrow has ties to 
anti-Semitic hate groups in the Pacific Northwest, including the 
Aryan Nations and the Christian Identity religious movement, which 
considers whites a superior race. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI officials will distribute copies of the report and discuss  
it at a meeting of the International Association of Chiefs of 
Police later this month in Charlotte, N.C. Later, copies will be 
sent to state and local law enforcement agencies, Carter said. At 
some point, a version might be made public.

<HEADLINE> Quaker Oats Earnings Rise 9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Quaker Oats Co. reported Thursday its  
third-quarter operating income jumped 9 percent as the company 
benefited from a strong cereal showing and booming summer sales of 
its top-selling product, Gatorade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago-based food and beverage maker reported operating  
income of $245.5 million, or $1.01 a share, up from $226.2 million, 
or 90 cents a share, for the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings topped a consensus of analysts by First Call/Thomson  
Financial who had forecast 95 cents a share. Quaker stock was down 
$3 to $65 a share on the New York Stock Exchange in an overall 
bleak day on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the third quarter in a row in which they've blown away  
earnings estimates,'' said Craig Albert, an analyst for Sanford C. 
Bernstein &AMP; Co. Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Quaker, which also makes Cap'n Crunch and Quaker cereals and  
Rice-a-Roni side dishes, said its net earnings were $137.3 million, 
or 98 cents per share, up from $107.8 million, or 75 cents per 
share, for the third quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	That includes a previously announced restructuring charge in  
1999 and special charges in the same quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell to $1.38 billion from $1.41 billion for the same  
period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Momentum continued across the portfolio,'' said Robert S.  
Morrison, chairman, president and chief executive officer. ``We're 
particularly pleased with U.S. and Canadian Foods, which delivered 
strong volume and sales growth with solid operating income 
increases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cited Gatorade's summer season, during which the company  
added new flavors of the thirst quencher. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide Gatorade sales rose 4 percent to $593.3 million,  
including a 6 percent gain to $498.7 million in the United States 
and Canada. Gatorade profits were $124.4 million, up 9 percent from 
$113.7 million in the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Quaker's hot and cold cereals also posted strong growth -- within  
the United States; hot cereal sales were up 7 percent and cold 
cereals increased 5 percent. That offset a 1 percent decline in the 
snacks business that was blamed on poor sales of rice cakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most impressive thing is that they're able to use cost  
savings to drive top-line growth in the food portion of Quaker's 
business, which has been widely criticized as being the weak 
link,'' Albert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Quaker disclosed plans to streamline U.S. and  
Canadian operations as part of a three-year project it said could 
result in the loss of 1,200 jobs -- a tenth of its work force. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month earnings were $392.7 million, or $2.81 per share,  
compared to $208.8 million, or $1.47 per share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month sales were $3.78 billion, down 2.7 percent from $3.88  
billion.

<HEADLINE> Report: Spy Network Eavesdropping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An ultra-secret spy network reportedly is  
eavesdropping on e-mails -- looking for words suggesting terrorist 
plots and other nefarious acts -- and prompting angry Internet users 
to try to overwhelm the listeners by flooding the system with 
fabricated messages. 
</P>
<P>
	In an attempt at electronic civil disobedience Thursday,  
organizers urged Internet users on dozens of Web sites and in 
discussion groups to bombard the U.S. National Security Agency with 
millions of e-mails with subversive-sounding language. ``Give the 
(NSA) their keywords!'' one person wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear who thought up ``Jam Echelon Day,'' as it was  
called in one message from an Australia-based Web site, but the 
intent was clear: Flood the NSA's powerful computers with enough 
suspicious traffic to crash them and disrupt the high-tech 
listening system, code-named ``Echelon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 report commissioned by the European Parliament described  
``routine and indiscriminate'' monitoring of fax, e-mail and 
telephone messages in Europe by the global spy network, which it 
said was coordinated by the NSA with the help of other nations' 
security organizations. A follow-up study for the European Union 
this year found the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., has said he supports congressional  
hearings to determine the scope of the spy network's capabilities 
and to prevent abuses. The network is said to include a listening 
station in Sugar Grove, W.Va., about 250 miles from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The NSA, which is barred by law from spying on U.S. citizens,  
declined to comment Thursday on its network or the potential impact 
of the day's e-mail campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agency doesn't discuss alleged intelligence operations,''  
NSA spokeswoman Judith Emmel said. ``It doesn't confirm or deny any 
Echelon-type technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even supporters of the jamming campaign were pessimistic  
that their efforts would have much effect. They suggested the spy 
network was smart enough to ignore the e-mails typically sent with 
lists of random words, especially since many of the messages were 
in English -- not in Arabic or Indonesian, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will cause a lot of laughter up at NSA, to tell the  
truth,'' said Wayne Madsen of the Washington-based Electronic 
Privacy Information Center, who tracks news about Echelon. ``If 
they seriously think they're going to bring the computers at the 
NSA to a grinding halt, they're going to be seriously 
disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It will not, in fact, have any effect on their operations,''  
agreed Duncan Campbell of Edinburgh, Scotland, who wrote the most 
recent report about Echelon for the EU. ``They're used to 
electronic warfare and screening out noise put up by enemies. This 
is noise from dissenting citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said even if their e-mail campaign didn't cause the  
NSA's computers to crash, it was important at raising awareness of 
the spy network's rumored abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Internet, where conspiracy theorists flourish, it was  
impossible to count how many e-mails protesters might actually have 
sent, much less determine their effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we'll ever know,'' said Simon Davies, who heads  
London-based Privacy International, a human rights organization. 
``I would guess maybe it will be 10 years before we understand the 
ramifications of any civil disobedience campaign.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Campaigns to Undecided Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, N.H. (AP) -- With a new poll showing him and Bill Bradley  
in a statistical dead heat for the Democratic presidential 
nomination, Vice President Al Gore gathered a group of undecided 
voters Thursday and campaigned to be their choice. 
</P>
<P>
	The setting was pure Americana -- a dusty middle school gymnasium  
with 200 people sitting on bleachers and folding chairs. Gore's 
appeal was an equal serving of apple pie: ``I'm in this because I 
want to make a positive difference and I'm in this because I think 
I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For more than 90 minutes, the audience quizzed him on a wide  
range of subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	-- What can you do to make prescription drugs more affordable for  
me and other senior citizens? 
</P>
<P>
	-- How can we reduce smog and help my asthma?  
</P>
<P>
	-- Do you support work on 18 extra submarines at the Portsmouth  
Naval Shipyard, where I work? 
</P>
<P>
	-- What can you do to reform the campaign finance system?  
</P>
<P>
	But perhaps the most poignant moment came when a woman  
complained, ``One of the things that I need from a president is an 
honest man but a moral man, and I'm very disappointed in the last 
president. I want your viewpoint on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, his voice dropping noticeably, replied: ``I want to take  
my own values of faith and family to the presidency. I understand 
the disappointment that you feel, and I felt it myself. I think 
most people want to look to the future, turn that page and move on. 
So, all I can do is tell you about myself and about my commitment 
to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that, Gore recounted his personal history, his 29-year  
marriage and described his four children and first grandson, born 
on the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience was composed of likely but uncommitted voters  
identified by Gore's campaign through door-to-door canvassing and 
telephone banks. About 200 were invited -- some brought children -- 
and the campaign placed no restrictions on the content of their 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore stood near a wooden stool positioned in the center of the  
gym, framed on two sides by portable bleachers and the other two by 
folding chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The forum at the older of Dover's two middle schools came as the  
latest New Hampshire poll showed that Bradley, the former New 
Jersey senator and Gore's only challenger, was in a statistical tie 
with the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-five percent of 600 likely Democratic voters supported  
Bradley, compared with 41 percent for Gore. Other recent polls have 
shown similar dead heats. An August poll showed Gore leading 
Bradley 46 percent to 29 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also made his sales pitch in somewhat hostile territory.  
While Dover is a homey Seacoast City basking in the glory of New 
England's foliage season, its voters have been far from 
enthusiastic about Gore in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	As a presidential candidate in 1988, Gore finished fourth in  
Dover with 7.7 percent of the vote in the state's primary. 
Neighboring son Michael Dukakis was first with 37 percent, followed 
by Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri and former Sen. Paul Simon of 
Illinois.

<HEADLINE> Report: Disney, Hong Kong Agree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Walt Disney Co. and the Hong Kong government  
have reportedly reached key agreements on how to finance a new 
theme park here, as the two sides finalize details ahead of the 
Oct. 31 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	The government will provide the roads and other related  
infrastructure, but Disney must give the city some kind of 
financial compensation for the land, the independent Sing Tao Daily 
reported, quoting unidentified government sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong has been in negotiations with the Burbank,  
Calif.-based Disney for months, but had to extend the talks over 
the summer, saying at the time that financial obstacles remained. 
</P>
<P>
	Peggy Chau, a government spokeswoman, refused to comment on the  
report, but said an announcement is expected by Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial Secretary Donald Tsang reportedly said this week the  
government is ready to talk to rival Universal Studios if it cannot 
reach a deal with Disney by the end of the month.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushing Spending Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite veto threats from President Clinton  
and a contentious start to budget talks, Republicans are continuing 
to push overdue spending bills through Congress for the new fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans planned to try moving a $14.5 billion measure  
through the House today that would finance the Interior Department 
and cultural programs. The bill contains millions more than last 
year for many programs, but Clinton has threatened a veto because 
it has less than he wants for park land purchases and has 
provisions helping oil, mining and other industries he considers 
anti-environmental. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks to reporters Wednesday, Clinton maintained a positive  
tone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have a great opportunity to make this a season of  
progress and work together to pass a budget that lives within its 
means and lives up to our values,'' Clinton said. ``We've done it 
before and we can do it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Republicans hope to send Clinton the last and biggest  
of the 13 annual spending measures for fiscal 2000, which began 
Oct. 1. The bill would provide more than $300 billion for the 
departments of Health and Human Services, Labor and Education. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate Republicans have added billions of dollars to  
it in recent days -- including, they say, $340 million more than 
Clinton requested for education. But it too faces a veto threat 
because it lacks money for Clinton's plan to hire thousands of new 
teachers, and generally gives states added control of federal 
education dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep that bill from eating into Social Security surpluses --  
which both sides have promised not to do -- Republicans are strongly 
considering an across-the-board cut of about $5 billion out of the 
13 bills. Democrats say the reduction would be overly harsh, but 
GOP lawmakers say such a cut would be felt only slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. President, no means no,'' said House Majority Whip Tom  
DeLay, R-Texas, reiterating Republican promises to leave Social 
Security alone. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, both parties have used Social Security's surpluses to  
cover spending without diminishing the system's annual benefit 
payments. But looking ahead to next year's elections, each party is 
trying to cast itself as a protector of the massive pension program 
for the elderly and disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Congress sent Clinton a $39 billion measure  
financing the departments of Commerce, Justice and State. The House 
approved it 215-213, while the Senate used a voice vote to pass it. 
It too faces a veto threat because it provides less than Clinton 
wants for hiring police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP legislative push was mainly designed to let them argue  
that they had move all the required spending bills to Clinton's 
desk, and that he was vetoing them because he wants to spend more 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, budget talks at the Capitol between the Clinton  
administration and Congress got off to a rocky start as White House 
officials accused Republicans of ignoring a pact to stop attacking 
each other over Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	White House budget director Jack Lew complained that a news  
release by House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, and a news 
conference by DeLay violated an understanding reached Tuesday at a 
White House budget session between congressional leaders and 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Armey spokeswoman Michele Davis said the two sides had agreed  
not to attack each other, but Armey was merely repeating an 
argument he has used for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how you can commit to save Social Security, and  
not be allowed to say so,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Clinton has threatened to veto or vetoed five of the  
bills because of disputes over spending or policy. They cover the 
departments of Education, Interior and five other Cabinet level 
agencies, plus foreign aid and the District of Columbia's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	If those fights are not resolved by Tuesday, White House  
officials are threatening a veto of a sixth measure, a $268 billion 
defense bill. The administration hopes to use that threat for 
leverage because a veto would add it to the bills from which 
savings could be pulled to pay for other spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton signed the sixth spending bill of the new year  
Wednesday, a $99 billion measure financing housing, veterans and 
environmental programs. An earlier round of bargaining between 
lawmakers and the White House produced an added $7 billion to 
earlier House-approved levels for housing, space and other 
programs.

<HEADLINE> Jim Brown Refuses Community Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Football legend Jim Brown claims the female  
judge who presided over his domestic violence trial is biased 
against men, and he says he will refuse to collect trash as a form 
of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury found Brown guilty of vandalism on Sept. 10 for smashing  
his wife's car with a shovel during an argument. He was acquitted 
of charges that he had threatened his 25-year-old wife, Monique. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Dale Fischer sentenced Brown to three  
years' probation and ordered him to pay $1,700 in fines. He was 
also ordered to attend a domestic violence counseling program and 
to complete 400 hours of community service. Brown was to appear in 
court today to prove he had enrolled in the counseling and 
community service programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, 63, said Wednesday he filed a motion alleging Fischer is  
against men in general and black males in particular. The motion 
seeks to have her retroactively removed from his case and his 
sentence nullified. 
</P>
<P>
	During his sentencing earlier this month, Brown objected to any  
domestic violence conditions because he was acquitted of the threat 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not going to clean trash on the freeway. They can take my  
(driver's) license. I am not going to get on my knees, and if they 
give me the maximum sentence, I will serve it like a man,'' Brown 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In his motion, Brown claimed that Fischer is a leader of the  
American Inns of Court, a professional legal organization founded 
in Utah in 1980 that he said is a ``radical and extremist group'' 
opposed to minority men. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown was prosecuted for making a threat against his wife even  
though she recanted her accusations to police that he had 
threatened to snap her neck. 
</P>
<P>
	She testified that she made her initial remarks following a June  
15 fight at the couple's Hollywood Hills home to get attention 
because she believed her husband was having an affair.

<HEADLINE> Report Faults Cleanup At Kent. Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- A new federal report is sharply critical  
of cleanup efforts at an Energy Department plant where the 
government is investigating why workers were exposed to toxic 
material. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency report issued Wednesday also said the possibility of  
an uncontrolled nuclear reaction at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion 
Plant cannot be ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings are the result of a six-week DOE investigation into  
environmental, safety and health issues at the western Kentucky 
plant dating to 1990. The plant processed uranium. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe began after three plant employees filed a federal  
lawsuit alleging workers unwittingly were exposed to plutonium and 
other highly toxic substances from 1953 to 1976. The lawsuit is 
sealed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department, which owns the plant and is overseeing  
the $1 billion cleanup, has acknowledged that 103,000 tons of 
recycled uranium containing a total of 12 ounces of plutonium were 
handled in Paducah during the period. 
</P>
<P>
	Plutonium can cause cancer if ingested in quantities as small as  
one-millionth of an ounce. The Energy Department is investigating 
why workers were exposed to plutonium and whether contractors who 
operated the plant covered it up. 
</P>
<P>
	In their report, Energy Department investigators cited  
``continuing weaknesses in the radiation protection management of 
known environmental contamination areas'' by both contractor 
Bechtel Jacobs Co. LLC, as well as federal workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing ``a lack of rigor, formality and discipline,'' the report  
said the company's training programs fail to ensure all workers are 
knowledgeable about hazards and protection requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Further, radioactive material stored inside buildings at the  
complex has not been completely analyzed, leaving a risk for a 
reaction, investigators concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	David Michaels, the DOE's assistant secretary for environment,  
safety and health, said Bechtel Jacobs was not responsible for all 
of the plant's woes, many of which existed before it took over 
cleanup operations in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's plenty of blame to go around, and the DOE certainly is  
not exempt from looking at itself, and from considering that we had 
a role in allowing a lot of these problems to develop,'' Michaels 
said. ``If fingers are going to be pointed, they should be pointed 
in many directions at once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bechtel Jacobs spokesman Mark Musolf called the report ``tough  
but fair.'' The company has agreed to an independent review of how 
it protects workers from radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	During a recent visit to Paducah, Energy Secretary Bill  
Richardson apologized for what he said were lapses in 
accountability and oversight, and said he would ask Congress to 
compensate plant workers or their surviving spouses who could claim 
radiation-induced illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The report is the first half of a two-part review of the plant's  
operations. The second half, a more historical overview, will focus 
on how the plant was run from the time it opened in 1952 until 
1989.

<HEADLINE> Former DEA Agent Gets 15 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A former Drug Enforcement  
Administration agent was given the maximum sentence of 15 years in 
prison for shooting his partner while in a drunken stupor. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Fekete, 57, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the  
shooting of his partner, Shaun Curl, was also sentenced to 15 years 
probation, random drug testing and counseling. He must write a 
letter every year on the anniversary of Curl's death, explaining 
what happened, and apologizing to Curl's family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Paul Backman blamed Fekete's friends and  
colleagues for failing to take appropriate action to prevent the 
tragedy on Dec. 12, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it wasn't Shaun, it would've been somebody else. Mr. Fekete  
was a time bomb waiting to explode,'' Backman said. ``It's a 
travesty that the friends of Mr. Fekete, both within the agency and 
outside the agency, never stepped in to stop him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An undercover DEA agent testified that Fekete had got drunk at a  
Metro-Dade Police Christmas party and had to be helped to the car. 
Curl, 39, was driving Fekete to his home when Fekete pulled his gun 
and shot him several times in the head and chest. 
</P>
<P>
	A psychologist, a psychiatrist and a neuro-psychologist  
testified that Fekete was having an alcohol-induced psychotic 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuro-psychologist Dr. Jorge Herrera testified that in 1993,  
Fekete suffered brain damage when he fell and hit the back of his 
head on a metal deck. He was advised not to drink, because alcohol 
combined with a brain injury can trigger violent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987 Fekete killed a knife-wielding man at a bar in  
Philadelphia. He was working undercover at the time and had been 
drinking for four hours.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls in Quiet Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell slightly Thursday against most  
major currencies, dampened on a quiet trading day by the morning 
fall in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 105.86 yen,  
down from 106.50 late Wednesday. The euro was quoted at $1.0820, up 
from $1.0752. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks plunged as low as 210 points during the day, mostly  
because IBM announced that Year 2000 computer bug concerns are 
hurting hardware sales. The market recovered some ground late in 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar initially followed stocks lower, since declining  
equity markets lead foreign buyers to purchase fewer investment 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	But on a quiet trading day, the dollar's decline was tiny, and  
later the U.S. currency ignored the stock market's attempts to 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a pretty good rally in the last hour and not much  
reaction with the dollar,'' said David Solin, a partner at Foreign 
Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn. ``The trading back and forth in 
stocks didn't have a whole lot of impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4720 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4813, and 1.4822 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4865. The British 
pound rose to $1.6767 from $1.6644. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8078 German 
marks, down from 1.8191; 6.0727 French francs, down from 6.1011; 
and 1,789.69 Italian lire, down from 1,800.93.

<HEADLINE> Senate Supports Roe v. Wade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A narrow majority of the Senate voiced support  
today for the 1973 Supreme Court decision to legalize abortion. The 
vote was non-binding, but supporters said it would be used in the 
2000 elections against senators who voted the other way. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is now clear what the true agenda of the anti-choice  
members ... really is,'' Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said, minutes 
after an attempt to kill his non-binding resolution failed, 51-48. 
``They want to criminalize choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin said the resolution would be a key weapon during next  
year's campaigns, when a third of the Senate will be up for 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-seven of the Senate's 54 Republicans voted to kill  
Harkin's non-binding amendment, which reads: ``It is the sense of 
the Congress that Roe v. Wade was an appropriate decision and 
secures an important constitutional right and such a decision 
should not be overturned.'' They were joined by two Democrats, 
Sens. John Breaux of Louisiana and Harry Reid of Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine Republicans joined 43 Democrats in support of the  
resolution. The Republicans are Sens. John Chaffee of Rhode Island, 
Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado, Susan Collins of Maine, James 
Jeffords of Vermont, Olympia Snowe of Maine, Arlen Specter of 
Pennsylvania, Ted Stevens of Alaska and John Warner of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was the latest development in the Senate's debate over  
a bill to ban some late-term abortions, the third time in four 
years the issue has come before Congress. It is headed for the same 
outcome: a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents today condemned the legislation as unconstitutional  
and designed to boost GOP election prospects next year at the 
expense of pregnant women whose lives and health are in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the third time the president will veto this bill,''  
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif, said Wednesday. ``Why go through this 
if not for politics?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House issued a statement Wednesday saying the bill  
``contains the same serious flaws'' as the bills Clinton vetoed in 
1996 and 1997, and that the president will veto this one as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's sponsor, Sen. Rick Santorum, said unborn children  
deserved another attack on a medical practice that brutalizes ``the 
most vulnerable members of our society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about infanticide,'' Santorum, R-Pa., said from the  
Senate floor. ``This is a baby who is all but born and then 
killed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a replay of previous debates over similar bills since 1995,  
two presidential vetoes and two failed override attempts, 
Wednesday's debate almost immediately degenerated into an argument 
over the definitions of viable life and when a fetus should be 
considered born. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure in question involves the partial, feet-first  
delivery of a fetus and the draining of its skull contents. 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum's bill, the ``Partial Birth Abortion Act of 1999,''  
would make it a felony punishable by a fine and/or a two-year 
prison term unless the procedure is ``necessary to save the life of 
a mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, illness 
or injury.'' The mother could not be prosecuted under the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, the legislation provides for lawsuits against the  
physician by the father of the fetus and by the mother's parents, 
in certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate on Wednesday rejected 61-38 an alternative, sponsored  
by Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., that would have stopped all abortions 
after fetuses can survive outside the womb, except in cases where 
two independent doctors certify a woman's life was at risk or she 
faced ``grievous injury'' to physical health. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said the proposal was a broadly worded attempt to  
permit abortions in almost all cases because pregnancy easily can 
be considered a threat to a woman's health. 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum's bill has little chance of becoming law. Senior Senate  
Republican aides who spoke on condition of anonymity acknowledged 
that even if Santorum's bill passes, it would likely fall short of 
the two-thirds majority required to override Clinton's expected 
veto. 
</P>
<P>
	It has sparse support in the courts. Thirty states have passed  
late term abortion bans, but lower courts in two-thirds of those 
states have struck down or prevented the activation of those laws. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 1692.

<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Massachusetts Teachers Association said  
Thursday it was endorsing Vice President Al Gore in next year's 
Democratic presidential primary. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision followed the National Education Association recent  
vote to back Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``During his seven years as vice president and during his prior  
congressional experience Al Gore has been right on the issues that 
are important to our members, such as children's health and safety, 
maximizing student learning and respecting education employees,'' 
MTA president Stephen Gorrie said in a statement.

</P>
<P>
	The 87,000-member MTA's decision to concur with the NEA's

<HEADLINE> Boston Teens Guilty of Race Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Two white teen-agers whose families were evicted  
from a housing project after the men were arrested for race-related 
attacks pleaded guilty Thursday to terrorizing their Hispanic 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Day, 19, was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in jail after  
pleading guilty to assault and battery, civil rights violations, 
and destruction of property in two 1997 attacks. His plea came a 
few hours before he was scheduled to go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Beatty, 19, pleaded guilty to assault and battery and  
destruction of property, and was sentenced to one year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	According to prosecutors, Day, Beatty and several other  
teen-agers in 1997 chased a Hispanic man to his apartment with 
sticks and bats and threw rocks and bricks at him. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than two weeks later, the group chased a Hispanic woman to  
her apartment late at night and Day threw her to the ground, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the teen-agers continued throwing bottles and  
bricks at the building where the woman lived, and Day was charged 
with throwing a bottle through a bedroom window where another 
Hispanic woman was sleeping with her infant daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The other teen-agers previously pleaded guilty.  
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Housing Authority evicted Day's and Beatty's families  
from the South Boston housing project using a new federal policy 
that allows evictions of public housing tenants who are violent, 
sell drugs or commit civil rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy was created in 1996 to make government housing for  
the poor a safer place to live.

<HEADLINE> Rusty Wallace Eyes 50th Win in N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKINGHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Priorities change in racing as the  
season nears its end. 
</P>
<P>
	When the 1999 season began, Rusty Wallace was hoping -- and  
expecting -- to be a contender for the Winston Cup championship. 
But, heading into Sunday's Pop Secret Popcorn 400 at North Carolina 
Speedway, Wallace is a distant eighth in the points with four races 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, his top priority is to get his 50th career victory; Wallace  
has been stuck on 49 since winning on April 11 in Bristol, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some very competitive tracks coming up for us where  
our chances for getting that win should be very good,'' said 
Wallace, the 1989 series champ. ``We've had a bunch of wins at 
Rockingham and feel like we've been on the verge of winning again 
in the last few races there. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going back to Phoenix as the defending champs of that  
race. We're testing at Homestead for two days and are bringing out 
another new car there (for the inaugural Winston Cup race). And, 
nobody knows what to expect at Atlanta.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that coveted 50th victory, though, Wallace has another  
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always said that the championship is the ultimate goal  
and outside of that, the big priority is finishing in the top 10,'' 
Wallace said. ``People remember that we won the championship. I 
don't think there are too many folks out there who remember or 
really care that we finished second in the points in '88 and '93 
... only maybe the guy who's writing my biography and my PR 
department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finishing in the top 10 in the standings means being invited  
onto the stage in December during the awards banquet in New York. 
That might not seem like a big deal to most people, but it means a 
great deal to the drivers and their crews. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are 10 guys who get to take to the stage and thank their  
sponsors, their owners and their teams for all their help during 
the year,'' Wallace said. ``You've just got to be one of those 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know how it feels being left out. Me and (Dale) Earnhardt  
both missed out on the deal back in '92 and that wasn't any fun at 
all. Sitting back there in the cheap seats isn't where it's at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt and Wallace came back to finish 1-2 the next season.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know it was much more than that, but I also know that I sure  
didn't like being left out of the deal in '92,'' Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into the weekend, Wallace is a solid eighth in the  
standings. He's 362 points behind seventh-place Earnhardt, but has 
a lead of 170 points over ninth-place Ward Burton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd have to have the screwup of the century to fall out of  
the top 10,'' Wallace said. ``But, with four races left, you can't 
let you guard down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five of his 49 victories have come on the 1.017-mile Rockingham  
oval. But he last won here in the spring of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, the drivers to beat have been Jeff Gordon, who  
has won three of the last five Rockingham events, and Dale Jarrett, 
who has yet to win here, but has finished second in six of the last 
seven races. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Wallace led with only 10 laps to go before finishing  
behind Gordon and Jarrett. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our car was just lightning fast for 25 or 30 laps,'' Wallace  
said. ``We had a caution with about 40 to go. We led from the 
restart until there were 10 to go. Then our tires just faded and 
Gordon and Jarrett chased us down and got around in the last few 
laps. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember seeing them in my mirror running way up there on  
the high side and running me down. My car just wouldn't work up 
there, but theirs sure did. We could get only about 60 laps out of 
a set of tires then and that could be an issue this time around, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Practice and qualifying begin Friday.

<HEADLINE> FCC Eyes Smart Traffic System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Futuristic electronic transportation systems --  
like radios that warn drivers of danger at an intersection or 
railroad crossing -- will have space to grow, thanks to action 
Thursday by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission set aside room on the  
radio spectrum for such short-range communication systems that are 
designed to alleviate traffic congestion and improve road safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers already can see at least one practical application of  
this technology: automatic toll booths in which cars passing 
through have their fare deducted from an electronic tag. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation officials and industry groups say this is just  
the beginning for uses of short-range communications between 
vehicles and roadside equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Intelligent Transportation Society of America, a  
nonprofit group created at the request of Congress in 1991, asked 
the FCC to set aside part of the spectrum so companies and public 
officials could develop more applications. Consumers could begin 
benefiting in the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really is a bridge to the future,'' said John Collins,  
president of the society. The group includes companies such as 
Motorola Inc. and Microsoft Corp., state transportation officials 
and trade associations. ``There are applications we can't even 
dream about out there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Collins said the current electronic toll passes  
eventually could function as ``wireless credit cards.'' Parking lot 
charges, gas fill-ups or even fast food from drive-thrus could all 
be billed to the same card. 
</P>
<P>
	The Transportation Department was authorized by Congress to  
develop a program for intelligent transportation systems in 1991. 
Already some of this technology is being used, such as fiber optic 
communication systems that can monitor traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
	The airwaves space from the FCC will make it possible to develop  
more short-range systems in the next few years, said Bill Jones, 
technical director of the Transportation Department's Intelligent 
Transportation System joint program office. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said tests show that new applications could coexist with  
satellite communications systems and military radars that already 
use this spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
	One application could enable ambulances approaching a stoplight  
to change it to green or prolong the green rather than having to 
run through a red light. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones envisions this happening in the next two to four years.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question the technology is here to do it,'' Jones  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states have installed ice detectors in bridges to alert  
crews if the spans freeze. These same detectors could send out a 
short-range signal to oncoming vehicles. The car's radio receiver 
then could get the signal and alert the driver with an audio 
message. 
</P>
<P>
	Other services under development include a collision avoidance  
system that warns drivers of dangers when approaching an 
intersection or railroad crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole idea is that we can have problems on the highway  
that can be communicated to people inside their cars,'' Collins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Automobile manufacturers are developing cars with capabilities  
to receive these communications. Jones said the Intelligent 
Transportation System program is developing standards for this 
technology so one device installed in a car could be used for a 
number of purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC said it would consider the licensing rules to govern  
these services at a later time.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Sink; Dow Down 152.61 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plunged in early trading today following  
IBM's dour warning that worries about the Year 2000 computer bug 
are hurting hardware sales and may cut into profits. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was down 152.61 at 10,239.75. IBM accounted for 
75 points of the decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also sharply lower. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 18.76 at 1,270.67, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was down 45.27 at 2,742.86. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders attributed the broad market's fall almost entirely to  
pessimism following IBM's disappointing forecast. The company said 
after the close of trading Wednesday that potential buyers of IBM's 
network and database servers are postponing purchases until after 
the start of the new year, when concerns over the Year 2000 
computer bug are fully resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from the network and database business dropped 40  
percent in the third quarter, and the weakness is expected to 
continue through the fourth quarter and into January, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of IBM plummeted 15 to 92 on the New York Stock Exchange.  
</P>
<P>
	IBM's news robbed the market of the ebullience that drove the  
Dow 187.43 points higher, and the Nasdaq 99.95 points higher, on 
Wednesday. That rally was sparked nearly entirely by Microsoft, 
which released earnings that soundly beat expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft officials attributed the company's strong earnings and  
sales to ``awesome'' demand for personal computers, sparking a 
day-long rally in technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers today by an 8-to-3 margin  
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 126.63 million 
shares, well ahead of Wednesday's early pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.56 to 410.38.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.5 percent. In

<HEADLINE> Bradley Offers Youth Poverty Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Calling child poverty a hidden, ``slow-motion  
national disaster,'' Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley 
offered a $9.8 billion prescription today to lift family incomes 
through automatic, annual increases in the minimum wage and 
expanded tax credits and child care subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	He also proposed new government programs to recruit 60,000  
teachers into poor school districts and give children an 
after-hours school hangout seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do not look to raise the poorest children among us we  
have no heart. And if we do not nourish the spirit of our children, 
we have no soul,'' Bradley said in remarks prepared for delivery at 
a Brooklyn, N.Y., church. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 13.5 million American children live in poverty,  
defined by the government as a yearly income of $16,400 or less for 
a family of four. That population has shrunk from 15.3 million when 
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore took office in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``Child poverty is a kind of slow-motion national disaster,''  
Bradley said. ``We don't see it because it is usually hidden.'' He 
optimistically committed to halving the number of impoverished 
children by the end of his second term, if elected. 
</P>
<P>
	With the speech, Bradley and Gore, his rival for the Democratic  
presidential nomination, continued to circle each other. Gore 
jumped ahead of the former New Jersey senator Wednesday by 
announcing his own ideas on child poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	Both candidates also were giving environmental speeches this  
week, eager to air their positions on their own terms before their 
first debate next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore argued that the best way to reduce poverty is to enforce  
child support and get more fathers involved in parenting. Echoing 
his common criticism of Gore's proposals as small and ``timid,'' 
Bradley cast his anti-poverty plan as more comprehensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only in an indifferent moral universe can we feel satisfied  
with ourselves for lifting a small percentage of children out of 
poverty,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's office said Bradley was offering warmed-over Clinton  
administration proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Bradley is choosing to be an echo to Al Gore's voice  
in proposing policy that Al Gore has already been fighting -- the 
minimum wage increse, more teachers and tax credits for working 
poor,'' spokesman Chris Lehane said. The vice president has been an 
advocate for all three issues, though the administration's minimum 
wage proposal is not as sweeping as Bradley's. 
</P>
<P>
	As with the massive health insurance plan he proposed earlier,  
Bradley's poverty plan, priced at $9.8 billion annually, would be 
paid for out of the federal budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	To end the predictable political fight over the minimum wage, he  
proposed increasing it by $1 over two years -- a position he shares 
with Gore -- but then writing into law an automatic annual increase 
indexed to growth in the nation's median wage. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who voted against the Republicans' 1996 welfare  
overhaul that President Clinton signed into law, also proposed 
``fixing'' the provision requiring welfare mothers to let states 
collect and keep due child support. He would give welfare 
recipients whatever child support is collected from fathers who 
don't pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Over accusations by the Gore campaign that Bradley stood in the  
way when the Clinton administration tried in 1993 to expand the 
Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income working parents, Bradley 
suggested making more families eligible for the credit and 
increasing the amount of the credit due them. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, he proposed:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Making the popular Dependent Care tax credit (for up to $1,440  
in annual child care expenses for a family with two children) fully 
refundable so that poor parents owing little or no income tax get 
the full amount of the credit as a cash refund. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Expanding by $1 billion -- to $4.3 billion each year -- the  
child care subsidies available through a block grant program that 
currently reaches just 1 in 7 eligible children. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Allowing people eligible for food stamps to apply for them at  
more accessible locations, such as grocery stores, and during more 
convenient ``off'' hours. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Boosting funds for Head Start to enroll an additional 400,000  
children. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Creating a ``Teach to Reach'' program of student loan  
forgiveness for 60,000 college students, high school graduates and 
mid-career professionals who certify as teachers and commit to 
serving in poor urban or rural schools. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Starting national programs of after-school community centers  
to keep kids safe and productively occupied outside the normal 
school day, and ``second-chance homes'' where teen mothers can 
learn parenting skills and get job training and housing referrals, 
meant to reduce the teen pregnancy rate.

<HEADLINE> Half of U.S. Households Invest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly half of all American households invest in  
the stock market, but despite all the hype about day trading and 
online transactions, most are long-term investors who rarely call 
upon a broker. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are among the findings of a survey released today by the  
Investment Company Institute and the Securities Industry 
Association, two trade organizations representing the nation's 
investment companies, securities firms and investment banks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hear a lot about people trading actively -- day trading  
over the Internet -- and that's simply not the case,'' said 
Elizabeth Powell, a spokeswoman for ICI. ``Most people are saving 
for retirement, and presumably, we can expect that trend to 
continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Powell said the study was the first to take such a detailed look  
at the habits of small-time, individual investors. Through random 
phone interviews with 4,842 people, the survey found that the 
typical stock owner is 47 years old, married, has a household 
income of $60,000 -- and generally subscribes to the 
``buy-and-hold'' investment strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	The average investor also considers himself market-savvy,  
although he may have no formal background in finance or business. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 49.2 million U.S. households, or 48 percent, own  
equities either individually or through mutual funds, according to 
the study. And those numbers have steadily been on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, only 32.5 percent of U.S. households held stock, Powell  
said. By 1992 that number had increased to 36.3 percent. And it 
approached 41 percent by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Powell said more people have been drawn to the market because  
they can get bigger returns for their investment in stocks than 
they can elsewhere. Declining interest rates, on a relative basis, 
have only added to the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Others have turned to 401(k) retirement plans, which are  
increasingly being offered by employers and may be some workers 
sole retirement benefit as pensions become less common. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of all, investing is easier now that was 10 years ago, with  
countless magazines pumping out advice and investment companies 
offering toll-free, 24-hour service, Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the high tech access, most individual investors do it  
the old fashioned way -- just sit and wait. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the study, only 11 percent of all stock owners  
conducted transactions over the Internet, and most hadn't bought or 
sold a single stock during all of 1998, the year examined. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, which has a 2 percentage point margin of error,  
found that 48 percent of all stock owners are between the ages of 
36 and 54, 32 percent are older than 55 and 19 percent are between 
the ages of 19 and 35.

<HEADLINE> Profits Fall for Reynolds Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc.'s  
profits from ongoing operations tumbled 30 percent drop in the 
third quarter, hurt by higher cigarette prices and lower 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	But the results reported Thursday were better than Wall Street  
expected from the nation's second biggest tobacco company, which 
makes Winston and Camels. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds' share price fell, however, as the tobacco stocks  
continued a sharp decline that followed Wednesday's state appeals 
court ruling in Florida that raised the prospect of a huge punitive 
damage award against the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Reynolds  
share were down 13 percent, or $3 a share, at $19.93 3/4 after losing 
12 percent a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported ongoing net income of $110 million, or  
$1.01 per share, for the July-September period versus $158 million, 
or $1.45 per share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	That was two cents better than the 99 cents a share that  
analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue increased 31 percent in the quarter to $1.99 billion  
versus $1.53 billion in the third quarter of 1998, reflecting 
higher selling prices even as the number of cigarettes it shipped 
fell 11.6 percent versus a 9.3 percent industrywide decline. 
</P>
<P>
	``The third quarter saw a continuation of volume declines for  
RJR's tobacco business and for the industry as a whole as the 
market continued to react to increased cigarette prices, which came 
largely as the result of the settlement agreements with the states' 
attorneys general,'' said Andrew J. Schindler, chairman and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Under those agreements, the industry agreed to pay $246 billion  
to the states over 25 years in exchange for the withdrawal of suits 
that sought payments for the costs of treating sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	If onetime costs are included, R.J. Reynolds lost $125 million,  
or $1.15 a share, in the quarter, versus a profit of $170 million, 
or $1.56 a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, Reynolds' ongoing profit was $284  
million, or $2.61 a share, down from $422 million, or $3.88 a 
share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $5.59 billion from $4.16 billion a year earlier.  
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds, the holding company for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., was  
separated from RJR Nabisco Holdings Inc. on June 15.

<HEADLINE> Coke's Third-Quarter Earnings Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Coca-Cola Co. reported an 11 percent drop in  
third-quarter earnings, citing economic troubles overseas and 
fallout from recalls of its products in Europe last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the world's biggest soft drink maker said today its  
case volume, an important industry measure, rose during the quarter 
after dropping in the first half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola earned $787 million, or 32 cents per share, down from  
$888 million, or 36 cents per share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke said its per-share earnings were reduced by 2 to 3 cents  
because of the costs associated with the beverage recalls in 
Belgium and France, including marketing expenses aimed at 
rebuilding its image. 
</P>
<P>
	But the per-share earnings matched what analysts surveyed by  
First Call/Thomson Financial had predicted for the Atlanta-based 
soft drink maker. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola stock fell to a 52-week low of $47.31 1/4 earlier this  
month, down from a high of $75.43 3/4 last November. Coke shares were 
trading at $53.31 1/4, up 56 1/4 cents or about 1 percent, at midmorning 
on the New York Stock Exchange, moving higher despite an overall 
sharp decline on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``The past year has not been what the company's shareholders or  
its management, most especially me, want or expect,'' said Coke 
chairman and chief executive officer M. Douglas Ivester. ``Both our 
volume and profit results and our stock price have disappointed us 
all, even recognizing the difficult circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Coke reported that its case volume, an industry indicator  
measuring sales of units of 24 eight-ounce servings, rose 3.5 
percent during the quarter. One percentage point was due to the 
recent acquisition of Cadbury Schweppes, but even accounting for 
that gain, Coke's performance was a turnaround following case 
volume declines in the first and second quarters of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported third-quarter revenues of $5.2 billion, a 9  
percent increase from $4.75 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The company named the global economic crisis as one reason for  
its earnings decline and said its profit margin also narrowed 
because of the consolidation of bottling operations in India and 
company-owned vending operations in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ivester said early signs of economic recovery bode well for  
Coke's future sales and earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fundamentals for our business have not changed; in fact, I  
believe they are stronger today than they were a year ago,'' 
Ivester said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke reported income of $2.48 billion for the first nine months  
this year, a 16 percent drop from last year's $2.94 billion. 
Earnings per share were $1, a 15 percent drop from $1.18 for the 
first nine months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month revenues were $15 billion, up 5 percent from $14.36  
billion.

<HEADLINE> Dole Quits Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Not too long ago, Elizabeth Dole looked  
delightedly at the networks she'd built in Iowa, New Hampshire and 
other early primary states. ``We're going to have everything in 
place by Christmas. We're in really good shape,'' she thought. 
</P>
<P>
	That was then. After recalling this once-sunny outlook  
Wednesday, Dole folded her presidential campaign, saying it was 
futile to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	She started out in February, a political celebrity, hot on  
George W. Bush's heels and basking in public fascination with the 
possibility that a woman could become president. 
</P>
<P>
	But the story from there is a tale of missed opportunities.  
</P>
<P>
	Dole blamed the Texas governor's ``preexisting network of  
political supporters,'' built ``quietly but effectively'' from his 
office, starting in 1996, while she was at the American Red Cross 
meticulously guarding the organization's nonpartisan status. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's bandwagon -- he's raised a historic $57 million -- crippled  
her fund raising, said Dole, who nonetheless accepted that she 
stepped onto the campaign trail as an unprepared first-time 
candidate without even a staff in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what she'd do differently, Dole offered a singular  
prescription: ``Leave the Red Cross earlier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican strategist Mary Matalin, a Bush ally, scoffed,  
``What's the implication? That she didn't have a network? That's 
ridiculous, the wife of a former senator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Dole also had sought the GOP presidential nomination three  
times. 
</P>
<P>
	A nontraditional campaign was Dole's stated aim. In practice,  
however, that meant a campaign so polite and cautious and 
deliberative that it plodded itself underfoot of this year's 
juggernaut through a compressed primary season. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the summer, Dole essentially put fund raising on hold while  
she furiously concentrated her legwork in Iowa, where her strategy 
for pulling off an impressive finish in an August straw poll was to 
personally invite each of the 3,410 Iowans who turned out to vote 
for her. 
</P>
<P>
	After a couple of victorious television interviews Dole  
retreated with her husband for a week's vacation in New Hampshire. 
Aides said at the time they didn't have the heart to deny the tired 
candidate time off. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the Iowa straw poll took place, it was expected maybe  
that this would translate into money,'' Dole said. ``What it 
translated into was a lot of strong organizations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But they were no good without the fund raising. ``You can't  
starve an army, organizations need support,'' said Dole's pollster, 
Linda DiVall. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole tried to make up for lost time by scurrying to dozens of  
events around the country in September, but they were mostly 
drawing women. And the vast majority of women political 
contributors -- about 75 percent -- give under $200 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Squeamish about looking unseemly or opportunistic, Dole put off  
a scheduled get-tough-on-drugs speech at the end of August when 
Bush, the GOP front-runner, was at the height of his tangle with 
unfounded allegations that he once used cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	When she finally delivered a toned-down version two months  
later, she picked a spot on the Mexican border so remote that few 
reporters covered the address. 
</P>
<P>
	Her back-to-school speech on education reform was twice  
postponed -- once because she didn't feel prepared, then again 
because of a hurricane -- only to pale in comparison to the detail 
and scope of Bush's education agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	She was slow to make decisions, one supporter said, a personal  
trait exacerbated by the fact that her shoestring operation of just 
30 or so aides lacked the manpower to soundly research every 
``pro'' and ``con'' for the candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said all along that a negative campaign was not in Dole's  
nature. Besides, she saw how her husband, the 1996 GOP nominee, was 
weakened by rival Steve Forbes' attack ads -- and how Forbes 
suffered a backlash. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican consultant Alex Castellanos faulted her for not  
drawing sharp distinctions and giving voters cause to select her 
over Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only difference was she was a female candidate and that is  
not enough,'' Castellanos said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Daffron, Dole's campaign manager, worried mostly  
Wednesday night about finding new jobs for Dole's earnest young 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always can look back and say there are things you could  
have done differently,'' Daffron said. ``But given the strength 
Bush showed both financially and politically, I don't think it 
would have materially changed the outcome.''

<HEADLINE> Coke's 3Q Earnings Drop 11 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Coca-Cola Co. reported an 11 percent drop in  
third-quarter net income Thursday and blamed continuing worldwide 
economic problems as well as costs associated with the recall of 
its products last spring in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fifth straight decline in Coke's quarterly earnings.  
But the world's biggest soft drink maker said its case volume, an 
important industry measure, rose in the July-September quarter 
after dropping in the first half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Coca-Cola may have hit bottom and be positioned  
for a modest rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just can't get any worse,'' said Roy Burry, an analyst with  
Brown Brothers Harriman and Co. ``I say that not in jest. They've 
been through very, very tough economic environments in some key 
markets and, yes, it's going to get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst David Goldman of Bank of America Securities said Coke  
dipped into profits to correct problems in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is a light at the end of the tunnel,'' Goldman  
said. ``It's just the wattage that's in question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based Coke said third-quarter earnings were $787  
million, or 32 cents per share, down from $888 million, or 36 cents 
per share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The per-share earnings were reduced by 2 cents to 3 cents by  
costs associated with last spring's product recalls in Belgium and 
France, including marketing expenses aimed at rebuilding its image, 
the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the per-share figure was in line with what analysts surveyed  
by First Call/Thomson Financial Corp. had predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The past year has not been what the company's shareholders or  
its management, most especially me, want or expect,'' said Coke 
chairman and chief executive officer M. Douglas Ivester. ``The 
positive, although still modest, global volume trends and 
increasing consumer confidence in many key markets around the world 
are further evidence of economies beginning to recover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola stock fell to a 52-week low of $47.31 1/4 earlier this  
month, down from a high of $75.43 3/4 last November. It was trading at 
$54.31 1/4 Thursday, up $1.56 1/4 or 3 percent, on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported third-quarter revenues of $5.1 billion, a 9  
percent increase from $4.75 billion in the same quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said its profit margin declined in part because of  
the consolidation of bottling operations in India and company-owned 
vending operations in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	But Coke said its case volume, an industry indicator measuring  
sales of units of 24 eight-ounce servings, rose 3.5 percent during 
the quarter. One percentage point was due to the recent acquisition 
of Cadbury Schweppes, but even accounting for that gain Coke's 
performance was a turnaround following case volume declines in the 
first and second quarters of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman and other analysts said the figures are a sign of a  
possible Coke recovery, but the company probably won't repeat the 
15-20 percent growth rates it saw earlier in the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something in the low teens would probably be more like it,''  
Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke reported nine-month net income of $2.48 billion, a 16  
percent drop from last year's $2.94 billion. Nine-month earnings 
per share were $1, compared with $1.18 a year ago. Revenues were 
$15 billion, up 5 percent from $14.3 billion last year.

<HEADLINE> Prada Wins America's Cup Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Italy's Prada scored a dramatic  
victory over San Francisco's AmericaOne Friday when two of the 
biggest guns went head to head for the first time in the challenger 
series for the America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Spinnaker problems for both teams were the deciding factor in  
the most anticipated and exciting race of the regatta so far. 
</P>
<P>
	After racing was postponed Thursday because of gale-force wind,  
conditions were nearly perfect Friday for fast match racing among 
the syndicates fighting for the chance to take on New Zealand for 
sailing's most prized trophy next year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a breeze blowing a steady 15 knots, skipper Francesco de  
Angelis' beat the Americans at the start and built a lead of 24 
seconds by the first turn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italians hit trouble after rounding the mark, twice losing  
their spinnaker -- and their lead -- in the first downwind leg of the 
12.5 nautical mile course on Hauraki Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italians made up two boat lengths on the next leg and were  
within striking distance of Paul Cayard's AmericaOne as they headed 
downwind towards the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Cayard looked to have held off Prada when, with just a few  
hundred yards to go, the giant green spinnaker collapsed into the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	Prada powered past and won the race by 17 seconds. AmericaOne  
raised another spinnaker but crossed the line with shreds of the 
torn old sail flapping from the top of the mast. 
</P>
<P>
	It was AmericaOne's first loss of the regatta, and ended what  
had been a three-way leadership deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
	Prada went ahead on points but has yet to have their bye. New  
York challenger Young America is also undefeated, but must beat 
Prada in their next race, expected Saturday, to draw even. 
</P>
<P>
	In other races, the Spanish Challenge defeated Young Australia  
by 37 seconds; America True defeated Stars and Stripes by 41 
seconds; Nippon defeated Le Defi Francais by 1 minute, 53 seconds; 
and Young America defeated Abradabra by 1 minute, 24 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of races on Friday was half that of previous days  
because of a local racing regatta on waters near the two challenger 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
	In more than 700 races over four months, the 11 challenger teams  
from seven countries score one point for each victory in the first 
of three round-robins, four points in the second and nine in the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of a finals series will meet Team New Zealand in a  
best-of-9 regatta starting in February 2000 for the America's Cup.

<HEADLINE> EgyptAir Hijacker Did It for Graf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- The suspect in the hijacking of an  
EgyptAir jet told a judge he had been armed only with a pen and did 
it for Germany and German tennis ace Steffi Graf, prosecutors said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he commandeered the jet after it left Turkey for  
Egypt, the suspect said he acted out of ``love for Germany and 
Steffi Graf,'' prosecutor Ruediger Bagger quoted him as saying at a 
Wednesday court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	The hijacker has not been identified by authorities, who  
described him as mentally disturbed. He was ordered to remain in 
jail on hijacking and other charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were looking for a knife the man reportedly used to  
hijack the Cairo-bound EgyptAir flight Tuesday. But prosecutor 
Bagger said the man told the court he was holding a pen. 
</P>
<P>
	The hijacking ended peacefully in Hamburg after police promised  
to consider the hijacker's request for asylum. None of the 46 
passengers on board the plane was harmed.

<HEADLINE> Knight Cited in Hunting Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOONER, Wis. (AP) -- Indiana basketball coach Bob Knight failed  
to report a hunting accident and hunted without a license during an 
expedition on which he accidentally shot a friend while hunting 
grouse, the state Department of Natural Resources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, Thomas Mikunda and two other men were hunting Oct. 12  
when they spotted a grouse, said Dave Zeug, law enforcement 
director for the DNR's northern region. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, 59, told investigators that as he turned to aim at the  
bird, his finger slipped off the shotgun's safety and hit the 
trigger, accidentally firing the gun before he was ready to shoot. 
Shotgun pellets struck Mikunda in the back and upper shoulder, 
causing wounds that were not life-threatening but required medical 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Under state law, Knight was required to report the accident to  
law enforcement authorities, Zeug said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of that investigation, it was determined Knight did  
not have a $43 nonresident small game license and that he also had 
hunted without one last year in Wisconsin, as did two of his 
hunting companions 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, coach at Indiana since 1971, will be cited for failure  
to report a hunting accident and will receive two citations for 
hunting without a license in 1999 and 1998. The fine for each 
citation is $165. 
</P>
<P>
	His two companions will receive similar citations.  
</P>
<P>
	Knight told investigators he didn't think he needed the license  
to hunt on private property. 
</P>
<P>
	Kit Klingelhoffer, sports information director at Indiana  
University, declined immediate comment Thursday on the DNR's 
accusations against Knight. Knight did not immediately return a 
message to The Associated Press left at his office. 
</P>
<P>
	DNR warden Gerald Carow, who is investigating the shooting, said  
he talked to Knight on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's feeling bad that it happened and feels deeply concerned  
over the victim and is willing to pay any penalty,'' Carow said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mikunda, an insurance agent, was not carrying a gun at the time  
of the shooting, which knocked him to the ground and left him 
temporarily dazed, said his mother, Betty Mikunda. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were hoping this wouldn't hit the news; not so much for  
Tom but for Mr. Knight,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mikunda was treated and released at Marshfield Clinic-Ladysmith  
Center in Ladysmith after the morning shooting.

<HEADLINE> Mattel Earnings Plummet 42 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mattel Inc. earnings plummeted 42 percent in  
the third quarter, undermined by a $105 million loss at its 
troubled software subsidiary and weak toy sales in international 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel said Thursday it earned $135.3 million, or 32 cents per  
share, on sales of $1.83 billion. During last year's third quarter 
Mattel earned $233.8 million, or 54 cents per share on sales of 
$1.88 billion. Including after-tax charges of $65 million, Mattel 
had net income of $168.7 million for the 1998 quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were slightly ahead of the average estimate of 31  
cents per share forecast by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson 
Financial. Mattel's shares fell 18 3/4 cents to $13.12 1/2 on the New 
York Stock Exchange Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss at The Learning Company was slightly higher than the  
$50 million to $100 million range Mattel forecast earlier this 
month, when it warned investors that third-quarter earnings would 
fall substantially. 
</P>
<P>
	The Learning Company, acquired earlier this year in a $3.8  
billion stock deal, had been expected to yield a $50 million profit 
through the sale of software titles such as Carmen Sandiego, 
American Greetings and Myst. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we are most disappointed in developments at The Learning  
Company, and by continuing difficulties in international markets, 
we are encouraged by U.S. sales increases in the quarter for our 
core Barbie, Fisher Price, Wheels and American Girl brands,'' Jill 
Barad, Mattel's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a 
news release. 
</P>
<P>
	In a conference call with analysts, Barad said there were no  
plans to sell The Learning Company or change its management. She 
said she expected The Learning Company to return to profitability 
sometime in 2000, but would not be more specific. Barad also told 
analysts the software maker planned to release some promising new 
titles, including one based on the popular Pokemon cartoon 
creatures. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we now need to prove is the potential of international  
sales and The Learning Company, ``Barad said. ``... We've faced 
challenges before and we are up to the challenges athat are ahead 
of us. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel's problems, however, won't be quickly resolved, analysts  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our feel is the problems are probably a little more entrenched  
and the industry issues will not disappear quickly,'' said Jill 
Krutick, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond The Learning Company problems, analysts' concerns include  
soft international sales and Mattel's core product line. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've obviously had some erosion in their core business as  
well,'' Krutick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel blamed The Learning Company loss on $58 million in  
distributor and retailer product returns and allowances and a $56 
million increase in bad debt reserves. Another reason, the company 
reported, was Mattel's decision to cancel a proposed licensing 
agreement that had been expected to produce $60 million in 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel's earnings warning, issued on Oct. 4, initially pushed  
the company's stock down nearly 30 percent. It also prompted 
speculation that Barad might lose her job and that Mattel could 
become a takeover target. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel stock has lost more than 70 percent of its value since  
hitting a 10-year peak of $46.75 in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Mattel lost $63.9  
million, or 71 cents per share, as a result of $269.7 million in 
one-time after-tax charges resulting from restructuring and other 
expenses. That compares to earnings of $111.3, or 27 cents per 
share, for the first nine months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month revenue came to $3.74 billion, down from $3.8  
billion.

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Profits Rise 12 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- McDonald's Corp. reported Thursday its  
third-quarter earnings rose 12 percent on strong sales at its U.S. 
restaurants and continued growth abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Several factors contributed to an impressive quarter by the  
world's largest fast-food company: successful promotions such as 
Furby, Teenie Beanie Babies and Inspector Gadget; the addition of 
breakfast bagel sandwiches to its U.S. menu and more international 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's said it earned $540.9 million, or 39 cents a share,  
up from $482.2 million, or 34 cents a share, in the year-earlier 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	That topped by one penny the consensus of analysts surveyed by  
First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's stock was fell $1.81 1/4 to $42.93 3/4 a share in trading  
Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. sales grew 6 percent for the quarter as the Oak Brook,  
Ill.,-based chain benefited from the near-completion of its Made 
for You cooking system. Nearly 12,000 restaurants in North America 
have had computerized kitchen equipment installed to allow 
customers to have sandwiches and other meals made to order. 
</P>
<P>
	Internationally, where McDonald's faces much less competition,  
sales soared 19 percent in Latin America, 10 percent in Europe and 
6 percent in Asia and the Pacific, including significant expansion 
in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Greenberg, chairman and chief executive officer, said  
McDonald's remains on track to add about 1,750 restaurants this 
year, about 90 percent outside the United States. McDonald's has 
more than 25,000 company-owned and franchised restaurants, about 
half in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was upbeat about prospects for the year ahead, when  
it plans to introduce new food items and make another strong push 
with its U.S. operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have got our U.S. business poised to really continue to  
grow,'' Mike Conley, chief financial officer, said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``And our business outside the U.S. continues to post really  
outstanding results'' despite the difficult economic environment in 
several areas, he said. ``We expect that a little more economic 
stability around the globe in 2000 will enable profits and sales to 
grow even more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Operating income for the three months ended Sept. 30 was $907  
million, up 9 percent from $835.2 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $3.44 billion, up 7 percent from $3.21 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Herbert Blutenthal, managing director of Hartline Investment  
Corp. in Chicago, said the report was slightly better than expected 
and he praised McDonald's for aggressive steps to pad its lead over 
tough domestic competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're questioning all kinds of things they're doing and  
experimenting with menus to try to improve U.S. sales,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month net income was $1.46 billion, or $1.04 a share, up 22  
percent from $1.2 billion, or 85 cents a share, in the same period 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the first nine months of 1999 were $9.89 billion,  
up 7 percent from $9.2 billion from the same period a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Olympics To Sell Premium Tickets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Sydney Olympic organizers hope to raise  
about $65 million from selling 325,000 tickets to next year's Games 
at prices inflated by up to 300 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of continuing public outrage that many of the best  
seats at the most sought-after events were not included in the 
public offer, the board of the Sydney Organizing Committee for the 
Olympic Games (SOCOG) voted Thursday to reveal exactly how many of 
the total of 9.6 million tickets were set aside for sale to wealthy 
groups and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG will publish detailed figures Monday showing which and how  
many tickets were made available to the public for a range of key 
sessions, including opening and closing ceremonies, swimming and 
track and field finals. 
</P>
<P>
	But the board decided not to release the names of the groups who  
had applied for the premium tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shouldn't be too cute about this,'' SOCOG president Michael  
Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, there were a number of seats that were quarantined to the  
public in the public offering and to the best of my knowledge 
nothing was taken out of that number of seats that was quarantined 
and put into premium packages. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, if the premium packages didn't exist there would have  
been a bigger pool for the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG already has raised more than $22 million from the sale of  
54,803 premium tickets and smaller amounts from 21,986 tickets 
included in sports passes and 49,050 tied to stadium packages. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the public outcry, SOCOG intends to push ahead with the  
sale of an additional 200,000 tickets above face value which are 
expected to raise another $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG's commercial and marketing general manager Paul Reading  
said about 25 percent of the premium ticket packages would be sold 
overseas.

	MANASSAS, Va. (AP) -- A teen-ager was convicted of voluntary  
manslaughter instead of murder Thursday in the beating death of a 
woman who had complained that the teen and her friends were

	Teresa Hattie Dixon, 18, wept as the verdict was read. The jury

<HEADLINE> Cherry Growers Want To Recruit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENNEWICK, Wash. (AP) -- This is one world that would be, like,  
so real. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northwest Cherry Growers are working to recruit a group of  
teen-agers from Taiwan willing to come to Washington state and work 
in a cherry orchard next year as part of a weekly show on Taiwanese 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a world where we are saturated with clutter ... you have  
got to do something that makes people remember you,'' said Eric 
Melton, vice president for international marketing at the cherry 
growers association. 
</P>
<P>
	Melton hopes the TV program will sell Northwest cherries in Asia  
and maybe boost international sales to as much as half the annual 
crop. International sales accounted for a third of the crop in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The cherry growers' plan is to try to capitalize on the success  
of a video called ``Fresh,'' a flashy, youth-oriented three-minute 
commercial, that for three months was a Top 10 musical hit on MTV 
Asia. The video used cherries as an analogy for love. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwanese pop star Gigi Leung filmed the music video on Don  
Olmstead's 115-acre cherry orchard in Grandview, Wash., and it was 
released at the height of cherry season. 
</P>
<P>
	The pioneering marketing move cost cherry growers $100,000, but  
generated millions of dollars in publicity and more than 20 hours 
of coverage on Asian television news and travel shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the growers think they can build on that.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you have great success, the next question is what are you  
going to do next year to top it,'' Melton said 
</P>
<P>
	Melton said the idea now is for a television show that  
chronicles the daily trials and tribulations of a group of young 
people brought together in a strange situation, like a Washington 
state cherry orchard. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a little like MTV's voyeuristic ``The Real World,'' a  
highly popular U.S. television program aimed at teen-agers where a 
group of young people live, argue and party together with the 
cameras rolling 24 hours a day. But this time there will be no 
plush loft or hip club scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington's farm-worker housing shortage is at its worst during  
the short cherry season. An estimated 16,000 migrant workers come 
through the region to pick the crop, but struggle to find shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	With the camera's rolling, the teen-age cherry pickers most  
likely will find suitable housing. 
</P>
<P>
	Migrant workers often find themselves crammed into tiny, squalid  
mobile homes or camped illegally along river banks and ditches 
without potable water or sanitation. The situation became even more 
critical this year, when a dispute between the state and federal 
governments eliminated the option of letting some workers set up 
tents in licensed camps on growers' property. 
</P>
<P>
	Cherry season was late this year, but it was a profitable one  
for those whose farms weren't hurt by the cool spring. Sales from 
the 1999 crop dropped only slightly from record 1998 levels, a 
major achievement since production volume was down about 30 
percent, Melton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 Northwest harvest of 61,000 tons brought $186 million  
in total sales, down from 87,000 tons and $190 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian countries have traditionally been the largest export  
buyers of Northwest cherries. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the region's economic troubles, cherries continued to  
sell as fast as grocers put them out in Asia this year. One week, 
stores in Taiwan ran out of cherries as consumers snapped up 
20-pound boxes selling for more than $110.

<HEADLINE> Russians Nearing Chechnya's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- More Russian troops have crossed the Terek  
River to take up positions near Chechnya's capital, Grozny, and 
forward units were less than eight miles from the city, Russian 
officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Russian artillery pounded the outskirts of the  
capital, making the earth tremble in parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian warplanes flew 20 combat mission Wednesday and early  
today, opening fire on a bridge, a fuel storage facility and 
vehicles transporting militants, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has waged a cautious, creeping offensive against Chechen  
militants in a bid to avoid the heavy casualties it suffered in a 
1994-96 war with the rebels. The Russian forces have relied mostly 
on airstrikes and heavy artillery, with few major ground clashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia says its aims are to maintain a security zone around  
Chechnya and to wipe out the militants. The Russian military has 
said it does not intend to storm Grozny in a bid to retake full 
control of Chechnya -- but that option has not been ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Grozny is not an end in itself,'' said Gennady Alyokhin, a  
Defense Ministry spokesman. ``The operation will be carried out 
according to plan. Our only goal is to eliminate the rebels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest advances come three weeks after Russia sent troops  
into Chechnya following weeks of airstrikes to eliminate Islamic 
militants who invaded neighboring Dagestan this summer. The 
militants have also been blamed for a series of September apartment 
explosions in Russia that killed 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian forces have been approaching the city from the north,  
west and east, and moved several miles closer in the eastern sector 
on Wednesday, Alyokhin said. Additional troops also crossed the 
Terek River, north of the capital, to join forces already 
positioned on a ridge overlooking the city. 
</P>
<P>
	While Russia's representative to Chechnya, Nikolai Koshman, says  
Russian troops are less than eight miles outside the capital, 
Chechens say some Russian soldiers have been spotted even closer. 
Chechen fighters north of the capital can easily see Russian troops 
through their binoculars, conducting drills and morning exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has lost 350 soldiers since fighting in the Caucasus  
region began more than two months ago, according to Russian 
officials. The military claims that up to 3,000 Chechen militants 
have been killed, but the figure cannot be independently confirmed, 
and both sides routinely inflate casualty figures suffered by the 
enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechnya, which has fewer than 1 million residents, has been  
effectively independent since Russian troops withdrew three years 
ago, but the territory has been wracked by lawlessness and a 
crippled economy.

<HEADLINE> 30-Year Sentence for Girl's Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- A Maryland man has drawn a 30-year prison  
term for the slaying 13 years ago of a young girl whose body has 
never been found. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-year-old Michele Dorr was last seen outside her father's  
Silver Spring, Md. home on May 31, 1986. Police believe she walked 
to a nearby home to play with a 5-year-old friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contended during the trial that Hadden Clark  
encountered the girl playing at his brother's house and slashed her 
to death. Clark, 47, was convicted Monday of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors said Clark buried the girl's body in a Cape Cod,  
Mass., cemetery, then dug it up on Halloween in 1992. But they have 
been unable to find it, despite years of questioning people and 
searching sites up the East Coast to Rhode Island and 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark pleaded guilty in 1993 to the murder of a 23-year-old  
Bethesda, Md., woman and is serving a 30-year sentence for that.

	Maryland District Court Judge Michael D. Mason cited ``the  
denial of the ability of the parents to bury the child'' as a 
factor in imposing a sentence that will not begin until Clark 
completes the previous 30-year term and a separate 10-year sentence 
for a theft charge tried earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> British May Prosecute Ex-Informant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The government said today it is considering  
whether to prosecute an 87-year-old woman who admits passing 
British atomic secrets to the Soviets in the 1940s, as well as four 
other alleged Cold War spies unmasked in a new book. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement by Home Secretary Jack Straw followed protests  
that Melita Norwood, a lifelong member of Britain's tiny Communist 
Party who cheerfully acknowledges spying, is free although 
intelligence services knew about her activities for years. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement to the House of Commons, Straw said that because  
of Mrs. Norwood's comments after being publicly identified last 
month ``the papers in this case are currently being studied again 
by the prosecuting authorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At her suburban home, Mrs. Norwood said she was ``not altogether  
surprised'' -- and not worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've brought it all on myself, the whole thing,'' she said.  
``I'll just have to lump it and see what happens. I'm not worried 
at the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Norwood and several British academics were identified last  
month in the book, ``The Mitrokhin Archive, and a TV series, ``The 
Spying Game,'' based on thousands of documents smuggled out by KGB 
archivist Vasili Mitrokhin who fled to Britain in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers opposed to Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party  
government had demanded to know why prosecutions weren't launched 
when Britain's MI5 and MI6 intelligence agencies examined the 
Mitrokhin files. 
</P>
<P>
	Straw had said earlier that prosecutors decided it was too late  
or that prosecutions might have compromised security. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Norwood was a secretary at the British Non-Ferrous Metal  
Research Association, linked to building Britain's atomic bomb. She 
began spying in 1937 and continued until her retirement in 1972, 
according to the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Straw said today that Mrs. Norwood was first vetted for access  
to government secrets in 1945 because of ``concerns'' about her, 
and her clearance was revoked in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	``She had not in practice had authorized access to government  
secrets after 1949,'' said Straw. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s the security services concluded that Mrs. Norwood  
spied during the 40s but they felt they had no ``usable evidence'' 
to prosecute, Straw added. 
</P>
<P>
	Straw did not immediately reveal the names of the others who  
might be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those also named in the book by Cambridge historian  
Christopher Andrew were two academics and a former Scotland Yard 
police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	One academic, Robin Pearson, who still teaches at Hull  
University in northern England, passed names of likely recruits to 
the Stasi, the East German secret police, according to the TV 
series.

<HEADLINE> N.H. Poll Shows McCain in 2nd Place </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- John McCain got new evidence of his firm  
hold on second place among Republican presidential candidates in 
New Hampshire in a poll released just a day after rival Elizabeth 
Dole dropped out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, an Arizona senator, had 26 percent, 10 points better  
than in August, but still behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who was 
at 42 percent in the latest poll. Bush's support was about the same 
as in August, with McCain's gains coming at the expense of other 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole had 7 percent in the August poll, compared to 3 percent in  
the latest poll, a shift within the poll's 4 percentage point error 
margin. The New Hampshire poll released today was taken Oct. 14-19 
before Dole dropped out of the race Wednesday, citing money woes. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Buchanan was at 8 percent in August, and was down to 2  
percent in today's poll. He is expected to announce next week that 
he abandoning his GOP presidential bid to seek the Reform Party 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Other recent New Hampshire polls had shown McCain making  
progress. McCain aides have kept a close eye on Dole's campaign, 
saying they were competing for the same moderate Republicans who 
didn't back Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Democrats, Bill Bradley was statistically tied with Vice  
President Al Gore in the poll as he has been in other recent polls 
in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-five percent of likely Democratic voters supported  
Bradley, a former New Jersey senator, compared to 41 percent for 
Gore, a statistical tie. In August, the same poll showed Gore 
leading Bradley 46 percent to 29 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Republican race, magazine publisher Steve Forbes, who has  
run numerous television and radio ads in the state with the 
nation's first presidential primaries, moved from 3 percent in 
August to 7 percent this month, a shift within the poll's error 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
	Former U.N. Ambassador Alan Keyes and conservative activist Gary  
Bauer stayed in the low single digits, while Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch 
remained steady -- at 0 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 600 likely Republican primary voters and  
600 likely Democratic primary voters was conducted by the American 
Research Group Inc. of Manchester.

<HEADLINE> South Pole Doctor Care an Odyssey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- An Indiana doctor who helped a South Pole  
physician treat herself for breast cancer until she could be safely 
brought out says the long-distance medical aid was ``difficult, 
sometimes frustrating and emotional work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jerri Nielsen was rescued last weekend from the  
Amundsen-Scott South Pole Research Center after treating herself 
for breast cancer for nearly five months under the supervision of 
Indiana University Hospital cancer specialist Dr. Kathy Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	By e-mail and videoconference, the two and other doctors  
considered whether Nielsen could perform surgery on herself, 
debated the risks of a subzero air drop of medical supplies and 
exchanged information on how to administer Nielsen's drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen, 47 -- who is from the Youngstown, Ohio, area -- was  
brought to the hospital for a medical evaluation and released 
Wednesday. Her destination was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	She didn't want details on her condition revealed, and the only  
public statement she made this week was to confirm the breast lump 
had been diagnosed as cancer and add, ``My spirit is strong.'' But 
she did give Miller permission to discuss her past treatment with 
The Indianapolis Star. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller told the newspaper it was hard to supervise Nielsen's  
self-treatment from 11,600 miles away with only the help of 
undependable videoconferencing technology and e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was almost to the point that if I didn't have an e-mail from  
Jerri every day, I started to get worried,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen, the only doctor at the station, discovered a lump in  
her breast in late spring -- when winter is approaching in the 
Antarctic and bad weather had closed down traffic into and out of 
the South Pole. Her case was referred to Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``She had all the same questions and worries as all my other  
breast cancer patients do,'' Miller said. ``How bad is this? Is it 
going to take my life? What will the treatment involve? Will it 
work? How will we know it works?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women considered whether Nielsen could perform surgery on  
herself to remove the lump. A Soviet doctor removed his own 
appendix at the site in 1961. Miller said doctors decided Nielsen 
couldn't operate extensively enough to do any good. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step was to arrange an air drop of medical equipment  
and supplies, a move Nielsen initially opposed for fear the danger 
to flight crews would outweigh the benefits for her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want people risking their lives to air drop things to  
me if it doesn't matter and won't save my life,'' Nielsen wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller insisted, writing in response: ``There is a real chance  
for long-term survival'' with proper treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplies allowed Nielsen to perform her own biopsy, getting  
tissue samples by inserting a needle into her breast. She e-mailed 
photographs of slide samples of the tumor to doctors in the United 
States, including Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Intravenous chemotherapy began July 23 with a videoconference  
between the South Pole and doctors in the United States. But 
problems dogged the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Nielsen, trained as an emergency physician, applied her  
own tourniquet and helped another South Pole medical worker find 
her vein, her helpers had trouble preparing and administering the 
potent drugs, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	On another occasion, medical staff were still preparing the  
drugs when the audio link to Indianapolis suddenly died. Miller and 
nurse LaTrice Haney had to write down instructions and hold them up 
to the camera. 
</P>
<P>
	``It made me realize it's hard to describe every step that you  
do,'' said Haney. ``You feel supportive, and at the same time, you 
feel helpless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen was ultimately rescued when the Antarctic winter  
relented slightly, making it warm enough -- 58 degrees below zero -- 
to risk a flight.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bring Pete Rose Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- By a 2-1 margin, most people think Pete Rose  
should be reinstated to baseball, even though many believe he did 
gamble on his sport, according to an Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-six percent of those surveyed said Rose should be  
reinstated, while 29 percent said he should not, according to the 
poll, conducted for the AP by ICR of Media, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven out of 10 said baseball's career hits leader belongs in  
baseball's Hall of Fame, while almost two out of 10 said he 
doesn't. Rose is not eligible for the Hall of Fame as long as his 
lifetime ban remains in effect. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 78 percent to 15 percent margin, people said commissioner  
Bud Selig made the correct decision to invite Rose to the World 
Series ceremony Sunday honoring the sport's All-Century team. Rose 
was among the 25 players elected in fan balloting in the second 
half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who think Rose should be allowed to appear at the  
series was Levona Walker, a communications specialist in her 40s 
from Bainbridge, Ga. The decision to let Rose appear with the 
All-Century team at the World Series is a good one, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a great player,'' said Walker, who considers herself a  
big baseball fan. ``Everybody has faults, so why blame him for his 
faults?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, more people don't believe Rose's gambling denial than  
believe him. Forty percent don't believe Rose is telling the truth 
about betting on baseball, while 30 percent believe him. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Murray, a 55-year-old retiree from Tonawanda, N.Y., says he  
thinks the example Rose set on the field far outweighs the charge 
of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the greatest baseball players,'' said Murray. ``He  
was a great example through his hustle -- he showed a lot of hard 
work and hustle. He was a good example of youth of that day and 
this day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray said he doesn't know whether Rose bet on baseball or not,  
``But I like him, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey of 1,012 adults was taken Oct. 1-5 and has  
a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, then manager of the Cincinnati Reds, agreed to a lifetime  
ban from baseball in August 1989 following an investigation of his 
gambling. He applied for reinstatement in September 1997, and Selig 
has not ruled on the request, saying he sees no reason to chance 
the ban originally imposed by commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who describe themselves as following baseball  
closely, Rose got even higher backing, with 67 percent saying he 
should be reinstated and 29 percent saying he shouldn't. 
Seventy-two percent say he belongs in the Hall of Fame and 79 
percent said he should be invited to the All-Century team ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	But 49 percent think he's lying when he says he didn't bet on  
baseball, with 36 percent believing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Among casual fans, those who say they follow baseball but not  
closely, 64 percent say he should be reinstated, 79 percent say he 
belongs in the Hall of Fame and 84 percent agree he should be 
invited to the All-Century team festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	This group was about evenly split, with 40 percent saying they  
think he's lying about gambling on baseball and 36 percent 
believing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Carbonneau, a 66-year-old retiree from Champaign, Ill.,  
is a lifetime baseball fan who thinks some officials in the sport 
may not have a good historical perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless they could prove he was throwing Reds games, they  
should let him back in,'' Carbonneau said. ``The Babe wasn't 
exactly a saint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press poll on former major leaguer Pete Rose is  
based on telephone interviews with 1,017 randomly selected adults 
from all states except Alaska and Hawaii. The interviews were 
conducted Oct. 1-5 by ICR of Media, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were weighted to represent the population by  
demographic factors such as age, sex, region and education. 
</P>
<P>
	No more than one time in 20 should chance variations in the  
sample cause the results to vary by more than 3 percentage points 
from the answers that would be obtained if all Americans were 
polled. 
</P>
<P>
	This margin of sampling error is larger for responses of  
subgroups, such as income categories. There are other sources of 
potential error in polls, including the wording and order of 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll's questions:  
</P>
<P>
	1. Which statement best describes your level of interest in  
baseball? 
</P>
<P>
	--I follow major league baseball closely, 14 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--I follow major league baseball, but not closely, 28 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--I don't pay much attention to major league baseball, 58  
percent. 

</P>
<P>
	2. As you may know, Pete Rose had the most hits of any major  
league baseball player ever, but was banned from baseball for life 
in 1989 after he was accused of gambling on the sport. Do you think 
he should be reinstated or not? 
</P>
<P>
	--yes, 56 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--no, 29 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--don't know, 14 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--refused, 1 percent  

</P>
<P>
	3. Do you think Pete Rose belongs in the baseball Hall of Fame  
or not? 
</P>
<P>
	--yes, 69 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--no, 18 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--don't know, 12 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--refused, 1 percent  

</P>
<P>
	4. The players elected by fans to the All-Century baseball team  
will be invited to the 1999 World Series. If Pete Rose is elected 
to the team, should he be invited to the 1999 World Series or not? 
</P>
<P>
	--yes, 78 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--no, 15 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--don't know, 7 percent  

</P>
<P>
	5. Pete Rose has admitted to sports gambling, but denies  
gambling on baseball. Do you believe Pete Rose when he says he 
didn't gamble on baseball or do you not believe him? 
</P>
<P>
	--believe him, 30 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--don't believe him, 44 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--don't know, 24 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--refused, 2 percent

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Rise by 9,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing new  
applications for unemployment benefits rose by 9,000 last week, but 
economists said even with the slight increase U.S. businesses still 
are scrambling to find workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said Thurday that 298,000 people filed new  
claims for jobless benefits for the week ending Oct. 16, compared 
with 289,000 filing claims the previous week, when the figure had 
dropped by 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase pushed the four-week moving average to 300,750, the  
first time it has been above the 300,000-level in three months. But 
even with the small rise, the number of newly laid off workers 
remains at historically low levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The unemployment rate in September remained at a 29-year low of  
4.2 percent and many economists believe strong economic growth 
could push that rate down even lower to 4.1 percent in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve, worried that tight labor markets could lead  
to rising wage demands and higher inflation, has pushed interest 
rates up twice this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists believe a third rate increase will occur at the  
Fed's next meeting on Nov. 16 because of Fed concerns that economic 
activity must be slowed further to make sure inflation does not get 
out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tight labor market remains the Fed's chief concern,'' said  
Karen Dexter, economist at Merrill Lynch in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the number of continuing unemployment claims remained  
at a low level of 2.22 million persons for the week ending Oct. 9, 
``suggesting that laid-off workers are having little trouble 
finding new jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a second report, a national survey showed that mortgage rates  
are continuing their upward climb. 
</P>
<P>
	The average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose  
to 7.93 percent this week, the highest level in two months, 
according to the survey done by Freddie Mac, the mortgage company. 
It was the highest level since rates hit 8.15 percent in 
mid-August, the high point for this year and a level not seen since 
April 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Van Order, Freddie Mac's chief economist, said that  
recent government reports showing higher inflation pressures at the 
wholesale and retail level were contributing to the pressure on 
mortgage rates. The government reported Tuesday that consumer 
prices jumped 0.4 percent in September, the biggest increase in 
five months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Results of the Producer Price Index and Consumer Price Index  
spooked the financial markets,'' he said, while predicting that 
rates should hold where they are in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Interest rates seem to have leveled off for the time being at  
least and I don't expect much of a change in the very near 
future,'' Van Order said.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Even for a well-adjusted homecoming king and

</P>
<P>
	Since their school was chosen as the setting for ``High  
School,'' a TV series airing on Fox next year, students in a 
Chicago suburb will have that unique experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameras are following the teen-agers through their senior year,  
and documentarian R.J. Cutler will craft their stories into a 
13-episode drama series. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutler envisions a nonfiction version of ``My So-Called Life,''  
the short-lived ABC series from 1994 that starred Claire Danes. 
While high school has long been a setting for sitcoms and dramas, 
from ``Happy Days'' to ``Dawson's Creek,'' this is something 
different. This is real life. With real kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, we had concerns,'' said Susan Benjamin, an assistant  
superintendent responsible for Highland Park High School, which is 
featured in the show. ``We wanted to make sure that he wasn't out 
to expose anyone in a negative way, to humiliate anybody. We were 
very concerned about that. He did convince us. We hope it's true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From a television standpoint, ``High School'' was inevitable. TV  
executives crave young viewers, so they're creating more shows with 
young characters. At the same time, reality-based television, like 
MTV's ``The Real World,'' is a voyeur's delight. It was only a 
matter of time before the two forms collided. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutler, the Oscar-nominated filmmaker who created ``The War  
Room,'' about President Clinton's first campaign, was looking for a 
way to combine cinema verite with a drama series. A high school 
seemed like the perfect place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that real dramas are compelling because they are real  
dramas,'' he said. ``People will recognize themselves in these 
characters far more than they recognize themselves in fictional 
dramas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cutler wanted a Midwestern school with some diversity to appeal  
to a wide audience. To woo their cooperation, he held meetings with 
Highland Park's senior class, parents and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't hurt that he promised to arrange for an independent  
study course in documentary filmmaking, taught by a college 
professor. Cutler has distributed video cameras to several students 
to help them record what's going on in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin did her own background checks to determine that Cutler  
was not a schlock filmmaker. She called former Clinton aide George 
Stephanopoulos, who raved about Cutler's work. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the students were enthusiastic, although now that a  
camera crew has been filming for a month, some have changed their 
mind -- either wanting in or wanting out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the parents were dying for their kids to get in,''  
Benjamin said. ``There were a few who thought it would be too much 
of an invasion of privacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She believes the series can be an educational experience, and  
not just for her budding documentarians. It could show teen-agers 
everywhere that others share their experiences, and could reassure 
older people about what high school is like in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that what it shows is that high school is not a  
dangerous time in students' lives,'' she said. ``I think we're 
concerned that when people think of high school, they think of 
Columbine, and we don't want that image.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin is wary about the impact sudden fame may have on  
Highland Park students. That's why she insisted that the focus be 
on seniors, who will have graduated by the time the series is 
aired. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox may be another warning sign. The network, home of the sultry  
``Beverly Hills, 90210,'' is known for its capacity to shock. This 
fall, Fox scheduled a fictional high school series, ``Manchester 
Prep,'' with a scene notorious for the suggestive language of a 
teen-age girl. It was canceled before it made the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin trusts that Cutler will turn out a classy product. ``I  
think he'd be very uncomfortable if he hurt one of the kids or 
humiliated one of the kids,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	They talk constantly, putting Benjamin in the odd position of  
learning from a TV producer in Los Angeles about the details of 
life in her school, such as the competitiveness between girls in 
the junior and senior classes. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the problems have hardly seemed insurmountable: Benjamin  
was worried that a helicopter hired for filming the homecoming 
football game would make it hard for fans to hear the marching band 
at halftime. Cutler said he's trying his best to record, but not 
intrude upon, Highland Park life. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't expect the subject matter -- the failed romances, the  
winning touchdown passes -- to surprise anyone who has been in high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process of coming of age is an extremely complex one and  
one I feel that is fertile ground for storytelling,'' he said. 
``Kids are very open and eager to have their stories told and the 
school was wise in sensing that it was a great opportunity to teach 
other people about what it is like to be a teen-ager today.''

<HEADLINE> Return of Rams' Lee on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Rams will have to do without  
third-down back Amp Lee, their leading receiver the last two years, 
for a little while longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, who broke his own team record for receptions by a running  
back with 64 last year, recovered from tendinitis in his right knee 
before training camp. But now, the bruise on the bottom of his foot 
particularly bothers him on artificial turf. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first action of the season, Lee carried three times for 3  
yards in the fourth quarter of Sunday's 41-13 victory at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came out of the game feeling that he really wasn't Amp Lee  
yet,'' coach Dick Vermeil said Thursday. ``He feels he needs more 
time to get himself ready, and I told him to take all the time he 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, if and when we do need him, he's ready to go.''  
</P>
<P>
	The need for Lee isn't pressing because the Rams have a surplus  
of receivers for quarterback Kurt Warner to choose from. Isaac 
Bruce has returned to form after two years of battling hamstring 
injuries and Marshall Faulk led NFL backs in receptions last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up to him,'' Vermeil said. ```Right now, we're not in a  
need factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other absences at practice Thursday were offensive guard Tom  
Nutten (back spasms) and safety Devin Bush (flu). Nutten hasn't 
practiced this week and likely will miss his second straight game 
this Sunday against Cleveland. He would be replaced again by Andy 
McCollum.

<HEADLINE> Dayne's Run At Ricky's Record Slows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Barry Alvarez won't compromise a lifetime  
of football teachings to help Ron Dayne chase history. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin's bruising senior tailback began the season needing  
1,717 yards rushing to eclipse Ricky Williams' major-college career 
record. In August, breaking the mark looked like a given for Dayne, 
a Heisman Trophy frontrunner and the featured back in one of the 
most run-oriented offenses in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	But with four games left in the No. 17 Badgers' season, Dayne  
has just 1,020 yards and still needs 697 to break Williams' record. 
That will be a tall order against four Big Ten Conference 
opponents, all of them keying on Dayne. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, Wisconsin players, coaches and fans are  
seriously considering the possibility Dayne won't make it -- and 
that has some boosters angry. Dayne's Heisman hopes also have taken 
a hit because of the tailback's struggles, and it's likely only an 
incredible finish could give Dayne the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alvarez isn't listening to his detractors. He says he always  
believed the team's goals were more important than the individual, 
and good sportsmanship conquers all. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, everyone pays lip service to those philosophies, but  
Alvarez has backed it up this season by pulling Dayne early in 
three Wisconsin blowout wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm concerned with keeping him healthy, not with racking up  
yards,'' Alvarez said. ``Once the score gets out of hand like it 
has for us several times this season, I don't think you can justify 
leaving a guy out there just for statistics' sake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Badgers (5-2, 3-1 Big Ten) have won three straight games,  
and on Saturday they'll face Michigan State, which has the best run 
defense in the nation. If Dayne falters the way he did against 
Michigan earlier in the season, the record will drop even further 
out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
	Blowout wins, minor injuries and inconsistency all have taken a  
toll on Dayne's run at the record. But most observers feel some 
blame must be placed at the feet of Alvarez's coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somewhere down the line, Dayne and this duel with history have  
to become more of a priority,'' columnist Andy Baggot wrote in the 
Wisconsin State Journal on Sunday. ``The pursuit of a Big Ten title 
is job one, of course, but Dayne should be a close second.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Dayne is supportive of Alvarez's team-first philosophy. He  
also says he would trade the record for another Rose Bowl victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I don't get it, I won't be mad,'' Dayne said. ``But I would  
be happy if I got it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Dayne stood helmetless on the sideline during the second  
half of Wisconsin's 59-0 victory over Indiana last Saturday, the 
home fans twice struck up chants of, ``We want Dayne! We want 
Dayne!'' The tailback grinned at the fans and mouthed a thank-you, 
but remained out of the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	With 1,020 yards rushing, Dayne is averaging 145.7 yards per  
game -- 95.4 of which came in the first halves of Wisconsin's seven 
games. He has run for as few as 80 yards and as many as 231 in an 
inconsistent season, and he has just two carries for 6 yards in the 
team's fourth quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've said all along that the record will be broken if he  
stays healthy and gets (enough) touches,'' Wisconsin offensive 
coordinator Brian White said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, he has done neither.  
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez and his assistants have removed Dayne early from  
victories over Murray State, Ball State and Indiana, which came by 
a combined score of 158-20. Dayne has sat out five quarters of 
Wisconsin's first seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Badgers have used Dayne erratically during  
games, often holding him out for an occasional first-half series 
and giving him extended breathers during one of Wisconsin's long, 
run-oriented drives. He also has suffered several minor injuries, 
from dislocated fingers and ankle sprains to a mild stinger in his 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne has already accomplished much. He's the leading rusher in  
the history of the Big Ten, and he's one of only four backs with 
four 1,000-yard rushing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne has been responsible for roughly one-third of all the  
yards Wisconsin has gained during his four seasons and is well on 
the way to a record third Big Ten rushing title. 
</P>
<P>
	But will all those achievements ring hollow if the biggest prize  
of all goes unclaimed? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think so,'' Dayne said. ``There's bigger things than  
the record.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Close Down / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the Japanese yen and share  
prices closed lower in Tokyo today amid investor worries over the 
direction of U.S. stocks after a surprise warning on slowing sales 
from IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 106.12 yen in late trading, down 0.24 yen from  
Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its New York level of 106.50 yen 
late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed down 86.44  
points, or 0.49 percent, at 17,448.27. On Wednesday, the average 
closed up 280.54 points, or 1.63 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar was higher early in the  
session, carrying through from its overnight strength in New York. 
But the greenback moved lower on concern over a possible drop in 
U.S. stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Worries over U.S. asset markets, including equities, still  
remain,'' said Shuji Takano, assistant manager of foreign exchange 
at ABN AMRO Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei stock index decline also hurt the dollar. Instead of  
causing a flight of capital out of Japan, traders said the decline 
in the Japanese market was a sign of what may happen at the start 
of trading later Thursday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded between 105.97 yen and 106.53 yen in Tokyo on  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was trading at 114.36 yen, down  
from 114.83 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	In stock trading, investor concerns about Wall Street stocks  
were reawakened following a surprise plunge in the share price of 
International Business Machines in after-hours trading in the 
United States on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobuhiko Kuromachi of Wako Securities said Tokyo stock prices  
advanced after the market opened following Wednesday's big rise in 
U.S. stocks during regular trading. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``investors quickly lost heart once the news of the big  
falloff in IBM stocks during after-hours trading percolated through 
the market,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 187.43 points, or 1.8  
percent, to close Wednesday at 10,392.36. 
</P>
<P>
	But after markets closed, IBM surprised traders with a gloomy  
outlook, even with third-quarter profits matching analysts' 
expectations. IBM said that with the Year 2000 date change 
threatening to cause widespread computer failures, would-be buyers 
of IBM's powerful network and database servers are proving 
extremely hesitant about complicating matters by adding new 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 596.60 million shares, up from 535.78 million shares 
Wednesday. Retreating issues outnumbered advancers 763 to 462 on 
the TSE First Section, while 113 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section closed down 3.37 points, or 0.22 percent, to 1,503.94 
points. The TOPIX closed up 35.51 points, or 2.4 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond was unchanged from Wednesday's finish at 1.8450 percent. Its 
price rose 0.01 point to 98.76.

<HEADLINE> Leafs Get Right to Match Khristich </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Toronto Maple Leafs today obtained Boston's  
right to match Dmitri Khristich's arbitration award in exchange for 
the Leafs' second-round entry draft selection next June. 
</P>
<P>
	Khristich scored 29 goals for the Bruins last season and has 225  
goals in 627 NHL games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ukrainian forward was awarded a $2.8 million salary this  
season in an arbitrator's decision in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins exercised their right to walk away from the ruling,  
making Khristich a free agent although Boston retained the right to 
match any offer less than 80 percent of the arbitrator's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs offered Khristich a three-year deal worth as  
much as $8 million to resume his career in Toronto. A club option 
on a fourth year would raise the total value to more than $10 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	His salary this season will be $850,000, with bonuses worth  
$750,000 and $700,000 to be paid over the next two years. His base 
salary will be $2.5 million for the second and third years of the 
contract, and $2.75 million plus a $300,000 signing bonus if the 
Leafs pick up the fourth year.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WINCHESTER, Tenn. (AP) -- One is a discount store cashier, others  
work in health care or in business, many are students -- but all 
stop what they are doing between 9:30 and 9:39 each morning and 
pray for the safety of children in schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucille Durm, the cashier who is a Pentecostal, is like many  
Franklin County residents who read news of the Columbine High 
School massacre in Colorado and concluded it can happen here. 
</P>
<P>
	To try to ensure it doesn't, they've agreed to stop working at  
9:30 a.m. and 9:39 a.m. each weekday and pray. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask the Lord to watch over this county,'' said Durm, 71, her  
gray hair pinned in a bun. ``I think that's what it's going to 
take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Jones, a University of the South football coach, and his  
pastor, the Rev. Alan Roggli, started the prayer movement, called 
Shield of Faith. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think maybe this is the only chance we've got left,'' Jones  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to have as many as possible worshipping  
simultaneously. The time was chosen to coincide with a nine-minute 
unscheduled period in the schools so students could pray, too. 
(Some participants said they pray earlier or later than 9:30, for 
convenience.) 
</P>
<P>
	``If we didn't have God to talk to and to work with and to pray  
to, I think you'd lose hope,'' said Kathy Syler, 44, a therapy 
services coordinator at a Winchester home health care organization. 
</P>
<P>
	She prays daily between phone calls, while in the bathroom or at  
her desk. A grandmother of triplets, she said she's afraid for when 
the babies are old enough to go to school. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was in high school we didn't have these problems,'' she  
said. ``As adults I don't know where we went wrong with our 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones doesn't know how many people participate each day, but  
said nearly 4,000 attended a rally last month to kick off the 
campaign. Some of the banners urging daily prayer still hang from 
storefronts in this town of 6,300, located 45 miles west of 
Chattanooga. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said a ``still, small voice'' during a moment of  
reflection led him and Roggli to start the movement. A visit to 
Littleton, Colo., in June also was an influence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It broke my heart. As my players can tell you, I'm not real  
sensitive,'' Jones said. ``But when I walked over the hill and saw 
Columbine High School and the flag was at half-staff I could not 
stop crying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last April, teen-age gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed  
12 Columbine schoolmates and a teacher before taking their own 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	To advertise Shield of Faith, Jones made up business cards with  
the group's name and a short explanation of its goals, and 
distributed them at department stores, restaurants and churches. 
Jones said he gave away about 17,000 cards. 
</P>
<P>
	To comply with federal law, school administrators and teachers

<P>
	``I believe that violence and evil can happen anywhere,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> CIA Reports on Y2K Bug Pitfalls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The CIA informed Congress on Thursday that it  
is ``highly confident'' Y2K computer failures will not lead to the 
accidental launch of a ballistic missile by any country. 
</P>
<P>
	But the intelligence agency expressed some concern over the  
safety of aging Soviet-era nuclear power plants in Russia and 
Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
	These so-called Chernobyl-style reactors could develop year 2000  
computer bugs that would be further aggravated by any power 
failures, said Lawrence Gershwin, the CIA's national intelligence 
officer for science and technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Gershwin told the House International Affairs Committee that  
these older reactors have ``inherent design problems,'' including 
lack of total containment systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chance of a nuclear incident in Russia, Ukraine or another  
state with Soviet-designed reactors during the Y2K rollover is 
low,'' Gershwin said. ``It is, however, higher than normal because 
of the likelihood that the power grid could experience failures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In the worst case, this could cause a meltdown and in some  
cases, an accompanying release of radioactive fission gases causing 
localized contamination,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At this late date, testing and making all Soviet-designed  
nuclear power plant systems Y2K compliant ``is not feasible, 
particularly given the age of the computer systems and the fact 
that many of the original manufacturers have gone out of 
business,'' Gerswhin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some intelligence officials had earlier expressed concerns that  
Y2K problems could cause serious disruptions in strategic missile 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	But, with Jan. 1, 2000, now less than three months away, ``we  
are highly confident that Y2K failures will not lead to the 
inadvertent or unauthorized launch of a ballistic missile by any 
country,'' the CIA official said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that some worry remains about ``the potential for Russia  
to misinterpret early warning data'' should Y2K problems occur, 
particularly in the midst of an international political crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the United States and Russia have set up a joint  
program, based at Peterson Air Force Base, Colo., to share 
information on upcoming missile and space launches ``to prevent any 
misunderstandings resulting from Russian early warning failures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gershwin said Russia, Ukraine, China and Indonesia remain the  
major countries most likely to experience ``significant Y2K-related 
failures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House panel is looking into potential disruptions abroad  
caused by Y2K problems and their impact on the millions of 
Americans who are living or traveling overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	John O'Keefe, director of Y2K programs for the State Department,  
said the agency had inventoried 23,000 items at its embassies and 
consulates in 164 nations to make sure they were all Y2K-compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	Each overseas post is prepared to report to the State Department  
at one hour past midnight local time on Jan. 1 to relay information 
on any potential problems, O'Keefe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many countries are lagging in their efforts, and electric power  
grids, telecommunications systems and the medical sector appear the 
most vulnerable, O'Keefe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have to rely on medical-electrical devices, you better  
be careful where you travel to,'' the State Department official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacquelyn Williams-Bridgers, the State Department's inspector  
general, said that the United States needs to guard against 
complacency and that there remains serious risk of major 
Y2K-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must recognize the potential for disruptions,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	In particular, she testified, ``developing countries are  
generally lagging behind and are struggling to find the financial 
and technical resources needed to solve their Y2K problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department has country-specific information on  
potential Y2K problems at its Web site http://travel.state.gov. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem is caused by computers that were programmed to  
read only the last two digits of a year. That could cause them to 
read the year 2000 as 1900, in some cases fouling up basic 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In other Y2K developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Food and Drug Administration official William Hubbard,  
testifying before a House Commerce Committee panel, gave assurances 
that medical devices will function properly and medical supplies 
and drugs will be available on Jan. 1. There has been concern that 
breakdowns in devices such as blood pumps and dialysis machines 
could be life-threatening. Health and Human Services Deputy 
Inspector General George Grob praised the FDA for its work but 
added a note of skepticism, saying ``many providers are not taking 
the necessary steps to ensure that their biomedical equipment will 
be ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Sens. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,  
heads of the Senate special panel on Y2K, cited a Texas A&AMP;M survey 
finding that 86 percent of chemical businesses with 200 or fewer 
employees are not currently prepared for Y2K. ``While the 
probability of a Y2K-related disruption is low, the potential harm 
even one chemical accident can cause means we must be especially 
vigilant,'' Dodd said.

<HEADLINE> Wilt Remembered With Love, Laughter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Wilt Chamberlain was remembered Thursday  
with uproarious laughter and a few tears at a church just blocks 
from the high school where he first soared to basketball fame. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 500 people attended the lighthearted memorial service,  
telling stories about the tall skinny kid who went on to become 
perhaps the sport's most dominant player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wilt never really left Philadelphia even when he was  
geographically far away. He never forgot us and we never really 
forgot him,'' Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain died Oct. 12 in his Bel-Air, Calif., home at 63 of  
an apparent heart attack. A previous memorial service was held in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those attending Thursday were former Warriors teammates  
Tom Gola and Paul Arizen, former 76ers teammates Bill Melchionni, 
Billy Cunningham and Matt Guokas, ex-Knicks star Earl Monroe and 
Temple coach John Chaney. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain led West Philadelphia's Overbrook High School to  
several championships before playing 14 dazzling seasons in the 
NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaney played alongside Chamberlain while he was in high school  
and Chamberlain was in junior high. Even then, Chaney said 
Chamberlain was dazzling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would put the ball up, and Wilt would take the ball out of  
the air and while he was up there would put the ball in the basket, 
and then he would get credit for my basket,'' Chaney said. ``I had 
to pull him aside and tell him to stop taking my shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gola said he still has a crook in his nose from an elbow by  
Chamberlain. Gola noted that Chamberlain's height, sometimes in 
question, was actually 7-foot-1 3/4. Gola said he measured Chamberlain 
using a ladder at training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Several friends and former teammates likened Chamberlain to such  
greats as Babe Ruth and Michael Jordan. Chamberlain still holds the 
NBA record for most points in a game (100) and highest season 
average (50 points in 1962). 
</P>
<P>
	But Chaney said Chamberlain should be compared to the late  
Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, who was instrumental in 
the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``He changed the game that we all know and love. So you can  
actually say, `We're playing the game according to Wilt,''' Chaney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizin remembered Chamberlain as generous and big-hearted.  
Chamberlain befriended Arizin's 16-year-old dying granddaughter in 
1996, helping her get autographs from dozens of NBA stars. He 
corresponded with the girl for six months before she died. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was more than an athlete, more than a great ball player, he  
was a great human being, which is probably more important than 
being a great athlete,'' Arizin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the church, a sea of tall, graying men swapped stories  
of when Chamberlain was only 6-9 and played at the local community 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those were things to remember ... playing against him every  
Sunday in a gym where we both went ... didn't get too many points 
against him,'' said Sylvester Brosier, 66. ``The records that he 
set will never be broken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vince Miller, Chamberlain's best friend for more than 50 years,  
was not at the 100-point game in Hershey in 1962. But he did see 
Chamberlain score 90 points in high school during a 32-minute game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a friend, my confidante, the best man at my wedding,''  
Miller said, choking back tears. ``I'll love him forever.''

<HEADLINE> Mattel Earnings Fall 42 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mattel Inc. earnings plummeted 42 percent in  
the third quarter, undermined by a $105 million loss at its 
troubled software subsidiary and weak toy sales in international 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel said Thursday it earned $135.3 million, or 32 cents per  
share, on sales of $1.83 billion. During last year's third quarter 
Mattel earned $168.7 million, or 42 cents per share on sales of 
$1.88 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were slightly ahead of the average estimate of 31  
cents per share forecast by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson 
Financial. Mattel's shares were up 31 cents to $13.63 on the New 
York Stock Exchange Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss at The Learning Company was slightly higher than the  
$50 million to $100 million range Mattel forecast earlier this 
month, when it warned investors that third-quarter earnings would 
fall substantially. 
</P>
<P>
	The Learning Company, acquired earlier this year in a $3.8  
billion stock deal, had been expected to yield a $50 million profit 
through the sale of software titles such as Carmen Sandiego, 
American Greetings and Myst. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we are most disappointed in developments at The Learning  
Company, and by continuing difficulties in international markets, 
we are encouraged by U.S. sales increases in the quarter for our 
core Barbie, Fisher Price, Wheels and American Girl brands,'' Jill 
Barad, Mattel's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a 
news release. 
</P>
<P>
	In a conference call with analysts, Barad said there were no  
plans to sell The Learning Company or change its management. She 
said she expected The Learning Company to return to profitability 
sometime in 2000, but would not be more specific. Barad also told 
analysts the software maker planned to release some promising new 
titles, including one based on the popular Pokemon cartoon 
creatures. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we now need to prove is the potential of international  
sales and The Learning Company, ``Barad said. ``... We've faced 
challenges before and we are up to the challenges athat are ahead 
of us. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel's problems, however, won't be quickly resolved, analysts  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our feel is the problems are probably a little more entrenched  
and the industry issues will not disappear quickly,'' said Jill 
Krutick, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond The Learning Company problems, analysts' concerns include  
soft international sales and Mattel's core product line. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've obviously had some erosion in their core business as  
well,'' Krutick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel blamed The Learning Company loss on $58 million in  
distributor and retailer product returns and allowances and a $56 
million increase in bad debt reserves. Another reason, the company 
reported, was Mattel's decision to cancel a proposed licensing 
agreement that had been expected to produce $60 million in 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel's earnings warning, issued on Oct. 4, initially pushed  
the company's stock down nearly 30 percent. It also prompted 
speculation that Barad might lose her job and that Mattel could 
become a takeover target. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel stock has lost more than 70 percent of its value since  
hitting a 10-year peak of $46.75 in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Mattel lost $63.9  
million, or 71 cents per share, as a result of $269.7 million in 
one-time after-tax charges resulting from restructuring and other 
expenses. That compares to earnings of $111.3, or 27 cents per 
share, for the first nine months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month revenue came to $3.74 billion, down from $3.8  
billion.

<HEADLINE> Architect of Capitol Rebuked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate's top two leaders complained  
Wednesday that senators' offices are in a ``general state of 
uncleanliness'' and said they're tired of uncollected trash, dirty 
restrooms, bugs and layers of dust in the Capitol complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader Tom  
Daschle, D-S.D., aimed their stern letter at embattled Architect of 
the Capitol Alan M. Hantman. The rebuke was read to Hantman during 
a hearing examining the upkeep of congressional buildings and 
treatment of Congress' work force. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators reminded the architect of citations during the past  
year for poor fire and worker safety, and angrily termed ``a horror 
story'' the supervision of a new child-care building delayed by a 
potentially deadly mold. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some offices are so poorly cleaned that dust heavily  
accumulates, trash collection does not always occur on a daily 
basis, and internal stairs and hallways often are not vacuumed or 
cleaned,'' Lott and Daschle wrote, adding to the list of woes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., in a separate letter, demanded  
relief for Senate restaurant workers who were reporting ``verbal 
and physical abuse'' by supervisors in the architect's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Hantman acknowledged to the Senate Committee on Rules and  
Administration that his office, which is charged with upkeep of 
congressional properties, has had some problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think improvement is necessary in the cleanliness of the  
buildings,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He blamed delays with the child-care center on contractors and  
said allegations of mistreatment of employees ``could not be 
substantiated.'' But he said any lack of respect for workers was 
``not acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last year, Hantman's stewardship of the Capitol grounds  
has been criticized for a lack of fire and workplace safety 
standards. A congressional health and safety agency issued several 
citations to the office. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and Daschle raised new concerns. They wrote of ``a general  
state of uncleanliness throughout the Senate office buildings'' and 
cited ``unwashed windows, bug infestations and major plumbing 
leaks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Public restrooms and public eating areas are expected to be  
kept clean and sanitary, but we are told that is not always the 
case,'' the leaders wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., told Hantman that the problem  
might have something to do a reduction in Senate custodial workers 
over the past six years from 130 to 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called the day-care  
center delays ``a horror story.'' The facility, a new building, was 
supposed to open two years ago but was delayed largely due to the 
discovery of potentially deadly stachybotrys mold. 
</P>
<P>
	With the mold finally eradicated, the planned Sept. 1 opening  
has been delayed again, because new mold spores have been found -- 
less serious but enough to keep the children out, said Lisa Tuite, 
a Senate employee and president of the center's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	``As one would expect, the cost of the mismanagement by the  
(architect's) office is more than any non-profit can stand,'' she 
wrote McConnell, citing a financial burden of $140,000 based on 
lost revenue and the hiring of a consultant to deal with the mold. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Senate is financing construction, parents pay $8,000  
to $9,000 annually for their children to receive day care, 
currently at an older, smaller building. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a bunch of employees here concerned about their  
children because you got this all fouled up,'' McConnell told 
Hantman, who estimated to the skeptical senators the center would 
be ready in three to five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a real crisis here,'' added Sen. Dianne Feinstein,  
D-Calif., who suggested to Hantman that ``we charge your budget'' 
for the parents' losses. Architect officials said they are formally 
seeking permission from the Senate to transfer money to the 
center's treasury. 
</P>
<P>
	Feinstein told Hantman that he should ``have someone down there  
full-time to get this project finished,'' and added, after a pause, 
``How about you yourself getting down there?'' She attributed the 
problems to ``lack of oversight and leadership'' by Hantman's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Mikulski wrote Hantman on behalf of the Senate restaurant  
workers, stating: ``I firmly believe that the Architect of the 
Capitol should be as committed to the social architecture of the 
Capitol work force as he or she is to the physical architecture of 
our buildings and grounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last December, the House inspector general said the U.S. Capitol  
and five House office buildings were firetraps that leave visitors, 
members of Congress and employees with an ``undue risk of loss of 
life and property.''

<HEADLINE> Alexander Catching on in KC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Derrick Alexander is just the kind of wide  
receiver the Baltimore Ravens are looking for: A sure-handed 
speedster who has a knack for finding a seam in the defense and is 
elusive enough to turn a short pass into a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander would be a perfect partner for Jermaine Lewis, who had  
been limited to 10 catches this season because he is usually must 
run patterns into double coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander was a big part of the Baltimore offense in 1996 and  
1997, and his name is listed prominently in the team record book 
under virtually every receiving category. But he left the Ravens 
after the 1997 season when it become apparent that Baltimore wasn't 
interested in keeping him around. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed with the Kansas City Chiefs in March 1998 and led the  
team with 992 receiving yards last season. This year he once again 
has more receiving yardage than anyone on the Chiefs (379) and 
ranks second with 18 catches. 
</P>
<P>
	When Kansas City (3-2) plays the Ravens (2-3) tonight at PSINet  
Stadium, Alexander plans to remind Baltimore fans about the good 
old days, when the No. 82 on his back was part of a purple and 
black uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to have a big game,'' he said. ``I don't think I have  
to prove anything, but I still see it as an opportunity for them to 
see what they let get away,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander fell out of favor with then-coach Ted Marchibroda for  
reasons that were not made public. But safety Stevon Moore, who 
expects to keep a close eye on Alexander tonight, remembers the 
receiver as someone who usually saved his best effort for game day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Derrick has never been a practice guy. You had to really get  
on him, even bench him, to force him to do things at practice,'' 
Moore said. ``But on game day he's ready to play, and I'm sure 
he'll be ready to play Thursday. He'll probably want to look good 
against his former team on national television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander may get that chance, but he's hardly the main focus of  
the Baltimore defense. The Chiefs average 135 yards rushing per 
game, so the Ravens will be looking for Kansas City to primarily 
keep the ball on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the type of game you don't have to even think about  
what they are going to do,'' Ravens middle linebacker Ray Lewis 
said. ``You know they are going to run the ball. That is what they 
believe in, so it is going to be a very physical game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens prefer to run, too, even though first-year coach  
Brian Billick directed a pass-happy attack last year as offensive 
coordinator of the Minnesota Vikings. Billick will keep his offense 
nice and simple in Baltimore until inexperienced quarterback Stoney 
Case becomes comfortable with the system. 
</P>
<P>
	Case had one career NFL start before this season, and his  
immaturity showed in a 14-11 loss to the Tennessee Titans on Oct. 
10. With Tennessee daring him to pass, Case completed only 15 of 37 
throws and failed to produce a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs would be silly not to use the same strategy, and  
Billick knows it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very aggressive and confident on defense. I would  
imagine he (Chiefs coach Gunther Cunningham) will bring his safety 
up for most of the game,'' Billick said. ``The only way to combat 
an eight-man front is hurt them on the outside. That puts a premium 
on the receivers and Stoney being efficient out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It might have been an easier proposition if Alexander was in the  
mix, but he seems to be a perfect fit in Cunningham's offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a magnificent player,'' Cunningham said. ``He's one of  
the most underrated players in the league, not only as a player but 
as a person. He really carries himself well.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Rules Against Strip Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- A federal judge has ruled that the  
state cannot issue strip mining permits for projects that use 
stream beds to dispose of rock and dirt, a decision a state 
official said would affect all mining in West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling issued Wednesday was a victory for environmentalists  
who sued last year arguing that allowing coal companies to dump 
excess rock and dirt into stream beds violates the federal Clean 
Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice is especially critical to the strip mining  
technique known as mountaintop removal mining, which has been used 
increasingly in the Appalachian region in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Charles Haden II said  
projects that dispose of waste in stream beds are usually so 
enormous that ``rather than the stream assimilating the waste, the 
waste assimilates the stream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said using the stream beds for disposal degrades water  
quality in violation of federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the plaintiffs are relieved and encouraged,'' said Cindy  
Rank, a spokeswoman for the Highlands Conservancy environmental 
group, a lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Department of Environmental Protection, which issues  
permits for large strip mines known as mountaintop removal mines, 
warned that the ruling ``will substantially curb all mining in West 
Virginia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the DEP said an appeal was likely.  
</P>
<P>
	Haden's review of the mountaintop removal issue was a result of  
Arch Coal Inc.'s efforts to obtain a permit to mine a 3,500-acre 
site in southern West Virginia's Logan County. 
</P>
<P>
	Arch, based in St. Louis, said it needed the permit because its  
adjacent Dal-Tex operation had exhausted its coal reserves. 
Together, the two mines would have stripped more than 10 square 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Haden issued a preliminary injunction blocking work on  
the new mine. His ruling Wednesday made the injunction permanent.

<HEADLINE> Colgate-Palmolive Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Colgate-Palmolive Co. posted an 11.5 percent  
earnings increase for the third quarter on Thursday, narrowly 
beating Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer products company known for Colgate toothpaste,  
Palmolive dish soap, Ajax cleanser and Mennen deodorant cited new 
products and global sales growth for its improved results. 
</P>
<P>
	Colgate earned $239.7 million, or 38 cents a share, in the three  
months ended September 30, compared with $214.9 million, or 33 
cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings were a penny per share ahead of the 37 cents expected  
by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. Colgate's 
stock was up $3.69 to $57.69 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose to $2.31 billion from $2.27 billion a year  
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Colgate, which sells its products in more than  
200 countries, reported sales increases of 4 percent in North 
America and 7 percent in its Asia-Africa division. 
</P>
<P>
	In Latin America and Europe, the company said sales figures were  
level with last year's, a result of declining currency values 
throughout the regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the company rolled out several new products, including a  
striped gel version of its Total toothpaste and a Navigator 
toothbrush with a flexible head. In Latin America, Colgate 
continued its expansion of Lady Speed Stick underarm deodorant. And 
in Europe, the company introduced Ajax antibacterial spray and 
liquid cleaners in 10 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebounding economies in Brazil and Asia helped build regional  
sales, the company said. In China, Colgate became the market leader 
in toothpaste and expanded direct distribution to 380 cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Colgate also saw an 8 percent increase in sales in its Hill's  
pet food unit, which makes specialty food to treat hairballs in 
cats and combat liver and kidney disease, renal failure and cancer 
in pets. The division reported strong growth from its overseas 
operations in Japan, Australia, South Africa and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Colgate earned $676.7  
million, or $1.06 per share, compared to $614.4 million, or 94 
cents per share over the same period in 1998. Revenue rose to $6.77 
billion from $6.68 billion.

<HEADLINE> IBM Stock Plunges on Y2K Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM's stock tumbled as much as 17 percent on  
Thursday and dragged down the broader market. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Dow regained more than half its loss, ending down 94.67  
at 10,297.69, and many technology stocks came back. IBM did not, 
ending down $16 a share at $91 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM released its third-quarter financial results late Wednesday,  
warning that sales would weaken because many would-be buyers of its 
powerful network and database server computers were hesitant to add 
new systems while fixing millennium bugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Although strong demand for software and systems support drove  
IBM's third-quarter profits 14 percent higher, matching most 
forecasts, the results weren't hearty enough to overshadow the 
accompanying warning from the company. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Year 2000 date change threatening to cause widespread  
computer failures, would-be buyers of IBM's powerful network and 
database servers are proving extremely hesitant about complicating 
matters by adding new systems, IBM said. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from that business dropped 40 percent in the third  
quarter compared with a particularly strong showing in the same 
period last year, and the weakness is expected to continue through 
the fourth quarter and into January, executives warned. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is more apparent that many customers had bought ahead to  
accommodate Y2K testing'' of their existing computer systems, and 
``slowed the deployment of more complex systems ... until after the 
millennium,'' said Doug Maine, IBM's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine noted that 70 percent of the world's business data is  
managed by IBM servers. Those machines, including banking and 
airline reservations systems, ``simply cannot go down,'' he said. 
But, Maine added, ``once we get past these lingering Year 2000 
effects, we should see an acceleration of demand'' for heavy-duty 
systems to meet the explosion of Internet-related commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the report was released yesterday, IBM's stock had soared  
to $112.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. But when the report was 
released after the 4 p.m. close of that exchange, the stock sank on 
other markets affiliated with the NYSE, closing at $107, and then 
continued to plunge in after-hours trading. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, IBM's shares fell as low as $89, a drop of $23.75  
from the 4 p.m. price used to calculate the Dow Jones industrial 
average and $18 below the closing price on NYSE affiliated markets. 
By midday, the stock had recovered to about $92 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	A drop of $23.75 by IBM, one of the 30 companies that make up  
the Dow, is equivalent to 120-point loss by that famous market 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, the Dow had jumped 187 points on Wednesday as a strong  
profit report from Microsoft helped restore confidence following a 
weak third-quarter showing from Intel last week. It wasn't clear 
whether IBM's slowdown, possibly only temporary, would extinguish 
the market's renewed optimism or be treated as an isolated problem. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM also said its third-quarter results were hurt by shortages  
of flat-panel computer screens for its ThinkPad laptops, as well as 
price competition in the market for computer harddrives. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's third-quarter operating profit amounted to $1.69  
billion, or 90 cents per share, for the July-September period. 
</P>
<P>
	Those figures exclude a $366 million gain from the sale of the  
company's Web services unit to AT&AMP;T Corp. and other one-time 
factors that gave IBM a net profit of $1.76 billion, or 93 cents 
per share. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, IBM earned $1.49 billion or 78 cents a share in the  
year-ago period, when there were no one-time factors. 
</P>
<P>
	The operating profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 was in  
line with analyst forecasts, according to a survey by First 
Call/Thomson Financial, marking the 14th straight quarter IBM has 
met or exceeded expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, IBM's third-quarter revenues rose 5 percent to $21.14  
billion, up from $20.10 billion a year ago. Most of that gain came 
from the systems management unit, IBM Global Services, where 
revenues rose 12 percent to $7.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, IBM's net profit totaled  
$5.61 billion or $2.99 per share, including a one-time gain of $750 
million from the AT&AMP;T deal and other one-time factors. In the same 
period a year ago, IBM earned $3.97 billion, or $2.05 a share. 
Nine-month revenues totaled $63.37 billion, up 12 percent from 
$56.54 billion tallied at the same point last year.

<HEADLINE> Stihl Recalls Garden Tools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stihl Inc. recalled about 7,200 weed trimmers  
and hundreds of brush cutters and augers Wednesday because of 
concerns of fuel leaks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Safety Product Commission said fuel can leak from  
an unsealed seam in the fuel tank, posing a fire hazard. The recall 
includes 192 brush cutters and 244 augers sold by the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Virginia Beach, Va.-based manufacturer is aware of one  
incident with a leaking trimmer in Europe. No injuries were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled trimmers have model numbers FS 120 and FS 200, and  
were sold with bicycle- or loop-type handles. The model of the 
cutters is FS 350. The augers have model number BT 120C and are 
used to drill holes in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The model numbers are located on the top of the engines'  
shrouds. The serial numbers are stamped into the crank case base. 
</P>
<P>
	Stihl dealers sold the brush cutters, weed trimmers and augers  
from November 1998 through September. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all serial numbers of the models are included in the recall.  
The commission recommends customers stop using the tools 
immediately and call Stihl at 800-467-8445 to determine if their 
tool is part of the recall. Recalled tools can be returned to a 
Stihl dealer for a new fuel tank.

<HEADLINE> Leaders Bid Farewell to Nyerere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) -- Military drums rolled,  
international leaders paid tribute and Tanzanians wept for their 
beloved ``Mwalimu'' Julius Nyerere, whose state funeral Thursday 
marked the passing of an era in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	A week after the 77-year-old Nyerere, who was his country's  
first president from 1962 to 1985, died in a London hospital, his 
African friends and colleagues entered the National Stadium to 
thank him for his role in the liberation of eastern and southern 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	International figures spoke with feeling for the leader known as  
``Mwalimu,'' the Kiswahili word for teacher, who gave his people 
self-respect, dignity and a stable unity -- a rare thing in Africa. 
They praised him for his honesty and integrity on a continent where 
so many leaders succumb to corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo nearly whispered as he  
recalled how Nyerere worked to free him from prison after he was 
jailed and accused of plotting a coup. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the first non-Nigerian who called me when I was freed,  
and he told me he was afraid he hadn't done enough,'' Obasanjo, 
wearing a dazzling white and blue agbada, the Nigerian national 
dress, said in his brief eulogy. 
</P>
<P>
	Many mourners, including Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
and Britain's Princess Anne, wore black. Nyerere's widow, Maria, 
and several of his daughters wore black turbans. 
</P>
<P>
	Among ordinary Tanzanians who crowded into the stadium, many of  
the women wore brightly colored shawls or the traditional 
``khanga'' cloth printed in black, white, blue and yellow with the 
likeness of a younger Nyerere and the phrase in Kiswahili, 
``Majonzi Tunayo Tanzania'' or ``Tanzania is grieving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who eulogized Nyerere spoke with admiration of his having  
used Kiswahili, an African language, to forge unity among a nation 
of 32 million people comprising 120 ethnic or language groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mwalimu's intellectual heritage lives on, and he is a source  
of inspiration to all of us,'' said Finnish President Martti 
Ahtisaari, the current head of the European Union. ``He gave you 
peace, stability and a clear identity based on a common language, 
culture and self-respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique reminded mourners of  
the debt his own country, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Namibia 
and Angola owe to Nyerere and the people of Tanzania who gave their 
meager resources to support liberation movements throughout the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, Tanzania's northern  
neighbor, described the day as the passing of an era, not only in 
Tanzania, but in all of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Moi recalled how Nyerere, who had negotiated independence from  
Britain for what was then Tanganyika in 1961, offered to hold off 
until both Kenya and Uganda were also free to create a united East 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Sutherland, an 80-year-old from Glen Ridge, N.J., who has  
made Tanzania his home since 1962, sat in the stands in his khaki 
safari suit and leopard-patterned scarf. He said Nyerere was a 
prophet. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always favored development through small local units, from  
the grassroots. I don't think he realized what a great potential 
this was,'' Sutherland said. 
</P>
<P>
	After his retirement in 1985, Nyerere acknowledged that his plan  
of achieving development through the creation of villages called 
``ujamaa'' or united groups was an economic flop. He reversed 
course and encouraged the establishment of a free market economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, mobile telephones are commonplace in major Tanzanian  
cities, and youngsters who can't afford their own computers check 
their e-mail at Internet cafes. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago, Tanzania had no television. The funeral of the  
man who sought to shield his people from the music of Jimi Hendrix 
and too much American influence was broadcast live through the 
combined effort of its three private TV networks. CNN picked up the 
signal. 
</P>
<P>
	The coffin carrying the body of the man Albright hailed as ``in  
every sense, a great world leader,'' left the stadium on the 
shoulders of 10 army officers and was flown to Butiama, his home 
village in northwestern Tanzania. Nyerere will be buried there 
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> IBM Y2K Woes May Not Affect Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite investor fears of broader industry  
fallout, IBM's dour warning about damage from the Year 2000 
computer glitch appears relatively limited to its own financial 
results -- and its stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns that IBM's woes could hit other technology companies  
initially pounded the stock market Thursday, sending the Dow Jones 
industrial average plunging more than 200 points in early trading. 
</P>
<P>
	But the market largely recovered by day's end, underscoring what  
some analysts have said all along: IBM could be a largely isolated 
instance of Y2K damage because its customers are heavy users of old 
mainframes, which are more likely to mistake the year 2000 for 
1900. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, in fact, the much-feared corporate spending freeze on  
new computer systems -- known in the industry as Y2K lockdown -- 
looks more like a mild chill. 
</P>
<P>
	``With very few exceptions, the software-hardware lockdown has  
been very small compared to what the fears were,'' said Michael 
Murphy, an independent analyst who is editor of the California 
Technology Stock Letter, based in Half Moon Bay, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``The customers are all saying, 'Our budgets aren't going to  
change, we're OK.' '' Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM released its third-quarter financial results late Wednesday,  
warning that sales would weaken because many would-be buyers of its 
powerful network and database server computers were hesitant to add 
new systems while fixing millennium bugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning sent the company's stock tumbling as much as 17  
percent on Thursday and dragged down the broader market. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Dow regained more than half its loss, ending down 94.67  
at 10,297.69, and many technology stocks came back. IBM did not, 
ending down $16 a share at $91 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The market's performance mirrors what several analysts say about  
how the damage to corporate spending by Y2K concerns is less 
broad-scale than feared as recently as early this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week software giant Microsoft Corp. predicted it  
would have strong holiday season sales, in contrast to a previous 
warning that sales could be off as companies devoted all their 
resources to stomping out 21st century computer bugs. 
</P>
<P>
	And Cisco Systems Inc., the largest maker of computer networking  
equipment, has said it's more comfortable with weathering Y2K woes 
than it was 6-to-12 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The uneven outlook is underscored by a recent survey by the  
Cutter Consortium. Only half of the 96 surveyed companies said they 
were deferring spending on computer systems while they prepare for 
Y2K snags. ``I would have expected it to be higher than that,'' 
said Sheila Green, of the Arlington, Mass.-based consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	George Elling, an analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc., said the  
mixed Y2K situation reflects the diversity of the computer 
industry. Hardly a monolith, the technology sector ranges from 
sellers devoted to just software or computers to full-range 
companies peddling all these products. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporations considering buying large computer systems, which  
are IBM's specialty, are most likely to defer related orders 
because of their scale and complexity. Also vulnerable are sellers 
such as PeopleSoft, which makes sophisticated software for running 
companies' human resource departments. 
</P>
<P>
	But few businesses will halt buying desktop computers needed to  
keep their basic operations humming smoothly, Elling said. 
</P>
<P>
	``More complex systems are likely to be deferred than a PC,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Overturns Police Lawsuit Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A federal judge has overturned a 1982  
state law that allowed police officers to sue individuals who 
complained of police misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Gary L. Taylor on Wednesday ruled that the  
law violated Constitutional rights to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union challenged the law saying  
officers had been using it to prevent people from following through 
with complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU filed suit on behalf of Myron Gritchen, who was stopped  
in April 1998 by a Long Beach police officer and accused of 
speeding. Gritchen, who denied the charge, filed a complaint 
against the officer and two months later received a letter from the 
officer's attorney threatening to sue him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're extremely pleased that the federal court has struck down  
a law that has been used as a tool for retaliation,'' said John 
Crew, director of the ACLU's police practices project. 
</P>
<P>
	Crew said the state law was the only type of its kind in the  
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Hunt, president of the 10,000-member Los Angeles Police  
Protective League, called the ruling a setback for officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court has ruled that as a police officer I don't have the  
constitutional right that every other citizen has to sue somebody 
who has made an untrue, false and deceptive accusation. That's 
wrong,'' Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unknown how many cases have been filed by police officers  
against citizens because most of the lawsuits have been taken up in 
small claims court, Crew said.

<HEADLINE> Snowmobiles Blamed in Park Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) -- Snowmobiles produce  
nearly all the air pollution in Yellowstone National Park, 
sometimes fouling the air twice as much as is found in parts of Los 
Angeles, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Park Service prepared the report, drawn from  
studies by several state and federal agencies and the University of 
Denver. It released portion Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Snowmobiles emit 100 times as much carbon monoxide and 300 times  
as much hydrocarbons as do automobiles, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	One winter's worth of emissions by snowmobiles amounts to 78  
percent of all carbon monoxide and 94 percent of all hydrocarbons 
released during the entire year in the nation's oldest national 
park, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being outnumbered by other vehicles by about 16 to 1,  
snowmobiles emit 3 percent of the park's annual nitrogen oxide 
emissions and 37 percent of the particulate matter emissions, the 
studies found. 
</P>
<P>
	For particulate matter, the federal limit is a concentrate of  
60. In February, the concentrations were as high as 122 at the 
park's west entrance. 
</P>
<P>
	``To put this in perspective, the maximum 24-hour particulate  
matter concentration in the Los Angeles suburb of Azusa in 1997 was 
68,'' the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	Several environmental groups last week called on the Park  
Service to end snowmobiling in the park. And officials from several 
counties around the park have called for expedited use of cleaner 
snowmobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Park Service says it is working toward reducing snowmobile  
emissions in Yellowstone and officials are working on a new 
winter-use plan for the park.

<HEADLINE> House Rejects School Voucher Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House rejected a voucher plan Thursday  
that could have given the families of poor children $3,500 each to 
attend private schools if their public schools were failing 
academically or deemed unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a push from GOP leaders, moderate Republicans crossed  
party lines to keep proposals for vouchers out of the $9.9 billion 
Title I program aimed at closing the achievement gap for 10.5 
million poor and otherwise disadvantaged children. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 358-67 vote, House members overwhelmingly approved the  
Title I bill. However, they dealt blows to two plans that would 
have given poor children under the program money for private 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am pleased that a solid bipartisan majority in the House  
voted to reject the false promise of vouchers,'' President Clinton 
said in a statement released by the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the House had taken an ``important step toward improving  
educational opportunities for the nation's most disadvantaged 
students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While he had some concerns about the bill, Clinton said he was  
encouraged it continued standards-based reform, expanded public 
school choice and held schools accountable for results. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall program -- the largest chunk of the $13.4 billion  
spent on federal programs for children in kindergarten through 12th 
grade -- was up for renewal this year. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate Republican-backed bill to free states from federal  
rules on education aid was narrowly passed along party lines, 
213-208. 
</P>
<P>
	Under pressure from moderates who voted for the measure in  
committee, House leaders limited it to 10 states in a pilot 
program, which would give states more freedom in complying with 
Title I and other federal school programs. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has pledged to veto the second bill -- the  
Academic Achievement for All Act, or ``Straight A's'' -- saying it 
would turn federal education programs into a lump sum that states 
could invest in children who are neither poor nor low-achieving. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has yet to take up debate on the programs, created in  
1965 as part of President Johnson's Great Society plan to address 
the needs of the nation's disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Title I -- last overhauled in 1994, when it became a high  
standards program, shifting from its remedial focus -- pays states 
to help local schools give poor children extra help such as books, 
teachers and computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, it had been criticized for not improving documented  
gaps in the test scores and academic performance between poor and 
better-off students. Conservatives, including GOP presidential 
front-runner George W. Bush, had said the program's funding should 
be given to parents to choose alternatives from tutors to private 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	That idea failed in two test votes on private schools in the  
second day of debate on the bill. Overriding the wishes of the 
House leadership, more than 50 Republicans sided with Democrats to 
reject the plan introduced by House Majority Leader Dick Armey, 
R-Texas, which would have given poor students private school 
vouchers for $3,500 if their public schools were failing 
academically or deemed unsafe. The vote was 257-166. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing in front of about 50 eighth-graders from Rogersville,  
Tenn., Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Education 
and the Workforce Committee, declared victory. He said he had long 
believed that education programs on the federal level weren't 
working. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we passed Title I and for the first time we are  
demanding accountability,''' said Goodling, who voted against the 
voucher plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the Armey bill, lawmakers defeated a plan to allow up to  
10 states to use federal funds for tuition at nonpublic schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the biggest problems that people have is the fact that  
these children will take their scholarship and sometimes go to 
parochial school,'' Armey told reporters. ``That bothers them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and anti-voucher groups cheered the move.  
</P>
<P>
	``The message seems to be penetrating over there,'' said Bob  
Chase, president of the National Education Association, the 
nation's largest teachers union, with 2.4 million members. ``The 
best way to raise student achievement is to make sure the Title I 
resources and support go to public education and not have it 
siphoned off for nonpublic education.'' ---- 
</P>
<P>
	The Title I bill is H.R. 2; the Straight A's bill is H.R.2300.

<HEADLINE> Gore: I Would Ban Offshore Drilling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Going a step beyond current policy, Vice  
President Al Gore pledged Thursday, if elected, to ban all new 
offshore oil drilling in federal waters off the coast of Florida 
and California. ``This coastline is too valuable to not take action 
now,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic presidential candidate also said he would fight  
to stop drilling in federal waters off of all states ``where the 
public clearly opposes it'' even if companies already have received 
offshore leases from the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will take the most sweeping steps in our history to protect  
our oceans and coastal waters from offshore oil drilling,'' Gore 
said in a statement. ``I will make sure that there is no new oil 
leasing off the coast of California and Florida.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A longtime environmentalist and author of ``Earth in the  
Balance,'' Gore said his plan would go further than current Clinton 
administration policy that permits limited new drilling in leased 
areas. Gore's plan would cover existing and future leases. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore issued the proposal amid a fight in California over the  
future of undeveloped leases in federal waters off the southern 
part of that key electoral state. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, owners of 36 leases who have yet to begin  
drilling still have the right to do so. But any new drilling is on 
hold until the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service 
finishes a $1.5 million feasibility study. The state also has 43 
active drilling sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign also plans a television ad in California  
promoting the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to protect our oceans and beaches, and if elected  
president I'll do that,'' Gore says in the ad. ``To be good 
stewards of our earth we must create a future worthy of our 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's proposal would go further to protect the environment than  
recent Clinton administration moves on offshore drilling. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, President Clinton signed an executive order extending  
until 2012 the existing ban on offshore oil drilling, which was to 
expire in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the ban protected virtually all of the North Atlantic  
and Pacific coasts, southwest Florida, New England, the 
Mid-Atlantic and southern Alaska, it did not stop existing rigs 
from drilling for oil. It also would have allowed additional rights 
to go up in southern California if oil companies acted on the 36 
``undeveloped'' leases. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, however, would extend the ban on offshore drilling, on  
current and future leases, to include all federal waters off of 
Florida and California. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies in both states already have spent billions of dollars  
to secure the rights to drill in the waters that Gore would place 
off limits, and his plan does not include reparations for companies 
that bought the leases. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not in the business of appeasing those companies,''  
said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane. ``We are in business of 
protecting our coasts and our waters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An industry spokesman said Gore's proposal would force companies  
to find new drilling sites overseas, which he argued would hurt the 
U.S. economy and increase dependence on imported oil and natural 
gas. 
</P>
<P>
	``To make such a ban really ignores the need for natural gas and  
oil to be produced domestically,'' said Mark Rubin of the American 
Petroleum Institute. ``The bottom line here is that because we are 
limited in our access to federal lands, the companies are forced to 
spend their exploration budgets overseas and this is going to 
simply further that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least one environmental group applauded the plan.  
</P>
<P>
	``These are two highly desirable places for complete  
protection,'' said Bruce Hamilton, national conservation director 
for the Sierra Club. ``It is great news to hear that a leader of 
his stature is taking a stand to protect both coasts.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Accused of Stalling Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats say informal negotiations with  
Republicans over a plan to put new restrictions on gun sales have 
reached an impasse, and it's time to put the issue to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	On the six-month anniversary of the Columbine High School  
shootings, Democrats accused Republicans of dragging their feet on 
legislation that make it harder for people with criminal records to 
buy guns at gun shows and harder for juveniles to get their hands 
on weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to bring this up. Vote it up. Vote it down. I don't  
know what everybody is scared of,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., 
said Wednesday ``But at least let's vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say informal negotiations continue, and it's the  
Democrats who have caused delay by not responding to their latest 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope that unprovoked political posturing would be held  
back so that we can bring this to fruition for American's 
children,'' House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., 
said. ``The task of assembling a coalition adequate to pass 
meaningful legislation is formidable, but worth trying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On April 20, two teen-age students, Eric Harris and Dylan  
Klebold, killed 12 youths and a teacher and wounded at least 23 
others before committing suicide at the Littleton, Colo., high 
school in the deadliest school shooting in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue in Congress are gun restrictions included in a Senate  
bill that toughens treatment of and penalties for juvenile 
offenders. A similar House measure does not contain gun 
restrictions, and lawmakers from both houses must meet to reconcile 
the differences between the two bills. 
</P>
<P>
	As proposals are passed back and forth between the two sides,  
agreement has been reached on some gun issues, but disagreement 
remains on perhaps the toughest ones, including how many gun 
sellers would constitute a gun show, said Rep. John Conyers, 
D-Mich., the highest ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Conyers said so far, Republicans proposals are not tight enough  
to prevent large numbers of people with criminal records from 
buying weapons at the shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end the loophole will have to be closed,'' Conyers  
said. ``They're hoping this issue will die down and go away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also complained no formal negotiating sessions have  
been held between the House and the Senate since the summer. It's 
pointless to deal informally with the gun issue piece by piece, 
Conyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``While children are being killed, gun safety legislation is  
dying a slow death of silence. The clock is ticking and this 
session of Congress is drawing to a close,'' Conyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans released their own statement on the Columbine  
shootings Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The survivors of the Columbine massacre should be assured that  
there are many in the United States Congress who continue to work -- 
on a daily basis -- toward the goal of achieving passage of a 
comprehensive youth violence bill,'' said a statement released by 
Hyde and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that those who cynically criticize the Congress  
remember that both the House and the Senate have passed legislation 
which we are working to reconcile. This is a difficult task given 
the emotions which surround so many of these issues.''

<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- MediaOne Group shareowners have approved  
the proposed merger with AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a key milestone in the process,'' said Chuck Lillis,  
chairman of MediaOne Group. He said the company hopes to close the 
merger early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	C. Michael Armstrong, AT&AMP;T chairman, said the merger is a vote  
of confidence in the company's strategy to provide millions of 
families with a choice in local phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	He said after the company gets regulatory approval, the merged  
company can move forward in broadband video, voice and data 
services to more communities. 
</P>
<P>
	MediaOne Group is one of the world's largest broadband  
communications companies. The company also has investments in 
foreign wireless communications. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Ozaki Shares Lead at Bridgestone  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHIBA, Japan (AP) -- Jumbo Ozaki shot a 6-under 66 Thursday and  
was in a three-way tied for the lead after the opening round of the 
$1.1 million Bridgestone Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Tied with Ozaki were Shigeki Maruyama and Ikuo Shirahama.  
</P>
<P>
	Ozaki, seeking his third victory this season and 112th of his  
career, had one eagle, five birdies and one bogey over the 
7,178-yard, par-72 Sodegaura Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	So did Maruyama, chasing his first title of the season and ninth  
overall. Shirahama, whose last victory came in this tournament in 
1993, had six birdies in a bogey-free round. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Nobuhito Sato shot a 71. Joe Ozaki, a member  
of the President Cup's International team, also fired a 71. Joe, 
the youngest of three Ozaki brothers on the Japan tour, has won 
four titles this season, including the Japan Open.

<HEADLINE> Viacom Earnings Rise 28 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Viacom Inc. posted a 28 percent increase in  
third-quarter profits Thursday, crediting strong results from its 
cable networks group, which includes MTV, VH1 and Nickelodeon. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom earned $110.9 million, or 16 cents a share, from  
continuing operations. Excluding a one-time restructuring charge 
related to the merger of Spelling Entertainment, Viacom earned 
$159.6 million, or 22 cents per share, handily beating Wall Street 
estimates of 16 cents a share. In the same period a year ago, 
Viacom earned $86 million, or 10 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Net earnings, which take into account other one-time factors and  
discontinued publishing and music operations, were $96.7 million in 
the July-September quarter, down from $123.4 million a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 1.3 percent to $3.33 billion from $3.29 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Viacom, which announced a blockbuster merger with CBS Corp. last  
month, said earnings were led by a 15 percent jump in revenues at 
its cable operations, which also include Showtime. Viacom said 
MTV's Video Music Awards show this year scored as the highest-rated 
entertainment show in cable history. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues at Viacom's entertainment division, which includes the  
Paramount movie studio and TV production operations, fell 11 
percent from last year, when the division got a huge boost from 
home video sales of ``Titanic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the studio did have several strong showings at the box  
office, including ``Runaway Bride,'' ``The General's Daughter'' and 
``Double Jeopardy.'' The division also makes a number of hit TV 
shows including ``Frasier,'' ``Star Trek: Voyager,'' ``Beverly 
Hills 90120'' and ``Judge Judy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom's Blockbuster video rental subsidiary posted a 13 percent  
increase in revenues. Viacom floated shares in Blockbuster in 
August and is expected to spin off the rest of the company by early 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Viacom earned $238.6  
million from continuing operations, or 33 cents a share. This 
compared with a loss of $133.3 million, or 25 cents a share, a year 
earlier when the company took a $424 million charge at Blockbuster 
as the company started up revenue-sharing agreements with Hollywood 
studios. 
</P>
<P>
	Net earnings came to $188.5 million in the first nine months  
this year, compared with a net loss of $185.9 million in the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month revenues rose 6.1 percent to $9.29 billion from $8.75  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom's other operations include the Simon &AMP; Schuster  
publishing house, theme parks and 19 television stations as well as 
half of the UPN television network and half of the Comedy Central 
cable network. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom shares rose 6 1/4 cents to $41.18 3/4 in trading on the  
American Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> German Utilities RWE, VEW To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- German utilities RWE and VEW plan to  
merge in a deal that will create the largest German power company 
and the third biggest in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	If the plans announced Thursday are approved by shareholders and  
regulators, the combined RWE-VEW entity would have almost 170,000 
employees and annual sales of $46 billion. The companies said the 
terms of the deal were still being negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
	German utilities have been under more and more pressure to  
consolidate to better compete in Europe's recently liberalized 
energy market. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said the combination would create the largest  
utility in Europe after two French utilities that are publicly run. 
</P>
<P>
	RWE lost its top spot among German utilities after Veba and Viag  
announced last month they would merge in a $14.6 billion deal. 
</P>
<P>
	VEW is the sixth-largest German power company, but is the  
largest gas distributor in the country. It acquired a controlling 
stake in Westfaelische Gasversorgung AG and Co. earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	RWE and VEW are competitors in their Ruhr Valley home in the  
industrial northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strategies of RWE and VEW completely complement each  
other,'' said Dietmar Kuhnt, chairman of RWE's board. 
``Particularly in the electricity and gas sectors can we completely 
utilize our cooperative strengths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	RWE is intent on becoming one of the leading power companies in  
Europe, and has set a goal of boosting its sales to $80 billion and 
capturing a 15 percent market share by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the merger of RWE and VEW could be difficult  
because more than 50 percent of VEW's shares are owned by municipal 
utilities, which may be loathe to give up their equity. 
</P>
<P>
	``A partnership between VEW and RWE would secure for us a top  
position in Europe in the areas of energy, water and environment,'' 
said VEW Chairman Gert Maichel.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates at Two-Month High / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages rose to 7.93 percent this week, the highest 
level in two months. 
</P>
<P>
	The average was up from 7.85 percent last week, according to a  
weekly survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage 
company. The average for this week is the highest since rates 
climbed to 8.15 percent in mid-August, the high for this year and a 
level last seen in April 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgages rates have been rising for most of the year. At the  
start of the year, 30-year mortgages averaged 6.79 percent and a 
year ago this week, they averaged 6.73 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 7.53 percent this week, up from the average of 7.45 
percent last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 6.30 percent this week, down slightly from 
6.31 percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages.

<HEADLINE> FCC To Increase Phone Subsidies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission today  
increased subsidies that help make phone service affordable for 
people in rural and expensive-to-serve areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The change is part of a broader effort to revamp the system in  
preparation for a day when there is widespread competition in the 
local phone market. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission ``is taking another step forward in reforming  
universal service for a more competitive era,'' said FCC Chairman 
Bill Kennard. ``Everybody acknowledges that as the markets change 
and as we get more competition, we will transition to a new 
model.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's action more than doubles the pot of money currently  
available in the program that goes to big telephone companies, such 
as the regional Bell companies and GTE, that serve rural customers 
and others living in high-cost areas. Those funds will now total 
$437 million but could eventually decrease. 
</P>
<P>
	Big phone companies now get $207 million in federal subsidies to  
help make local phone service affordable in high-cost areas in 19 
states. Of that, $130 million goes to the main phone company in 
Puerto Rico. Alabama and California are two big recipients among 
the states. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal subsidies are mostly paid by fees the FCC imposes on  
AT&AMP;T, MCI, Sprint and other long-distance companies, which pass 
them on to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest long-distance carrier, AT&AMP;T, anticipates  
that it will have to raise the monthly line-item fee that consumers 
see on their bill, called the Universal Service Connectivity 
Charge, because of the subsidy increase. 
</P>
<P>
	But spokesman AT&AMP;T Jim McGann said it too soon to determine how  
much the 99-cent charge will go up or when that will take effect. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC officials said no state would receive less federal subsidy  
than it does now in the short-term, but could not say how long such 
protection will last. The commission's decision also does not 
affect the $1.45 billion in federal subsidies that go to small 
phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Some large companies, like U S West which provides phone service  
to 3.3 million rural and high-cost customers, will be watching the 
FCC action carefully to make sure the states they cover get enough 
of the pot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Universal service is very important to maintaining affordable  
basic phone service, which for many people is their only link to 
the Internet,'' said U S West spokesman David Fish. ``A lot of 
Westerners are crossing their fingers that the FCC won't decide the 
information highway ends at the Mississippi River.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's action is only one part of a broader effort to revamp  
the system. Yet to be addressed are the subsidies built into 
so-called ``access'' fees that local phone companies charge 
long-distance carriers to connect calls. 
</P>
<P>
	A coalition of major telecommunication carriers estimates that  
$650 million of these fees also go toward making local phone 
service affordable. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 telecommunications law sought to make such subsidies  
explicit, rather than having them hidden in other charges. The 
industry coalition -- which includes long-distance companies AT&AMP;T 
and Sprint and major local phone companies Bell Atlantic, 
BellSouth, GTE and SBC -- has offered the FCC a proposal on how to 
accomplish this task. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard expects reform on this front in the early part of 2000.  
</P>
<P>
	Gene Kimmelman, co-director of Consumers Union, says the FCC  
needs to reduce the access fees that long-distance companies pay 
local companies, and make sure customers reap the benefits with 
lower rates, to offset the increases in the subsidies.

<HEADLINE> NBA Resumes Drug Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Drug testing in the NBA was suspended for six  
days after the identities of two players who tested positive for 
marijuana were disclosed to a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	The testing resumed Wednesday, and all players will have been  
subjected to urinalysis by next week. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first season in which NBA players are being tested  
for marijuana and steroids. Veterans can only be tested once, 
unless they produce a positive sample. Rookies are tested 
throughout the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The players' union sent a letter to all players in September  
urging anyone who smoked marijuana to come forward and seek 
treatment if they feared they would produce a dirty sample. 
</P>
<P>
	A first-time offender must undergo mandatory counseling, and a  
second positive test would include a $15,000 fine. Subsequent 
positive tests would result in five-game suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They let us know about it, so it shouldn't be a problem,''  
Knicks forward John Wallace said. ``It's just a matter of doing 
what you've got to do to make sure that when the time comes you're 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The identities of two players who tested positive were revealed  
to The New York Times, although the newspaper did not name them. 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure clearly caused friction between the union and the  
league. The information is considered highly sensitive, and both 
sides were suspicious that the other had leaked the names. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the players themselves did not know they had tested  
positive until a reporter from The Times alerted them. The drug 
agreement says players who test positive will not be told so until 
all the testing is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times report also said that six players had tested positive  
for marijuana during the first week of testing, which began in 
early October. Teams are not notified in advance of the date of 
their tests, and players have typically arrived at practice to find 
representatives from the league and union waiting for them to 
produce urine samples. 
</P>
<P>
	``The press asked for it, the commissioner asked for it, we used  
it during the (collective) bargaining session to get something we 
wanted,'' union president Patrick Ewing said earlier this month. 
``We gave it up, that's it. No sense crying about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Houston of the Knicks welcomed the policy, saying it  
seemed overdue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just disappointed that it is treated so lightly in  
general, not just in our league,'' Houston said, referring to 
marijuana. ``That's the problem, it's not a problem of testing. 
You'd think it wouldn't be a problem because we are professional 
athletes, but the problem is that it's glorified in some areas of 
our culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember when I was in high school, I looked at that as  
crack. But now, it's like a cigarette, and I think that's why it 
has become what it is in our league,'' Houston said.

<HEADLINE> Els Trying To Get Back in the Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Winning at Disney World in his  
first appearance won't make Ernie Els feel any better about his 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Victories in either Houston next week for the Tour Championship  
or in Spain for the season-ending Stroke Play Championship would be 
nice, especially since the $1 million first-place prize would put 
him in the top 10 on the money list for only the second time in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	But Els wants much more than that, and the Big Easy has been  
having a hard time getting back to the level he feels he should be. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hasn't been a very spectacular year on the course,'' Els  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others in the field for the National Car Rental Classic, which  
began today on Disney's Magnolia and Palm courses, would love to 
have such an unspectacular year. 
</P>
<P>
	Els doesn't have to worry about getting into the top 30 on the  
money list to qualify for the Tour Championship, a challenge facing 
players like Jesper Parnevik, Steve Elkington and Stewart Cink this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old South African won in Los Angeles in February,  
his sixth straight year with at least one victory, the longest 
active streak on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	But Els measures himself by major championships, and this year  
he hasn't come close to measuring up to his goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I've played this bad in the majors since I've  
been out here,'' Els said. ``It wasn't a lot of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Els has finished in the top five in at least one major  
every year since he started playing them on a regular basis in 
1992. But he hasn't recorded one since winning his second U.S. Open 
victory in 1997 at Congressional. 
</P>
<P>
	He tied for 27th in the Masters, closing with an 80 on Sunday.  
He missed the cut in the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship, and 
was never a factor in Carnoustie when he tied for 24th in the 
British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	What gives?  
</P>
<P>
	Part of it was what happened off the golf course, which turned  
an average season into a wonderful change in lifestyle. Els' first 
child, Samantha, was born May 26 in England. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably my focus has been more away from golf than I wanted  
it to be,'' he said. ``But it's been more important matters in 
life. I mean, having a baby has been quite an adaptation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The best illustration of that was last week, when the Els clan  
returned from two weeks in Britain for the Dunhill Cup and the 
World Match Play Championship. Els and his wife, Liezl, have 
traveled around the world since 1992 with ease. 
</P>
<P>
	``We used to get on the airplane and just conk out,'' he said.  
``Now, it's a different story. We came back from London. It's a 
nine-hour flight, and I think I was on my feet for about six hours. 
It's a huge change. But it's the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Els now wants the best of both worlds.  
</P>
<P>
	``I offer no excuses for the future,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Els is among a strong field at Disney that features four of the  
top five on the money list (only David Duval is missing) and 27 of 
the top 40. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the next major is six months away, Els is working to  
get his game in shape now. He has slipped to No. 9 in the world 
ranking and wants to prove again that he is in the same class as 
Tiger Woods and Duval, two players he defeated down the stretch to 
win in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need to play because I have not been in great form lately,''  
he said. ``I'm trying to get the edges all smoothed out, and then 
obviously I'll go to the offseason and start thinking about next 
year -- what I want to achieve, and how I'm going to come back and 
get to that level where I've been. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll go back to the drawing board.''  
</P>
<P>
	He also will return to his old travel ways, even if that means  
walking the aisles of a jumbo jet with a baby girl in his arms. 
</P>
<P>
	Els has taken substantial time off this year with no success. He  
came back from one break and finished 80th in Paris. He took 
another break and was disqualified in Germany for not finishing his 
round when he would have missed the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with increasing his PGA Tour to at least 20 tournaments,  
he plans to keep a full schedule in Europe and early in the year in 
South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good when I play a lot,'' he said. ``I didn't play a  
lot last year because of a back problem, and this year was slow 
with Samantha. Next year, I'll give it a full go again, travel a 
little bit like the old days and see how it goes.''

<HEADLINE> Rose To Be on Field for Game 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Despite his lifetime ban from baseball, Pete Rose  
is scheduled to be on the field before Game 2 of the World Series 
on Sunday as part of baseball's All-Century team. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans voted for the century's top 25 players, including nine  
outfielders, and Rose was consistently ninth in the voting, which 
ran from July 13-Sept. 19. His election was confirmed Wednesday by 
a baseball official familiar with the final vote totals, speaking 
on the condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig decided in August that Rose  
could participate in the All-Century team if he was elected. Rose, 
however, was not invited to a luncheon prior to the All-Star game 
that honored the living members among the 100 on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, then manager of the Cincinnati Reds, agreed on Aug. 23,  
1989 to a lifetime ban from baseball following an investigation 
into his gambling, a deal announced the following day by 
commissioner Al Bartlett Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's career hits leader applied for reinstatement in  
September 1997. While Selig hasn't formally ruled on the 
application, he's made clear numerous times that he has no 
intention of lifting the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Century team, which includes five people overlooked by  
fans and added by a special panel, will be announced Saturday and 
honored the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	As long as he's banned, Rose is ineligible for the Hall of Fame.  
No person ever permanently banned has ever been reinstated.

<HEADLINE> Leafs Sign Khristich to 4-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- After the signing of former Boston forward Dmitri  
Khristich to a $10 million, four-year deal, the Toronto Maple Leafs 
released popular Steve Sullivan on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Khristich, 30, lands with his fourth NHL club after a  
well-publicized contract battle with the Bruins, for whom he scored 
29 goals last season. Boston GM Harry Sinden refused to pay the 
$2.8 million the Ukrainian forward was awarded by an arbitrator in 
August, making Khristich a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins retained matching rights if any club signed him for  
80 percent or less of the $2.8 million. The Leafs sent Boston a 
second-round draft pick in 2000 for his rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Khristich will get $850,000 this season, $2.5 million for each  
of the second and third years, and $2.75 million for a fourth year, 
at the club's option. He'll also receive signing bonuses of 
$750,000 and $700,000 to be paid over the next two years, plus 
$300,000 if a fourth year kicks in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to getting back in the NHL,'' said  
Khristich, who has been working out with a team in Kiev. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan was being used sparingly, had no points, and his 155  
pounds didn't suit GM-coach Pat Quinn's intention of making the 
Leafs bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, I'll get picked up and start fresh somewhere  
else,'' Sullivan said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinden contended Khristich disappeared during last year's  
playoffs. But Quinn didn't heed that criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was that out there,'' Quinn said of the player's  
reputation. ``But that has been, in my opinion, a bad tag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to sign Khristich intensified after captain Mats Sundin  
suffered a broken bone in his right ankle Oct. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team's scouting reports, even long before I got here, are  
solid on this guy. He looks to me like the kind of guy who can play 
a two-way game pretty well,'' Quinn said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Chemical Profits Up 2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) -- Dow Chemical Co. reported a 2 percent rise  
in earnings for the third quarter, the first year-over-year 
increase since the second quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow said Thursday it earned $320 million, or $1.44 per share, up  
from $314 million, or $1.40 a share, in the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat Wall Street's expectations. A survey of  
analysts by First Call/Thomson Financial predicted earnings of 
$1.32 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow reported sales of $4.7 billion, up 9 percent from $4.31  
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's higher earnings came despite a 30 percent spike in  
feedstock and energy costs from the same period a year ago, 
executive vice president and chief financial officer J. Pedro 
Reinhard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased with the quarter's results, which again  
demonstrate Dow's resilience based on our global business 
leadership positions and low-cost structure,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's two-year slide in profits has been blamed on drops  
in demand for chemicals, metals and plastics in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-quarter earnings before interest and income taxes were  
$584 million, compared with $540 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Dow Chemical's net  
earnings were $1.06 billion, or $4.74 per share, down from $1.16 
billion, or $5.10 per share, in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales totaled $13.73 billion, down from $14 billion.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Sink on IBM Y2K Warning / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plunged today following IBM's dour  
warning that worries about the Year 2000 computer bug are hurting 
hardware sales and may cut into profits. 
</P>
<P>
	With an hour remaining in Wall Street trading, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was down 194.08 at 10,198.28, recovering some 
ground after an earlier drop of 210 points. IBM accounted for about 
110 points of the decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 22.58 at 1,266.85, and the Nasdaq composite 
index was down 33.01 at 2,755.12. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders attributed the broad market's fall almost entirely to  
pessimism following IBM's disappointing forecast. The company said 
after the close of trading Wednesday that potential buyers of IBM's 
network and database servers are postponing purchases until after 
the start of the new year, when concerns over Year 2000 computer 
bugs are fully resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from IBM's network and database business dropped 40  
percent in the third quarter, and the weakness is expected to 
continue through the fourth quarter and into January, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of IBM plummeted 16 11/16 to 90 5/16 on the New York  
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's news robbed the market of the ebullience that drove the  
Dow 187.43 points higher, and the Nasdaq 99.95 points higher, on 
Wednesday. That rally was sparked nearly entirely by Microsoft, 
which released earnings that soundly beat expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft officials attributed the company's strong earnings and  
sales to ``awesome'' demand for personal computers, sparking a 
day-long rally in technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as it was all about Microsoft yesterday, it's all about  
IBM today,'' said Larry Wachtel, a market analyst with Prudential 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's decline set off a slide in a wide range of technology  
stocks. Sun Microsystems, a maker of computer servers, fell 5 5/16 
to 91. Computer Associates, a major maker of software used to run 
computer systems, lost 4 5/16 to 53 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a long food chain involved with IBM, and they're all  
down because of IBM's problems,'' Wachtel said. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online provided a notable exception to the technology  
slump. AOL rose 4 7/16 to 122 7/16 after announcing late Wednesday 
that earnings in its fiscal first quarter tripled from the same 
period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL also announced a deal to have its Internet software loaded  
onto computers sold by Gateway, the country's largest direct seller 
of consumer PCs. AOL will invest $800 million over two years in 
Gateway, which rose 8 5/16 to 60 5/16 today. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco stocks fell after an appeals court ruled Wednesday that  
a lump-sum payment may be awarded to plaintiffs in a landmark suit 
against the major tobacco companies. Lawyers for cigarette makers 
say the payment could cripple the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris, another Dow component, lost 3 15/16 to 23 1/16.  
</P>
<P>
	Also today, the Labor Department reported that 298,000 Americans  
filed new jobless claims for the week ending Oct. 16, up 9,000 from 
the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the increase, the number of newly laid off workers  
remains at historically low levels, stoking fears that the Federal 
Reserve will raise interest rates later this year in its effort to 
cool the economy. Economists say tight labor markets could lead to 
rising wage demands and higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers today by a 2-to-1 margin  
on the NYSE, where volume came to 776.64 million shares, well ahead 
of Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.24 to 411.70.

<HEADLINE> FCC Eyes Smart Traffic System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Futuristic electronic transportation systems --  
like radios that warn drivers of danger at an intersection or 
railroad crossing -- will have space to grow, thanks to action 
Thursday by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission set aside room on the  
radio spectrum for such short-range communication systems that are 
designed to alleviate traffic congestion and improve road safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers already can see at least one practical application of  
this technology: automatic toll booths in which cars passing 
through have their fare deducted from an electronic tag. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation officials and industry groups say this is just  
the beginning for uses of short-range communications between 
vehicles and roadside equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Intelligent Transportation Society of America, a  
nonprofit group created at the request of Congress in 1991, asked 
the FCC to set aside part of the spectrum so companies and public 
officials could develop more applications. Consumers could begin 
benefiting in the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really is a bridge to the future,'' said John Collins,  
president of the society. The group includes companies such as 
Motorola Inc. and Microsoft Corp., state transportation officials 
and trade associations. ``There are applications we can't even 
dream about out there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Collins said the current electronic toll passes  
eventually could function as ``wireless credit cards.'' Parking lot 
charges, gas fill-ups or even fast food from drive-thrus could all 
be billed to the same card. 
</P>
<P>
	The Transportation Department was authorized by Congress to  
develop a program for intelligent transportation systems in 1991. 
Already some of this technology is being used, such as fiber optic 
communication systems that can monitor traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
	The airwaves space from the FCC will make it possible to develop  
more short-range systems in the next few years, said Bill Jones, 
technical director of the Transportation Department's Intelligent 
Transportation System joint program office. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC decided to use the frequency range of 5.850 to 5.925 GHz  
for these communications systems and did not have to take away 
space from any other operations. Instead, the new applications will 
share space with satellite communications systems and military 
radars that already use the spectrum. Tests indicated that these 
systems could coexist, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	One application could enable ambulances approaching a stoplight  
to change it to green or prolong the green rather than having to 
run through a red light. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones envisions this happening in the next two to four years.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question the technology is here to do it,'' Jones  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states have installed ice detectors in bridges to alert  
crews if the spans freeze. These same detectors could send out a 
short-range signal to oncoming vehicles. The car's radio receiver 
then could get the signal and alert the driver with an audio 
message. 
</P>
<P>
	Other services under development include a collision avoidance  
system that warns drivers of dangers when approaching an 
intersection or railroad crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole idea is that we can have problems on the highway  
that can be communicated to people inside their cars,'' Collins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Automobile manufacturers are developing cars with capabilities  
to receive these communications. Jones said the Intelligent 
Transportation System program is developing standards for this 
technology so one device installed in a car could be used for a 
number of purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC said it would consider the licensing rules to govern  
these services at a later time.

<HEADLINE> Penn Health System To Cut 1,700 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The financially-ailing University of  
Pennsylvania Health System will eliminate 1,700 positions by June -- 
975 of them by Nov. 1 -- in the latest phase of a comprehensive 
``financial recovery plan'' released on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the plan is designed to boost profits by about  
$250 million over three years for the system, which reported an 
operating loss of $198 million for the latest fiscal year. That 
included severance costs from the first round of layoffs in May, 
when 1,100 jobs were eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	According to broadcast reports and a release on the health  
system's Web site, the employees to be let go on Nov. 1 will be 
from the Health System's corporate staff, as well as its 
Philadelphia-area hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The third phase will take place before June 30 and cover  
positions from other areas including the primary-care network, 
physician-practice plan, multispecialty facilities and home-care 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The health system had indicated in September that more job cuts  
would be forthcoming, but did not indicate how many. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the restructuring is complete, UPHS will have eliminated  
close to 2,800 positions, or 20 percent of its health services work 
force, since last May. All affected employees will receive thirty 
days notice, and eligible staff will receive pay and 
benefits-continuation based on years of service as well as 
outplacement assistance, the health system said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Academic medical centers across the nation have sustained  
significant losses over the past two years, as have we,'' said Dr. 
William N. Kelley, chief executive officer of the health system and 
dean of the medical school. ``We continue to face formidable 
challenges presented by a number of external factors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the health system said it lost $90 million in 1998,  
even after borrowing $123 million in services from the University 
of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley blamed the system's situation on lower Medicare and  
Medicaid reimbursements, reduced payments from insurance companies 
and rising costs of healthcare technology and pharmaceuticals.

<HEADLINE> GOP Ignores Veto Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans shoved a $14.5 billion bill for  
federal land and culture programs through Congress on Thursday, the 
second straight day they pushed spending legislation despite a 
presidential veto threat. 
</P>
<P>
	The House-Senate compromise, which passed by the House by  
225-200 and the Senate by voice vote, encapsulated the GOP's 
strategy of mixing confrontation with cooperation. It added 
hundreds of millions of dollars to earlier versions and even 
restored a program Republicans boasted about killing in 1995. But 
it has provisions for mining, ranching and oil interests the White 
House says would hurt the environment, and less than President 
Clinton wants for buying park lands. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hoped to send the 13th and final spending bill for  
fiscal 2000 as early as Friday, providing more than $310 billion 
for health, education and labor programs. It is among five bills 
facing veto threats that Republicans have sent Clinton anyway, 
hoping to show that Congress has completed its budget business -- 
without using Social Security surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've laid out what our positions are,'' said House Speaker  
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ``The message is, talk to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats complained that the GOP drive to keep passing bills  
would only slow budget talks between White House officials and top 
lawmakers over unfinished spending measures for fiscal 2000, which 
began Oct. 1. Wary of being left without enough money for its own 
priorities, the administration wants all remaining bills considered 
together, not piece by piece. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to make progress as long as they're in that  
mindset, because that's just not the way the world works,'' said 
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials and leading lawmakers held no bargaining  
sessions Thursday, a day after a blowup over GOP leaders' comments 
accusing Clinton of wanting to spend Social Security dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the positioning, Clinton signed a stopgap bill letting  
agencies continue operating through Oct. 29. The first such 
temporary extension expired Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep their spending bills from eating into Social Security  
surpluses -- the GOP's primary budget goal of the year -- Republican 
leaders were making final decisions on the roughly $5 billion in 
savings they will need. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of it -- about $4.3 billion -- will come from an  
across-the-board cut in all 13 spending bills, said one Republican 
speaking on condition of anonymity. Republicans say such a 
reduction would be barely felt, which Democrats contest. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said remaining savings  
would likely come from delaying some grants to the Centers for 
Disease Control and other agencies. Postponing those payments from 
September 2000 into the next month would count as fiscal 2000 
savings because the spending would not occur until fiscal 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The lands bill debated in the House on Thursday represented a  
risk for GOP leaders. It faced near-solid Democratic opposition. 
Also GOP moderates were unhappy with the oil and mining provisions 
and conservatives were upset over spending increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise bill was $200 million higher than 1999 levels,  
and $600 million above the version the House approved in July, and 
was filled with projects for lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Included was $68 million for a financially ailing fund that  
finances health care for more than 60,000 retired mine workers; the 
provision was won by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. A second item, $22 
million to help Alaskan communities where lumber plants are 
closing, was promoted by Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	Added in late negotiations was $40 million to buy the  
95,000-acre Baca ranch in New Mexico, a purchase supported by the 
administration and New Mexico's congressional delegation, and $30 
million for a historic preservation fund favored by first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	It also restored $2 million for an urban parks and recreation  
fund Republicans touted in 1995 among the programs they eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Congress sent Clinton a $39 billion measure  
financing the departments of Commerce, Justice and State. Because 
it provides little of the money Clinton wants for hiring local 
police officers, Clinton on Thursday renewed his veto threat, 
saying it ``doesn't have the right priorities.''

<HEADLINE> Jonathan Winters Gets Humor Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- He's worn a dress, hatched from a giant egg  
and changed the face of American comedy with nonstop improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
	Now funny-man Jonathan Winters is wondering how to handle his  
latest achievement --receiving a bust of Mark Twain as an award for 
his contribution to American humor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought the head would be bigger,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Winters accepted the award Wednesday night at the John F.  
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts after being honored by 
performances from fellow comedians. 
</P>
<P>
	Winters ``once parked in a handicap parking space and a woman  
said, 'Hey, you're not handicapped,' and he replied, 'Madam, can 
you see inside my mind?''' comedian Robin Williams recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	Having broken out of a massive egg shell on the 1970s television  
series ``Mork and Mindy,'' Winters went on to play Williams' 
full-grown, extraterrestrial child. 
</P>
<P>
	During production of the show, Winters would often digress into  
hour-long sessions of improvisation, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had to leave an extra forty-five minutes for him to get  
from his car to the set because he'll perform for anybody,'' 
Williams said before the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow comics including Steve Allen, Sid Caesar and Richard  
Belzer took turns providing the entertainment as Winters became the 
second winner of the Kennedy Center's Mark Twain prize for American 
humor. Richard Pryor received last year's award. 
</P>
<P>
	Winters, 73, entered the comedy scene in the 1950s and  
introduced a rapid-fire, stream-of-conciousness humor that 
influenced generations of comedians. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the most unique, transformative, revelatory figure of  
all of comedy,'' Belzer said before the event. ``When I first saw 
him on television I was astounded how he didn't tell conventional 
jokes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Comic Eugene Levy, who recently starred in the movie ``American  
Pie,'' said Winters was ``a god to me, a comic icon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt there would have been an 'SCTV,' a 'Saturday Night  
Live' or an 'In Living Color' without Jonathan Winters,'' Levy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, who had Winters as a frequent guest on the original  
``Tonight Show,'' called him a compulsive comedian who couldn't 
help but make people laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	The best way to handle him was to ``turn him on and let him  
go,'' Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribute, which cable network Comedy Central will televise in  
January, featured clips from Winters' early days on the ``Jack Paar 
Show'' and his role in the film ``It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad 
World.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winters once impersonated an old lady selling garbage bags, and  
has had many characters obsessed with eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	With such an endless supply of bizarre personalities, Williams  
said Winters should run for president. 
</P>
<P>
	``He isn't just everyman, he literally is every man,'' Williams  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Winters joked he could be a candidate, calling himself ``the  
only threat to Warren Beatty.''

<HEADLINE> Modell Wants Partner for $150M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Baltimore Ravens owner Art Modell is seeking  
one or more partners to buy a minority share of the team and wants 
at least $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Modell is seeking a partner so he can pay off loans and  
strengthen the team's financial position. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens have made all required loan payments, but fell into  
technical default on some promissory notes this year. The NFL 
hastily arranged for a one-year loan of up to $85 million, which 
comes due in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The league has asked the Ravens to have a new partner on board  
by early next year. If one can't be found, the league would have 
time to find a buyer for the entire franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Modell said Wednesday documents with a potential partner are in  
the final stages of preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The response has been very good,'' said Modell, who in 1961  
paid $3.9 million for the franchise. He said he hopes to have a 
deal completed by March. 
</P>
<P>
	In correspondence with potential investors, the franchise is  
valued at between $450 million and $550 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Modell is hoping to retain control of the team and eventually  
will it to his sons. He moved the Browns from Cleveland and renamed 
them the Ravens after the 1995 season.

<HEADLINE> Stihl Recalls Weed Cutter, Augurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stihl Inc. is recalling about 7,200 weed  
trimmers and hundreds of brush cutters and augers because of 
concerns about fuel leaks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Safety Product Commission said Wednesday that fuel  
can leak from an unsealed seam in the fuel tank, posing a fire 
hazard. The recall includes 192 brush cutters and 244 augers sold 
by the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled trimmers have model numbers FS 120 and FS 200, and  
were sold with bicycle- or loop-type handles. The model of the 
cutters is FS 350. The augers have model number BT 120C and are 
used to drill holes in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The model numbers are located on the top of the engines'  
shrouds. The serial numbers are stamped into the crank case base. 
</P>
<P>
	Stihl dealers sold the brush cutters, weed trimmers and augers  
from November 1998 through September. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all serial numbers of the models are included in the recall.  
The commission recommends customers stop using the tools 
immediately and call Stihl at 800-467-8445 to determine if their 
tool is part of the recall. Recalled tools can be returned to a 
Stihl dealer for a new fuel tank.

<HEADLINE> Warrick's Future Remains Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Peter Warrick's football future  
remained on hold Thursday, diminishing the chances of the Florida 
State star being back on the field Saturday at Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
	For a second straight day, Warrick received a court postponement  
on a plea agreement in connection with a department store scam that 
would reduce a felony grand theft charge to a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick's lawyer, John Kenney, is hoping to get the receiver  
back on the playing field and resolve a plea agreement under terms 
satisfactory to the university president. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I enter a plea that is acceptable to the court and is  
acceptable to the state attorney's office, but won't help him get 
back on the field, it's not going to make Peter Warrick very 
happy,'' lawyer John Kenny said Thursday. ``So I've got to try to 
work between the state attorney's office and the university. And 
right now I don't have that set in concrete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick and former teammate Laveranues Coles were charged with  
buying more than $400 of designer clothes Sept. 29 for $21.40 from 
a 19-year-old store clerk, who is also charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The clerk, Rachel Myrtil, pleaded no contest Thursday to grand  
theft and was sentenced to two years' probation, 10 days on a 
county work program, ordered to pay $308 in court costs and stay 
out of Dillard's department stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, who was kicked off the Florida State team, has not  
resolved his legal situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick's playing future now depends on Florida State president  
Sandy D'Alemberte, who is out of town and left the case with his 
general counsel, Alan Sundberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny said he has spoken with Sundberg and is ``trying to nail  
down exactly what they find acceptable in terms and conditions that 
will allow him to play again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to ... try to find out what exactly, what terms  
would be acceptable to him and to Sandy D'Alemberte,'' Kenny said. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick is to return to court Nov. 4, but the judge said the  
parties can return sooner if they come to an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating for everybody,'' Kenny said. ``I need to go  
talk to Peter right now, I need to meet with the university ... and 
try to make sure that I can salvage something out of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, a favorite for the Heisman Trophy before his arrest,  
has practiced all week and can continue to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State coach Bobby Bowden, who goes after his 300th  
career victory Saturday at Clemson, hopes Warrick can play in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping and praying he will be able to,'' said Bowden, who  
will have to get the momentous win against his son, Tommy.

<HEADLINE> Team of the '90s: Braves?, Yankees? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- No need to ask John Schuerholz. Just look at the  
only piece of jewelry the Atlanta Braves general manager is 
wearing. 
</P>
<P>
	There it is, engraved on the gold band he proudly displays on  
his left ring finger: ``Team of the 90s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way he sees it, there's not a debate on baseball's team of  
the decade. To him, the Braves already own that title, even if the 
New York Yankees take home the next World Series trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``To answer that question for the 1,442nd time, we don't need to  
do anything,'' Schuerholz said. ``We've won more games than any 
team, we've won 100 games three years in a row, we've won eight 
straight division titles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you choose any criteria except one narrow criteria -- World  
Series championships -- we lead it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To the Yankees, though, that's not such a narrow category.  
</P>
<P>
	``Aren't we the team of the century?'' New York GM Brian Cashman  
said Wednesday. ``World championships, that's the goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fittingly, the clubs that had the majors' two worst records in  
1990 get a final chance to make their cases starting with Game 1 
Saturday night at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, MVP of the AL Championship  
Series, will start for the Yankees against Tom Glavine in the 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
	David Cone will pitch Game 2 for the Yankees, followed by Andy  
Pettitte and Roger Clemens. After Glavine, it will be Greg Maddux, 
Kevin Millwood and John Smoltz for the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	For Atlanta, it's an opportunity to win that elusive second  
World Series title. The Braves beat Cleveland in 1995 -- prompting 
them to put that boast on their rings -- but have nothing else to 
show for eight straight trips to the NL Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Yankees, it's a chance to win their record 25th title  
and third in four years. That recent run began when they beat 
Atlanta in six games in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got another shot at them,'' Atlanta third baseman  
Chipper Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves earned their fifth trip to the World Series in the  
1990s by beating the New York Mets 10-9 in 11 innings Tuesday night 
in Game 6 of the NLCS. The Yankees beat Boston in five games in the 
ALCS. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta took a day off Wednesday while New York's practice at  
Yankee Stadium was rained out. That gave extra time for the Yankees 
to talk about -- or turn down -- debate about the top team in the 
last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players don't worry about it,'' catcher Joe Girardi said.  
``There are a lot of different players on both teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	True, a lot has changed for the Yankees since 1990, when they  
went 67-95 with a starting lineup that included Oscar Azocar, Steve 
Balboni and Bob Geren, plus a rotation that had Tim Leary, Chuck 
Cary and Andy Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves were even worse that season at 65-97. That was the  
year they traded Dale Murphy and could only hope that young Glavine 
and Smoltz would blossom. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Atlanta is a major league-best 925-629 in  
regular-season games during the decade and the Yankees are next at 
851-702. Oh, their interleague record against each other? 
Appropriately, 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves have won titles in the West and East in the 1990s and  
became the first NL franchise to reach five World Series since the 
Dodgers in the '50s. The Yankees have gone to the playoffs for five 
straight years, their best stretch since going to the World Series 
from 1960-1964. 
</P>
<P>
	And now, with no slight intended to Toronto for its  
championships in 1992-93, it's all come down the Braves and 
Yankees. At stake, a trophy and a title -- Team of the Decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we win another World Series,'' Schuerholz said. ``At  
least it would put an end to that question.''

<HEADLINE> Attorney: Bartender Was Raped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Police are investigating a woman's claims  
that she was raped by more than one person at a police social club 
operated by retired law enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, a bartender at the club, was assaulted early on Sept.  
25, said her attorney, Steven Holden. He would not identify her 
alleged attackers but said they could be Oklahoma City police 
officers or others who were in the Glitter Dome at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The same people who raped her are the very people who are  
supposed to be protecting her,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A police spokesman, Capt. Charles Allen, declined to comment on  
Holden's statements but said the investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sex crimes investigation right now,'' Allen said. ``And  
we're good at doing those, whether it involves us or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the night of the alleged attack, Oklahoma City Police Capt.  
Bill Martin called 911 and reported that the woman was nude, drunk 
and ``going crazy'' in the club. Holden said she was not drunk. 
</P>
<P>
	A police report said that when she was questioned, the woman  
denied being involved in any sexual activity. Three days later, 
police said, she said she had been undressed against her will but 
did not believe she had been sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said she did not make the assault allegation until she  
was interviewed one more time.

<HEADLINE> Gore: I Would Ban Offshore Drilling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Going a step beyond current policy, Vice  
President Al Gore pledged Thursday, if elected, to ban all new 
offshore oil drilling in federal waters off the coast of Florida 
and California. ``This coastline is too valuable to not take action 
now,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic presidential candidate also said he would fight  
to stop drilling in federal waters off of all states ``where the 
public clearly opposes it'' even if companies already have received 
offshore leases from the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me this issue is not only an economic issue and a health  
issue,'' Gore said in a speech at Seacoast Science Center at 
Odiorne State Park in Rye, N.H. ``It's is also a moral issue. I 
think we have an obligation to do right by the environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A longtime environmentalist and author of ``Earth in the  
Balance,'' Gore said his plan would go further than current Clinton 
administration policy that permits limited new drilling in leased 
areas. Gore's plan would cover existing and future leases. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore issued the proposal amid a fight in California over the  
future of undeveloped leases in federal waters off the southern 
part of that key electoral state. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, owners of 36 leases who have yet to begin  
drilling still have the right to do so. But any new drilling is on 
hold until the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service 
finishes a $1.5 million feasibility study. The state also has 43 
active drilling sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign also plans a television ad in California  
promoting the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to protect our oceans and beaches, and if elected  
president I'll do that,'' Gore says in the ad. ``To be good 
stewards of our earth we must create a future worthy of our 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's proposal would go further to protect the environment than  
recent Clinton administration moves on offshore drilling. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, President Clinton signed an executive order extending  
until 2012 the existing ban on offshore oil drilling, which was to 
expire in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the ban protected virtually all of the North Atlantic  
and Pacific coasts, southwest Florida, New England, the 
Mid-Atlantic and southern Alaska, it did not stop existing rigs 
from drilling for oil. It also would have allowed additional rights 
to go up in southern California if oil companies acted on the 36 
``undeveloped'' leases. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, however, would extend the ban on offshore drilling, on  
current and future leases, to include all federal waters off of 
Florida and California. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies in both states already have spent billions of dollars  
to secure the rights to drill in the waters that Gore would place 
off limits, and his plan does not include reparations for companies 
that bought the leases. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not in the business of appeasing those companies,''  
said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane. ``We are in business of 
protecting our coasts and our waters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An industry spokesman said Gore's proposal would force companies  
to find new drilling sites overseas, which he argued would hurt the 
U.S. economy and increase dependence on imported oil and natural 
gas. 
</P>
<P>
	``To make such a ban really ignores the need for natural gas and  
oil to be produced domestically,'' said Mark Rubin of the American 
Petroleum Institute. ``The bottom line here is that because we are 
limited in our access to federal lands, the companies are forced to 
spend their exploration budgets overseas and this is going to 
simply further that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least one environmental group applauded the plan.  
</P>
<P>
	``These are two highly desirable places for complete  
protection,'' said Bruce Hamilton, national conservation director 
for the Sierra Club. ``It is great news to hear that a leader of 
his stature is taking a stand to protect both coasts.''

<HEADLINE> Raytheon Loses $169M in Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Mass. (AP) -- Raytheon Co. lost $169 million during  
the third quarter, largely because of heavy write-downs and 
restructuring charges in its electronics business. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense contractor said Thursday the loss was equal to 50  
cents per share. The results compared with $11 million in net 
income in the third quarter of 1998, or 3 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The company did not provide figures for its operating earnings,  
which exclude one-time charges. But a company official said 
Raytheon's earnings from operations were 59 cents per share, above 
the expectations of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson 
Financial who predicted operating profit of 55 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Raytheon rose 18 3/4 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $29.25 in  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon has lowered its earnings expectations twice in the past  
two months. Last week the company said profits would be hurt by 
increased competition, longer lead times for buyers to make 
purchasing decisions and lower margins at Raytheon Systems Co., its 
defense and electronics unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest report showed that sales rose to $4.73 billion in the  
July-September period, up 7 percent from $4.44 billion a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The previously disclosed pretax charge of $599 million, or $1.09  
per share, represents asset write-downs, restructuring and contract 
adjustments. Of that total, $449 million relates to the company's 
electronics business, Raytheon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend to restore confidence in Raytheon by outperforming  
the competition over the long term,'' said Daniel P. Burnham, the 
company's chairman and chief executive officer. ``Raytheon has 
tremendous strengths and we're determined to win new business and 
reach our full potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, net income was $313 million,  
down from $495 million last year, after one-time charges and 
accounting changes are factored in. Earnings per share fell to 
$1.07 from $1.45. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose to $14.83 billion from $14.09 billion in the same  
period a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Tiny Beetles Threaten Calif. Oaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Beetles are killing an unprecedented number  
of Northern California's majestic oaks from the inside out. 
</P>
<P>
	In an infestation that is confounding experts and stunning  
homeowners who are seeing their trees wither in a matter of weeks, 
the tiny beetles have claimed thousands of live oaks and tan oaks 
along a 200-mile swath of coastline. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one knows what's going on. Not even the state,'' said Mitzi  
Staley, a gardener for the University of California Cooperative 
Extension. ``We don't know if it's a cyclical thing or a pollution 
thing because we haven't had anything like this for a long time. 
It's very serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trees are under attack from two types of beetles: the  
Western oak bark beetle, which burrows under the bark until it 
falls off, and the oak ambrosia beetle, which tunnels into the wood 
and deposits a fungus that clogs the trees' circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The theory is that the tan oaks were somehow weakened by drought  
and El Nino and developed some kind of unexplained disease. Beetles 
then preyed on the weakened tan oaks, and eventually spread to the 
live oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the well-to-do coastal area, property values have everything  
to do with the trees, some of which are more than 250 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a lot of well-heeled Marin County residents with  
hundreds of trees dying,'' said Bruce Hagen of the California 
Forestry Department. ``And live oaks are almost emblematic of the 
state. They're durable trees that can grow many hundreds of years. 
People have learned to love their oaks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pavel Svihra, a researcher with the university extention service  
who learned of the problem in 1995, called it an ``entomological 
blitzkrieg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This epidemic is critical for two reasons,'' he said. ``One,  
it makes the ecosystem unstable. Two, as trees die, each becomes 
fuel for fire. And fires can be extremely explosive in an area like 
this.''

<HEADLINE>  Megawati Elected Indonesia VP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Popular opposition leader Megawati  
Sukarnoputri was elected Indonesia's vice president today, one day 
after she lost the first free and contested presidential vote in 
the country's history. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory appeared likely to end a rash of violent,  
anti-government protests that broke out after Megawati lost the 
presidential ballot Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank God for this, and I will do my best for the republic  
of Indonesia,'' Megawati said, as a crowd of legislators burst into 
cheers and sang the national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote in the People's Consultative Assembly, the country's  
highest legislative body, was 396 for Megawati and 284 for the 
leader of the Muslim United Development Party, Hamzah Haz. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in days, not a single protest was reported in  
the capital, Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the main tourist island of Bali, a Megawati stronghold,  
was wracked by unrest even as the legislative vote was under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of Megawati supporters set supermarkets ablaze and  
barricaded the only road into the main tourist area. Inside a 
complex of more than 100 hotels that line the beaches, trees were 
on fire and smashed statues of Buddha and Hindu gods lay about. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,000 tourists were stranded at the airport after taxis  
refused to take them. Some were being ferried to their resorts by 
hotel staff on motorbikes. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries were immediately reported, and protesters were quick  
to emphasize that their anger was directed at the special assembly, 
not at foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's that dangerous,'' said Raymond Smith, a  
tourist from Stockton, Calif. ``I don't want to go downtown with 
all this going on, but I feel safe in the hotel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One protester, who identified himself as Putu, said this:  
``Megawati lost. We burn everything. We are mad. This is people 
power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory by Megawati, the daughter Indonesia's founding  
president, Sukarno, means that she could eventually succeed 
Abdurrahman Wahid as the country's new president. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people believe that Wahid, 59, a moderate Muslim politician  
and cleric who is blind and has had two strokes, may not be able to 
complete his five-year term in office as Indonesia's leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before the vice presidential election, Gen. Wiranto,  
head of the powerful military, and Akbar Tanjung, chief of the 
former ruling Golkar Party, withdrew from the contest. Both said 
they were doing so to promote national unity in this diverse 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's now forget all our differences in the past. We have to  
stay united together to rebuild the country. Hopefully all the 
wounds will be healed now,'' Amien Rais, the newly elected, 
reformist speaker of the assembly, said after Megawati's victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Anticipating her election, the stock market jumped 5.5 percent,  
and the rupiah currency gained strength against the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Wahid, who was sworn in as president Wednesday night, came to  
power as Indonesia grapples with its worst economic crisis in 30 
years and continuing communal and separatist violence across this 
ethnically diverse archipelago of 210 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	His election gave Islam unprecedented influence in the world's  
largest Muslim nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia also is struggling with democratic reforms that it  
began to introduce 16 months ago when President Suharto, who ruled 
with an iron fist for 32 years, was driven out of power by a 
violent, pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
	His successor, B.J. Habibie, withdrew from Wednesday's  
presidential election shortly after the legislature rejected his 
administration in the equivalent of a no-confidence vote. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Jakarta was paralyzed by widespread protests that  
broke out when Megawati's many supporters heard she had lost the 
presidential vote. But pro-Wahid celebrations also occurred in many 
other cities on the country's 17,000 islands. Gangs also roamed 
some streets and tried to hijack cars. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two people were killed and 65 injured when a car  
exploded. A separate bomb, hidden in a flower pot, injured five 
people at the city's main traffic circle. A third bomb went off, 
harmlessly. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, workers began to repair the exterior of the white,  
concrete convention center, one side of which was blackened by 
fire. The inside of the building had escaped damage. 
</P>
<P>
	On Java Island, where Jakarta is located, dozens of people  
vandalized and set fire to the main municipal building in Surakarta 
on Wednesday, the Jakarta Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The mobs also destroyed the home of Amien Rais' mother, the  
paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city, 500 Megawati  
supporters occupied the local parliament after hearing she had lost 
the election, the Post said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, people also marched down the streets of the Indonesian  
cities in Banda Aceh, Ambon, Purwokerto, Samarinda, Tasikmalaya and 
Manado to celebrate Wahid's victory.

<HEADLINE> Blues Traveler Bassist Overdosed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A coroner has classified the death of Bobby  
Sheehan, bassist for the Grammy-winning rock band Blues Traveler, 
as an accidental drug overdose. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheehan, 31, had heroin, cocaine and Valium in his system when  
he was found dead in his home two months ago, toxicology tests 
showed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very sad,'' Coroner Frank Minyard said Wednesday. ``This  
guy had a bright future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheehan and three high school friends formed Blues Traveler in  
New York in the mid-1980s. Led by harmonica virtuoso John Popper, 
they built up a national following. The hit single ``Runaround,'' 
which won a Grammy in 1995, catapulted sales of the band's album 
``Four'' past the 4 million mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheehan moved to New Orleans in 1996.

<HEADLINE> GAO Issues Funeral Industry Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government lacks adequate oversight of  
funeral industry practices, according to a congressional report 
made public Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission ``does not have a systematic or  
structured process for measuring funeral homes' compliance'' with 
rules for the fair treatment of consumers, concluded the General 
Accounting Office, the investigate arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC disputed the findings and said it was satisfied that  
compliance with consumer protection rules has improved. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO report, commissioned by Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa,  
and John Breaux, D-La., also faulted the FTC for not enforcing 
penalties against funeral homes and cemeteries found violating 
consumer service rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of adequate oversight, Grassley said, ``ought to be  
disturbing, particularly when you consider there are 22,300 funeral 
homes in this country providing more than 2 million funerals a 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley noted that a typical funeral and burial costs $8,000,  
making it one of the larger purchases most Americans will ever 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, the FTC began requiring that homes provide an itemized  
price list and not charge for services people did not receive, want 
or need. The Funeral Rule was a response to complaints that people 
were being deceived or overcharged by some unscrupulous funeral 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC says industry compliance with the rules has been good.  
But GAO said that between 1994 and 1998, the FTC did not check out 
enough homes -- the agency test-shopped 958 homes, of 4.3 percent of 
the country's total -- to conclude that there was broad adherence to 
the rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC chairman, Robert Pitofsky, said the checks, carried out  
over 24 states, did provide accurate evidence that compliance with 
the requirements of the rule had risen markedly compared with the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO said that in 1997 and 1998 the FTC did not take  
enforcement actions in more than half the cases of potential rule 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``What incentive is there for the bad apples to comply with the  
Rule if they face no penalty for violating it?'' Grassley asked. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pitofsky said the FTC and the industry have developed ``a  
remedial rather than a punitive law enforcement program that is 
more effective in stimulating compliance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO also looked into state oversight of the funeral industry  
in California, Florida, Maryland, New York and Texas, but found it 
difficult to assess the extent of problems because there is no 
single organization that collects and compiles complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	It also found relatively few complaints: The Better Business  
Bureau received 453 complaints about death care goods and services 
in 1997, compared with 654 complaints about barber and beauty 
shops. The FTC received 152 complaints in 1998, only 0.33 percent 
of 46,091 consumer complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason for the small number of complaints might be that  
consumers consider death care a personal rather than a consumer 
matter, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley and Breaux, who head the Senate Special Committee on  
Aging, said they plan hearings next year on consumer concerns in 
the funeral industry.

<HEADLINE> No Love Between Gumbel and Couric </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bryant Gumbel may be a golf buddy of his former  
``Today'' show colleague Matt Lauer, but don't expect him to tee up 
with Katie Couric anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Gumbel, who returns to morning television on CBS' ``The Early  
Show'' on Nov. 1, appears to take a few shots at his former 
``Today'' partner in a profile to be published Sunday in The New 
York Times Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	While talking about his canceled CBS newsmagazine, ``Public Eye  
with Bryant Gumbel,'' Gumbel brings up Ms. Couric's experience on 
an earlier NBC show, ``Now,'' which became part of ``Dateline 
NBC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I was quick enough to remember at the time but, you  
know, Katie had a prime-time magazine fail under her,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to his supposed difficulty in getting along with  
people, Gumbel said: ``I've had one assistant for 18 years. 
Somebody who shall remain nameless went through five in five years. 
I had one makeup and hair person the whole time I was at NBC. 
Somebody who shall remain nameless went through three or four.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Couric, Gumbel's partner at the end of his 15 years on  
``Today,'' sent word through a spokeswoman that she 
``respectfully'' declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gumbel, in a telephone interview, said he did not intend to  
single out Ms. Couric in pointing out that other network stars had 
been on unsuccessful magazines. He wouldn't say who he was 
referring to in his comment about personal assistants. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I wanted to refer to anyone in particular, I would have  
named them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gumbel said that he found the idea that he was attacking Ms.  
Couric amusing, and that there wasn't ``any evidence'' that the two 
didn't get along. 
</P>
<P>
	``I even said in the article that I never said a bad word about  
Katie and I'm not going to start now,'' he said, ``and then 
suddenly people want to write that I've said all these bad 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About Ms. Couric and Gumbel, the article quotes a former staff  
member at ``Today,'' who is not identified, as saying: ``I don't 
think either one of them wanted to spend one minute together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Times also said that several former colleagues believe that  
Gumbel cannot accept Ms. Couric's status as the leading personality 
in morning television. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, I don't think that's correct,'' Gumbel said.

<HEADLINE> Boston Teens Guilty of Race Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Two white teen-agers whose families were evicted  
from a housing project after the men were arrested for race-related 
attacks have pleaded guilty to terrorizing their Hispanic 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Day, 19, was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in jail after  
pleading guilty Thursday to assault and battery, civil rights 
violations and destruction of property in two 1997 attacks. His 
plea came a few hours before he was scheduled to go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Beatty, 19, pleaded guilty to assault and battery and  
destruction of property and was sentenced to one year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	According to prosecutors, Day, Beatty and several other  
teen-agers in 1997 chased a Hispanic man to his apartment with 
sticks and bats and threw rocks and bricks at him. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than two weeks later, the group chased a Hispanic woman to  
her apartment late at night and Day threw her to the ground, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the teen-agers continued throwing bottles and  
bricks at the building where the woman lived, and Day was charged 
with throwing a bottle through a bedroom window where another 
Hispanic woman was sleeping with her infant daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The other teen-agers previously pleaded guilty.  
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Housing Authority evicted Day's and Beatty's families  
from the South Boston housing project using a new federal policy 
that allows evictions of public housing tenants who are violent, 
sell drugs or commit civil rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy was created in 1996 to make government housing for  
the poor a safer place to live.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Tobacco Exec Discusses Movie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Tobacco whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand says  
the movie ``The Insider'' takes some liberties with his story, but 
is essentially accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	In one scene, the former Brown &AMP; Williamson executive is  
portrayed as hitting golf balls at a driving range while a burly 
man watches him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did that happen? No,'' Wigand said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	But Wigand said the movie starring Al Pacino as ``60 Minutes''  
producer Lowell Bergman accurately portrays the kinds of threats he 
and his family faced after publicly addressing health and smoking 
issues in 1995. The movie opens in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its fidelity to the actual facts is acceptable,'' Wigand said.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> GTE Profits Rise 16 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- GTE Corp. reported Thursday its  
third-quarter profit rose 16 percent, helped by strong sales of 
Internet and data services. 
</P>
<P>
	The telecommunications company said it earned $952 million, or  
97 cents a share, compared with $822 million, or 85 cents a share, 
in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE, which is being acquired by Bell Atlantic Corp., beat the  
95-cents-per-share estimate of analysts surveyed by First 
Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings figure excludes a gain of $416 million, or 42 cents  
a share, mostly from the September sale of GTE's Government Systems 
business unit to General Dynamics. Including this gain, net income 
came to $1.4 billion, or $1.39 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive Charles R. Lee said the company is  
on track to hit its target of 13 percent to 15 percent earnings 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 7.8 percent, to $6.43 billion from $5.97 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Data-services revenue rose 30 percent over a year ago to $322  
million, wireless revenue increased 21 percent, and Internetworking 
-- including Web hosting and e-business -- jumped 82 percent to $285 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue from local phone service and directory publishing was  
flat at $3.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported an 11 percent increase, to 28.6 million, in  
the number of phone lines, but much larger increases came from 
long-distance hookups -- a 27 percent jump to 3.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also saw a 23 percent increase in wireless customers  
bringing the total to 6.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE's international operations were reported among the most  
profitable divisions, registering a 26 percent increase in 
earnings, to $144 million. The company cited a boost in new 
customers from Latin America and Taiwan. International revenue 
gained 31 percent, to $981 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first nine months of the year, GTE earnings excluding  
one-time items rose to $2.45 billion, or $2.50 a share, from $2.12 
billion, or $2.19 a share, the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Including one-time items, net earnings came to $3.03 billion, or  
$3.09 per share, up from $1.32 billion, or $1.36 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue increased to $18.6 billion from $17.3 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	GTE shares fell 87 1/2 cents to $72.50 on the New York Stock  
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Total Mutual Funds Assets Rise / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's money market funds rose  
in the past week, even with a modest drop in retail funds, the 
Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.539 trillion for the week  
ended Wednesday, according to the Washington-based mutual funds 
trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.530 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets for retail money market mutual funds fell by $847.2  
million in the latest week to $907.32 billion, ICI reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category fell  
by $361.2 million to $755.86 billion. Tax-exempt fund assets fell 
by $486.0 million to $151.46 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds rose by $9.28 billion  
to $631.52 billion for the same period. Among institutional funds, 
taxable money market fund assets rose by $8.94 billion to $583.21 
billion; assets of tax-exempt funds rose by $340.4 million to 
$48.31 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in  
the week ended Tuesday to 4.77 percent from 4.74 percent the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield rose to 4.73 percent from 4.72, IBC Financial Data 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield rose to 4.88 percent from 4.85  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield rose to 
4.85 percent from 4.83 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
57 days, unchanged from a week earlier, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts fell to 2.07 percent as of 
Wednesday from 2.08 percent a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.  
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing 
checking accounts was 0.84 percent, unchanged from a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.44 percent  
on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 4.42 percent the 
previous week. Yields were 4.82 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 4.81 
percent; 5.08 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs, up from 5.06 percent; and 
5.32 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 5.31 percent.

<HEADLINE> Norris Gets Wish To Fight Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Orlin Norris finally is getting a fight he  
wanted a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like I could beat him 10 years ago,'' said Norris, who  
will fight Mike Tyson on Saturday night. ``Nothing has changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norris' attitude might remain the same, but a lot has changed in  
10 years for the two fighters, especially for Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, Tyson was the fearsome undisputed heavyweight champion.  
Now he is 33 and making yet another comeback. He is a fighter who 
maintains the power of his glory years, but whose fast hands and 
quick feet have been slowed by time and inactivity. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, however, remains an attraction, a man held in the harsh  
glare of a celebrity built on his boxing achievement and his 
out-of-ring problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``People love Mike Tyson,'' said Dan Goossen, president of  
promoter America Presents. ``They love to see him win. They love to 
see him lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He has done so much for the game, and I think he deserves a  
lot of the attention he gets,'' said the 34-year-old Norris. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was a 12-1 favorite to win the 10-round match in the MGM  
Grand Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	A decade ago the odds against Norris would have been similar to  
the 42-1 odds that favored Tyson against James ``Buster'' Douglas 
on Feb. 11, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas, who knocked out Tyson in the 10th round in perhaps  
boxing's greatest upset, was the first choice for this bout. Tyson 
is fighting for the first time since he knocked out Francois Botha 
Jan. 16 and served 3 1-2 months in a Maryland jail for assaulting 
two motorists after a minor accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas, however, was rejected because of his poor physical  
condition. The attraction of Douglas to the people who guide and 
sell Tyson's career was his chin, which had grown increasingly 
fragile. 
</P>
<P>
	The attraction of Norris is that he does not pack a big wallop.  
Most of the 27 knockouts on his 55-5 record came through attrition. 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor that probably helped Norris get the fight is his  
size. He's built like Tyson, who could use a dominating performance 
at this point of his career. Norris is 5-foot-10, while Tyson is 
listed at 5-11 1-2, but appears shorter. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris has a crafty style, one that can frustrate an opponent  
and also bore a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1989, Norris had a 22-1 record, but because of his  
style he was not in the heavyweight championship mix. He won eight 
of his next 10 fights, outpointing former heavyweight champion Greg 
Page in 1989 and future champ Oliver McCall in 1990 and losing a 
decision to former champ Tony Tucker in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991 he shed more than 20 pounds to enter the 190-pound  
cruiserweight class. He won the WBA in 1993 and lost on an 
eighth-round knockout by Nate Miller in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of his career, Norris has boxed in the shadow of  
younger brother Terry, who was a flashy junior middleweight 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris will try to frustrate Tyson for 10 rounds. Botha did it  
for most of five rounds, winning all of the first four on two cards 
and three of the four on the third card. Then the South African got 
a little too cocky late in the fifth, dropped his guard and was 
knocked out by a right to the jaw. 
</P>
<P>
	``Botha fought Tyson the right way,'' Norris said. ``Botha did a  
lot of things right. He impressed me, more or less, as a boxer. He 
didn't stay in front of Tyson until the last round. Botha used the 
jab, he used his right hand and speed. My job is not to get hit 
with the big shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Showtime telecast will begin at 11 p.m. EDT. Tyson's fight  
probably will not start until the World Series game ends, but it 
not expected to starter later than midnight.

<HEADLINE> US: Japan Jeopardizing Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Japan is jeopardizing a new round of global  
trade talks before they even start by pursuing a self-serving 
strategy of protecting existing barriers, the Clinton 
administration told Congress on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Undersecretary David Aaron said Japanese officials, as  
far as he could see, had ``no positive objectives'' they were 
pursuing in a proposed new round of talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron said Japan seemed only to be interested in protecting  
favored domestic industries such as fishing and lumber and in 
attacking the laws employed by the United States to protect 
American steelmakers against a surge in low-cost Japanese steel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a worrisome strategy they seem to be employing here,''  
Aaron told the Senate Finance subcommittee on trade, which was 
hearing testimony on U.S. objectives in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said he shared the concerns about  
Japan and said he believed Japan had been allowed to avoid making 
serious commitments to lower trade barriers in the last round of 
global negotiations, known as the Uruguay Round. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Trade Organization will conduct negotiations Nov.  
30-Dec. 3 in Seattle, aimed at achieving agreement to launch a new 
three-year round of negotiations among its 134 member countries to 
lower trade barriers in agriculture, services and manufactured 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has been pressing for agreement that the new talks will  
revisit WTO rules on the use of anti-dumping laws, which allow a 
nation to impose high tariffs on imports if the country determines 
those goods are being sold at unfairly low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States used its anti-dumping laws to put stiff  
tariffs on steel from Japan and other nations earlier this year and 
ease a surge in foreign shipments after the Asian financial crisis. 
The Commerce Department reported Thursday that imports of steel 
fell 10.1 percent in September compared with August and for the 
first eight months of this year are running 13.8 percent below last 
year's levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron welcomed the decline but told reporters Japanese steel  
imports were still one-third higher than they were before 1997. He 
said Japanese shipments must fall still more. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron said the United States will never agree to include  
America's anti-dumping rules in a new round of global negotiations. 
He said calls by developing countries to reopen this issue had been 
orchestrated by Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (all countries) have a stake in having good, fair  
trade laws, which quite frankly are violated most frequently, as 
far as we can tell, by the Japanese government,'' Aaron said. ``For 
(the Japanese) to now try to change those rules which they have 
been found in violation of strikes me as unseemly at best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron's comments highlighted the trade tensions that are  
surfacing among the world's major economic powers as they bargain 
behind the scenes on what matters will be covered in the new 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin told a  
meeting of French farmers in Paris that the United States was being 
unreasonable in trying to restrict the negotiating topics in the 
new round, saying that it should be as broad as possible to respond 
to the concerns of ordinary people about the impact of 
globalization. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials contend that Europe's strategy is to load up the  
negotiating agenda to keep from meeting the primary U.S. objective 
of sharply reducing trade-distorting farm subsidies. Most such 
subsidies are provided by the 15-nation European Union for its own 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's language has begun to harden as the U.S.  
trade deficit has risen this year. The government reported 
Wednesday that the deficit through August is running at a record 
annual rate of $252 billion and the imbalance with Japan and China 
is well above last year's levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers will lead a delegation of  
U.S. officials in talks Sunday and Monday in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Student Movie Star Missing Premiere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPEAKE, Ala. (AP) -- One of the stars of ``Crazy in Alabama''  
won't be at its world premiere this Friday in Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas Black's other role -- left guard and nose guard for the  
Speake High School football team -- is more important. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first year to play varsity football,'' said Black,  
the 16-year-old actor who made a name for himself in the 1996 
Oscar-winning movie ``Sling Blade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have too good a record, but it's been fun. I don't  
think I need to miss a game to go to that premiere,'' he said. 
``Besides, I know what happens in the movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While he enjoys making movies, Black said he prefers hunting,  
fishing or playing sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``Crazy in Alabama,'' based on Mark Childress' best-selling  
novel of the same name, is a coming-of-age story about a boy 
nicknamed Peejoe, played by Black, and how he comes to the aid of 
his eccentric aunt during the 1960s. Melanie Griffith plays the 
aunt.

<HEADLINE> T-Wolves Sign Veteran Schayes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Minnesota Timberwolves signed 18-year  
veteran center Danny Schayes on Thursday and released Anthony 
``Pig'' Miller, who was signed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Schayes, a 6-11, 260-pound center, has played for Utah, Denver,  
the Los Angeles Lakers, Phoenix, Miami and Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	Schayes, 40, averaged 7.7 points and 5.0 rebounds in his career.  
His best season was 1987-88, when he averaged 13.9 points and 8.2 
rebounds for the Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Timberwolves have sustained a rash of injuries during the  
preseason and have no veteran centers. Dean Garrett had 
arthroscopic surgery on his left knee last week and is expected to 
miss 3-4 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Former University of Minnesota center Trevor Winter played in  
one game last season. Slovenian Radoslav Nesterovic, the team's 
first-round draft pick in 1998, played in just two regular-season 
games and the playoffs after signing last May following a season in 
the Italian League. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Joe Smith, out with a broken left foot, will miss the  
entire preseason. Forwards Sam Mitchell (right knee) and Tom 
Hammonds (both heels) are out indefinitely.

<HEADLINE> Rose To Be on Field for Game 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Despite his lifetime ban from baseball, Pete Rose  
is scheduled to be on the field before Game 2 of the World Series 
on Sunday as part of baseball's All-Century team. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans voted for the century's top 25 players, including nine  
outfielders, and Rose was consistently ninth in the voting, which 
ran from July 13-Sept. 19. His election was confirmed Wednesday by 
a baseball official familiar with the final vote totals, speaking 
on the condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig decided in August that Rose  
could participate in the All-Century team if he was elected. Rose, 
however, was not invited to a luncheon prior to the All-Star game 
that honored the living members among the 100 on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, then manager of the Cincinnati Reds, agreed on Aug. 23,  
1989 to a lifetime ban from baseball following an investigation 
into his gambling, a deal announced the following day by 
commissioner Al Bartlett Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's career hits leader applied for reinstatement in  
September 1997. While Selig hasn't formally ruled on the 
application, he's made clear numerous times that he has no 
intention of lifting the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Century team, which includes five people overlooked by  
fans and added by a special panel, will be announced Saturday and 
honored the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	As long as he's banned, Rose is ineligible for the Hall of Fame.  
No person ever permanently banned has ever been reinstated.

<HEADLINE> High-Priced Wool Fine, But Deadly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anyone who would pay up to $15,000 for a wool  
shawl that could slip through a wedding ring is being asked to 
resist the temptation and join an effort to protect Tibetan 
antelope. 
</P>
<P>
	While shahtoosh, the ``king of wools,'' spells ultra-chic and  
ultra-expensive to the world of high fashion, it means death for 
the three to five Tibetan chiru antelopes that have to be killed to 
produce one large shawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Enlisting the aid of supermodel Shalom Harlow, the  
Washington-based World Wildlife Fund and the Wildlife Conservation 
Society launched a campaign today to stop use of the illegal luxury 
fiber they said was being sold in Hong Kong, Paris, New York and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign coincided with an investigation by a New Jersey  
grand jury that has subpoenaed New York socialites and celebrities 
and followed a meeting on conservation of the Tibetan antelope in 
Xining, China, last week. The meeting included representatives of 
China, France, India, Nepal, Britain and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a Chinese court sentenced a farmer to 12 years in  
prison for poaching 88 Tibetan chiru antelope, according to the 
state-run Xinhua News Agency. China began a crackdown on the 
poaching in April. The farmer got the equivalent of $63 each for 
the rare hides. 
</P>
<P>
	Shahtoosh shawls, which sell undecorated for $2,000 and  
embroidered for up to $15,000, are said to be so fine that even a 
large one can be pulled through a wedding ring. Thus the name 
``ring shawl,'' once used only as a traditional dowry item in 
Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade of shahtoosh items has been illegal in the United States  
and in most other countries since 1979, but it has been showing up 
recently in exclusive shops around the world and in private sales, 
the conservationist groups claim. 
</P>
<P>
	``The protection of the Tibetan antelope is a worthy cause to  
which I have recently dedicated myself,'' said Harlow, a former TV 
fashion show hostess. She called for the use of pashmina, made from 
a nonendangered Tibetan mountain goat, as a still fairly luxurious 
-- about $300 for a typical shawl -- substitute. Her comments were 
quoted in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the antelope, the goats don't have to be killed to obtain  
the fiber, said Kerry Green Zobor, a World Wildlife Fund 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're being killed at the rate of 20,000 a year,'' said  
Zobor in an interview. With no more than 70,000 in the wild, they 
could become extinct in a few years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The antelopes are slaughtered on the Tibetan plateau in China  
with their hides taken to Kashmir, India, where the fiber is 
extracted and loomed into shawls and scarfs that make their way to 
New Delhi and eventually to clandestine markets in the world's 
richest cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Socialites and celebrities subpoenaed by the Newark grand jury  
in July included supermodel Christie Brinkley, according to an 
article in the November issue of Vanity Fair. The magazine report 
said they bought shahtoosh shawls at a charity function in November 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The Record of Hackensack, N.J., reported on Tuesday that fashion  
star Nan Kempner, socialite Sandy Hill Pittman and more than 100 
others also were subpoenaed and many of them already have 
surrendered their shawls to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

<HEADLINE> GOP Radio Ad Criticizes Democrats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of Republican moderates is using next  
week's debate between Al Gore and Bill Bradley to criticize the 
Democratic presidential agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	In a television ad being aired by the Republican Leadership  
Council in New Hampshire and Washington, a mock debate moderator 
says, ``Let's emphasize your differences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You both voted to raise taxes.''  
</P>
<P>
	``You both want more government spending.''  
</P>
<P>
	``You both voted to give college grant money to prisoners.''

	``So what are we going to debate?''  
</P>
<P>
	``Wait a minute. Didn't one of you guys invent the Internet?''  
</P>
<P>
	The vice president appeared to take credit last spring for  
inventing the Internet. He and Bradley, a former New Jersey 
senator, debate in New Hampshire on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two follow-up RLC television ads use the same mock debate format  
to criticize the pair. The groups says it is paying $150,000 to air 
the ads, which also will be broadcast sparsely on national cable 
outlets.

<HEADLINE> Young's Future Tied to Salary Cap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young's decision on whether to  
leave football might hinge on more than his health. 
</P>
<P>
	The salary cap of the San Francisco 49ers is certain to figure  
into the timing of any retirement announcement by the star 
quarterback, USA Today reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Money considerations) could certainly be a factor,'' 49ers  
general manager Bill Walsh said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers have declined comment about Young's future while he  
seeks additional medical opinions. Young sustained his fourth 
concussion in three years Sept. 27 against Arizona and is sidelined 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	If Young were to announce his retirement in the near future,  
salary-cap rules would force the team to make deep cuts in the 
player payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because his early retirement would force the team to  
account for Young's six-year, $45 million salary over a shorter 
period. If done too early, it could raise the team's payroll above 
the $57.3 million cap imposed by the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	One possibility is for the 49ers is to place Young on the  
injured-reserve list, which would require him to sit out the rest 
of the season. The long rest could give Young an opportunity to 
shake off his postconcussion symptoms and eventually return to the 
game, as he said he wants to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are several reasons a definitive resolution might not come  
soon: 
</P>
<P>
	--If Young were to retire before June 1, the already financially  
strapped team would take a $5 million salary cap hit. The team 
would then have just a week to get under the cap. 
</P>
<P>
	--If Young were to wait until after June 1 to retire, the 49ers  
would have just a $1.2 million salary-cap hit for next season. 
Young would then cost the cap nearly $3.8 million in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	--If Young were to announce his retirement next week when the  
49ers have a bye, he would lose 10/17th of his $6.25 million salary 
this year: a total of nearly $3.7 million.

<HEADLINE> Energy Secretary Traveling to India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson will travel  
to India next week to discuss energy issues with senior members of 
India's new government, the Energy Department announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson's visit will focus on potential partnerships in  
developing clean energy technologies. He also will discuss 
U.S.-India relations. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip, from Tuesday to Thursday, will be the first visit to  
India by a member of President Clinton's Cabinet since India's new 
government was formed Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	While Richardson was to focus on energy issues in his public  
appearances, including a trip to an energy efficient water 
treatment plant, his private discussions likely will include the 
recent military coup in Pakistan and concerns about India and 
Pakistan nuclear weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration announced Wednesday that it is  
prepared to permanently waive trade sanctions that were imposed on 
India and Pakistan last year after they conducted nuclear bomb 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States said it was not ready to lift the sanctions  
against Pakistan. That decision has become clouded by the failure 
of Pakistan's new military ruler to give a timetable for the return 
of democracy.

<HEADLINE> Husband Finally Exonerated in Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- For more than 27 years, authorities  
thought Gilbert Peppin shot his wife to death at home one summer 
night in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	For just as long, Peppin maintained his innocence and even  
cooperated with investigators trying to nail down the killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Now authorities say a recent confession by the couple's former  
paper boy -- already jailed for another death -- is Peppin's 
long-awaited exoneration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long 27 years,'' Peppin said Wednesday after  
Ramsey County authorities announced the confession of Charles Lee 
LaTourelle. ``There is no better thing I could find out at this 
time in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaTourelle, 44, confessed to the crime Oct. 10. He is already  
serving a prison sentence for the 1980 murder of Catherine John, a 
St. Cloud State University student. Ms. John was stabbed 21 times, 
raped and dumped into the Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say LaTourelle told them he killed Phyllis Peppin,  
then 26, on June 14, 1972, after he broke into her home and she 
tried to flee. 
</P>
<P>
	LaTourelle, then 17 and the neighborhood paper boy, had come  
there with the intent of raping her, and says he was ``obsessed'' 
with her, according to a criminal complaint. He has been charged 
with second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Peppin had long maintained he found his wife's body on the  
floor after coming home late from work at his father's barbershop. 
</P>
<P>
	While investigators suspected Peppin, he was not charged. He  
cooperated with authorities, got married again and kept working as 
a barber. Police never considered LaTourelle as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Peppin said he vaguely remembered LaTourelle, but only after  
being shown a photograph. ``I have no idea other than I probably 
paid him a few times for delivering the paper,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peppin's wife of 16 years, Adrienne, said Wednesday she had  
endured criticism from relatives fearful of her marrying a murder 
suspect. The couple have two children, ages 13 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the best guy I ever met,'' she said. ``Hopefully, he can  
live his life in peace, and Phyllis can rest in peace.''

<HEADLINE> $98M Judgment in Informant's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A jury has decided the District of Columbia  
police department and four of its officers must pay a mother $98 
million in damages for the death of her son, who was a police 
informant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm relieved that it's over, and I hope that it makes a  
difference,'' said Terry Butera, who had sought $115 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The damages ruling Wednesday came two days after the D.C.  
District Court jury had concluded that police negligence led to 
Eric Butera's death. Jurors also ruled that police violated the 
civil rights of Butera and his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	The police department declined to comment on the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	Butera, 31, was robbed and beaten to death on Dec. 4, 1997,  
while assisting police with an undercover investigation into a 
triple killing that occurred at a Starbucks coffee shop in 
Georgetown earlier in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Butera, a waiter trying to overcome a history of drug abuse,  
volunteered to assist police after telling them he overheard people 
talking about the killings while he was buying drugs in a row house 
in southwest Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Police asked him to make another drug buy there, so they could  
get a search warrant. They gave him $80 in marked money and a ride 
to the house the night of Dec. 4, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Butera was attacked, robbed and killed before he could even get  
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Ms. Butera argued that police put him in an  
extremely dangerous situation and failed to protect him. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to have informants, you have to protect  
them,'' said juror Marion Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	The people Butera heard talking about the Starbucks killings  
were not involved in that case, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people were convicted in Butera's killing.

<HEADLINE> Sears Profits Fall As Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sears, Roebuck and Co. reported Thursday its  
earnings dropped as expected due to sluggish retail sales during 
the summer. But the company also said business picked up in the 
early fall, raising hopes of an improvement in fourth-quarter 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's second-larger retailer said it had earnings of $265  
million, or 69 cents a share, down 11 percent from $298 million, or 
76 cents a share, for the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	That slightly exceeded the expectations of analysts who had  
revised earnings forecasts to 64 cents a share from an initial 82 
cents after the company warned last month that profits would be 
well below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest quarter does not include a charge of $29 million, or  
7 cents a share, for previously announced staff cuts and the 
shutdown of some automotive retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears said net earnings were $236 million, or 62 cents a share,  
up from $44 million, or 11 cents a share, in the third quarter of 
1998. The year-ago results reflect the 1998 sale of Western Auto 
and early debt payoffs, which reduced third-quarter profits by $254 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears stock was down 50 cents to $28.50 a share in early trading  
Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, its value nearly halved 
from its 52-week high of $53.18 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based company blamed softness in  
retail sales in July and August for the decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell to $9.54 billion, down 2.7 percent from $9.8 billion,  
as Sears continued to struggle to regain ground it has lost this 
year to discount and specialty retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we are clearly not satisfied with overall performance  
for the quarter, we are encouraged by the September improvements in 
retail sales and gross margin,'' said Arthur Martinez, chairman and 
chief executive officer. ``In addition, our credit business is 
solid and Sears Canada has experienced outstanding results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Church, an analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, also saw  
some positive signs in the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did see some improvement in their mix of sales, which  
helped margin trends. Some of the new merchandise rolling out into 
the stores has been gaining some traction in sales,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those factors, plus a strong showing from Sears Canada,  
``resulted in a quarter that wasn't quite as bad as we had 
feared,'' the analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears announced a management shakeup last month intended to  
break its prolonged slump. The company gave two top executives new 
responsibilities and announced the departure of the company's top 
merchandising officer. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, Sears reported operating income of  
$1.24 billion, up 3 percent from $1.2 billion in the same period of 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month net income was $713 million, or $1.87 a share, up 39  
percent from $513 million, or $1.32 a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues amounted to $28.57 billion, down 2.7 percent from  
$29.35 billion.

<HEADLINE> CDC Panel Urges Meningitis Warnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- It was Christmas Eve in 1995 when Melanie Benn  
began feeling ill from the disease that would eventually take both 
her arms and legs. 
</P>
<P>
	Then a college freshman, Ms. Benn says she was unaware that her  
battle with meningitis might have been prevented had she injected a 
$65 vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no idea the vaccine was out there before I entered  
college, and even though I got sick while at home, I'm convinced 
that I contracted it in the dorm,'' said Ms. Benn, now 22. 
</P>
<P>
	In an attempt to stem such cases, a panel of federal health  
experts recommended Wednesday that colleges make meningitis 
vaccines readily available and that they warn students of the risks 
of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	But the advisory committee from the Centers for Disease Control  
and Prevention stopped short of recommending that all college 
students be vaccinated. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel didn't go further in its recommendations because  
current meningitis vaccines are no more than 90 percent effective 
and don't work on all strains, said Dr. Nancy Rosenstein of the 
CDC's meningitis branch. 
</P>
<P>
	Meningococcal meningitis is an infection of the membranes around  
the brain and spinal cord that is fatal in about 10 percent of 
cases. It can be spread through contact such as kissing, sharing 
kitchen utensils and sneezing. Symptoms include fever, headache, 
nausea and vomiting, neck stiffness and skin rash. 
</P>
<P>
	The meningitis vaccine was originally developed to combat the  
disease in U.S. Army barracks. It has been mandatory for Army 
recruits for more than 30 years, and the disease is now extremely 
rare among soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	School and health officials have been reluctant to recommend the  
vaccination to all students because it is expensive -- averaging $65 
a shot -- and not completely effective, and the disease is so rare. 
</P>
<P>
	However, meningitis cases involving people ages 15 to 25 have  
doubled since 1991, and more than 170 colleges have added 
meningitis vaccine guidelines to their health recommendations in 
the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	A CDC study of 83 reported meningitis cases in college students  
from September 1998 through May 1999 indicated a rate of 1.4 cases 
per 100,000 freshmen, and 3.8 cases per 100,000 freshmen living in 
dormitories. The rate for all 18- to 22-year-olds was 1 case per 
100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the American College Health Association, between  
100 and 125 college students get meningitis each year, and between 
five and 10 die. 
</P>
<P>
	One Georgia Tech student died and another barely recovered in  
unrelated cases earlier this year in Georgia, while more than 8,000 
students and faculty at Michigan State University have been 
vaccinated since a student fell ill with meningitis earlier this 
month.

<HEADLINE> Chemicals Suspected in Bird Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MASCOUTAH, Ill. (AP) -- Wheat soaked with an agricultural  
insecticide may have killed as many as 27,000 birds in a southern 
Illinois field and officials want to know if the mass poisoning was 
intentional. 
</P>
<P>
	About 75 percent of the dead birds were red-winged blackbirds.  
The rest were brown-headed cowbirds, grackles, starlings and horned 
larks, said Georgia Parham of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The insecticide Furidan -- a chemical usually sprayed directly on  
a crop -- was spread on the St. Clair County winter wheat field, 
said Capt. Mark Ottis, a state conservation officer. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department of Natural Resources spokesman Joe Khayyat said  
the insecticide was used ``apparently for the sole purpose of 
eliminating a population of blackbirds that were perceived to be a 
nuisance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No charges have been filed, pending the outcome of lab tests on  
the carcasses. Authorities said the land owner is cooperating with 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	If the poisoning was intentional, the farmer could face federal  
charges since migrating birds are protected by federal law, Parham 
said. Officials had first suspected that a downdraft killed the 
birds by slamming them into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers finished picking up the carcasses Wednesday to prevent  
other animals from eating them and possibly becoming sick. 
Officials said there is no danger to humans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Environmental Protection  
Agency and the St. Clair County state's attorney's office were 
investigating.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The world's largest Internet service provider

products. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online and computer giant Gateway Inc. announced the  
alliance Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the two-year deal, AOL will invest $800 million in  
cash and equity securities into San Diego-based Gateway Inc.; $180 
million of that in AOL stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway will spend $85 million to feature and market AOL  
products and services on its PCs. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading this afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange, AOL

</P>
<P>
	Besides sharing subscribers and directing customers to each  
other's electronic commerce sites, the companies plan to share 
operating profits on customers from online software sales and 
Gateway's Internet training courses.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Developing Mad Cow Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists are developing a blood test they  
hope can be used to detect mad cow disease and similar brain 
illnesses in animals and humans. 
</P>
<P>
	The test, developed by private and government researchers,  
detects the presence of abnormal proteins called prions that cause 
a group of diseases known as transmissible spongiform 
encephalopathies, or TSE. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been successfully used on TSE illnesses in sheep, elk,  
mule deer and hamsters. Additional research, which will probably 
take at least a year, must be done to ensure the test is reliable 
enough to be used for diagnostic purposes in humans and other 
animals, said Mary Jo Schmerr, a scientist at the Agriculture 
Department's National Animal Disease Center in Ames, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far, from what we've seen it looks very promising,'' she  
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Testing for TSE diseases is now done by taking a sample of brain  
or glandular tissue, usually after death. 
</P>
<P>
	The blood test likely would be used first in Britain. The best  
known TSE is mad cow disease, which has been linked with a variant 
of the fatal brain condition known as Cruetzfeldt-Jakob. At least 
43 people have died of that strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob in Britain 
since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans who traveled frequently to Britain during the mad cow  
crisis have been banned from donating blood in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no known mad cow disease in U.S. cattle, but sheep are  
susceptible to a related condition called scrapie and other forms 
of TSE infect elk, mule deer and mink. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA filed this week for a patent on the blood test.

<HEADLINE> Gore Campaigns to Undecided Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, N.H. (AP) -- With a new poll showing him and Bill Bradley  
in a statistical dead heat for the Democratic presidential 
nomination, Vice President Al Gore gathered a group of undecided 
voters Thursday and campaigned to be their choice. 
</P>
<P>
	The setting was pure Americana -- a dusty middle school gymnasium  
with 200 people sitting on bleachers and folding chairs. Gore's 
appeal was an equal serving of apple pie: ``I'm in this because I 
want to make a positive difference and I'm in this because I think 
I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For more than 90 minutes, the audience quizzed him on a wide  
range of subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	-- What can you do to make prescription drugs more affordable for  
me and other senior citizens? 
</P>
<P>
	-- How can we reduce smog and help my asthma?  
</P>
<P>
	-- Do you support work on 18 extra submarines at the Portsmouth  
Naval Shipyard, where I work? 
</P>
<P>
	-- What can you do to reform the campaign finance system?  
</P>
<P>
	But perhaps the most poignant moment came when 42-year-old  
Laurrie Malizia of Dover complained, ``One of the things that I 
need from a president is an honest man but a moral man, and I'm 
very disappointed in the last president. I want your viewpoint on 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, his voice dropping noticeably, replied: ``I want to take  
my own values of faith and family to the presidency. I understand 
the disappointment that you feel, and I felt it myself. I think 
most people want to look to the future, turn that page and move on. 
So, all I can do is tell you about myself and about my commitment 
to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that, Gore recounted his personal history, his 29-year  
marriage and described his four children and first grandson, born 
on the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
	Malizia, an administrative assistant at the University of New  
Hampshire, said afterward that she liked Gore's answer but would 
still think about Gary Bauer, the Republican conservative activist, 
before making a primary choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what impressed her, Malizia replied: ``The fact that he  
looked at me straight in eyes. The fact that he seemed disappointed 
in the actions of the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Byrne, 45, of Dover, said he had been leaning towards  
Bradley but would now have to re-evaluate Gore. ``The whole 
woodenness issue has been laid to rest for me. He's very 
personable,'' Byrne said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign said it picked uncommitted voters identified  
through door-to-door canvassing and telephone banks. About 200 were 
invited -- some brought children -- and the campaign placed no 
restrictions on the content of their questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore stood near a wooden stool positioned in the center of the  
gym, framed on two sides by portable bleachers and the other two by 
folding chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The forum at the older of Dover's two middle schools came as the  
latest New Hampshire poll showed that Bradley, the former New 
Jersey senator and Gore's only challenger, was in a statistical tie 
with the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-five percent of 600 likely Democratic voters supported  
Bradley, compared with 41 percent for Gore. Other recent polls have 
shown similar dead heats. An August poll showed Gore leading 
Bradley 46 percent to 29 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also made his sales pitch in somewhat hostile territory.  
While Dover is a homey Seacoast City basking in the glory of New 
England's foliage season, its voters have been far from 
enthusiastic about Gore in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	As a presidential candidate in 1988, Gore finished fourth in  
Dover with 7.7 percent of the vote in the state's primary. 
Neighboring son Michael Dukakis was first with 37 percent, followed 
by Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri and former Sen. Paul Simon of 
Illinois.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Dallas Bower, a pioneer television producer who  
also worked in early radio and cinema, died Monday. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Bower began sound recording in radio when broadcasting was a  
novelty. He moved to cinema and then to television, where he became 
the first producer of drama and opera for the British Broadcasting 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	He also directed feature films and documentaries, and was  
associate producer of Laurence Olivier's 1944 film ``Henry V.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Bower's first jobs was to record the soundtrack for  
Alfred Hitchcock's 1929 film ``Blackmail'' for British 
International Pictures. That year he also recorded the first 
all-talking British film, ``Under the Greenwood Tree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bower was appointed to the BBC Television Service in 1936.  
During World War II, he made propaganda films as an executive 
producer in the government's Ministry of Information.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stanley L. Dritz, who popularized the zipper and  
other sewing products as part of his family's business, died 
Saturday in White Plains, N.Y. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	As president of John Dritz &AMP; Sons, Dritz raised the consumer  
appeal of a hookless fastener he had first seen in England. He made 
the fastener, commonly known as the zipper, out of plastic and 
rustproof metals. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of the hundreds of sewing aids found in his company's  
catalog, which also included the seam ripper and the electric 
scissors. 
</P>
<P>
	Dritz was born in New York City and joined his father's business  
after graduating from college. He was president in the 1950s and 
1960s, and the company was sold upon his retirement.

</P>
<P>
	Durden co-wrote ``Heartbreak Hotel'' with Mae Boren Axton of  
Nashville, Tenn., and for reasons never explained, Presley also was

</P>
<P>
	In 1956, Durden was performing with a band in Jacksonville,  
Fla., when he came across a newspaper account of a man who had 
committed suicide. The man left a note that said, ``I walk a lonely 
street,'' and Durden said he used that as the basis for 
``Heartbreak Hotel.''

<P>
	Griffith was a bat boy in 1924-25 for the Washington Senators.  
He worked in every capacity in the minor and major leagues before 
taking control of the Senators from his uncle and adoptive father, 
Clark Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1960 season, he moved the Senators to Minnesota. The

	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Jack Lynch, the former Irish prime  
minister best known for his unfulfilled promise not to ``stand by'' 
as violence wracked Northern Ireland, died Wednesday at a Dublin 
hospital. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch served as prime minister from 1966 to 1973 and again in  
1977, when his Fianna Fail party won its biggest majority ever in 
Dublin's parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, when violence spilled into the streets of British-ruled  
Northern Ireland, Lynch moved some army units to the border to open 
field hospitals for refugee rioters. But the Catholic militants 
waited in vain for the tiny Irish army to come to their rescue. 
Instead, scores of homes were torched in Belfast and the British 
army was deployed as peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	Overspending in Lynch's 1978 budget produced soaring deficits  
and inflation and fueled a voter backlash. He resigned later that 
year.

develop France's ``new novel'' movement, died at her Paris home on 
Tuesday. She was 99.

<P>
	Sarraute was best known for writing about imperceptible

	Sarraute turned out her first book, ``Tropismes,'' in 1939 and  
wrote more than 20 works, from novels to plays. 
</P>
<P>
	She had said that it was in her third novel, ``L'ere du

writing began to emerge that reached for the ``interior drama'' of 
people's lives.

<HEADLINE> GTE Profit Rises 16 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- GTE Corp. reported today its third-quarter  
profit rose 16 percent, helped by strong sales of Internet and data 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	The telecommunications company said it earned $952 million, or  
97 cents a share, compared with $822 million, or 85 cents a share, 
in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE, which is being acquired by Bell Atlantic Corp., beat the  
95-cents-per-share estimate of analysts surveyed by First 
Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings figure excludes a gain of $416 million, or 42 cents  
a share, mostly from the September sale of GTE's Government Systems 
business unit to General Dynamics. Including this gain, net income 
came to $1.4 billion, or $1.39 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive Charles R. Lee said the company is  
on track to hit its target of 13 percent to 15 percent earnings 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 7.8 percent, to $6.43 billion from $5.97 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Data-services revenue rose 30 percent over a year ago to $322  
million, wireless revenue increased 21 percent, and Internetworking 
-- including Web hosting and e-business -- jumped 82 percent to $285 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue from local phone service and directory publishing was  
flat at $3.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported an 11 percent increase, to 28.6 million, in  
the number of phone lines, but much larger increases came from 
long-distance hookups -- a 27 percent jump to 3.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also saw a 23 percent increase in wireless customers  
bringing the total to 6.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE's international operations were reported among the most  
profitable divisions, registering a 26 percent increase in 
earnings, to $144 million. The company cited a boost in new 
customers from Latin America and Taiwan. International revenue 
gained 31 percent, to $981 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first nine months of the year, GTE earnings excluding  
one-time items rose to $2.45 billion, or $2.50 a share, from $2.12 
billion, or $2.19 a share, the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Including one-time items, net earnings came to $3.03 billion, or  
$3.09 per share, up from $1.32 billion, or $1.36 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue increased to $18.6 billion from $17.3 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	GTE shares fell 94 cents to $72.44 on the New York Stock  
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Stoneman Frontrunner for Angels GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The Anaheim Angels hope to announce the  
hiring of a general manager before the World Series begins 
Saturday, and it appears Montreal Expos executive Bill Stoneman is 
the frontrunner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times reported Stoneman was to meet with Disney  
officials Thursday in what would be his third interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, Stoneman and former New York Yankees GM Bob Watson  
were interviewed twice, according to team spokesman Tim Mead, who 
added that New York Mets assistant GM Omar Minaya and Houston 
Astros assistant GM Tim Purpura also were interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing definitive at this point regarding the  
announcement of our next general manager,'' Mead said Thursday. 
``The interview process will continue today. I'm not at liberty to 
discuss names.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Times quoted a source as saying Stoneman hadn't been offered  
the job before Thursday, but a multiyear contract offer was 
imminent and an announcement could be made as early as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball mandates that no major announcements be made during the  
playing of the World Series so as not to detract from the sport's 
biggest event. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Bavasi resigned as general manager of the Angels Oct. 1  
after nearly six years on the job. Two days later, the team 
finished a disappointing 70-92 season and in last place in the AL 
West. 
</P>
<P>
	Most recently Montreal's vice president-baseball operations,  
Stoneman has worked primarily as the Expos' chief financial officer 
since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoneman pitched in the majors for eight years with a 54-85  
record and 4.08 ERA. A right-hander, he was a member of the Chicago 
Cubs for two years and the Expos for five before completing his 
career with the Angels in 1974. He pitched two no-hitters with the 
Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason the Angels would like to have a GM in place as soon  
as possible is because they are without a manager, which would be 
the new hire's first priority. Terry Collins resigned Sept. 3, and 
was replaced by bench coach Joe Maddon on an interim basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Baylor, the AL MVP in 1979 as a member of the Angels and  
hitting instructor of the NL champion Atlanta Braves, is believed 
to be a leading contender for the managerial job. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor, who played for the Angels from 1977-82, managed the  
Colorado Rockies from 1993-98 and was NL manager of the year in 
1995 for leading his team to postseason play in its third year of 
existence. Baylor was fired one day after the completion of the 
1998 season.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Police in Yugoslavia Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.N. police are investigating  
several fellow officers suspected of pressuring Serbs to sell their 
homes to ethnic Albanians at prices below market value, a U.N. 
official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry was launched after Serbian media reported that two  
U.N. officers told Serbs they should sell their homes to Albanians 
and instructed them to contact an ethnic Albanian lawyer to draw up 
the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Serbs are keen to leave Kosovo because of attacks by ethnic  
Albanians seeking revenge for the Serb crackdown that left 10,000 
people dead before NATO bombing forced Serb forces to withdraw in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb media reports identified one of the officers under  
investigation as John Henderson. The U.N. official, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity, confirmed an officer with that name was 
under investigation but declined to give his nationality or other 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	Ekrem Smaili, the lawyer named in the reports, confirmed he knew  
Henderson but said he also did not know his nationality. He said he 
had no business relationship with the officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaili denied that the properties were being sold below market  
value. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every transaction is done properly to show they were not  
selling under coercion,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, NATO officials spoke of the newest form of  
anti-Serb intimidation -- bogus lists of Serb war crimes suspects, 
some signed by banned Kosovo Liberation Army or local, 
self-declared Albanian police units. It wasn't clear if the 
signatures were real. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern is that you could have people killed by the fact  
that someone hates someone else and puts their name on a list,'' 
said a NATO spokesman, Maj. Roland Lavoie. 
</P>
<P>
	Such posters are bound to strengthen Serb determination to  
defend themselves, adding to already high ethnic tensions in the 
province and blocking international attempts to establish 
cooperation between the two hostile groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Lavoie also detailed more attacks on Serbs -- unknown assailants  
hitting Serb houses in the eastern village of Migola with 
rocket-propelled grenade and automatic weapons fire. Serbs returned 
fire, he said. In another recent incident, a Serb man was wounded 
by a shot to the chest in Urosevac, a U.S.-controlled town south of 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite such attacks and intimidation, the United Nations has  
rejected Serb plans to set up self-rule in parts of the province 
and an all-Serb defense force. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb leaders argue that their own secure enclaves and protection  
force are the only way to prevent the remaining Serbs from fleeing 
the province. Estimates of remaining Serbs vary from 20,000 to 
100,000, down from 200,000 before a mass exodus prompted by revenge 
attacks by ethnic Albanians following the end of NATO's bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, NATO said Wednesday that some Serbs were returning to  
areas that the NATO-led peacekeepers were protecting. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO, meanwhile, condemned the Yugoslav government for ordering  
international air traffic controllers throughout the region not to 
clear commercial flights to and from Pristina. While the government 
remains sovereign in Kosovo, NATO spokesman Maj. Ole Irgens said 
NATO-led peacekeepers have authority over its airspace. 
Negotiations are continuing to restart flights in the near future, 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Shea To Coach Rutgers in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Terry Shea will remain as Rutgers football coach next season  
despite losing all six games this season and 32 of 39 in three-plus 
seasons, athletic director Robert E. Mulcahy said in a statement 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever a season has the difficulties like this one has had,  
questions arise as to the status of the coach,'' Mulcahy said. ``I 
want to put to rest all of those questions, so the staff can focus 
on the remaining games and the continued recruiting of 
student-athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shea, 53, was selected Big East Conference coach of the year in  
1998 after leading the Scarlet Knights to a 5-6 record, a five-game 
improvement over the 0-11 mark of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement comes two days before the Scarlet Knights (0-6,  
0-3 Big East) play Pittsburgh (3-3, 1-2) at Rutgers Stadium. The 
timing also comes less than a week after Rutgers lost consecutive 
games to No. 4 Virginia Tech and West Virginia by a combined 
120-36. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulcahy noted that the football team has been plagued by  
injuries this season, including the loss of starting quarterback 
Mike McMahon for the year and eight starters on defense. Those 
problems have forced Shea to use players who weren't even on the 
depth chart at the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all share in the disappointment of how our current season  
has unfolded,'' Mulcahy said. ``The level of play has not 
consistently met the expectations we had following our 1998 season, 
where we showed marked improvement. We certainly empathize with our 
many supporters, alumni and fans who have expressed concern. We 
understand how people who are not exposed to the day-to-day 
workings of our program could have doubts, given our present 
won-loss record. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there is much more that goes into evaluating a college  
football program. I am deeply involved with our program, and admire 
Terry's integrity and ability,'' Mulcahy said. ``We share a common 
vision to which we all aspire. This is a critical point of the 
season, and our coaches and players must continue to stay focused 
on the goals we have set, including the continued recruitment of 
top student-athletes for the coming year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mulcahy said that Rutgers made a commitment to Shea four years  
ago and will honor it. 
</P>
<P>
	Shea was 15-6-2 in two seasons at San Jose State, where he was  
named the Big West's coach of the year in 1990.

<HEADLINE> FCC To Increase Phone Subsidies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission voted  
Thursday to boost the subsidies that help make phone service 
affordable for people in rural and expensive-to-serve areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC more than doubled the pot of money available to big  
telephone companies, such as the regional Bells and GTE, that serve 
rural customers and others in high-cost markets. Those funds now 
will total $437 million -- up from $207 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is likely to increase long-distance bills for consumers  
but it is not clear by how much. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission used a new formula to determine which states  
should be eligible for the money and how much they should get. But 
the FCC decided to protect states that already had been receiving 
subsidies for a transitional period. Once that period ends, the 
pool of money is expected to shrink. 
</P>
<P>
	The change is part of a broader FCC effort to revamp the system  
in preparation for widespread competition in local phone markets. 
</P>
<P>
	This action is ``about making sure consumers everywhere get the  
same high-quality service at comparable rates,'' said FCC Chairman 
Bill Kennard. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal subsidies are mostly paid by fees the FCC imposes on  
AT&AMP;T, MCI, Sprint and other long-distance companies, which 
typically pass the costs on to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest long-distance carrier, AT&AMP;T, criticized the  
FCC for making its fund too large. The company predicted it will 
have to increase the 99-cent monthly line-item fee that consumers 
see on their bill, called the Universal Service Connectivity 
Charge. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI and Sprint, which charge customers a percentage of their  
long-distance calling bill to contribute to the fund, expected they 
would recover the increased fees in some way from consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Commissioner Susan Ness said consumers who make few  
long-distance calls -- but still pay these line-item fees -- could 
ultimately be hurt by the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``These subscribers have not derived the benefits of the very  
substantial rate reductions in long-distance service,'' Ness said. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West, which serves 3.3 million rural and high-cost  
customers, blasted the FCC's new mechanism for determining support, 
saying it could force individual states to shoulder a greater 
burden to keep service affordable. 
</P>
<P>
	``These new rules could tell large companies serving rural  
communities to stop investing in advanced telecommunications 
services in high-cost areas,'' said U S West executive vice 
president Mark Roellig. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet to be addressed are subsidies built into so-called  
``access'' fees that local phone companies charge long-distance 
carriers to connect calls. 
</P>
<P>
	A coalition of major telecommunications carriers estimates that  
$650 million of these fees also go toward making local phone 
service affordable. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 telecommunications law sought to make such subsidies  
explicit, rather than having them hidden in other charges. The 
industry coalition has offered the FCC a proposal on how to 
accomplish this task. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Kimmelman of Consumers Union says the FCC should reduce the  
access fees that long-distance companies pay local companies, and 
make sure long-distance companies pass the benefits to customers 
with lower rates. This could help offset bill increases from 
Thursday's action, Kimmelman said.

<HEADLINE> Modell Wants Partner for $150M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Baltimore Ravens owner Art Modell is seeking  
one or more partners to buy a minority share of the team and wants 
at least $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Modell is seeking a partner so he can pay off loans and  
strengthen the team's financial position. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens have made all required loan payments, but fell into  
technical default on some promissory notes this year. The NFL 
hastily arranged for a one-year loan of up to $85 million, which 
comes due in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The league has asked the Ravens to have a new partner on board  
by early next year. If one can't be found, the league would have 
time to find a buyer for the entire franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Modell said Wednesday documents with a potential partner are in  
the final stages of preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The response has been very good,'' said Modell, who in 1961  
paid $3.9 million for the franchise. He said he hopes to have a 
deal completed by March. 
</P>
<P>
	In correspondence with potential investors, the franchise is  
valued at between $450 million and $550 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Modell is hoping to retain control of the team and eventually  
will it to his sons. He moved the Browns from Cleveland and renamed 
them the Ravens after the 1995 season.

<HEADLINE> Douglas Joins Nets for Second Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Having enjoyed his first stay in  
New Jersey, Sherman Douglas had no qualms about signing up for a 
second stint with the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the familiarity sure had something to do with it,''  
Douglas said Thursday in explaining why he signed a multiyear 
contract with the Nets the day before. ``Going to a place you feel 
comfortable with and not so far (from home) had a lot to do with 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two-year deal will pay Douglas the 10-year veteran minimum  
of $1 million this season. The second year is Douglas' option. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas averaged 8.2 points and 4.1 assists for the Nets during  
the 1997-98 season. In three playoff games against the Chicago 
Bulls, he averaged 18.3 points and 8.3 assists while starting for 
injured Sam Cassell. 
</P>
<P>
	This time around Douglas will back up Stephon Marbury, one of  
the rising stars in the league. Marbury averaged 21.3 points and 
8.9 assists last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are enough minutes behind Stephon,'' Douglas said. ``I  
know he's the star and he's going to get the bulk of the minutes. 
But as a veteran, I know I can go in and supply some leadership and 
a spark off the bench. Any time you get a veteran point guard to 
back up a star point guard I don't think you skip a beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas played for the Los Angeles Clippers last season. He was  
drafted by Miami in 1989 after playing collegiately at Syracuse. He 
had his best NBA season in 1990, when he averaged 18.5 points and 
8.5 assists in 73 games with the Heat. 
</P>
<P>
	He was traded to Boston in 1992, then to Milwaukee in 1995. In  
1997, he was sent in a three-way trade to Cleveland, then traded a 
month later to Denver. Douglas signed at the end of October 1997 as 
a free agent with the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we get everybody healthy, that will be the key. If we can  
get everybody healthy and on the same page, we have the talent to 
get to the playoffs,'' Douglas said of the Nets' chances this year.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. Examines Clemency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department, under fire for its  
handling of freedom granted to jailed Puerto Rican nationalists, 
says it is considering changes in the clemency process to better 
involve victims of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could do a better job,'' Deputy Attorney General Eric  
Holder said Wednesday during a hearing by the Senate Judiciary 
Committee. ``I think we should look at the regulations and tinker 
with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers scolded the Justice Department throughout the often  
testy hearing for what they see as a string of missteps, primary 
among them failing to contact victims during the clemency 
proceedings to gather their input. Many victims maimed in bombings 
by Puerto Rican militants have appeared on Capitol Hill in recent 
weeks to complain that they had been left out of the process and in 
many cases only learned the prisoners had been freed through news 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think victims should be consulted about such things. They  
should be heard,'' Sen. Patrick Leahy D-Vt, said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's clemency offer to 16 Puerto Rican  
nationalists in August caused a furor, as did New York senatorial 
hopeful Hillary Rodham Clinton's appeal to withdraw it. Most were 
associated with the FALN -- the Spanish initials for the Armed 
Forces of National Liberation -- responsible for a wave of bombings 
in the late 1970s and early 1980s that left six dead. The White 
House has said none of the 16 were involved in acts that resulted 
in deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department, FBI Director Louis Freeh and the U.S.  
attorneys offices in Illinois and Connecticut, where the 
nationalists were prosecuted, were all opposed to their release. 
The Justice Department made its opposition to the release known in 
a 1996 recommendation to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemency is an exclusive power of the president but the Justice  
Department makes recommendations, gathers information and is 
heavily involved in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Also unveiled at hearing was a report from Attorney General  
Janet Reno that said the FALN and its sister group in Puerto Rico, 
Los Macheteros, pose an ``ongoing threat'' to national security. 
</P>
<P>
	``Factors which increase the present threat from these groups  
include renewed activity by a small minority advocating Puerto 
Rican statehood, the 100-year anniversary of the U.S. presence in 
Puerto Rico and the impending release from prisons of members of 
these groups jailed for prior violence,'' said the report. 
</P>
<P>
	This version of the report, the Justice Department's Five-Year  
Interagency Counterterrorism and Technology Crime Plan, was dated 
September 1999, after Clinton's clemency offer, so it appeared to 
refer to the prisoners he released. 
</P>
<P>
	But Holder told a news conference today that the report actually  
was written in December 1998, well before the clemency offer, and 
was ``talking about the possibility that people from among other 
groups, the FALN, were going to be released over the next few 
years'' after finishing their sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	``The attorney general's report clearly did not refer to those  
people (granted clemency), given the fact that they have, as a 
condition of their release, renounced violence,'' Holder said. 
Justice spokeswoman Chris Watney said the version released at the 
hearing was merely a shorter version of the originial 1998 report, 
which was edited in September 1999 to remove classified 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Judiciary hearing, Republicans sparred with Holder and  
Pardon Attorney Roger Adams over seeming violations of Justice 
Department clemency guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	The original request for clemency, for instance, was made by the  
prisoners' lawyer, not the prisoners themselves. Adams acknowledged 
that was ``unusual'' but said it was not unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice officials declined to answer several questions,  
saying they were bound by the White House's claim of executive 
privilege over information specific to the clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	Also presented at the hearing was the transcript of a phone  
conversation one Adolfo Matos, of the Puerto Rican separatists 
freed by Clinton, had in April while still in prison. In the 
conversation, which was taped routine inmate monitoring, Matos 
expresses no remorse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing to be ashamed of or feel that I have to ask for  
forgiveness,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Matos did not mention violence specifically, but added that his  
resolve for his cause had grown while in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``My desire has gotten stronger, to the point where I want to  
continue. Continue to fight and get involved with my people, 
because I love them,'' Matos said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 94.67 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks wobbled to a mixed finish on Wall Street  
today, rebounding from steep losses wrought by IBM's warning that 
worries about the Year 2000 computer bug are hurting hardware 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was down 94.67 at 10,297.69. Earlier in the session, the 
Dow had dipped 213 points. IBM accounted for nearly all of the 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rallied late in the day and ended  
mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 5.81 to 1,283.62, and the Nasdaq  
composite index rose 13.82 to 2,801.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,892 down, 1,160 up and 479 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 984.66 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
917.51 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.33 to 414.27.  
</P>
<P>
	Stocks plunged at the start of trading today in a selloff  
attributed almost entirely to pessimism following IBM's 
disappointing forecast. The company said after the close of trading 
Wednesday that potential buyers of IBM's network and database 
servers are postponing purchases until after the start of the new 
year, when concerns over Year 2000 computer bugs are fully 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from IBM's network and database business dropped 40  
percent in the third quarter, and the weakness is expected to 
continue through the fourth quarter and into January, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of IBM plummeted on the New York Stock Exchange.  
</P>
<P>
	IBM's news robbed the market of the ebullience that drove the  
Dow 187.43 points higher, and the Nasdaq 99.95 points higher, 
yesterday. That rally was sparked almost entirely by Microsoft, 
which released earnings that soundly beat expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft officials attributed the company's strong earnings and  
sales to ``awesome'' demand for personal computers, sparking a 
day-long rally in technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as it was all about Microsoft yesterday, it's all about  
IBM today,'' said Larry Wachtel, a market analyst with Prudential 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's decline set off a slide in a wide range of technology  
stocks. Sun Microsystems, a maker of computer servers, and Computer 
Associates, a major maker of software used to run computer systems, 
fell steeply. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a long food chain involved with IBM, and they're all  
down because of IBM's problems,'' Wachtel said. 
</P>
<P>
	But by midafternoon, investors had begun snapping up technology  
stocks at relative bargains. Also, analysts said, investors turned 
their attention toward good news in the technology sector. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online rose sharply after announcing late Wednesday that  
earnings in its fiscal first quarter tripled from the same period 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL also announced a deal to have its Internet software loaded  
onto computers sold by Gateway, the country's largest direct seller 
of consumer PCs. AOL will invest $800 million over two years in 
Gateway, which rose today. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco stocks fell after an appeals court ruled Wednesday that  
a lump-sum payment may be awarded to plaintiffs in a landmark suit 
against the major tobacco companies. Lawyers for cigarette makers 
say the payment could cripple the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris, another Dow component, fell.  
</P>
<P>
	Also today, the Labor Department reported that 298,000 Americans  
filed new jobless claims for the week ending Oct. 16, up 9,000 from 
the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the increase, the number of newly laid off workers  
remains at historically low levels, stoking fears that the Federal 
Reserve will raise interest rates later this year in its effort to 
cool the economy. Economists say tight labor markets could lead to 
rising wage demands and higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The labor report hampered bond prices. The yield on the 30-year  
Treasury bond hit 6.36 percent, up from 6.33 percent late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is, bond prices still don't look like they've hit  
bottom, and until they do, it will be tough for stocks to rally,'' 
said Steven Goldman, market strategist at Weeden &AMP; Co. in 
Greenwich, Conn.

<HEADLINE> Marino Nisses Practice Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- An ailing Dan Marino missed practice for the  
second consecutive day Thursday, making it less likely he'll play 
Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Dolphins' quarterback is improving but still unable to  
throw well because of spasms and weakness in a muscle between his 
neck and right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	If Marino can't play, Damon Huard will make his first NFL start.  
Huard came off the bench last week and rallied Miami to a 31-30 
victory at New England. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan's getting better,'' coach Jimmy Johnson said. ``We'll make  
the decision Sunday morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino is officially listed as questionable, indicating a 50-50  
chance he'll play. Offensive coordinator Kippy Brown said Marino 
could start without practicing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's practiced enough in his time,'' Brown said with a  
chuckle. ``Dan's been in every meeting and he knows the game plan. 
He could play -- if he's healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But because Marino has missed the week's two most important  
practices, many of his teammates anticipate that Huard will get the 
nod. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that we know Damon is starting, we'll circle the wagons,''  
receiver O.J. McDuffie said. ``He just needs to stay away from 
turnovers and negative plays, and we'll be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles (2-4) have won two in a row. They faced a first-time  
starter at quarterback last week, beating rookie Cade McNown and 
the Chicago Bears 20-16. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins (4-1) are trying to protect their lead in the AFC  
East. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan Marino might be the greatest quarterback of all time, so  
of course they would miss him if he doesn't play,'' Eagles safety 
Brian Dawkins said. ``But Huard played well enough to win a big 
game last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hung there and is taking all of their reps in practice now.  
He looked good to me on tape. But he young and isn't as experienced 
as Dan, so there is a difference.''

<HEADLINE> Knight Cited in Hunting Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOONER, Wis. (AP) -- Indiana basketball coach Bob Knight  
accidentally shot a friend while hunting grouse without a license 
but failed to report the mishap, the state Department of Natural 
Resources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, Thomas Mikunda and two other men were hunting Oct. 12  
when they spotted a grouse, said Dave Zeug, law enforcement 
director for the DNR's northern region. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, 59, told investigators that as he turned to aim at the  
bird, his finger slipped off the shotgun's safety and hit the 
trigger, accidentally firing the gun before he was ready to shoot. 
Shotgun pellets struck Mikunda in the back and upper shoulder, 
causing wounds that were not life-threatening but required medical 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Under state law, Knight was required to report the accident to  
law enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of that investigation, it was determined Knight did  
not have a $43 nonresident small game license and that he also had 
hunted without one last year in Wisconsin, as did two of his 
hunting companions 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, coach at Indiana since 1971, will be cited for failure  
to report a hunting accident and will receive two citations for 
hunting without a license in 1999 and 1998. The fine for each 
citation is $165. His two companions will receive similar 
citations. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight told investigators he didn't think he needed the license  
to hunt on private property. 
</P>
<P>
	An unsigned statement by Indiana University said: ``This is a  
matter that is outside the scope of coach Knight's university 
duties. The university, however, recognizes that matters relating 
to coach Knight receive significant attention. This is an 
unfortunate accident and we are thankful that there was no serious 
injury. The university is confident that coach Knight will respond 
appropriately to resolve this matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight did not immediately return a message to The Associated  
Press left at his office. 
</P>
<P>
	DNR warden Gerald Carow, who is investigating the shooting, said  
he talked to Knight on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's feeling bad that it happened and feels deeply concerned  
over the victim and is willing to pay any penalty,'' Carow said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mikunda, an insurance agent, was not carrying a gun at the time  
of the shooting, which knocked him to the ground and left him 
temporarily dazed, said his mother, Betty Mikunda.

<HEADLINE> Banta To Open Three Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MENASHA, Wis. (AP) -- Banta Corp. plans to open three plants in  
Houston, Singapore and The Netherlands and will hire about 700 
workers. Banta is making the moves after getting a $600 million to 
$800 million from Compaq Computer to configure, test, package, 
inventory and ship Compaq hard drives and other storage components 
to markets worldwide, chairman Donald D. Belcher said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The plants in Houston, Singapore and Amersfoort will be in full  
operation by next spring, Banta said. The European facilities are 
scheduled to begin serving Compaq early next year. Banta's new 
Asian operation in Singapore is scheduled to open during second 
quarter of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's recently constructed Global Turnkey Group facility  
in Houston will begin operating under the contract next month, 
serving Compaq's needs in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract recaptures the 650 jobs Banta eliminated in a  
restructuring move last spring that was blamed on slumping stock 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Banta will serve Compaq's European requirements from its  
existing Global Turnkey operations in Europe and open the new 
facility in Amersfoort.

<HEADLINE> `Saturday Night Fever' on Broadway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When John Travolta strutted down a Brooklyn  
street more than two decades ago in the opening sequence of 
``Saturday Night Fever,'' a star was born and disco had the movie 
that would keep it in the public's consciousness for the next 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Cashing in on that memory, movie producer Robert Stigwood has  
transferred ``Fever'' to the stage -- first in London, where it has 
been running since May 1998, and now on Broadway, where the musical 
swiveled into the Minskoff Theater on Thursday and promptly tripped 
over its tight, flared, polyester pants and platform heels. 
</P>
<P>
	In turning ``Saturday Night Fever'' into a theater piece,  
something has been lost. That's surprising since adapter Nan 
Knighton seems to have lifted large chunks of dialogue directly 
from the film. What she has removed, though, are its heart and 
soul. 
</P>
<P>
	This cold ``Fever'' is for people who want a live-action  
postcard of the motion picture. The story is there, but it hasn't 
been translated with any stagecraft that would make it a viable 
theatrical entity in its own right. 
</P>
<P>
	Our young hero, Tony Manero, yearns to dance, living only for  
the time he spends at a Bay Ridge disco called 2001 Odyssey. By 
day, he works at a dead-end job in a paint store; at night, he's 
king of the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony is a cocky lad, spurning the advances of Annette, who moons  
over him with an intensity that is downright scary. He's also the 
leader of loose-knit group of guys, whose insecurities match his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony finds his machismo challenged when he meets Stephanie, an  
older woman (well, by a year or two anyway) who has a job in fabled 
Manhattan, working for a record producer. She considers herself a 
woman of the world, but her fears and frustrations are just as big 
as Tony's. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie sweetly depicted their halting relationship, with  
Travolta and Karen Lynn Gorney beautifully playing off each other. 
</P>
<P>
	As Broadway's Tony Manero, James Carpinello has a tough act to  
follow. As anyone knows who saw his performance in off-Broadway's 
``Stupid Kids,'' Carpinello can command a stage. He has a more 
difficult time here. The wiry actor sings modestly and, what's 
worse, is a cautious dancer, making all the struts, swivels, kicks 
and splits look hard rather than easy. 
</P>
<P>
	Director and choreographer Arlene Phillips has devised dances  
that are more aerobic than inspired. Her big production numbers 
look like gym class at the local high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Paige Price, a seductive Stephanie, moves with style, but she  
and Carpinello display little chemistry, either on or off the dance 
floor. Vocally, Orfeh, who portrays the forlorn Annette, dominates 
the show with pipes that blast their way through ``If I Can't Have 
You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bee Gees' memorable score was an important part of the  
movie's success. It was never sung by the characters, but was heard 
on the soundtrack as musical commentary to what was happening on 
screen. Now, the characters sing these classics, and some of the 
pairings of people and songs are just wrongheaded. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, when the two would-be lovers decide to just be  
friends, they break into ``How Deep is Your Love,'' the oddest song 
placement in the musical. 
</P>
<P>
	The large supporting cast doesn't get a chance to make much of  
an impression. Paul Castree, as the doomed Bobby C, telegraphs his 
demise from the moment he walks on stage and also gets saddled with 
the most obvious number in the show, ``Tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Batt injects some fleeting moments of humor into the  
evening as the lewd disco dance instructor Monty. Fun is in such 
short supply that even Tony's volatile home life, played very 
broadly, gets laughs. 
</P>
<P>
	Designer Robin Wagner's giant sets are just as cold as the show,  
although his massive backdrop of the Verrazano Narrows Bridge, 
traversed by tiny automobiles, is visually striking. 
</P>
<P>
	Undoubtedly, ``Saturday Night Fever'' will run. Its advance sale  
has passed the $20-million mark. For many people, the fact that the 
musical recalls the movie will be more than enough. Those looking 
for a genuine theater experience will have to search elsewhere.

<HEADLINE>  Young's Future Tied to Salary Cap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young's decision on whether to  
leave football might hinge on more than his health. 
</P>
<P>
	The salary cap of the San Francisco 49ers is certain to figure  
into the timing of any retirement announcement by the star 
quarterback, USA Today reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Money considerations) could certainly be a factor,'' 49ers  
general manager Bill Walsh said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers have declined comment about Young's future while he  
seeks additional medical opinions. Young sustained his fourth 
concussion in three years Sept. 27 against Arizona and is sidelined 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	If Young were to announce his retirement in the near future,  
salary-cap rules would force the team to make deep cuts in the 
player payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because his early retirement would force the team to  
account for Young's six-year, $45 million salary over a shorter 
period. If done too early, it could raise the team's payroll above 
the $57.3 million cap imposed by the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	One possibility is for the 49ers is to place Young on the  
injured-reserve list, which would require him to sit out the rest 
of the season. The long rest could give Young an opportunity to 
shake off his postconcussion symptoms and eventually return to the 
game, as he said he wants to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are several reasons a definitive resolution might not come  
soon: 
</P>
<P>
	--If Young were to retire before June 1, the already financially  
strapped team would take a $5 million salary cap hit. The team 
would then have just a week to get under the cap. 
</P>
<P>
	--If Young were to wait until after June 1 to retire, the 49ers  
would have just a $1.2 million salary-cap hit for next season. 
Young would then cost the cap nearly $3.8 million in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	--If Young were to announce his retirement next week when the  
49ers have a bye, he would lose 10/17th of his $6.25 million salary 
this year: a total of nearly $3.7 million.

<HEADLINE> Women for Giuliani Poke Fun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Women for Rudy'' was the theme of Thursday's  
fund-raiser for Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's likely U.S. 
Senate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	But judging from the buttons everyone wore with a slash through  
the first lady's name and face, the event could have been called 
``Women against Hillary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Rep. Susan Molinari, the emcee, said the 1,600 women who  
attended the hotel breakfast were there ``to send a message to 
somebody else who thinks she can come in from Arkansas and 
Washington and say she speaks now for all her 'fellow New 
Yorkers.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Molinari added: ``We're New Yorkers. We're not that dumb.''  
</P>
<P>
	Among those attending the $100,000 fund-raiser were comedienne  
Joan Rivers, socialite Georgette Mosbacher and the mayor's former 
press secretary Cristyne Lategano. The mayor's wife, Donna Hanover, 
did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, for his part, tried to soften his image as a  
tough-talking crime-buster for the feminine audience. He portrayed 
the crime reductions during his tenure as particularly liberating 
for women who had been fearful of becoming victims. He also 
defended his welfare-to-work policies as a way of replacing 
hand-outs with self-reliance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I care about people,'' Giuliani insisted. ``I love them.''  
</P>
<P>
	But he said he is most frustrated when his policies and programs  
are viewed as being harsh or cruel. ``It's what's wrong with the 
opposition philosophy. They don't really understand compassion,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani also reiterated his support for school vouchers as a  
way of helping children trapped in failing public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton supports welfare reform, but opposes school  
vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Molinari derided the first lady's frequent appearances in  
New York State as ``months of listening'' compared to ``months of 
action by Mayor Giuliani.'' Mrs. Clinton, Giuliani's likely 
Democratic opponent in the Senate race, has been on a ``listening 
tour'' around the state since early summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Mrs. Clinton's claim of being a longtime Yankees fan --  
despite the fact that she has never lived in New York -- came under 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Harrison, co-chair of the Republican National Committee and  
a native New Yorker, wore a Yankees cap as she praised the mayor, 
then added: ``Anyone who would lie about being a Yankees fan 
shouldn't be trusted with a seat in the U.S. Senate, much less a 
seat in the house that Babe Ruth built.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Molinari noted that Marist College polls have shown  
Giuliani's support growing among women. In January, 58 percent of 
women supported Mrs. Clinton, compared to 34 percent for Giuliani. 
A September poll had them tied among women. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a Republican, that's amazing,'' Ms. Molinari said.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Kid's Rail Death Is a Homicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SELIGMAN, Mo. (AP) -- Authorities have begun investigating the  
suspicious death of a 14-year-old boy who was hit by a train after 
he was either knocked unconscious or killed and put on the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Hocutt, an eighth-grader at Southwest High School, was  
last seen being chased away from his girlfriend's house by her 
father about 4 a.m. on Oct. 8, about two hours before he was hit by 
a freight train, authorities said. His body was found a day later. 
</P>
<P>
	``This young man was not on the tracks by his own means,'' said  
Ron Sparks, director of special investigations for the 
Arkansas-Missouri Railroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, everyone is still a suspect,'' said Capt. James  
Smith of the Barry County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities began investigating the case as a homicide after  
being given conflicting statements from several people, Smith said. 
An autopsy showed Hocutt had no alcohol or drugs in his system. 
</P>
<P>
	Hocutt had lived in Seligman, a town of fewer than 600 people  
near the Arkansas line, for only a few months before his death. No 
one was at Hocutt's home Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hocutt hadn't been home since Oct. 7, according to his parents,  
who told authorities that they didn't report their son missing 
because they thought he was staying at another boy's home. 
</P>
<P>
	``That really wasn't uncommon for that family,'' Smith said.  
``He was allowed to roam probably more than he should have been.''

<HEADLINE> Steel Imports Down for Second Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steel imports fell in September, for the  
second consecutive month, the Commerce Department said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 percent one-month decline followed a 5 percent drop in  
August. It represents a 24 percent drop from September 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Mastel, an economist with the New America Foundation, said  
the data indicates that anti-dumping lawsuits are having an impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``The many cases are beginning to bite,'' he said. ``The United  
States steel industry will see good news in this -- though any 
single month is not necessarily indicative of a trend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The August and September declines followed a 6 percent increase  
in July and a 9 percent decrease in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports of hot-rolled and cut-to-length plate steel increased  
from August. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports of cold-rolled, wire rod, heavy structurals and  
semifinished steel declined from their August levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall steel imports fell 13.8 percent during the first nine  
months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports from Japan fell 31.8 percent from August and imports  
from Indonesia fell 60 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, said he was not satisfied with the decline  
and would work to bring imports down further. 
</P>
<P>
	The worsening trade deficit has translated into major political  
headaches for President Clinton, with critics charging it 
highlights the failure of the administration's free trade policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the loudest criticism has come from the U.S. steel  
industry, which has won a number of anti-dumping rulings that steel 
from Japan and other countries was being sold in the U.S. market at 
unfairly low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese Trade Minister Takashi Fukaya said Wednesday in Tokyo  
that Japan will complain to the World Trade Organization that the 
steel cases involving 20 foreign countries are in violation of WTO 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky  
promised to defend America's anti-dumping laws.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Bond Prices Slip / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices slipped Thursday in advance  
of a big sale of notes by Ford Motor Credit that will compete for 
traders' dollars. With the decline, long-term yields returned to a 
two-year high. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/16  
point, or $3.12 1/2 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
	Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.35  
percent from 6.33 percent Wednesday. That matched the 6.35 percent 
yield reached Tuesday, the highest level for long-term Treasurys 
since the 6.42 percent of Oct. 22, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	With no major economic reports due until next week, traders  
focused on competition to Treasurys from a $5 billion issue of Ford 
Motor Credit notes coming to market. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were unchanged to down 1/16 point, and intermediate maturities were 
down 3/32 point to 1/8 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.11 percent as the  
discount fell 0.01 percentage point from Wednesday to 4.97 percent. 
Six-month yields were 5.25 percent, as the discount rose 0.02 
percentage point to 5.04 percent. One-year yields were 5.46 percent 
as the discount rose 0.01 percentage point to 5.17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.25 percent from 4.88 percent Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds was unchanged from Wednesday at 108 9/16. 
The average yield to maturity held at 6.13 percent.

<HEADLINE> Jets' Williams' Condition Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Jets defensive back Kevin Williams,  
hospitalized with a mysterious throat ailment, could be taken off a 
respirator by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Jets coach Bill Parcells, who said doctors are ``cautiously  
optimistic'' about Williams' condition, said the player improved on 
Thursday. But Williams still is heavily sedated. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-year cornerback was hospitalized when the Jets  
returned from a game in Denver on Oct. 3. His condition steadily 
worsened, and earlier this week, he was placed on the reserve, 
non-football injury list, causing a stir because the Jets aren't 
obligated to pay Williams for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells said the team will pay Williams half of his remaining  
salary, which would amount to about $162,000.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Navy Officers Wronged Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A U.S. military court ruled that Navy security  
officers used excessive force when they shackled an American murder 
suspect with handcuffs and leg irons for eight days, a Navy 
spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers held Columbia R. Shiloh, who had pleaded guilty to  
the 1997 killing of the wife of a Navy airman, at two hospitals in 
Japan after he attempted suicide in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. D. Michael Hinkley, the military judge presiding over  
Shiloh's sentencing, ruled on Wednesday that the method was 
unreasonable, especially when he was under guard and in a secured 
room, said Michael Chase, spokesman at the U.S. Naval base in 
Yokosuka. 
</P>
<P>
	Shiloh, 38, a dental technician who worked at the base, was held  
for five days at the U.S. Naval Hospital in Yokosuka and three days 
at the Yokohama City University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Shiloh was sentenced Thursday to 25 years in prison for  
strangling Wakana Brock, 24, in an off-base apartment outside 
Tokyo. She was married to airman Jonathan Brock. 
</P>
<P>
	Shiloh, of Cordele, Ga., was arrested in March 1997 and held at  
the Yokosuka base until he tried to hang himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy base, the headquarters of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, is 28  
miles southwest of Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> West Timor Border Tensions Heat Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Tensions on the West Timor border heated  
up further Thursday, with international peacekeepers reinforcing 
their ranks along the frontier following a surge of militia 
incursions into East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 more peacekeeping troops moved into position early  
Thursday near the border to blunt the push by the pro-Indonesian 
militiamen and to protect refugees returning from West Timor, said 
Col. Mark Kelly, spokesman for the 16-nation peacekeeping force. 
West Timor is controlled by Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of stepped-up activity by anti-independence militias came a  
day after Indonesian lawmakers agreed to accept the results of East 
Timor's Aug. 30 independence referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	Peacekeepers said it was too early to say whether the militia  
incursions were connected to the lawmakers' vote, in which the 
Jakarta government effectively relinquished its claim to East 
Timor. A United Nations transition team is expected to assume 
control of the territory by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Some had feared the Indonesian vote would trigger a fresh  
rampage by the militias, who went on a spree of burning, looting 
and intimidation last month after a referendum in which East 
Timorese overwhelmingly favored independence. 
</P>
<P>
	About one-third of the territory's 850,000 people fled or were  
driven from their homes during the violence. More than 250,000 
ended up in neighboring West Timor, and militiamen have been 
harassing those who began returning on foot across the border two 
days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly said soldiers from the multinational force heard shots  
fired near the border on at least one occasion and believed 
militiamen were responsible, but it was not clear who was being 
targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	Early Thursday near the port town of Suai, British  
reconnaissance patrols spotted 20 militiamen coming across the 
frontier in trucks. The peacekeepers sent a force in response, 
Kelly said, but the paramilitaries went back across the border 
before it arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly want our presence there to deter'' such  
incursions, he said, adding that peacekeepers have intensified 
round-the-clock patrols, both by land and by air. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly refused to say when or how peacekeepers would move into  
the enclave of Oecussi, where the pro-independence Falintil rebel 
group says civilians are being terrorized and killed by the 
militias. Peacekeepers would have to go in by sea or air since the 
enclave has no land border with East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Humanitarian officials, meanwhile, said the flow of refugees  
across the border over the past two days stopped early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials say there is a heavy militia presence in refugee  
camps just across the border that is limiting the refugees' 
movement. They believe the exodus of 2,000 people over the past two 
days came after the Indonesian army forced militia members to leave 
one camp, freeing the refugees to head for home. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear why the military appeared to be cooperating,  
but U.N. officials predicted the process would be repeated 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands more refugees were believed to be waiting to cross  
over on foot, said Jacques Franquin of the U.N. High Commissioner 
for Refugees. Also, the first ship carrying refugees was to arrive 
Friday in Dili with 2,000 people aboard, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daily flights over the past two weeks have brought in several  
thousand other returnees.

<HEADLINE> Davidian Lawyers Want To Test Theory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a high-stakes challenge to the government,  
lawyers for survivors of the 1993 Waco siege are offering to put to 
the test their claim that federal agents fired into the Branch 
Davidian compound during the deadly standoff's final hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The lead lawyer in a wrongful-death lawsuit filed against the  
government proposed Wednesday to stage a demonstration -- attended 
by experts for the FBI, Congress and the special counsel 
investigating Waco -- recreating conditions similar to those present 
when the FBI recorded aerial infrared footage of the siege's final 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results of this demonstration will prove conclusively that  
the only possible explanation for the flashes seen on the FBI 
(infrared) tapes from April 19, 1993 is government gunfire,'' 
Houston lawyer Michael Caddell wrote the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI cautioned that it would be ``near impossible'' to  
duplicate conditions -- particularly since the plaintiffs lack 
crucial information about the altitude of the FBI plane that flew 
over the Texas compound, the infrared camera's design 
specifications and film speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Furor over Waco was touched off anew in late August, with the  
FBI's belated admission that potentially incendiary tear gas 
canisters were fired hours before the Davidians' retreat erupted in 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional inquiries are underway and Attorney General Janet  
Reno appointed a special counsel who has said he will examine 
Waco's ``dark questions'' -- including whether federal agents fired 
shots on the final day. 
</P>
<P>
	The government long has insisted FBI agents did not fire any  
shots during the 51-day siege. Some 80 Davidians died April 19, 
some from the fire, others from gunshot wounds. Federal officials 
concluded the gunshot victims killed themselves or died at the 
hands of sect members intent on fulfilling a prophecy of mass 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	But Caddell and his allies, who are prepared to go to trial next  
spring, contend the infrared surveillance footage offers 
``irrefutable'' proof that federal forces fired into the building 
during the standoff's waning hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department provided little reaction to the offer.  
``We'll have to review the letter,'' said department spokesman 
Myron Marlin, declining further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	But an FBI official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it  
would be ``near impossible'' to recreate the exact conditions 
present that day. 
</P>
<P>
	Caddell has been stymied in his campaign to learn more about the  
infrared camera. The Justice Department refused to provide the 
information, saying the camera's specifications are classified. 
</P>
<P>
	In his letter, Caddell said he merely requires confirmation that  
an infrared camera in the plaintiffs' possession is similar to the 
one the FBI used. With such confirmation, he proposed to use a 
plane similar to the FBI's ``Nightstalker'' aircraft to fly over a 
Dallas area firing range, recording infrared images of gunfire from 
weapons similar to those carried by Davidians and federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI source said details of the infrared equipment, used in  
sensitive law enforcement cases, must be shielded to keep the 
technology viable. ``The assumption would be (the plaintiffs' 
lawyers) are trying to use the media to force what they could not 
get'' through discovery, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the FBI questioned the proposed demonstration's worth, a  
spokesman for a congressional panel that is investigating Waco 
suggested a test could have merit. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Government Reform Committee would ``welcome a  
scientific test that would enable us to do a side-by-side analysis 
with the FBI (infrared) tape,'' spokesman Mark Corallo said. 
</P>
<P>
	An infrared expert retained by the committee, as well as others  
consulted by the plaintiffs and several media organizations, have 
concluded that bursts of light on the FBI's tapes represent gunfire 
from government positions, Caddell noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only `experts' who dispute these conclusions are on the  
government's payroll,'' he added, deriding government theories that 
the light flashes represent sunlight glinting off water puddles, 
metal shards or debris. 
</P>
<P>
	But the president of a Maryland laboratory to whom FBI officials  
have steered reporters reiterated his lab's view -- held since its 
experts first examined the tapes in 1997 at a newspaper's request -- 
that the flashes don't represent gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's purported to be gunfire, we don't believe is gunfire,''  
said Norris J. Krone Jr., president of the Maryland Advanced 
Development Laboratory. He declined to discuss whether FBI or 
Justice have contracted with his lab regarding Waco.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Senator a Passionate Pro-Lifer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Rick Santorum, a driving force behind  
legislation to ban certain late-term abortions, fumes when 
opponents suggest he can't relate to the plight of pregnant parents 
faced with such a difficult choice. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Santorum and his pregnant wife twice rejected the idea  
of a late-term abortion even though they knew their fetus had a 
defect and would die after birth. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son, who died, was not perfect in the eyes of this world,''  
Santorum, a Pennsylvania Republican and Roman Catholic, said 
Thursday from the Senate floor in fiery defense of his bill. ``But 
he was perfect to me. He was perfect to my wife. And, most 
importantly, he was perfect in God's eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors presented the option less than two weeks after Santorum  
led an unsuccessful fight to override a presidential veto of a bill 
that would have outlawed what opponents call partial-birth 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	The override attempt failed, just as it is expected to do should  
his bill pass Congress this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum says he discarded a ``laissez faire'' attitude on  
abortion after consulting physicians during his first campaign for 
Congress in 1990. The medical procedure, in all its versions, 
amounts to killing an unborn human, he believes. Abortion should be 
banned except in the case of rape, incest and when the life of the 
mother is in danger, Santorum says. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence prompted me to change my views,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said banning late-term abortions is in keeping with the U.S.  
Supreme Court's 1973 ruling in Roe vs. Wade that allows 
restrictions on abortion when the fetus is determined to be viable 
in the second and third trimesters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has passed a proposed ban on late-term abortions  
twice before, but both times has fallen short of the 67 votes 
needed to override President Clinton's veto. Santorum said he is 
optimistic that the addition of several new senators could provide 
the votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Santorum faces a difficult re-election fight next year,  
several political analysts said his position on this issue would 
not affect the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state is very divided on the issue,'' said Temple  
University political scientist Robin Kolodny. ``Though there are 
Republicans who use choice as a make-or-break issue, it's a very 
Catholic state in some areas.''

<HEADLINE> Merck Hits Earnings Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Merck &AMP; Co. met Wall Street's third-quarter earnings forecasts,  
but rivals SmithKline Beecham and Monsanto fell just short of 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	A look at the companies' results:  

</P>
<P>
                            *Merck &AMP; Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	Merck's third-quarter profit rose 13 percent, driven by rising  
sales of its top-selling prescription drug, the 
cholesterol-lowering pill Zocor. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck, the world's largest pharmaceutical company, reported  
Thursday it earned $1.54 billion in the quarter, or 64 cents a 
share, compared to $1.37 billion, or 56 cents per share, a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Results matched forecasts of analysts surveyed by First  
Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 20 percent to $8.2 billion from $6.84 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Zocor rose 17 percent to $1.16 billion, an improvement  
from the drug's recent growth rate of 11 percent to 12 percent. 
Although Zocor is the second best selling drug in the world it has 
lost market share in the United States to Lipitor, a cholesterol 
drug co-marketed by Warner-Lambert and Pfizer. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck's double-digit sales growth was also attributed to the  
hypertension drug Cozaar and companion Hyzaar, which together had a 
sales increase of 27 percent, to $350 million. Sales of Fosamax, an 
osteoporosis drug, rose 44 percent to $280 million. 
</P>
<P>
	On the downside, Merck's other hypertension drug Vasotec and  
companion Vaseretic together had a sales increase of just 5 
percent, to $485 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck's heavily advertised male baldness pill Propecia had flat  
sales of $45 million. Propecia sales have been flat the past three 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Vioxx, the company's new arthritis pain drug introduced  
this summer, came to $111 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, Merck earned $4.32 billion or  
$1.79 per share, compared to $3.85 billion or $1.57 per share, a 
year ago. Sales rose 23 percent to $23.75 billion from $19.37 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Whitehouse Station, N.J.-based Merck rose $2.44 to  
$78.13 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                        *SmithKline Beecham    	
</P>
<P>
	British drugmaker SmithKline Beecham PLC said its third-quarter  
profits rose 10 percent, driven by sales of its new diabetes drug 
Avandia, its antibiotic Augmentin and new vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
	But even as the company reported good sales for Avandia,  
SmithKline said the drug was given a negative opinion by a European 
advisory panel. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline said it earned $486 million, or 44 cents a share,  
compared to $441 million, or 40 cents a share, in the same quarter 
a year earlier. Results fell a penny short of forecasts of analysts 
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell 6 percent to $3.05 billion from $3.27 billion,  
largely related to the company selling its laboratory and pharmacy 
benefits businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline, whose U.S. headquarters are in Philadelphia, said  
the sales and profit figures excluded a $238 million special charge 
during the third quarter relating to a restructuring earlier in the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline declined to comment Thursday on the specific reason  
why an advisory panel to a European drug regulator gave Avandia a 
negative opinion. Approval by the panel, the European Committee for 
Proprietary Medicinal Products, is a key step in gaining permission 
to market the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	The news sent shares of SmithKline plummeting $7.81, or 12  
percent, to $59.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	New product sales increased 34 percent, including Avandia, which  
was launched in the United States this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall U.S. pharmaceutical sales rose 4 percent. Sales of the  
antidepressant Paxil rose 4 percent to $471 million, while sales of 
the antibiotic Augmentin rose 4 percent to $358 million. 
</P>
<P>
	New vaccines sales, including a combination hepatitis A and B  
vaccine, rose 34 percent to $189 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, the company reported  
earnings of $1.46 billion, or $1.33 a share, compared with earnings 
of $1.3 billion, or $1.18 a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 5 percent to $9.93 billion from $9.58 billion.  

</P>
<P>
                           *Monsanto Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto's operating earnings plummeted 33 percent as rising  
pharmaceutical sales could not overcome falling agricultural 
products sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding special charges, St. Louis-based Monsanto earned $58  
million, or 9 cents per share, compared to $87 million, or 14 cents 
per share, a year ago. Results fell a penny short of Wall Street 
estimates, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest quarter, Monsanto had a $61 million gain from the  
reversal of a restructuring charge and a $75 million charge 
associated with combining its agricultural chemcial and seed 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Including special charges and discontinued opertaions, the  
company had net earnings of $49 million, or 8 cents per share, 
compared to a net loss of $100 million, or 17 cents per share, a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the quarter rose 11 percent to $1.9 billion from $1.7  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's Celebrex arthritis drug had sales increase 25  
percent to $398 million from $318 million in the second quarter. 
Celebrex, introduced in January, has become the hottest selling new 
drug in pharmaceutical history. 
</P>
<P>
	Agricultural sales rose 10 percent to $951 million from $868  
million a year ago, but excluding unusual items the unit lost $25 
million, compared to a gain of $103 million in the year earlier 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's Searle drug division had sales increase 21 percent  
to $971 million from $802 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first nine months of 1999. excluding unusual items, the  
company earned $481 million or 74 cents per share, compared to $479 
million or 76 cents per share a year ago. Sales rose 24 percent to 
$6.8 billion from $5.5 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Monsanto rose 69 cents to $38.88 in New York Stock  
Exchange trading.

<HEADLINE> Disney Bans Tobacco Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co. has banned tobacco  
sales at its domestic theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco sales stopped Sept. 3 at Disneyland in Anaheim,  
spokesman Ray Gomez said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Walt Disney World in Florida stopped  
cigarette sales at the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney-MGM Studios and 
Animal Kingdom parks in Orlando. Sales are still allowed at 
Disney's hotels, restaurants, and clubs near the parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors to all Disney parks are currently allowed to smoke in  
open public areas, but lit cigarettes are banned from indoor areas 
and ride lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Gomez would not say whether stopping tobacco sales would lead to  
a smoking ban. He said Disney would consider complaints from 
smokers and non-smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smoking and tobacco are obviously an issue in theme parks. We  
will continue to monitor the issue, but we are not ready to make 
any announcements,'' Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Disneyland boasted its own tobacco shop until 1990, the  
company has gradually increased restrictions as public tolerance of 
smoking diminished.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Offers Youth Poverty Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Calling child poverty a hidden, ``slow-motion  
national disaster,'' Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley 
offered a $9.8 billion prescription today to lift family incomes 
through automatic, annual increases in the minimum wage and 
expanded tax credits and child care subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	He also proposed new government programs to recruit 60,000  
teachers into poor school districts and give children an 
after-hours school hangout seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do not look to raise the poorest children among us we  
have no heart. And if we do not nourish the spirit of our children, 
we have no soul,'' Bradley told teachers, students and social 
workers at a Brooklyn church. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 13.5 million American children live in poverty,  
defined by the government as a yearly income of $16,400 or less for 
a family of four. That population has shrunk from 15.3 million when 
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore took office in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``Child poverty is a kind of slow-motion national disaster,''  
Bradley said. ``We don't see it because it is usually hidden.'' He 
optimistically committed to halving the number of impoverished 
children by the end of his second term, if elected. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning sentence-by-sentence applause for each of his proposals,  
Bradley nonetheless stumbled several times over the words of his 
text. ``It doesn't look like it was rehearsed,'' Uzette Wint, a 
25-year-old social worker, said approvingly. ``Seems like it was 
from the heart. What he's talking about, that's reality for us 
parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the speech, Bradley and Gore, his rival for the Democratic  
presidential nomination, continued to circle each other. Gore 
jumped ahead of the former New Jersey senator Wednesday by 
announcing his own ideas on child poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	Both candidates also were giving environmental speeches this  
week, eager to air their positions on their own terms before their 
first debate next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore argued that the best way to reduce poverty is to enforce  
child support and get more fathers involved in parenting. Echoing 
his common criticism of Gore's proposals as small and ``timid,'' 
Bradley cast his anti-poverty plan as more comprehensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only an indifferent moral universe can feel satisfied with  
ourselves when there's nearly 1 in 5 American children still in 
poverty,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's office countered that Bradley was offering warmed-over  
Clinton administration proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Bradley is choosing to be an echo to Al Gore's voice  
in proposing policy that Al Gore has already been fighting -- the 
minimum wage increase, more teachers and tax credits for working 
poor,'' spokesman Chris Lehane said. The vice president has been an 
advocate for all three issues, though the administration's minimum 
wage proposal is not as sweeping as Bradley's. 
</P>
<P>
	As with the massive health insurance plan he proposed earlier,  
Bradley's anti-poverty plan, priced at $9.8 billion annually, would 
be paid for out of the federal budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	To end the predictable political fight over the minimum wage, he  
proposed increasing it by $1 over two years -- a position he shares 
with Gore -- but then writing into law an automatic annual increase 
indexed to growth in the nation's median wage. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who voted against the Republicans' 1996 welfare  
overhaul that President Clinton signed into law, also proposed 
``fixing'' the provision requiring welfare mothers to let states 
collect and keep due child support. He would give welfare 
recipients whatever child support is collected from fathers who 
don't pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Over accusations by the Gore campaign that Bradley stood in the  
way when the Clinton administration pushed in 1993 for a bigger 
expansion in the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income working 
parents, Bradley suggested making more families eligible for the 
credit and increasing the amount of the credit due them. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, he proposed:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Making the popular Dependent Care tax credit (for up to $1,440  
in annual child care expenses for a family with two children) fully 
refundable so that poor parents owing little or no income tax get 
the full amount of the credit as a cash refund. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Expanding by $1 billion -- to $4.3 billion each year -- the  
child care subsidies available through a block grant program that 
currently reaches just 1 in 7 eligible children. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Allowing people eligible for food stamps to apply for them at  
more accessible locations, such as grocery stores, and during more 
convenient ``off'' hours. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Boosting funds for Head Start to enroll an additional 400,000  
children. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Creating a ``Teach to Reach'' program of student loan  
forgiveness for 60,000 college students, high school graduates and 
mid-career professionals who certify as teachers and commit to 
serving in poor urban or rural schools. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Starting national programs of after-school community centers  
to keep kids safe and productively occupied outside the normal 
school day, and ``second-chance homes'' where teen mothers can 
learn parenting skills and get job training and housing referrals, 
meant to reduce the teen pregnancy rate.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Court Out of Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is asking the  
Supreme Court to back out of a big-bucks battle over states selling 
information -- such as people's addresses and telephone numbers -- 
from driver's licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief made public by the court Thursday, Solicitor General  
Seth Waxman said the anticipated constitutional showdown ``has 
something of an academic tenor at the present time'' because of a 
law President Clinton signed earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices in May granted a Justice Department appeal and  
agreed to review a South Carolina dispute over a federal law that 
closes state motor vehicle records to the public. A federal appeals 
court had ruled in that case that Congress usurped states' 
authority when it enacted the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, which took effect in most states in 1997, bars states  
and their employees from releasing personal information from motor 
vehicle records. States routinely have sold such information to 
businesses and political candidates, earning millions of dollars in 
revenue each year. 
</P>
<P>
	When the law was enacted in response to the 1989 killing of  
actress Rebecca Schaeffer by a stalker, 34 states were making motor 
vehicle records public in some form. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue in the South Carolina case, scheduled to be argued  
before the nation's highest court on Nov. 10, is whether Congress' 
power to regulate interstate commerce gives it the authority to 
demand states keep motor vehicles records private. 
</P>
<P>
	But Waxman said the new law, which essentially imposes the same  
restrictions on states, is not tied to Congress' power over 
commerce. Instead, it is based on Congress' far-broader power over 
spending -- the restrictions apply to any state receiving federal 
transportation funds. 
</P>
<P>
	As written, the law's restrictions linked to federal spending  
are to take effect 90 days after the Supreme Court's final 
disposition of the South Carolina case. 
</P>
<P>
	Waxman said that means that even if the court were to rule that  
the 1994 law exceeded Congress' authority, South Carolina and all 
other states would have to comply ``with the very same restrictions 
on disclosure as a condition to its receipt of federal 
transportation funds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waxman said the court ``may wish ... to consider'' setting aside  
the federal appeals court's ruling and sending the South Carolina 
case back for more study in light of the new law. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Reno vs. Condon, 98-1464.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Aims To Save Rare Antelope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To the fashion world, shahtoosh means  
ultra-chic, ultra-expensive, the ``king of wools.'' To wildlife 
protection groups, it spells disaster for an endangered Tibetan 
antelope. 
</P>
<P>
	Enlisting the aid of model Shalom Harlow, the World Wildlife  
Fund and the Wildlife Conservation Society are launching a campaign 
Thursday to stop the use of the illegal luxury fiber made from the 
wool of the Tibetan chiru antelope. 
</P>
<P>
	Shahtoosh shawls, priced up to $15,000, are said to be so fine  
that even a large one can be pulled through a wedding ring; thus 
the name ``ring shawl,'' once used only as a traditional dowry item 
in Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign comes amid reports that as a federal grand jury in  
New Jersey has subpoenaed model Christie Brinkley and dozens of 
other high-fashion figures in an investigation of antelope 
poaching. They were said to have bought shahtoosh shawls at a 
charity function in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, representatives of China, France, India, Nepal, Britain  
and the United States met last week in China to discuss 
conservation of the Tibetan antelope. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade of shahtoosh items has been illegal in the United States  
and in most other countries since 1979, but it has shown up 
recently in exclusive shops around the world and in private sales, 
the conservationist groups claim. 
</P>
<P>
	As a fairly luxurious substitute, Harlow suggested pashmina,  
made from a nonendangered Tibetan mountain goat. The cost would run 
about $300 for a typical shawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the antelope, the goats do not have to be killed to  
obtain the fiber, said Kerry Green Zobor, fund spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people claim the fiber for shahtoosh was gathered off  
rocks and bushes where the animals graze, but that's not true. 
They're being killed at the rate of 20,000 a year,'' Zobor in an 
interview. With no more than 70,000 in the wild, they could become 
extinct in a few years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The antelopes are slaughtered on the Tibetan plateau in China  
and their hides are taken to Kashmir, India, where the fiber is 
extracted and loomed into clothing bound for clandestine markets in 
Hong Kong, New York, Paris and elsewhere, Zobor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The demand for shahtoosh is the single greatest threat to the  
survival of the Tibetan antelope,'' said Ginette Hemley, fund vice 
president for species conservation. ``But we can stop this savage 
trade if consumers refuse to buy and wear shahtoosh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a Chinese court sentenced a farmer to 12 years in  
prison for poaching 88 Tibetan chiru antelope, according to the 
state-run Xinhua News Agency. The farmer got the equivalent of $63 
each for the rare hides.

<HEADLINE> Warrick's Future Still on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Peter Warrick's football future  
remained on hold today, but the Florida State star probably won't 
play Saturday against Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight day, he received a court postponement on  
a plea agreement in connection with a department store scam. His 
lawyer wants to make sure Warrick can rejoin the top-ranked 
Seminoles after his legal problems are settled. And that requires 
the approval of the university president. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick is to return to court Nov. 4, but the judge said the  
parties can return sooner if they have reached an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I enter a plea that is acceptable to the court and is  
acceptable to the state attorney's office, but won't help him get 
back on the field, it's not going to make Peter Warrick very 
happy,'' lawyer John Kenny said today. ``So I've got to try to work 
between the state attorney's office and the university. And right 
now I don't have that set in concrete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick's return apparently now depends on Florida State  
president Sandy D'Alemberte. D'Alemberte spoke by phone Wednesday 
with athletic director Dave Hart and general counsel Alan Sundberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny said he has spoken with Sundberg and is ``trying to nail  
down exactly what they find acceptable in terms and conditions that 
will allow him to play again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be speaking to him again this morning to try to  
find out what exactly, what terms would be acceptable to him and to 
Sandy D'Alemberte,'' Kenny said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating for everybody,'' Kenny said. ``I need to go  
talk to Peter right now, I need to meet to the university ... and 
try to make sure that I can salvage something out of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, a favorite for the Heisman Trophy, has practiced all  
week and can continue to do so. He has missed the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
	He and former teammate Laveranues Coles were charged with buying  
more than $400 of designer clothes Sept. 29 for $21.40 from a store 
clerk, who is also charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The clerk, Rachel Myrtil, pleaded no contest today to grand  
theft and sentenced to two years' probation, 10 days on a county 
work program, ordered to pay $308 in court costs and stay out of 
Dillard's department stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, who was kicked off the Florida State team, has not  
resolved his legal situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny had reached an agreement with prosecutors this week that  
he thought would allow Warrick to return to the team. The deal 
included 30 days in jail after the semester. But D'Alemberte, out 
of town on school business, balked. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny does not want Warrick to enter a guilty plea on a felony  
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think its a petty theft, which gives me great reservation to  
have Peter accept a plea to something he didn't do,'' Kenny said.

<HEADLINE> Rocker Ready for New York Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- John Rocker got downright nasty with baseball  
fans in Queens. The Atlanta Braves closer sounds more conciliatory 
toward those in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, it's not like he'll be exchanging pleasantries when the  
World Series shifts to Yankee Stadium next week. But he expects to 
resume more of a normal player-opposing fan relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yankee fans, they're original,'' Rocker said. ``I think the  
Mets fans pull a lot of their harassing ways from the Yankee 
fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker sparked a firestorm of controversy when he said Mets fans  
were ``stupid'' and ``a tired act'' prior to the NL Championship 
Series. He willingly engaged in vitriolic sparring when the series 
moved to New York, saying the fans were even worse than he 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves defeated the Mets 4-2 in the best-of-7 series,  
clinching the pennant with a dramatic 10-9 victory in 11 innings 
Tuesday. Atlanta meets the AL champion Yankees in the World Series, 
which begins Saturday night at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	In a backhanded sort of way, Rocker was complimentary of Yankee  
fans while still reveling in Atlanta's victory over the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess the Yankee fans are kind of the forerunners of  
heckling other teams' players,'' he said. ``You can sit out in the 
bullpen or listen during batting practice and actually hear some 
pretty funny, original stuff. About as original as Mets fans get 
is, `Hey, you (stink).''' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker, who saved 38 games in the regular season and two more in  
the NLCS, wasn't around when Atlanta lost to the Yankees in its 
last Series appearance three years. Actually, a lot has changed for 
the Braves since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Wohlers is gone. Ditto for Mark Lemke, Marquis Grisson,  
Fred McGriff, Denny Neagle and Steve Avery. These days, it's guys 
like Rocker, Brian Jordan, Kevin Millwood and Gerald Williams 
playing key roles for Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves have been a work in process throughout their decade  
of excellence. Only pitchers Tom Glavine and John Smoltz have been 
part of every team during an unprecedented run of eight straight 
postseason appearances since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't realize how hard it is to get here year after  
year,'' general manager John Schuerholz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker is the Braves' third closer in three years. Wohlers, who  
surrendered a crucial homer to Jim Leyritz in the '96 Series, 
forgot how to throw strikes and was replaced by ex-independent 
league pitcher Kerry Ligtenberg. But he suffered a season-ending 
elbow injury in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan is two cleanup hitters removed from McGriff, who handled  
the role in '96. Andres Galarraga replaced McGriff last season, but 
spent this year recovering from cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Neagle was the Braves' fourth starter in the last Series, a role  
now handled -- at least numerically -- by Millwood. Actually, the 
24-year-old right-hander became Atlanta's most consistent starter 
while the Cy Young triumvirate of Greg Maddux, Glavine and Smoltz 
went through assorted struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	The leadoff role has been passed from Grissom to Williams, who  
scored the series-winning run Tuesday night. Instead of Lemke, it's 
Bret Boone who plays and bats second. Jordan is in right field, not 
Jermaine Dye. Walt Weiss succeeded Jeff Blauser at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	All season, change has been a theme for the Braves. Galarraga  
and Ligtenberg were out before the season began. All-Star catcher 
Javy Lopez, middle reliever Rudy Seanez and fifth starter Odalis 
Perez were sidelined with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The character we have, the heart we have in this locker  
room,'' said Jordan, who's been bothered by a sore hand since being 
hit by a pitch in late June. ``We've proved a lot of people 
wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves have been helped along by fringe players like catcher  
Eddie Perez, forced into the lineup by Lopez's injury. Perez was a 
unanimous choice as MVP of the NLCS after hitting .500 with two 
homers and five RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 6 against the Mets, the Braves also got key hits from  
Brian Hunter -- signed in the spring after Galarraga's illness was 
diagnosed -- and reserve shortstops Jose Hernandez and Ozzie 
Guillen. Russ Springer, moving into Seanez's role, was the winning 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Cox hasn't announced his World Series rotation,  
though Maddux or Glavine is likely to pitch the opener. Maddux last 
pitched Sunday, working seven innings in Game 5 of the NLCS, while 
Glavine hasn't pitched since Game 2 of that series Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's hand might be a concern. He was struck again Tuesday  
night by a pitch from Turk Wendell, putting Jordan in obvious pain 
though he remained in the game.

<HEADLINE> FDA To Permit Soy Product Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration soon will  
begin allowing health claims on food products containing soy 
protein. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting Tuesday, soy product labels will be permitted to make  
statements about the role of soy in reducing heart disease, the 
agency said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA said it decided to permit the statements after  
concluding that foods containing soy protein included in a diet low 
in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart 
disease by lowering cholesterol levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Foods that may be eligible for the claim include soy beverages,  
tofu, tempeh, soy-based meat alternatives and possibly some baked 
goods, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to qualify for the claim, foods must contain 6.25 grams  
of soy protein per serving, one-fourth of the 25 grams of soy 
protein daily that studies have shown is needed to show a 
significant cholesterol-lowering effect. An ounce is a little more 
than 25 grams.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Don't Mourn Subway Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Playing for the World Series championship might  
be a bit easier for the New York Yankees than fighting for the city 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that beating the Atlanta Braves, a team that had the best  
record in the majors this season and has been to five World Series 
this decade, will be an easy task. 
</P>
<P>
	It's just that it won't be the crosstown Mets.  
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees admit they don't know what mayhem a Subway Series  
would bring, but they do know it would entail 10 days of demand for 
tickets, screaming front-page headlines and dueling fans on talk 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure would have been excruciating. This, after all, is a  
team whose owner can't stand losing exhibitions to the crosstown 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing the Mets would have been a much more difficult  
situation,'' catcher Joe Girardi said Wednesday. ``Not from the 
standpoint of who we played, but how you're remembered. If it was 
the Mets, neither the Mets or Yankees would want to be remembered 
as the team that lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It has been 43 years since two New York teams played in the  
World Series. After the Dodgers and Giants left New York for 
California following the 1957 season, what once happened seven 
times in a 10-year period hadn't come close to occurring again 
until this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any of us could imagine what it would have been  
like,'' said David Cone, who played six season with the Mets. ``It 
would have been a once in a lifetime experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the Mets rallied from 5-0 and 7-3 deficits to take the  
lead twice in Game 6 against the Braves, the Yankees were prepared 
for it. But the Braves ended up winning 10-9 in 11 innings and 
dreams of a Subway Series were put to rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``There certainly would have been a lot more at stake that a  
world championship,'' said Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, 
who probably would have received the brunt of the criticism from 
owner George Steinbrenner if the Yankees actually lost to the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``There would have been city bragging rights, which would have  
been a story within a story. Now it's just the World Series and 
that's how it should be. I can't fathom what it would have been 
like in the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Girardi can. The phone wouldn't stop ringing with ticket  
requests. And the road would have offered no escape because there 
would be no road. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been a pain in the neck in a way,'' Girardi  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reliever Jeff Nelson agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been a madhouse,'' he said. ``In that respect,  
maybe it's better we aren't playing them. But, it's not like we're 
going to have it easy. After all, we are playing the Braves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oh yeah, the Braves. That's the team that sends aces Greg  
Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz and Kevin Millwood to the mound 
each night. They're the ones with MVP candidate Chipper Jones in 
the lineup and hard-throwing closer John Rocker in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	Only in New York can that be viewed as a break.  
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Manager Joe Torre announced his rotation today. Orlando  
Hernandez will pitch the opener followed by Cone, who would then 
get five days' rest between Games 2 and 6. Andy Pettitte will pitch 
Game 3 and Roger Clemens will pitch the fourth game. ... Torre also 
said he will replace second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, who made 26 
errors this season, with Luis Sojo for defense late in games. Torre 
had been hesitant to do that during the season, but talked it over 
with Knoblauch before Game 5 against Boston. ... Paul O'Neill's 
broken rib is less of a concern to the Yankees, meaning postseason 
hero Jim Leyritz will be back on the roster in place of Shane 
Spencer. Leyritz has seven career playoff homers, including the 
momentum-shifting three-run shot in Game 4 against Atlanta in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Justice Department Sues Ohio City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The Justice Department on Thursday sued  
the city of Columbus, charging a pattern of civil rights violations 
by the police department. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations include excessive force, false arrests and  
improper searches. The Justice Department reviewed more than 300 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit comes the day after the local Fraternal Order of  
Police rejected an offer to settle the case. The city and Justice 
Department reached a tentative settlement agreement in August, but 
union approval was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus was only the third city in the United States to be  
threatened with such a lawsuit by the Justice Department's Civil 
Rights Division under the authority of Violent Crime Control and 
Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Steubenville and Pittsburgh reached 
agreements -- known as consent decrees -- in which they promised to 
correct problems in the training, supervision and discipline of 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said it found a pattern of civil rights  
abuses in the 1,700-member Columbus police department. The 
investigation also included a review of recent lawsuits and records 
from a 1996 mayoral investigation of Police Chief James Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone messages were not immediately returned Thursday from  
the city attorney's office and police union President William 
Capretta. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, demands improvements  
in the training and supervision of police officers, and the 
investigation of civilian complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would still prefer to bring about needed changes in the  
police department through negotiations, rather than contested 
litigation,'' said Bill Lann Lee, acting assistant atttorney 
general for civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	In the proposed settlement, the city would not have admitted  
liability, and the police department and individual officers would 
not be penalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Provisions of the agreement included:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Appointment of an independent monitor, to be paid for by the  
city, to ensure that agreement requirements are met. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Increased training, including a requirement that new officers  
complete a four-month field training program. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The hiring of a deputy director of training, who will ensure  
that officer training meets police needs. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Establishment of reporting procedures for instances involving  
the use of force, serious law enforcement related injuries, 
warrantless searches and seizures and traffic stops. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement would have been in effect for five years. The city  
could ask that it be ended early if it establishes substantial 
compliance after two years.

<HEADLINE> S.C. NAACP Pres. Holds on Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The South Carolina NAACP refrained from  
stepping up the boycott of its home state on Thursday, but its 
president promised it would not meet again at home until the 
Confederate battle flag flying atop its Statehouse came down. 
</P>
<P>
	The boycott over the flag, called by the National Association  
for the Advancement of Colored People this summer, has so far 
persuaded more than 40 groups nationwide to cancel plans to come to 
South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	State leaders of the civil rights group have raised the  
possibility of extending the boycott to South Carolina products 
such as such as BMW cars and Michelin tires. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the start of the three-day conference of the state  
chapter, held across the border in North Carolina, state president 
James Gallman would only say that step might be discussed. He did 
not mention the boycott in his opening remarks, and said the 
meeting wouldn't focus on the flag. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the state chapter hopes to return to the Palmetto State  
for future meetings. ``But as long as South Carolina continues to 
disrespect our people by waving the flag on the state Capitol, 
we'll be forced to meet away from our home,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP considers the flag a symbol of slavery and racism;  
supporters say it represents South Carolina's heritage and honors 
its war veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina, the only state to fly the Confederate battle  
flag over its Statehouse, first raised the flag in 1962 to 
commemorate the Civil War's centennial. Critics say it was actually 
a swipe at the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
	While the state chapter was relatively quiet about the boycott,  
a national NAACP leader vowed Thursday that the boycott would 
continue as long as it is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wall is up until South Carolina stops flying the flag of  
slavery,'' said Nelson Rivers III, a NAACP national field 
operations director and former state chairman. ``If it takes a 
year, we'll be pleased. If it takes 10 years, we'll still be doing 
it.''

	GOP Pushing Spending Bills  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite veto threats from President Clinton  
and a contentious start to budget talks, Republicans are continuing 
to push overdue spending bills through Congress for the new fiscal 
year. Republicans planned to try moving a $14.5 billion measure 
through the House today that would finance the Interior Department 
and cultural programs. The bill contains millions more than last 
year for many programs, but Clinton has threatened a veto because 
it has less than he wants for park land purchases and has 
provisions helping oil, mining and other industries he considers 
anti-environmental.

	CDC Panel Urges Meningitis Warnings  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- In an attempt to stem avoidable meningitis cases,  
a panel of federal health experts recommended yesterday that 
colleges make meningitis vaccines readily available and that they 
warn students of the risks of the disease. But the advisory 
committee from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
stopped short of recommending that all college students be 
vaccinated. The panel didn't go further in its recommendations 
because current meningitis vaccines are no more than 90 percent 
effective and don't work on all strains, officials said. 
Meningococcal meningitis is an infection of the membranes around 
the brain and spinal cord that is fatal in about 10 percent of 
cases. Symptoms include fever, headache, nausea and vomiting, neck

	U.S. Hopeful After Indonesia Moves  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton welcomed Indonesia's  
selection of a moderate Islamic leader as its next president and 
the nation's decision to end a quarter-century of rule in East 
Timor. ``The events of the last two days should give us all hope 
that a very great country that the world needs very much is on the 
way back, and that's what I'm hoping will happen,'' Clinton said 
yesterday. The president spoke with reporters in the Oval Office at 
a signing ceremony for an annual appropriations bill. ``There are 
still a lot of hurdles for Indonesia out there. They've been 
through an incredibly traumatic time, not just politically but 
economically,'' Clinton said. But he called the changes ``a very 
hopeful development for the world.''

	Incursions Reported in East Timor  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- A day after Indonesia agreed to accept  
independence for East Timor, peacekeepers today reported a surge of 
cross-border incursions from Indonesia-controlled West Timor by 
anti-independence militiamen. ``In the past 24 hours, there have 
been a number of sightings of militia groups coming across the 
border,'' Col. Mark Kelly, spokesman for the 16-nation peacekeeping 
force, told reporters in Dili, East Timor's capital. But Kelly said 
it was too early to say whether this was part of some concerted new 
campaign by the paramilitary forces in response to yesterday's vote 
by the Indonesian assembly, in which the Jakarta government 
effectively relinquished its claim to East Timor.

	Voucher Plan Struggles in House  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Moderate Republicans appear to be balking at  
supporting a private-school voucher plan that could jeopardize 
legislation on education programs for poor students. House 
conservatives worked to gather votes today for the voucher plan, 
which would give poor students $3,500 private school vouchers if 
their public schools are failing academically or deemed unsafe. 
``These parents don't need another federal mandate. They need a 
chance to escape from a nightmare,'' said Rep. John Boehner, 
R-Ohio, who added that more than 100 of the nation's schools have 
been on the Education Department's list of troubled schools for 
more than 10 years.

	Opportunities Missed in Dole Run  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Not too long ago, Elizabeth Dole looked  
delightedly at the networks she'd built in Iowa, New Hampshire and 
other early primary states. ``We're going to have everything in 
place by Christmas. We're in really good shape,'' she thought. That 
was then. After recalling this once-sunny outlook yesterday, Dole 
folded her presidential campaign, saying it was futile to continue. 
Dole blamed the Texas governor's ``preexisting network of political 
supporters,'' built ``quietly but effectively'' from his office, 
starting in 1996, while she was at the American Red Cross 
meticulously guarding the organization's nonpartisan status.

	NBA Resumes Drug Testing  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Drug testing in the NBA was suspended for six  
days after the identities of two players who tested positive for 
marijuana were disclosed to a reporter. The testing resumed 
yesterday, and all players will have been subjected to urinalysis 
by next week. This is the first season in which NBA players are 
being tested for marijuana and steroids.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Most Want Rose Reinstated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- By a 2-1 margin, most people think Pete Rose  
should be reinstated to baseball, even though many believe he did 
gamble on his sport, according to an Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-six percent of those surveyed said Rose should be  
reinstated, while 29 percent said he should not, according to the 
poll, conducted for the AP by ICR of Media, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven out of 10 said baseball's career hits leader belongs in  
baseball's Hall of Fame, while almost two out of 10 said he 
doesn't. Rose is not eligible for the Hall of Fame as long as his 
lifetime ban remains in effect. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 78 percent to 15 percent margin, people said commissioner  
Bud Selig made the correct decision to invite Rose to the World 
Series ceremony Sunday honoring the sport's All-Century team. Rose 
was among the 25 players elected in fan balloting in the second 
half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the AP poll showed slightly higher support for  
Rose's admission to the Hall of Fame than four polls conducted from 
1989 to 1991 for the Roper Center at the University of Connecticut. 
Those polls showed support ranging from 47 percent to 58 percent 
for Rose's admission to Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other polls -- one done for Roper in 1990 and another by  
Gallup in 1989 -- found almost identical support for Rose as the AP 
poll, which was conducted earlier this month. The 1990 Roper poll 
found 68 percent supported of Rose's admission to the Hall of Fame, 
and the 1989 Gallup poll found 66 percent of respondents favored 
his being in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who think Rose should be allowed to appear at the  
series was Levona Walker, a communications specialist in her 40s 
from Bainbridge, Ga. The decision to let Rose appear with the 
All-Century team at the World Series is a good one, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a great player,'' said Walker, who considers herself a  
big baseball fan. ``Everybody has faults, so why blame him for his 
faults?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, more people who were asked in the AP poll don't believe  
Rose's gambling denial than believe him. Forty percent don't 
believe Rose is telling the truth about betting on baseball, while 
30 percent believe him. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Murray, a 55-year-old retiree from Tonawanda, N.Y., says he  
thinks the example Rose set on the field far outweighs the charge 
of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the greatest baseball players,'' said Murray. ``He  
was a great example through his hustle -- he showed a lot of hard 
work and hustle. He was a good example of youth of that day and 
this day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray said he doesn't know whether Rose bet on baseball or not,  
``But I like him, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey of 1,012 adults was taken Oct. 1-5 and has  
a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, then manager of the Cincinnati Reds, agreed to a lifetime  
ban from baseball in August 1989 following an investigation of his 
gambling. He applied for reinstatement in September 1997, and Selig 
has not ruled on the request, saying he sees no reason to chance 
the ban originally imposed by commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who describe themselves as following baseball  
closely, Rose got even higher backing, with 67 percent saying he 
should be reinstated and 29 percent saying he shouldn't. 
Seventy-two percent say he belongs in the Hall of Fame and 79 
percent said he should be invited to the All-Century team ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	But 49 percent think he's lying when he says he didn't bet on  
baseball, with 36 percent believing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Among casual fans, those who say they follow baseball but not  
closely, 64 percent say he should be reinstated, 79 percent say he 
belongs in the Hall of Fame and 84 percent agree he should be 
invited to the All-Century team festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	This group was about evenly split, with 40 percent saying they  
think he's lying about gambling on baseball and 36 percent 
believing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Carbonneau, a 66-year-old retiree from Champaign, Ill.,  
is a lifetime baseball fan who thinks some officials in the sport 
may not have a good historical perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless they could prove he was throwing Reds games, they  
should let him back in,'' Carbonneau said. ``The Babe wasn't 
exactly a saint.''

<HEADLINE> School Bus Hits Dump Truck in N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CENTRAL BRIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- A bus carrying second-graders to a  
pumpkin hunt collided with a dump truck at a dangerous intersection 
Thursday, injuring 51 youngsters and adults. 
</P>
<P>
	One child was in critical condition, and three youngsters and an  
adult were in serious condition Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus was carrying 44 children, three teachers and four adult  
chaperones from Albany School No. 18 on a field trip to the Pumpkin 
Patch, a popular Halloween spot 30 miles west of Albany. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids are going to be traumatized,'' said Sandra Bowles,  
whose 7-year-old granddaughter escaped injury in the crash. ``They 
are so young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The empty dump truck, registered to a construction company, was  
pulling a trailer when it struck the back right side of the bus. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus spun 180 degrees and rolled to a rest in grass about 500  
feet from the point of impact. The collision caused the front end 
of the bus to dip onto the pavement, knocking the hood off the 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck was traveling on Route 7, which has a 55 mph speed  
limit. The bus was traveling on Route 30A, which has a 30 mph speed 
limit. At the intersection of the two roads, there is a flashing 
yellow light for traffic on Route 7 and flashing red on Route 30A. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire Chief Eric Johnson called it one of the most dangerous  
intersections in the area, although he said this was the worst 
accident he's seen in his 25 years with the department. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus driver, William J. Treacy, 79, and the truck driver,  
Edward Cook, 52, were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Schoharie County Sheriff John Bates said it did not appear that  
drugs or alcohol were factors in the crash, and no charges were 
filed.

<HEADLINE> AOL Stock Up on Earnings Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- America Online stock rose in a falling  
market today after the world's largest Internet service provider 
reported first-quarter earnings that were triple those of the 
year-ago period and the addition of more than 1 million new members 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing its push for growth, AOL also announced a deal to  
have its Internet software loaded onto computers sold by Gateway 
Inc., the country's largest direct seller of consumer PCs. Under 
the deal, Gateway will receive $800 million over two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement after markets closed Wednesday came as AOL  
released first-quarter earnings of 15 cents per share. The $184 
million was up from $50 million, or 4 cents per share, in the same 
period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had been  
expecting earnings of 13 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading this morning on the New York Stock Exchange, AOL was  
up 1.3 percent, or by $1.56 1/4 at $119.56 1/4 a share, while Gateway 
soared 11.3 percent, or by $5.87 1/2 to $57.87 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose to $1.5 billion, a 47 percent increase over last  
year's first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL added nearly 1.1 million new members worldwide in the period  
ended Sept. 30, bringing its total number of subscribers to 18.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive officer Steve Case said the results  
show the growing importance of AOL's products in the lives of 
Internet users. AOL products reach eight of 10 American Internet 
users, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This quarter's results clearly demonstrate America Online's  
leadership and growing earnings power,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dulles, Va.-based company's subscription revenues reached  
$995 million, and the average daily minutes online of its members 
hit 55 minutes, an increase of eight minutes over last year's first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from advertising, commerce and other sources climbed to  
$350 million, up from $175 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	To expand its reach, the company is making its e-mail services  
available on Palm Pilot hand-held computers and last week announced 
an alliance with Motorola that will allow users of AOL's instant 
messaging service to communicate with users of Motorola's wireless 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also continued to broaden its services, signing a  
deal with drkoop.com, the online health care information company 
headed by former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. AOL also expanded 
its travel and personal finance offerings during the quarter.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Serves to Renowned Chef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton won praise  
for courage Thursday after serving lunch to celebrated chef Julia 
Child, one of four women honored at the White House for advancing 
women's causes. 
</P>
<P>
	On the menu: chicken with pesto, potato and goat cheese puree,  
autumn greens with artichokes and pumpkin mousse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hillary, it takes a lot of guts to serve lunch to Julia  
Child,'' joked Labor Secretary Alexis Herman. 
</P>
<P>
	Honored for ``shattering glass ceilings'' were Herman, Child,  
University of Pennsylvania President Judith Rodin and Ann Fudge, 
Kraft Foods executive vice president. Child was the first person to 
have a televised cooking show and to win an Emmy Award for her 
culinary expertise. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is exciting for me as I travel around to meet young girls  
who are no longer in any way limited by what they see as visions 
for their own lives and potential,'' thanks to women like the 
honorees, Mrs. Clinton told guests in the White House State Dining 
Room. 
</P>
<P>
	But the country still has ``work to be done'' to ensure equal  
pay for women, access to affordable child care and health care, 
Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sara Lee Foundation will make a $50,000 donation in each  
honoree's name to the nonprofit organization of her choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Past winners include poet Maya Angelou, Health and Human  
Services Secretary Donna Shalala and Martin Luther King's widow, 
Coretta Scott King. 
</P>
<P>
	Though lunch had yet to be served, Child said she was ``very  
much impressed'' by the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bon appetit,'' John Bryan, chief executive officer of Sara  
Lee, told the guests, borrowing Child's trademark line.

<HEADLINE> La Nina Reappears in Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Scientists are predicting a wet winter  
across the Northwest and a dry one in the Southwest after 
discovering the reappearance of La Nina in the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S.-French satellite earlier this month detected a pool of  
unusually cool water in the eastern North Pacific, and warm water 
in the western and mid-latitude Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	``These unbalanced conditions will undoubtedly exert a very  
strong influence on climate over North America this fall and 
winter,'' oceanographer William Patzert of the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The observations by the U.S.-French Topex-Poseidon satellite  
came three months after La Nina appeared to be fading away. 
</P>
<P>
	La Nina is characterized by unusually cold sea-surface  
temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific, which trigger 
atmospheric patterns that influence weather around the world. La 
Nina is linked to cooler conditions in central North America, and 
dry, warm conditions in the Southern states. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's La Nina contributed to a series of huge storms that  
blasted Washington, Oregon and northern California with 
hurricane-force winds, heavy rains and mountain snows, and powerful 
storms elsewhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Patzert called conditions ``ripe'' for a stormy winter in the  
Pacific Northwest and a relatively dry winter in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, these unusual conditions, which have persisted for 2 1/2  
years, will not be returning to normal anytime soon,'' Patzert 
said. ``This climate imbalance is big and we're definitely going 
through a decade of wild, climatic behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last winter's La Nina followed the historic 1997-98 El Nino,  
which was blamed for heavy snow in the West, massive flooding in 
Africa and drought in Asia.

<HEADLINE> America West Picks Pratt &AMP; Whitney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- America West Airlines selected a  
Pratt &AMP; Whitney engine for its new fleet of aircraft, a deal worth 
about $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline selected Pratt's PW6000 engine to power its Airbus  
Industrie A318 aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The PW6000 engine was created for 100-passenger aircraft which  
typically make several flights a day with quick turnarounds. It is 
designed to stay in service for up to 12,000 flights. 
</P>
<P>
	The first flight on the A318 will be in 2001 with entry into  
service in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	America West also has a firm order for 12 A320 planes powered by  
the International Aero Engine V2500. Pratt &AMP; Whitney and Rolls 
Royce are the lead companies of the IAE consortium which also 
includes MTU of Germany and the Japanese Aero Engines Corp. The IAE 
order is worth about $50 million to Pratt &AMP; Whitney.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq May Delay After-Hours Quotes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq Stock Market said Thursday it is  
considering again delaying plans to extend the operation of its 
stock quote ticker to accommodate after-hours traders. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision is expected Friday, said Scott Peterson, a Nasdaq  
spokesman in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The ticker provides the stock price information that scrolls  
across the bottom of television screens and is distributed to 
millions of investors via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq initially planned to extend its ticker hours on Oct. 4,  
but that was delayed until Oct. 11, while the plan awaited approval 
from the Securities and Exchange Commission. After the SEC gave the 
go-ahead, Nasdaq pushed back the date until Oct. 25, next Monday, 
to give brokers and security dealers time for computer system 
upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
	A news release was posted late Thursday on Nasdaq's Web site  
announcing there would be a third delay until Nov. 15 to allow 
broker-dealers more time, but Peterson said the statement was 
prematurely released and that a decision had yet to be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq plans to keep its system open until 6:30 p.m. Eastern  
time from 5:15 p.m. Late quotes also are planned for the system 
that reports trades on shares listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Both systems currently stop distributing quotes at 5:15 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	An increase in after-hours trading sessions scattered across a  
number of different markets -- primarily on electronic 
communications systems, or ECNs -- has prompted calls for the 
extension of hours of centralized stock information systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq last month offered to extend the hours of its ticker to  
address that need. A week later, the organization that runs the 
NYSE's ticker also agreed to extend its ticker hours because the 
Chicago Stock Exchange, which trades NYSE listed stocks for 
regional customers, will soon keep its market open until 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE and Nasdaq are also planning extended sessions, but not  
until next year.

<HEADLINE> Captain's Errors in Grounding Listed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The saga of the New Carissa, the freighter  
that ran aground and refused to be disposed of, began with the 
captain's ``ill-fated'' decision to anchor close to shore in poor 
weather, the Coast Guard says. 
</P>
<P>
	An agency report issued Wednesday cited captain's error as the  
main cause for the grounding near Coos Bay last Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``The grounding was a result of the Master's ill-fated  
decision'' to anchor near shore in a gale, the report said. ``A 
contributing factor to the event was the Master's imprudent 
approach to anchoring. He chose to use only one anchor and did not 
lay out more anchor chain as would be expected for the 
environmental situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard noted that the captain, Benjamin Morgado, did  
not testify at the formal hearing because of possible pending 
criminal charges so there was little insight into his decisions. 
The report said the grounding was not due to a criminal act and 
tests on the Filipino crew showed no evidence of drugs or alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	The freighter ran aground while waiting to enter Coos Bay to  
pick up a load of wood chips. The problems dragged on for months. 
</P>
<P>
	A harbor pilot tried to pull the wreck off the beach with its  
own engines, but failed. While waiting for a break in rough weather 
for a salvage tug to make its way down the coast, the ship bounced 
and twisted in the surf, breaking cracks in the hull and releasing 
70,000 of fuel oil that fouled beaches and shorebirds. 
</P>
<P>
	A Navy demolition team placed explosive charges and Bangalore  
torpedoes throughout the ship to crack open the fuel tanks and set 
ablaze the thick gooey fuel oil. It took two tries and the fire 
didn't consume all the oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Weeks later, an ocean-going tug using a special cable pulled the  
bow section off the beach. But a severe storm parted the cable, and 
the bow soon was back on the beach, 80 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	The bow was finally towed far out to sea to be sunk in 12,000  
feet of water. Shelling from a Navy destroyer couldn't sink it, and 
a Navy submarine had to be called in to sink it with a torpedo. 
</P>
<P>
	The stern remains mired in sand.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Questioned Over Valuables </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and  
his wife Sarah were questioned by police today after officers 
seized dozens of valuable items the couple is suspected of having 
kept illegally after he left office. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu waved briefly before he and his wife entered the Fraud  
Squad headquarters in the Tel Aviv suburb of Bat Yam. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu's lawyer, David Shimron, said his client had not done  
anything wrong and accused police of conducting a politically 
tainted investigation. Shimron said the items were in storage to be 
sorted. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the searches were connected to an ongoing  
investigation into allegations that Netanyahu accepted illegal 
favors from a contractor, Avner Amedi, while in office. In that 
case, Netanyahu and his wife were questioned for more than seven 
hours last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedi's lawyer, Yaron Rabinovitch, said the contractor had  
promised to provide information on the Netanyahus to the police as 
part of a plea bargain deal. According to Israel army radio, Amedi 
will admit to bribery, but not serve jail time. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, police investigators searched Netanyahu's  
Jerusalem apartment, his office and a storage room he uses. 
Journalists were tipped off in advance, while the Netanyahus were 
taken by surprise, prompting accusations that the police were 
treating the couple unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could have been handled in an entirely different way,''  
said Shimron. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said dozens of items were seized, including pictures and  
gold and silver utensils. They did not say whether the pictures 
were works of art or photographs, or whether the items were 
official gifts he was given while in office. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Israeli law, gifts received by a prime minister are  
property of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Shimron said the storage room was a government facility and that  
the items were being held there, along with some of the Netanyahus' 
personal property, so they could eventually be sorted out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was for temporary storage, between the phases of official  
and private life,'' Shimron told Israel army radio. 
</P>
<P>
	The Netanyahus have been interrogated in the past about a bill  
for $100,000 submitted by Amedi for work he did for the couple 
while Netanyahu was prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Amedi's work was at Netanyahu's private home. An Israeli  
newspaper, Yediot Ahronot, reported that Amedi polished the floors 
weekly, though the Netanyahu family was living in the official 
prime minister's residence at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedi submitted bills for moving furniture from the apartment.  
Because Amedi was never paid, police suspect that he was expecting 
to receive some sort of improper payment. He later submitted the 
bill to the prime minister's office after Netanyahu lost the 
Israeli election in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other former officials from Netanyahu's office have also  
been questioned in the affair, but no formal charges have been 
brought. 
</P>
<P>
	Police earlier warned Netanyahu and his wife that they might be  
charged with criminal offenses in the case. Wednesday's statement 
was the first indicating police suspicion that the couple also took 
presents home illegally.

<HEADLINE> Report: Journal Violates Own Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The New England Journal of Medicine  
apparently violated its own strict disclosure policy by publishing 
articles from researchers whose ties to drug companies were not 
disclosed, the Los Angeles Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	In eight of 36 ``Drug Therapy'' articles reviewed by the Times  
that were printed in the Journal since 1997, researchers had 
financial links to companies that marketed treatments reviewed in 
the article. That potential conflict of interest was not revealed 
to the reader. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal has not yet reviewed the articles identified by the  
newspaper but is developing new ethical guidelines, interim editor 
in chief Dr. Marcia Angell told the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to try to do the right thing and bring our  
practice into conformity with our policy,'' she said. ``There was a 
misinterpretation of exactly what our policy was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The policy at the 187-year-old weekly journal is among the  
strictest of all medical publications, prohibiting ``editorialists 
and authors of review articles from having any financial connection 
with a company that benefits from a drug or device discussed in the 
editorial or review article.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the articles examined by the newspaper, the authors who  
reviewed drug treatments received speaking fees, consulting fees, 
travel expenses and other funding from the makers of the same drugs 
they were reviewing. The articles were not accompanied by any 
disclosures about the ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the authors said they disclosed to the Journal their  
financial ties. Two other articles were by European authors who did 
not respond to e-mail messages from the Times seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper's analysis did not evaluate whether the authors  
showed a bias toward the companies' products, but experts said 
leaving out the financial links raised serious questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's highly misleading of journal editors to say on the one  
hand that they have a strict policy to avoid conflict of interest 
and then turn around and violate that policy,'' said Mildred Cho, a 
scholar at the Stanford University Center for Biomedical Ethics.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Fall on Brazil Weather / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures fell sharply Thursday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade as forecasts for continuing rain in drought-plagued 
Brazil lessened concerns of crop damage. Grain futures were slightly 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
        Sporadic spring showers in the past week have provided relief  
for key growing areas in Brazil, the world's No. 2 producer, as farmers 
plant next year's crop. 
</P>
<P>
        Corn futures nearly held their own despite the fall in soybeans  
and U.S. stocks, buoyed by the Agriculture Department's report of a 
75 percent jump in U.S. export sales from a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat got early support from higher-than-expected weekly export  
sales, although prices slipped lower on technical weaknesses later. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for December delivery fell 3/4 cent to $2.57 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1/2 cent to $2.00 a bushel; December oats fell 1/4 
cent to $1.09 a bushel; November soybeans fell 8 1/4 cents to $4.79 
3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef and pork futures settled mixed in trading on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
        December live cattle rose .18 cent to 68.77 cents a pound;  
November feeder cattle fell .03 cent to 81.20 cents a pound; December 
lean hogs rose .83 cent to 48.75 cents a pound; February frozen pork 
bellies fell .25 cent to 66.10 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Half of U.S. Households Play Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly half of all American households play the  
stock market, but despite all the hype about day trading and online 
transactions, most are long-term investors who rarely call upon a 
broker. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are among the findings of a survey being released today by  
the Investment Company Institute and the Securities Industry 
Association, two trade organizations representing the nation's 
investment companies, securities firms and investment banks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hear a lot about people trading actively -- day trading  
over the Internet -- and that's simply not the case,'' said 
Elizabeth Powell, a spokeswoman for ICI. ``Most people are saving 
for retirement, and presumably, we can expect that trend to 
continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Powell said the study was the first to take such a detailed look  
at the habits of small-time, individual investors. Through random 
phone interviews with 4,842 people, the survey found that the 
typical stock owner is 47 years old, married, has a household 
income of $60,000 -- and generally subscribes to the 
``buy-and-hold'' investment strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	The average investor also considers himself market-savvy,  
although he may have no formal background in finance or business. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 49.2 million U.S. households, or 48 percent, own  
equities either individually or through mutual funds, according to 
the study. And those numbers have steadily been on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, only 32.5 percent of U.S. households held stock, Powell  
said. By 1992 that number had increased to 36.3 percent. And it 
approached 41 percent by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Powell said more people have been drawn to the market because  
they can get bigger returns for their investment in stocks than 
they can elsewhere. Declining interest rates, on a relative basis, 
have only added to the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Others have turned to 401(k) retirement plans, which are  
increasingly being offered by employers and may be some workers 
sole retirement benefit as pensions become less common. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of all, investing is easier now that was 10 years ago, with  
countless magazines pumping out advice and investment companies 
offering toll-free, 24-hour service, Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the high tech access, most individual investors do it  
the old fashioned way -- just sit and wait. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the study, only 11 percent of all stock owners  
conducted transactions over the Internet, and most hadn't bought or 
sold a single stock during all of 1998, the year examined. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, which has a 2 percentage point margin of error,  
found that 48 percent of all stock owners are between the ages of 
36 and 54, 32 percent are older than 55 and 19 percent are between 
the ages of 19 and 35.

<HEADLINE> Celtics Sign Forward Marty Conlon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Celtics signed free agent forward Marty  
Conlon on Thursday to strengthen a frontcourt weakened by the loss 
of Danny Fortson. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortson underwent successful surgery Thursday to repair a stress  
fracture in his right foot and is expected to be out 8-12 weeks, 
Celtics spokesman Jeff Twiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Conlon, 31, played the last two seasons with the Miami Heat. He  
appeared in only seven games last season because of hand and finger 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Conlon, a 6-foot-11, 235-pound forward, played for the Celtics  
in 1996-97, averaging 7.8 points and 4.4 rebounds in 74 games. He 
averaged 22.7 minutes per game during that span. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bronxville, N.Y., native has played for seven NBA teams  
during an eight-year career, averaging 6.5 points and 3.5 rebounds 
in 376 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Before turning pro, he played four seasons at Providence  
College, where he finished as the 18th leading scorer in school 
history with 1,135 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortson, a 6-foot-7 foot, 260-pounder, averaged 11 1/2 rebounds and  
seven points in two preseason games since coming to the Celtics in 
a multiplayer trade with Denver in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors inserted a pin into the injured bone in his foot during  
surgery at New England Baptist Hospital on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials don't know how Fortson, 23, hurt his foot, but  
doctors ordered X-rays Tuesday when he complained that nagging pain 
was getting worse. The tests revealed a stress fracture.

<HEADLINE> Euro Bank Leaves Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The European Central Bank left its key  
interest rates unchanged following its regular meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank, which sets monetary policy for the 11 European Union  
nations that have adopted the euro single currency, left its main 
refinancing rate on loans to financial institutions at 2.5 percent, 
where it has been since a 0.5 percent cut in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank also confirmed that its overnight deposit rate will  
remain at 1.5 percent and its marginal lending rate will continue 
to be at 3.5 percent. The deposit rate and the marginal lending 
rate represent the floor and ceiling for money-market rates in the 
European nations that have adopted the euro as their currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank president Wim Duisenberg said two weeks ago the ECB was  
prepared to tighten policy as soon as it gets more signs of a 
strengthening economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, ``there's really no additional information'' that  
would have justified a move Thursday, said Gwyn Hacche, economist 
with HSBC in London. ``If anything, data have decreased the need to 
raise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The September business climate index in Germany, published  
Wednesday, was weaker-than-expected and damped expectations for a 
rate rise Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, inflation in the 11 European countries that have adopted  
the euro continues to be moderate, showing an annual rise of 1.2 
percent in September, unchanged from August, despite a 6.4 percent 
surge in energy prices. Inflation even fell slightly when volatile 
energy and food prices are stripped out. 
</P>
<P>
	The ECB bases its monetary policy decisions on money supply data  
and the outlook for inflation.

<HEADLINE> EU Rule on Genetically Altered Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union experts agreed on new  
labeling rules for genetically altered food Thursday in an effort 
to allay widespread consumer concerns over how to identify the new 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of scientists from the 15 EU nations agreed that  
producers should label goods as containing genetically modified 
organisms, or GMOs, if 1 percent of such organisms are present. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement should help end months of legal uncertainly over  
the labeling of genetically modified food, which has become major 
issue with European consumers already scared by a series of 
food-health scares. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to make a start and develop more rigorous standards,''  
British Food Minister Baroness Hayman told BBC radio. ``I think 
consumers have driven change because they have said they want to 
exactly what they are eating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new labelling rule should be in force within three months,  
after a final decision by the EU's executive Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The standards are controversial, with some pressure groups  
arguing the threshold for GMO-labeling should be as low as 0.1 
percent per ingredient. However, some scientists say such low 
levels are impractical since natural processes such as winds and 
birds can spread GMO's indiscriminately. 
</P>
<P>
	The London-based environmental group Friends of the Earth  
blasted the EU ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public has made it perfectly clear that they do not want  
to eat food containing GM ingredients,'' Pete Riley, the group's 
senior food campaigner said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's decision ... will encourage many food producers to  
weaken their standards for sourcing food free from GMOs. Once again 
our politicians are out of step with the public on this issue.''

<HEADLINE> Hamed Set To Wow 'Em in Detroit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- He is brash and flamboyant and promoted like a  
rock star. And he has won the hearts of Detroit's sizable Arab 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince Naseem Hamed, the WBO featherweight champion, will face  
WBC titleholder Cesar Soto in a unification match Friday night at 
Joe Louis Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15,000 fans are expected for the 12-round bout at Joe  
Louis Arena. There are an estimated 250,000 to 300,000 people of 
Arab heritage in the Detroit area. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamed, an Englishman of Yemeni descent is considered one of the  
hardest punchers in boxing. But he might be best known for his 
leopard-print trunks and his 10-minute entrances that finish with a 
flip over the top rope and into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've brought some flash into boxing when it badly  
needed it,'' Hamed said. ``I'm supremely confident, but I always 
back it up. There's no pressure on me because I know what I will 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in his unbeaten career, Hamed made several Muhammad  
Ali-like knockout predictions. But his last two fights produced 
just a winning decision and an 11th-round knockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he is talking knockout over Soto even though his Mexican  
challenger has never been KO'd in his 11 years in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can honestly say this is the first time he's going to be  
knocked out,'' Hamed said. ``I'm unbelievably confident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Soto's WBC belt is more prestigious than Hamed's WBO  
title, the Mexican will enter the ring as a huge underdog. But that 
doesn't mean he doesn't expect to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I expect to win the fight,'' Soto said through an  
interpreter. ``We both hit very hard, so I don't think the fight 
will last long. I'm going to fight like a true Mexican warrior -- an 
Aztec.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The card, which will also include a title fight between WBC  
super bantamweight Erik Morales and Wayne McCullough, will be 
televised live by HBO, starting at 8 p.m. EDT and tape-delayed for 
the same time on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The starting time, early by boxing standards, was aimed at  
drawing in a younger audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very electric,'' promoter Cedric Kushner said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit Red Wings had been scheduled to play the Anaheim  
Mighty Ducks in the arena, but the Red Wings agreed to move the 
game to November for the fight to come to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was quite a huge gesture, considering this is Hockeytown,''  
trainer Emanuel Steward said.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Kid's Rail Death Is a Homicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SELIGMAN, Mo. (AP) -- An eighth-grader last seen alive being  
chased from his girlfriend's house by her father was hit by a train 
and found dead, but authorities say he was not on the tracks by 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say they believe that 14-year-old Justin Hocutt  
was killed -- but are still unsure whether he was dead before the 
train hit him or if he was knocked unconscious and left there to 
die. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe there was a homicide and a conspiracy to cover it  
up,'' Ron Sparks, director of special investigations for the 
Arkansas Missouri Railroad Police, said Thursday. ``There's 
numerous individuals involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An acquaintance of the girlfriend's family was arrested Monday  
on suspicion of destroying evidence, and at least two people wanted 
for questioning appear to have skipped town, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin was seen about 4 a.m. on Oct. 8 being chased from his  
girlfriend's home by her father, authorities said. Investigators 
believe he was hit by the train about two hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	The father had found the two juveniles asleep on the floor  
together, both fully clothed, and had asked Justin to leave, Sparks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's body was found the next day near train tracks that  
cross the tiny town near the Arkansas border. His body, thrown by 
the impact, was found about 300 feet from the girl's home, Sparks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our first indication was that he had severe head and bodily  
injuries due to being run over by a train,'' said Barry County 
Coroner Skip White. ``Because of some other things that I cannot 
discuss, we believe that he was not up on the tracks laying down on 
his own accord.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justin had lived in Seligman with his father and grandparents  
for only a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin's father told authorities the boy hadn't been home since  
Oct. 7, but he didn't report him missing because he thought he was 
staying with a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``That really wasn't uncommon for that family,'' said Capt.  
James Smith of the Barry County Sheriff's Department. ``He was 
allowed to roam probably more than he should have been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities became suspicious about Justin's death after several  
people gave conflicting statements and the autopsy results showed 
no signs of alcohol or drug use, Smith said.

<HEADLINE> White House Hopeful Over ABM Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House expressed hope Wednesday that  
Russia eventually will warm to a U.S. proposal to amend the 1972 
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty in exchange for American help in 
completing a major Russian radar system. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to continue working with them,'' said White House  
spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``We're in the beginning of this process, 
and we're going to keep the lines of communication open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials confirmed Sunday they have offered to help finish  
a radar installation near Irkutsk, Siberia. In exchange, the United 
States wants Russian consent to alter the ABM treaty so both 
countries could establish limited national missile defense systems. 
The officials said the systems are needed to contain potential 
nuclear threats from nations such as Iran and North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	But Russian officials long have resisted the idea of amending  
the ABM, saying revising the treaty could trigger a new arms race. 
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said 
Wednesday that Russia's position is unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	``We aren't negotiating any kind of amendments to the ABM,''  
Rakhmanin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said Russian officials had not given any formal notice  
that they were rejecting the United States' offer. ``We're going to 
work closely with the Russians to make sure that they understand 
our concerns and we understand theirs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. delegation led by Undersecretary of State John D. Holum  
is to begin another round of talks in Moscow on Thursday. The 
topics will include the ABM treaty and prospects of additional 
weapons cuts.

<HEADLINE> AP Board Approves Rate Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The board of directors of The Associated Press  
has approved a 2.5 percent general assessment increase for members 
of the news cooperative, effective Jan. 2, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase applies to all AP newspaper and broadcast members.  
Changes in circulation, on which AP's newspaper rates are based, 
will also affect the actual change in weekly assessment for many 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This continues AP's record over the past decade of keeping  
assessment increases at or about the inflation level,'' said Donald 
Newhouse, chairman of the AP board and president of the Star-Ledger 
of Newark, N.J. He said the board continues to work closely with 
management to keep standards of service high. In 1999, AP completed 
installation of Y2K-compliant workstations in all bureaus, and AP's 
small-dish satellite delivery system was switched to a more 
reliable and economical KU band network. 
</P>
<P>
	Newhouse noted that 2000 will be a challenging year for the news  
service. In addition to covering quadrennial elections and the 
Olympics, AP will be replacing its entire photo delivery system 
with faster, more reliable satellite transmission technology and 
will begin placing a receiving device called AP Server at every 
newspaper that currently has an AP Leaf Picture Desk. 
</P>
<P>
	Newhouse said AP also would continue its program of adding  
reporting strength to state bureaus. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press is the world's oldest and largest  
newsgathering organization, providing text, audio, graphics, video 
and technology to more than 15,000 organizations worldwide. AP 
employs more than 3,500 staffers in 237 bureaus.

<HEADLINE> GM Has Used Car Internet Dealership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The virtual used-car lot isn't new. A Detroit  
automaker at the helm is. 
</P>
<P>
	Though a regulatory snafu stymied it for about three months,  
General Motors Corp. finally has gotten rolling on a 
first-of-its-kind, Internet-based used car dealership here that 
could be a prototype for stores nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found a strong, unmet consumer need,'' said Roy Pikus,  
chairman of GM's DriverSite online used-car sales division. ``We 
were really looking for a nontraditional way to buy a used 
vehicle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many dealerships, including national chains AutoNation Inc. and  
CarMax Group, already offer online inventories of used vehicles. GM 
is the first manufacturer to get into the business. 
</P>
<P>
	Pikus said GM chose Texas' largest city because, in addition to  
being the nation's fourth-largest used-car market, research showed 
it also was among the most Internet-savvy. 
</P>
<P>
	Pikus describes DriverSite as a ``clicks-and-mortar'' mix of a  
virtual showroom with a physical point of sale. Only the suburban 
north Houston location is open now, but Pikus said the concept 
could expand next year if the prototype succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	A prospective customer can scan a retailer's inventory on its  
Web site, which has pictures, descriptions and no-haggle prices of 
available cars. The surfer, for a refundable $100 deposit, can set 
up a test drive at the location and buy it on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``The response has been encouraging so far,'' said Pikus. The  
store, with about 200 cars from the automaker's ``Certified Used 
Vehicles'' stock, has sold about 20 in the three weeks it's been 
open. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston location was ready for business in July when GM  
learned that a new Texas law prohibits automakers from selling used 
cars. Also, some area dealers were nervous about perceived 
competition by GM. 
</P>
<P>
	Prominent Houston dealer George DeMontrond solved the legal  
problem by acquiring the DriverSite outlet. GM has helped salvage 
its dealer relations by allowing other local dealers to buy cars 
off the Web site at the wholesale price DeMontrond paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Pikus admits many details on how future locations would operate  
remain up in the air. That uncertainty still worries some dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of unknowns,'' said Rocky McCullough, general  
manager of Goodson Honda-Pontiac-GMC, a few miles from DriverSite. 
``It seems to me when things are discussed, people tend to think 
the worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM has also angered dealers with a move into new-car dealing. It  
announced three weeks ago it would form a separate company to buy 
and operate as many as 770 GM dealerships. But after meeting with 
dealers last week, GM said it would move ``cautiously'' into the 
business.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Names Millennium Trails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton announced  
Thursday the names of 50 Millennium Legacy Trails to ensure a trail 
within reach of ``every single home in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trails -- located in 47 states, the District of Columbia,  
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands -- became part of a network 
of greenways, as well as water, rail and long-distance trails. They 
were chosen because they preserve open spaces, interpret history 
and encourage recreation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of them stitch a design in our landscape and help  
together to create a picture of America,'' Mrs. Clinton said. They 
``reflect the unique spirit of their states and collective history 
of our nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, she said, the Monon Rail Trail in Indiana displays  
murals painted by students. In Nebraska, the 321-mile Cowboy Trial 
is the country's longest railroad to be converted to a trail. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House Millennium Council, the Transportation  
Department and a private nonprofit group, Rails-to-Trails 
Conservancy, selected the trails from thousands of nominations made 
by state governors and other officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning trails will receive funding for preservation or, for  
those that have yet to be completed, construction. For example, 
National Endowment for the Arts Chairman Bill Ivey announced a 
$520,000 grant Thursday to support arts projects along the routes, 
and American Express also has contributed $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The legacy trails continue a network of 16 National Millennium  
Trails announced in June, including the path of Lewis and Clark's 
expedition. In a year, Mrs. Clinton said she hopes to announce 
thousands of other community trails to finish the network.

<HEADLINE> Tagliabue Visits NFL's Newest City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue has no regrets  
that Houston beat out Los Angeles for an NFL franchise, he said 
Thursday before joining local business leaders for a celebratory 
luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue, making his first public appearance here since owners  
voted earlier this month to return to Houston in 2002, credited 
franchise owner Bob McNair, elected officials and fans for making 
it happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we understood in March that this was going to be a  
great opportunity to look at two really strong areas,'' Tagliabue 
said. ``I don't have an ounce of reservation. I think it's great 
for the league, and I think the owners feel that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNair, backed by taxpayer commitment to help pay for a $310  
million retractable-roof stadium next to the Astrodome, secured the 
NFL's 32nd franchise on Oct. 6 with a $700 million bid that 
defeated efforts by Los Angeles, the nation's No. 2 television 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue said Houston, the 11th-largest market, now can start  
concentrating on football. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue's enthusiasm about Houston as a football hotbed  
contrasts with statements he made in 1996, when fans spurned the 
Oilers after owner Bud Adams made it clear he was headed for 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner said at the time that Baltimore and Cleveland,  
two other cities deserted by NFL franchises, showed more desire for 
pro football. ``If we had the same situation in Houston, then we 
could compare the three,'' he said. ``But I'm not sure that we do 
at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue said Thursday he didn't remember criticizing Houston.  
</P>
<P>
	After working tirelessly to bring back the NFL since the Oilers,  
now called the Titans, moved to Tennessee after the 1996 season, 
McNair said he's as busy as ever laying the groundwork for an 
expansion club. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone asked me what it's been like, and I said, `Have you  
ever kicked a fire ant hill?' I think that's the best 
description,'' McNair said. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair, whose businesses are based atop a downtown building, is  
constructing an NFL information center in the lobby, complete with 
a sample luxury suite that should be ready in December. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair hopes to have 75 of the 146 planned luxury boxes sold by  
Jan. 15. The team's web site already has gotten about 3 million 
hits, and more than 63,000 fans have inquired about season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Groundbreaking for the proposed 69,500-seat stadium is set for  
March, which is when the team's nickname will be announced. Fans 
will get their say on the name in a coordinated media effort 
scheduled to begin soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston Texans is considered the favorite, but McNair said  
he's open to suggestions, which are pouring in through the Internet 
site, letters to the Houston Chronicle and calls to sports talk 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue also noted that Houston has an excellent shot at the  
2004 Super Bowl presuming the stadium stays on schedule, but 
cautioned that the NFL had made no commitments as to when the game 
will return to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland also has shown interest in the 2004 game.

<HEADLINE> Report: Sluggers Help FBI in Sting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Tony Gwynn worked  
with the FBI to help catch forgers who were selling faked items in 
the sports memorabilia market, according to a broadcast report. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes helped the FBI spot fake signatures during a  
two-year undercover FBI investigation known as ``Operation 
Bullpen,'' ABC's ``20/20'' reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn told ``20/20'' he went to the FBI three years ago after  
discovering the San Diego Padres' own gift shop was victimized by 
suppliers of fake baseball memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I'm walking in, I'm looking in the window, and they had a  
nice display of Padre baseballs, and 8x10s with other players,'' 
Gwynn said. ``And I'm looking, and I started looking at the 
signatures. I mean, every one in there -- every single one -- was a 
forgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI then got Sosa and McGwire involved as well, the report  
said, and it has several tractor trailer loads of forgeries from 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	According to ``20/20,'' authorities estimate faked sports  
memorabilia have become a $500 million scam in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many unsuspecting people out there who are  
getting ripped off, they probably don't know if they're getting 
ripped off,'' Gwynn said. ``They have got balls and pictures and 
bats sitting on shelves and in cabinets and ... it hasn't probably 
dawned on them that it might not be real.''

<HEADLINE> N.H. Poll Shows McCain in 2nd Place </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOULTONBOROUGH, N.H. (AP) -- Arizona Sen. John McCain, who  
continues to gain ground against George W. Bush in New Hampshire, 
urged students Thursday to vote, work for campaigns and run for 
public office. 
</P>
<P>
	``My whole purpose in being here is to motivate you to become  
involved in public service,'' he said during a 15-minute visit with 
Moultonborough Academy's senior class. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to do what Jack Kennedy did, what Ronald Reagan did,  
what Franklin Roosevelt and Teddy Roosevelt did, and what Abraham 
Lincoln did -- motivate people to a cause greater than their own 
self-interest,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain cut short his campaign trip to the first primary state to  
return to Washington for a Senate vote on a bill that would ban a 
certain type of late-term abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, President Clinton will veto it, and no, we won't have the  
votes to override the president's veto, and I'm sorry about that,'' 
he said. ``It is a horrible and repugnant procedure that shouldn't 
be part of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before departing, McCain had good news from The New Hampshire  
Poll, which showed him with a solid hold on second place in the 
race for the Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain had 26 percent, 10 points better than in August, but  
still lagged behind Bush, who was at 42 percent in poll of 600 
likely Republican primary voters. The poll, released Thursday, was 
conducted Oct. 14-19, before Elizabeth Dole dropped out of the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very pleased with the progress, but I'm not smoking  
anything so strong that I feel assured of victory,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said it is too soon to say how Mrs. Dole's departure will  
affect his campaign, but said he would consider her as a running 
mate. 
</P>
<P>
	``She would make an excellent running mate for any Republican  
nominee,'' he said. ``Certainly, she's in the mix for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's wife, Cindy, continued the question and answer session  
with students after her husband left, speaking candidly about her 
children, her past addiction to painkillers, and how she views the 
role of first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McCain, who has admitted stealing drugs during the early  
1990s from a medical charity she founded, urged the students to 
stay away from drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm an addict. I'm in recovery, but I was addicted to  
prescription drugs for three years,'' she said. ``Look at your 
friends, look at your family. Don't do drugs.''

<HEADLINE> Bill: Bilingual Programs Need OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House has approved a bill to prevent  
children from being placed in federally funded bilingual education 
programs without their parents' consent. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved the parental consent provision and other  
changes to bilingual education programs during debate Wednesday on 
a larger education bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional critics say bilingual education programs often  
keep students from learning English and contribute to high drop out 
rates among Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal of having children speak more than one language is a  
noble goal ... but somewhere along the way bilingual education is 
miserably failing some of these students, predominantly the 
Hispanic students,'' said Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., the main 
backer of the parental consent provision. 
</P>
<P>
	Bilingual education programs often teach students academic  
subjects in their native language, such as Spanish, while gradually 
teaching English. Salmon said 3.5 million children in the United 
States are considered to have limited English skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Students would continue to take bilingual classes if their  
parents cannot be contacted or do not respond to attempts to get 
their consent.

<HEADLINE> Viacom Earnings Rise 28 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Viacom Inc. posted a 28 percent increase in  
third-quarter profits today, crediting strong results from its 
cable networks group, which includes MTV, VH1 and Nickelodeon. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom earned $110.9 million, or 16 cents a share, from  
continuing operations. Excluding a one-time restructuring charge 
related to the merger of Spelling Entertainment, Viacom earned 
$159.6 million, or 22 cents per share, handily beating Wall Street 
estimates of 16 cents a share. In the same period a year ago, 
Viacom earned $86 million, or 10 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Net earnings, which take into account other one-time factors and  
discontinued publishing and music operations, were $96.7 million in 
the July-September quarter, down from $123.4 million a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 1.3 percent to $3.33 billion from $3.29 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Viacom, which announced a blockbuster merger with CBS Corp. last  
month, said earnings were led by a 15 percent jump in revenues at 
its cable operations, which also include Showtime. Viacom said 
MTV's Video Music Awards show this year scored as the highest-rated 
entertainment show in cable history. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues at Viacom's entertainment division, which includes the  
Paramount movie studio and TV production operations, fell 11 
percent from last year, when the division got a huge boost from 
home video sales of ``Titanic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the studio did have several strong showings at the box  
office, including ``Runaway Bride,'' ``The General's Daughter'' and 
``Double Jeopardy.'' The division also makes a number of hit TV 
shows including ``Frasier,'' ``Star Trek: Voyager,'' ``Beverly 
Hills 90120'' and ``Judge Judy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom's Blockbuster video rental subsidiary posted a 13 percent  
increase in revenues. Viacom floated shares in Blockbuster in 
August and is expected to spin off the rest of the company by early 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Viacom earned $238.6  
million from continuing operations, or 33 cents a share. This 
compared with a loss of $133.3 million, or 25 cents a share, a year 
earlier when the company took a $424 million charge at Blockbuster 
as the company started up revenue-sharing agreements with Hollywood 
studios. 
</P>
<P>
	Net earnings came to $188.5 million in the first nine months  
this year, compared with a net loss of $185.9 million in the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month revenues rose 6.1 percent to $9.29 billion from $8.75  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom's other operations include the Simon &AMP; Schuster  
publishing house, theme parks and 19 television stations as well as 
half of the UPN television network and half of the Comedy Central 
cable network.

<HEADLINE> Designer of China's Flag Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- Zeng Liansong, who designed the red,  
five-starred national flag of the People's Republic of China, has 
died at 82, state media said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Zeng died Tuesday in Shanghai, the official Xinhua News Agency  
and newspapers said. They did not give a cause of death, but said 
he was hospitalized after a 1997 stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Zeng submitted his design of five gold stars on a red background  
in 1949 after seeing a notice in a newspaper calling for 
recommendations for a flag for the newly communist nation, Xinhua 
said. The stars represent the Communist Party, industry and 
commerce, farmers, students and the military. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag was first raised on Oct. 1, 1949, by revolutionary  
leader Mao Tse-tung in Tiananmen Square in Beijing when he declared 
the founding of the People's Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Zeng later became a company manager and a Standing Committee  
member of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference after 1949, Xinhua said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports did not give any other details on Zeng's life,  
survivors or funeral arrangements.

<HEADLINE> IBM Y2K Woes May Not Affect Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite investor fears of broader industry  
fallout, IBM's dour warning about damage from the Year 2000 
computer glitch appears relatively limited to its own financial 
results -- and its stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns that IBM's woes could hit other technology companies  
initially pounded the stock market Thursday, sending the Dow Jones 
industrial average plunging more than 200 points in early trading. 
</P>
<P>
	But the market largely recovered by day's end, underscoring what  
some analysts have said all along: IBM could be a largely isolated 
instance of Y2K damage because its customers are heavy users of old 
mainframes, which are more likely to mistake the year 2000 for 
1900. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, in fact, the much-feared corporate spending freeze on  
new computer systems -- known in the industry as Y2K lockdown -- 
looks more like a mild chill. 
</P>
<P>
	``With very few exceptions, the software-hardware lockdown has  
been very small compared to what the fears were,'' said Michael 
Murphy, an independent analyst who is editor of the California 
Technology Stock Letter, based in Half Moon Bay, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``The customers are all saying, 'Our budgets aren't going to  
change, we're OK.' '' Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM released its third-quarter financial results late Wednesday,  
warning that sales would weaken because many would-be buyers of its 
powerful network and database server computers were hesitant to add 
new systems while fixing millennium bugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning sent the company's stock tumbling as much as 17  
percent on Thursday and dragged down the broader market. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Dow regained more than half its loss, ending down 94.67  
at 10,297.69, and many technology stocks came back. IBM did not, 
ending down $16 a share at $91 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The market's performance mirrors what several analysts say about  
how the damage to corporate spending by Y2K concerns is less 
broad-scale than feared as recently as early this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week software giant Microsoft Corp. predicted it  
would have strong holiday season sales, in contrast to a previous 
warning that sales could be off as companies devoted all their 
resources to stomping out 21st century computer bugs. 
</P>
<P>
	And Cisco Systems Inc., the largest maker of computer networking  
equipment, has said it's more comfortable with weathering Y2K woes 
than it was 6-to-12 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The uneven outlook is underscored by a recent survey by the  
Cutter Consortium. Only half of the 96 surveyed companies said they 
were deferring spending on computer systems while they prepare for 
Y2K snags. ``I would have expected it to be higher than that,'' 
said Sheila Green, of the Arlington, Mass.-based consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	George Elling, an analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc., said the  
mixed Y2K situation reflects the diversity of the computer 
industry. Hardly a monolith, the technology sector ranges from 
sellers devoted to just software or computers to full-range 
companies peddling all these products. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporations considering buying large computer systems, which  
are IBM's specialty, are most likely to defer related orders 
because of their scale and complexity. Also vulnerable are sellers 
such as PeopleSoft, which makes sophisticated software for running 
companies' human resource departments. 
</P>
<P>
	But few businesses will halt buying desktop computers needed to  
keep their basic operations humming smoothly, Elling said. 
</P>
<P>
	``More complex systems are likely to be deferred than a PC,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Euro Bank Leaves Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The European Central Bank left its key  
interest rates unchanged following its regular meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank, which sets monetary policy for the 11 European Union  
nations that have adopted the euro single currency, left its main 
refinancing rate on loans to financial institutions at 2.5 percent, 
where it has been since a 0.5 percent cut in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank also confirmed that its overnight deposit rate will

<P>
	Bank president Wim Duisenberg said two weeks ago the ECB was  
prepared to tighten policy as soon as it gets more signs of a 
strengthening economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, ``there's really no additional information'' that  
would have justified a move Thursday, said Gwyn Hacche, economist 
with HSBC in London. ``If anything, data have decreased the need to 
raise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The September business climate index in Germany, published  
Wednesday, was weaker-than-expected and damped expectations for a 
rate rise Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, inflation in the 11 European countries that have adopted  
the euro continues to be moderate, showing an annual rise of 1.2 
percent in September, unchanged from August, despite a 6.4 percent 
surge in energy prices. Inflation even fell slightly when volatile 
energy and food prices are stripped out. 
</P>
<P>
	The ECB bases its monetary policy decisions on money supply data  
and the outlook for inflation.

<HEADLINE> Forbes To Unveil Economic Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steve Forbes says his flat tax, health care,  
Social Security and deficit-reduction proposals would expand the 
U.S. economy by 75 percent, create more than 24 million jobs and 
increase wages by two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential candidate was releasing his 11-page  
economic package today in New Hampshire. Long-term estimates of the 
plan's effect on the U.S. economy were produced by a Virginia 
financial forecasting firm hired by the Forbes campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it is time to remove the big government barriers that  
stand in our way so that every American is free to take full 
advantage of the New Economy -- free to get a world-class education 
for their kids, get the IRS out of their face, choose their own 
doctors, own their own home, start their own businesses, and save 
and invest for a secure retirement,'' the document says. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who is trying to cast himself as an issue-driven  
candidate, planned to discuss the package during a visit to the 
home of a middle-class couple. 
</P>
<P>
	The package is a compilation of proposals Forbes put forth  
earlier in the campaign, some more detailed than others. Aides said 
this is the first time he has pulled them together and measured 
their impact. 
</P>
<P>
	He proposes to:  
</P>
<P>
	---- Replace the current tax code with a flat tax, allowing  
personal exemptions. A family of four earning $36,000 a year would 
pay no federal income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Allow young workers to establish personal retirement accounts.  
By 2002, a worker could deposit 4 percent of their Social Security 
taxes into a personal account that would be invested in the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Impose new spending limits on discretionary, non-defense  
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Create a ``truly dynamic and competitive health insurance  
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Allow parents to use government money to send children to the  
school of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiscal Associates, the Virginia firm hired by Forbes, says the  
plan would increase economic growth from 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent 
-- growing the U.S. economy from $9.8 trillion to $17.2 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes and the firm say that would create huge surpluses,  
allowing the $5.5 trillion federal debt to shrink by 60 percent in 
2020.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Panel Decides on Toxic School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles school system has been  
advised to finish building a half-completed, multimillion-dollar 
high school on a toxic site and deal with potential dangers later. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert panel set up specifically to decide the fate of the  
Belmont Learning Center voted 4-3 Wednesday in favor of completing 
the project at the downtown site -- a former oil field that releases 
potentially dangerous gases. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said it would attach conditions on dealing with  
the dangers of the site later. 
</P>
<P>
	The district already has spent $144 million on Belmont, the  
nation's most expensive high school. The commission concluded that 
finishing Belmont and adding technology to ease the gas problem 
would boost the cost about $50 million more than the original 
estimate of $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A commission report concluded that going to a replacement site  
would send the total cost to $339 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The half-built campus, originally scheduled to open this year,  
was to have been the crown jewel of the district's nearly 800 K-12 
schools. It is the nation's second-largest school district, with 
697,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction was halted after it was discovered that the 35-acre  
Belmont site was polluted with explosive methane and potentially 
deadly hydrogen sulfide. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite those problems, some 150 students marched from the  
existing overcrowded Belmont High School to the panel's meeting to 
urge that the school be completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got heard,'' Lester Pavon, 17, said afterward. ``We can  
show the generation that's coming up that we cared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During debate Wednesday, commission members -- experts on public  
health, law and science -- all agreed that the site was a bad one. 
Arguments centered on whether the levels of methane and hydrogen 
gas could be safely controlled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we would be placing (students) in the safest school in  
the entire area,'' if a system for collecting and venting the gas 
is installed, said Charles Calderon, a former state senator. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Craig Perkins countered that school should be ``a  
refuge, not a laboratory for toxic gas protection systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Belmont plan includes accommodations for 5,000 students,  
post-high school career development academies within the complex, 
retail stores, a police substation, low-income housing and sports 
facilities for the community. 
</P>
<P>
	In recommending the school be finished, the commission said it  
would also suggest that the school board ask the state attorney 
general whether proceeding would violate state law against building 
on toxic sites.

<HEADLINE> Blazers' Stoudamire Is Happier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Damon Stoudamire wouldn't mind being the  
starting point guard for the Portland Trail Blazers if he didn't 
have to do all that darn dribbling. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire averaged nearly 20 points a game in 2 1/2 seasons with  
the Toronto Raptors before being traded to Portland, his hometown, 
in February 1998. His role immediately changed from that of scorer 
to strictly playmaker, and his point production dropped to 12.6 a 
game during the lockout-shortened season. 
</P>
<P>
	With the offseason acquisitions of Scottie Pippen and Steve  
Smith, both veteran guard-forwards who can handle the ball, 
Stoudamire is looking forward to showing that his offensive flash 
hasn't dimmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happier,'' he said. ``As long as I don't have to bring the  
ball up the court every time, I'm going to find a way to get to the 
basket or make something happen. When I'm in my attack mode, it's 
either going to be a bucket or a foul. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you can always make plays for somebody else, but nobody  
can make them for you in return, that gets very frustrating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trading for Pippen and Smith and signing free agent Detlef  
Schrempf also has shifted the spotlight from Stoudamire, who did 
not react well to pressure during the Blazers' four-game sweep by 
San Antonio in the Western Conference finals last season. 
</P>
<P>
	After missing a key free throw late in Game 2 that allowed the  
Spurs' Sean Elliott to win it with a 3-pointer, Stoudamire blasted 
Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy for playing Greg Anthony more than him 
in crunch time. Stoudamire even said signing a seven-year, $81 
million contract extension before the season may have been a 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire's comments perplexed his coach, raised the eyebrows  
of the seasoned Spurs and caused the player to be vilified on 
sports talk shows and in newspapers across the country. Stoudamire 
became another example of ``What's Wrong with Athletes Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His low point came in Game 3, when the Rose Garden crowd booed  
him. It only got worse when he shot just 1-for-12 and the Blazers 
lost by 22 points. Two nights later, Portland lost again and 
Stoudamire wept after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	While trade rumors sprang up, Stoudamire got out of Dodge,  
traveling to the Bahamas and all over the United States, returning 
to Portland only to conduct free basketball camps and other 
community service events. 
</P>
<P>
	``I traveled around the country and around the world for a  
couple months, just to get away from the game and do some other 
things,'' Stoudamire said. ``That was fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers are 4-0 in exhibition games are looking more  
comfortable with each other every time out. In their first home 
exhibition against Golden State last week, Stoudamire was 
sensational, getting 10 points and six assists in a 37-point first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'll get better shots on our team because we move the  
ball better, and we pass the ball better,'' Dunleavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three nights later against Phoenix, however, Anthony showed why  
Dunleavy went to him so often with the game on the line. 
Stoudamire, returning to the McKale Center in Tucson for the first 
time since leaving Arizona in 1995, watched from the bench as 
Anthony scored 10 points in the fourth quarter to lead the Blazers 
back from an 85-78 deficit to a 117-110 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire would like to boost his scoring average back up to  
the 15-point range, but said he won't mind if he isn't the center 
of attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that people don't understand is that I never really  
wanted to score 20 here,'' he said. ``That never really was my goal 
when I got traded here to Portland. I've always wanted to lead the 
league in assists, because I was always right up there with the 
high numbers in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not even too concerned about how my scoring opportunities  
are going to come. I know I'll have more, just because I've got 
guys that know how to create for other people, just the same way I 
can create for them.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Parents Sale Kid on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALLIANCE, Ohio (AP) -- For years, social workers noted the awful  
conditions at the family's home -- the children smoked, missed 
school, were plagued with lice and slept in bedrooms with animal 
feces. 
</P>
<P>
	But a bad situation became intolerable to county officials when  
claims surfaced that the parents had sold their 14-year-old son to 
a Virginia man they met through the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the teen-ager and five siblings, ranging in age from 11  
months to 12 years, have been removed from their parents' custody 
on a judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents and the man who took the boy in deny wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged criminally, but the FBI and police in  
Alliance, about 50 miles southeast of Cleveland, are investigating. 
The Associated Press and other news organizations are not releasing 
the family's name to protect the children's privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-year-old, while under psychiatric care for threatening  
suicide in Virginia, last month told a social worker his parents 
sold him to Harry Greene for between $300 and $400, according to 
court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa LaGuardia, an attorney for the Stark County Department of  
Human Services, would not say whether authorities believe the 
youth's claim. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to assess and reassess all allegations that have  
been made,'' she said Wednesday. ``I don't think we make a 
complaint based on any one thing. It's a combination of stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, 38, of Harrisonburg, Va., said the allegations are  
``totally false -- totally misleading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene insisted he paid no money for the teen-ager. He said he  
placed the Internet ad because he wanted to take in a foster child 
after his 13-year-old son died in 1996 from an allergic reaction to 
an antibiotic. 
</P>
<P>
	Social workers have been monitoring the family for five years  
and the county maintains that the children were abused and 
neglected, LaGuardia said. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple have 11 children in all. A 15-year-old is permanently  
in county custody and four were adopted by other families, 
LaGuardia said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a complaint filed this month by the human services  
agency, the 14-year-old told social workers his parents always 
received compensation when they put a child up for adoption, 
including hundreds of dollars, clothes for the other children and, 
in one case, a swing set. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint also said the home was ``constantly filthy,'' with  
cockroaches, flies and animal feces in the children's bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Graham, an attorney for the parents, called the  
allegations absurd. He said the couple would respond fully at a 
Dec. 9 hearing to decide whether the county should have permanent 
custody of the children. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple's phone is temporarily disconnected. They were not  
home when the AP left a written request for an interview at their 
door.

<HEADLINE> Jury Rules on Mistaken Prescription </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ODESSA, Texas (AP) -- A jury has ordered a cardiologist, a  
drugstore and a pharmacist to pay $450,000 to the family of a 
42-year-old man who died after the druggist misread the doctor's 
handwritten prescription. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the verdict to be paid by Dr. Ramachandra Kolluru, and  
the other half by an Albertson's pharmacy in Odessa and pharmacist 
Thomas Updyke. The verdict was issued on Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctor is disappointed, because he very strongly felt in  
his mind that he had written a legible prescription,'' said 
Kolluru's attorney, Max Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney also said he believes strong evidence was presented  
that the man's heart disease killed him, not the medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of heart patient Ramon Vasquez contended that he died  
in 1995 because he took an overdose of the wrong medication after 
Updyke misread an illegible prescription from Kolluru. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the lawsuit, the prescription called for 20  
milligrams of Isordil, used to treat angina, every six hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Updyke instead received a prescription for the same dosage of  
Plendil, which is used to treat high blood pressure. That drug has 
a recommended dosage of only 5 milligrams per day, with a maximum 
of 10 per day. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Vasquez, a father of three, returned home and began  
taking the drug, he suffered a heart attack and died. 
</P>
<P>
	Updyke does not have a listed number.

<HEADLINE> Albright Decries Cut in Africa Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in  
the middle of an African tour, angrily denounced members of 
Congress back home for slashing foreign aid while people here 
suffer in a daily struggle for survival. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not that they expect a handout from the U.S. They expect  
help,'' she told reporters Wednesday as she flew across the 
continent to Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright had just spent three days in West Africa, meeting  
government officials in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Mali and Nigeria. She 
said all those nations have an opportunity to escape dreadful 
pasts, including civil war and dictatorships, and need U.S. 
financial help to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	It's ``very hard to understand that we have the world's greatest  
economy and we have a huge budget surplus and they are digging 
themselves out of garbage,'' Albright said, referring to Africans 
still trapped in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright suggested that Congress might not have cut $2 billion  
from the administration's foreign affairs budget request if more 
members traveled abroad and met ordinary people. ``That is how we 
can get this passed -- if they understood what the stakes are,'' she 
said. Although Albright named no names, she noted that one 
congressional leader has acknowledged that he does not have a 
passport. ``I don't think that should be a matter of pride,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress cut the Clinton administration's foreign operations  
spending request to $12.7 billion, and President Clinton vetoed the 
bill on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., defended the congressional action  
saying the funding lawmakers approved would enhance U.S. priorities 
overseas while remaining within the confines of a balanced budget 
agreement. He said foreign affairs programs should be subjected to 
the same fiscal discipline as domestic spending. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Callahan offended Arab-American leaders and angered  
congressional Democrats when he criticized Clinton's proposals for 
forgiving ``debt that these foreign leaders have incurred during 
these corrupt regimes in Africa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I might forewarn the President that Halloween is just around  
the corner and a lot of these people knocking on the White House 
gate for trick-or-treat might have on turbans,'' Callahan said on 
the floor of the House. ``And I might tell them when they go knock 
on the door, `Wear a turban and carry a bag and let me tell you, 
that President will fill it up. He'll give you an IOU from the 
Congress.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright vented her frustrations with such attitudes not long  
after taking off from Nigeria for Kenya, the fifth stop on her six 
country Africa tour. 
</P>
<P>
	She was clearly impressed by the Nigeria and its fledgling  
democratic government's prospects for becoming an economic 
powerhouse and a force for peace and democracy among smaller 
troubled neighbors in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the Clinton's administration's budget battles with the  
Republican-controlled Congress didn't stop Albright from proposing 
about $55 million in additional assistance to Sierra Leone and at 
least that much for Nigeria. She also spoke of the possibility of 
debt forgiveness for some countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a giveaway program. It's in the national interest,''  
Albright said, although she added, ``There are those who don't 
believe in this program who are going to use my trip to say that I 
was handing out money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright promised that she will return to Washington this  
weekend with ``renewed vigor'' to make her case for more foreign 
aid to the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States clearly has to help which is why I am so  
angry ... at what is going on with our budget,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Gore: I'll Ban Offshore Drilling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, going beyond Clinton  
administration policies, is pledging to ``do everything in my 
power'' to ban all new offshore oil drilling in federal waters off 
Florida and California. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic presidential candidate also said he would fight  
to stop drilling in federal waters off all states ``where the 
public clearly opposes it'' -- even if companies already have been 
given offshore leases from the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will take the most sweeping steps in our history to protect  
our oceans and coastal waters from offshore oil drilling,'' Gore 
said in prepared remarks for a campaign event in Rye, N.H. ``I will 
make sure that there is no new oil leasing off the coast of 
California and Florida.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, long a champion of the environment and author of ``Earth  
in the Balance,'' also said his plan would go further than the 
current Clinton administration policy that permits limited new 
drilling in areas already leased to companies by the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will go much further: I will do everything in my power to  
make sure that there is no new drilling off these sensitive coasts 
-- even in areas already leased for drilling by previous 
administrations,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's proposal would go further to protect the environment than  
recent Clinton administration moves on offshore drilling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gore campaign plans a television ad in California to promote  
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to protect our oceans and beaches, and if elected  
president I'll do that,'' Gore says in the ad. ``To be good 
stewards of our earth we must create a future worthy of our 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, President Clinton signed an executive order extending  
until 2012 the current federal offshore oil drilling ban, which was 
set to expire in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the moratorium blankets virtually all of the North  
Atlantic and Pacific coasts, southwest Florida, New England, the 
Mid-Atlantic and southern Alaska, his action did not stop existing 
rigs from pumping oil from beneath the ocean floor. And, in 
southern California at least, more rigs can still go up if oil 
companies act on 39 ``undeveloped'' leases. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, however, would extend the ban on offshore drilling in  
federal waters to include all the waters off Florida and 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies in California and Florida already have spent billions  
to secure the lease rights to drill in the federal waters Gore 
would place off-limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a ban, an industry spokesman said, will force companies  
overseas to find new drilling sites -- hurting the economy and 
making the United States even more dependent on imported oil and 
natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
	``To make such a ban really ignores the need for natural gas and  
oil to be produced domestically,'' said Mark Rubin, spokesman for 
the American Petroleum Institute. ``The bottom line here is that 
because we are limited in our access to federal lands, the 
companies are forced to spend their exploration budgets overseas 
and this is going to simply further that. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to force companies to go overseas to find  
natural gas and oil,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	One prominent environmental group applauded Gore's proposal.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is extremely welcome news. These are two highly desirable  
places for complete protection,'' said Bruce Hamilton, national 
conservation director for the Sierra Club. ``It is great news to 
hear that a leader of his stature is taking a stand to protect both

<HEADLINE> The Bowdens Keep Few Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	We probably know more about the Bowdens than any bunch since the  
Bradys. Because for nearly four decades now, the first family of 
college football has kept few secrets from us or one another. 
</P>
<P>
	If you wanted to know whether Tommy really had a master plan to  
become a coach in sixth grade, all you had to do was ask Ann, his 
mother. The term paper that came back from school that day marked 
``A-plus'' went straight into a drawer, where it still sits today. 
</P>
<P>
	Or say you wanted to know how upset Bobby really was when some  
boosters and bigwigs at Auburn forced Terry out as coach. Then you 
asked Jeff, the youngest son. 
</P>
<P>
	With a knowing smile, Jeff would say forget the neutral  
mumbo-jumbo their dad mentioned at the time and look at how much 
Auburn coughed up -- $500,000 -- to cancel a scheduled game against 
Florida State rather than incur the old man's wrath. 
</P>
<P>
	And just think: All that candor was just a rehearsal for the  
jabs, jokes, stories, trick plays, offensive schemes and uncensored 
material the Bowdens have been swapping freely among themselves 
over the dinner table for nearly 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Or used to, anyway.  
</P>
<P>
	Because something changed drastically two months ago, just as  
college football was about to kick off. That's when the father, 
about to begin his 24th season at Florida State, called in his 
second-oldest son, about to begin his first at Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
	``No way can we share the things we usually do,'' Bobby Bowden  
told Tommy. ``We're all usually on the same page. Now that we're 
playing, I have to be very careful. I don't reveal any secrets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If this seems harsh, remember what the old man has on the line  
Saturday, when father faces son as coach for the first time in the 
113 years colleges have played one another. Bobby Bowden will be 
looking to pick up his 300th win, keep his record unblemished and 
his chances for a national championship alive. 
</P>
<P>
	And what about Tommy?  
</P>
<P>
	``If we lose,'' he deadpanned, ``we're 3-4.''  
</P>
<P>
	But father vs. son won't be the only tie that binds the  
sidelines in this game. Jeff coaches receivers for his dad at 
Florida State. Jack Hines, who coaches the secondary for Clemson, 
is married to the Bowdens' oldest child, Robyn. 
</P>
<P>
	To top it off, Terry, who took his buyout from Auburn and went  
to work for ABC Sports, will be in the studio analyzing the game. 
</P>
<P>
	That in itself will give Tommy and Bobby something to talk about  
before kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll wonder, Tommy said, ``How much Terry will criticize us  
both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That may be the last laugh they share for several hours. Because  
Saturday will be one of those days the grownups in the Bowden 
household have dreaded since Bobby started lecturing his own about 
the ugly side of his profession. The poor job security, the 
gypsy-like existence, the constant politicking -- things he used to 
hope his sons would never know. 
</P>
<P>
	Lot of good that did him.  
</P>
<P>
	Even seeing their father hung in effigy had little effect on the  
boys. It happened 25 years ago one Sunday morning when Bobby was 
coaching at West Virginia and driving his family to church. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Steve, the oldest boy, bypassed dad's world completely and  
became a financial planner. Even the Bowdens' two daughters married 
football players. 
</P>
<P>
	To find the reason why the kids chose football, and why Saturday  
will be less about pain than gain, you don't have to scratch the 
surface very deep. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Bowden is -- to use his own words -- so ``dad-gummed  
competitive'' that that singular gene appears to have taken hold 
above all the others he and Ann bestowed on their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby has the family's only national championship. The two sons  
both have unbeaten seasons -- something their father wants. Terry 
got his the year Auburn was on probation and ineligible for a bowl. 
That enabled him to steal coach of the year honors from Bobby the 
season he won the national title. Tommy completed his perfect 
season last year at Tulane. You can be sure the three boys never 
fail to remind one another of the details. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Bobby quit talking strategy before September rolled  
around. It's why Tommy would like nothing better than to derail his 
dad's express, and why Ann will be sitting in seats at Memorial 
Stadium far above the field to root for her husband and wrestle 
with her conscience. 
</P>
<P>
	That much is understood by the rest of the family. Jeff used to  
say his mother always said she'd cheer for whichever Bowden has the 
most to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there wasn't so much at stake in this ballgame for Bobby, I  
wouldn't even think twice about rooting for Tommy,'' Ann said. 
``There is not a lot at stake for Tommy. This is his first year. 
He's not expected to win like we are.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Honors Police Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton honored nearly three dozen  
police officers for outstanding service to their communities 
Thursday, and he used the Rose Garden ceremony to press Republicans 
to pass his crime-fighting measures this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Trumpeting the decline in violent crime during his  
administration and linking it to his program to put 100,000 
community police officers on the streets, the president lambasted 
GOP lawmakers for resisting his proposal to continue the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now this doesn't make any sense to me. If you've got a problem  
that you're solving ... and we've got the money to do it, why would 
you choose to spend the money on something else instead of making 
America the safest big country in the world?'' Clinton said. ``If 
Congress sends me a crime-fighting bill that's a crime-spending 
bill that doesn't have the right priorities, I will have to veto 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke at a ceremony honoring the 32 recipients of  
this year's National Association of Police Organizations sixth 
annual ``Top Cops'' award. The honorees included officers who 
rescued fellow officers while under fire, subdued assailants after 
being shot and wounded and evacuated 200 people from an apartment 
building before a gas explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have performed astonishing acts of valor and humanity,''  
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the guests was actor Yaphet Kotto, who played a commander  
on the TV drama ``Homicide.'' Kotto's son, Frederick Samuel Kotto, 
30, a police officer in San Jose was named for Kotto's uncle, who 
was killed in the 1950s while on duty as a New York City police 
detective. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a son out there driving a police car, and I don't  
want anything to happen to him,'' he said, urging lawmakers to fund 
Clinton's anti-crime proposals. ``This is not a game out there. 
These guys, while they're sitting around politicizing it, people 
are out there actually risking their lives. I don't want to go to 
my son's funeral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The honorees were: Alaska State Trooper Barry Croy; Los Angeles  
police officers Andy Azodi, Jude Bella, Ryan Clark, Chris Dunn, 
Kevin J. Foster, Craig Schofield Hewitt and Chris Yzaguirre; 
Connecticut state troopers Michael Allard, Michael J. Hoague, Mark 
Pelletier and James E. Reidy Jr.; Chicago police Sgt. James 
McMullin; Detroit police officers James Henry Lightfoot Jr., Gasper 
Rossi and Steven Louis Sosa, and Sgts. Michael Stefani and James 
Tolbert and Lt. Arthur McNamara; St. Joseph, Mo., police Sgts. 
Terry R. White, Steven Gumm and Billy Paul Miller, and officers 
Rebecca Caton, Roy W. Wedlow Jr., Henry Castaneda Pena and Shawn 
Hamre; Jersey City, N.J., police Sgt. Heriberto Carattini; 
Poughkeepsie, N.Y., police Sgt. Karl Skip Mannain; Johnston, R.I., 
police Sgt. Michael Calenda and officer Thomas H. Dolan; U.S. Park 
Service police officers Robert Louis Freeman III and Kevin J. 
Nieves.

<HEADLINE> Stayner Charged in Yosemite Murders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIPOSA, Calif. (AP) -- Relatives of three sightseers slain in  
Yosemite National Park say they are glad murder charges have been 
filed against a motel handyman who allegedly confessed to the 
killings three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'll feel a resolution when it's all done -- when this  
man is in jail or in prison for at least the rest of his life,'' 
said Carole Carrington, whose daughter, Carole Sund, and 
granddaughter, Juli Sund, were two of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner, 38, was charged with three murder counts on  
Wednesday. He could face the death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI investigators say Stayner confessed in late July to killing  
Sund, 42, her daughter Juli, 15, and their Argentine friend Silvina 
Pelosso, 16, while the three were visiting the park in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner's admission came while he was being questioned in the  
beheading of Yosemite naturalist Joie Ruth Armstrong, 26, officials 
say. Stayner, who also said he killed Ms. Armstrong, has pleaded 
innocent in that case. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators had said they were waiting to charge Stayner in  
the sightseers' slayings until they could rule out the possibility 
of accomplices. 
</P>
<P>
	One member of the FBI task force handling the case, who spoke on  
condition of anonymity, said he was ``stunned'' by the charges, 
saying ``there are just too many unanswered questions'' about 
whether Stayner acted alone. 
</P>
<P>
	A month after their disappearance, authorities discovered the  
bodies of Mrs. Sund and Miss Pelosso in the trunk of their rental 
car, which had been set afire and abandoned along a logging road. 
Juli's body was found a few days later in a thicket near a lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner was questioned repeatedly but never considered a suspect  
in the deaths. Agents began searching for him again when he failed 
to show up for work the day after Ms. Armstrong's body was found in 
a remote corner of Yosemite, not far from the motel where he 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested at a nudist camp three days later.

<HEADLINE> Iowa Cubs Name New Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The Iowa Cubs hired Dave Trembley on  
Wednesday as their manager for the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Trembley replaces Terry Kennedy, who managed Iowa the past two  
seasons before asking for a position closer to his Arizona home. 
Kennedy compiled a record of 150-134 and led the Cubs to the 1998 
Pacific Coast League Central Division pennant. 
</P>
<P>
	Trembley has managed 13 seasons in the minor leagues, including  
six in the Chicago Cubs organization. Trembley spent four seasons 
managing the Cubs AA team, the past two with West Tennessee Diamond 
Jaxx. 
</P>
<P>
	West Tennessee finished the 1999 season with an 84-58 record,  
advancing to the Southern League championship series. Trembley was 
chosen the Southern League Manager of the Year.

<HEADLINE> President Raises Money for Dems. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, relaxed and jocular among a  
welcoming partisan crowd, raised campaign cash Thursday night for a 
leader of American liberalism, Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am genuinely honored,'' Clinton told about 250 guests who  
paid $10,000 apiece to attend a reception at Kennedy's Washington 
home. ``I love Edward Kennedy,'' Clinton said, pausing between each 
word for emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton reeled off an unashamedly liberal to-do list for the  
early years of the new century, including help for the poorest 
Americans, better health care, better services for the aged and an 
end to discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the opportunity to create the world of our dreams,''  
Clinton said, adding later: ``There's nobody better qualified to be 
the conscience, the heart, and the tactical leader of that struggle 
than Senator Kennedy. This is a big deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy is also a favorite target of Republicans, especially in  
fund-raising appeals. He faced an unexpectedly difficult 
re-election in 1994, when multimillionaire Republican Mitt Romney 
spent $7.6 million to come within single digits of Kennedy in 
opinion polls. Kennedy rallied, and won with 58 percent of the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton noted that he was in the 10th grade when Kennedy was  
first elected in 1962, and that Kennedy will likely still be in 
office when Clinton leaves the White House 15 months from now. ``I 
resent it, actually,'' Clinton joked. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he drew a laugh by remarking, as he often does these  
days: ``I'm not running for anything. I kind of wish I was, 
actually.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic National Committee said the party would raise  
$400,000 for Kennedy's 2000 campaign, when Kennedy hopes to win a 
seventh six-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton made an unscheduled stop at the nearby home of another  
Democratic stalwart, Johnson administration Defense Secretary 
Robert McNamara, en route to a second Democratic fund-raising 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	About 25 technology industry executives dined on wild mushroom  
consomme, curried spiced chicken and chocolate and ginger ice cream 
at the home of Kennedy's Massachusetts colleague, Sen. John Kerry. 
The DNC estimated the event would bring in $400,000 for Democratic 
candidates in general. 
</P>
<P>
	The event was part of the Democratic Party's efforts to reach  
out to the new wealth among high technology executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who sometimes says the computer age has left him a bit  
befuddled, spoke briefly about the opportunity for advances in 
human health through technology, saying, ``I think it's a huge 
issue.''

<HEADLINE> UPS Anticipates Raising $4.6B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- United Parcel Service could raise as much as $4.6  
billion in its initial public offering set for next month, 
according to a document the company filed Wednesday with federal 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS said in the Securities and Exchange Commission filing that  
it expects to sell 109.4 million shares valued at $36 to $42 per 
share after a 2-for-1 split planned immediately before the IPO. 
</P>
<P>
	The package delivery giant announced in July that it plans to  
sell 10 percent of its common stock to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	If the offering goes forward at the higher price of $42 per  
share, it would be the largest ever, valued at about $4.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest IPO was last year's $4 billion offering by the oil  
company Conoco. Last year, Goldman Sachs, the securities firm, 
raised $3.66 billion when it went public in the second-largest IPO 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based UPS has about 330,000 employees. Last year, the  
company reported net income of $1.7 billion on revenues of $24.8 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees are set to vote on the proposed stock sale Oct. 25. If  
it's approved, UPS expects the IPO to occur in November, although 
no date has been set, company spokesman Norman Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees and retirees now own about two-thirds of the company.  
</P>
<P>
	UPS has requested to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange  
under the symbol UPS.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Sink; Dow Down 152.61 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plunged in early trading today following  
IBM's dour warning that worries about the Year 2000 computer bug 
are hurting hardware sales and may cut into profits. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was down 152.61 at 10,239.75. IBM accounted for 
75 points of the decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also sharply lower. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 18.76 at 1,270.67, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was down 45.27 at 2,742.86. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders attributed the broad market's fall almost entirely to  
pessimism following IBM's disappointing forecast. The company said 
after the close of trading Wednesday that potential buyers of IBM's 
network and database servers are postponing purchases until after 
the start of the new year, when concerns over the Year 2000 
computer bug are fully resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from the network and database business dropped 40  
percent in the third quarter, and the weakness is expected to 
continue through the fourth quarter and into January, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of IBM plummeted 15 to 92 on the New York Stock Exchange.  
</P>
<P>
	IBM's news robbed the market of the ebullience that drove the  
Dow 187.43 points higher, and the Nasdaq 99.95 points higher, on 
Wednesday. That rally was sparked nearly entirely by Microsoft, 
which released earnings that soundly beat expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft officials attributed the company's strong earnings and  
sales to ``awesome'' demand for personal computers, sparking a 
day-long rally in technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers today by an 8-to-3 margin  
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 126.63 million 
shares, well ahead of Wednesday's early pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.56 to 410.38.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.5 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 1.4 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 1.7 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 0.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bauer, Keyes Meet in GOP Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DERRY, N.H. (AP) -- Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes, the only two  
participants in New Hampshire's first forum for Republican 
presidential candidates Thursday night, agreed more than they 
disagreed during the half-hour event. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah had planned to attend, but canceled at  
the last minute because of unfinished business in Washington. He 
offered brief greetings and an apology by satellite before the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer and Keyes criticized their rivals -- and Texas Gov. George  
W. Bush in particular -- for their unwillingness to attend the 
WNDS-TV forum. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's sad Gov. Bush has not shown up tonight,'' Bauer  
said. ``I think the front-runners in the party are relying on their 
bank accounts, not their ideas. I think that's going to backfire on 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes agreed, calling the absence of the other candidates a  
``reflection of their contempt for the democratic process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a bunch of people who think this race is already  
determined by their name or their money,'' the former U.N. 
ambassador said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the event's host took a not-so-subtle jab at the other  
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes you wonder whether other candidates with more dollars  
and higher poll numbers really want to debate,'' said news director 
Jack Heath. 
</P>
<P>
	In the most recent poll by the American Research Group Inc. of  
Manchester, Keyes and Bauer stayed in the low single digits, while 
Hatch held steady at 0 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer and Keyes are competing for votes among conservative  
Christians. When asked how they would persuade voters of other 
faiths to support them, Keyes said his goals stem from the 
fundamental principles the country was founded upon, ideals that 
transcend religion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter what someone's race or background is because  
we can stand as Americans together,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said he doesn't hide his faith, but said he is running as  
a ``Reagan Republican'' whose views on the economy and other key 
issues will appeal to a wide segment of voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last time I checked, Buddhists were as concerned about lower  
taxes as anyone,'' said Bauer, who was vice president of a group 
called Focus on the Family from 1989 until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair diverged most widely on campaign finance reform, with  
Bauer supporting a ban on soft money contributions to political 
parties and an increase in the donations individuals can make to 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shouldn't have government financing of campaigns, but I do  
think we should have reform,'' he said. ``If someone can write a $5 
million check and give it to the Democratic National Committee or 
the Republican National Committee, that's going to buy some 
access.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Keyes said campaign financing should be completely  
unregulated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to abolish this whole phony system of regulation,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes said only individuals should be able to contribute to  
campaigns, but should be allowed to do so without limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be total publicity,'' he said. ``The minute they  
give that donation, everyone in American ought to know it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both candidates said the growing incidence of school violence  
stems from a breakdown in families and the nation's moral decline. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of the shooting at Columbine High School in  
Colorado, school officials missed important signs, Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one sent them home, no one called their parents in for a  
conference,'' he said. ``But if a teacher had hung up the Ten 
Commandments in a classroom, she would've been in the principal's 
office the same day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both also agreed that the federal government has too much  
control over education. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why are we setting up a system to send money to Washington and  
then begging them to send it back to us?'' Keyes said. ``The goal 
of a Keyes administration is to do what Ronald Reagan said we 
should do: abolish the Department of Education.''

<HEADLINE> Blockbuster Moves Onto Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Blockbuster Inc. plans to allow customers to  
reserve videos over the Internet starting next spring, a move 
generally applauded by analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Some wonder, however, whether the move will prove to be a  
last-gasp effort to save an industry that soon may not exist 
because of ongoing technological advances and changing consumer 
preferences. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blockbuster has done a nice job of consolidating a declining  
industry,'' said Tom Wolzien, a media analyst with Sanford C. 
Bernstein &AMP; Co. in New York. ``They're signing up customers, 
they're opening stores, they're doing everything right. The 
question is, are they seeing the future right?''

	Wolzien predicts that within four to seven years, consumers will  
have set-top boxes from cable-television operators that can receive 
signals for the Internet and video. Even if the Dallas-based 
Blockbuster captures some of that video-on-demand business, Wolzien 
said, it would be less profitable than video stores, which benefit 
from late fees and the habit of some consumers to rent more tapes 
than they watch. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessica Reif Cohen, an entertainment-industry analyst for  
Merrill Lynch, said Blockbuster had no choice but to make this 
move. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're big believers in video-on-demand. It's going to take at  
least half the market share away from the bricks-and-mortar 
stores,'' said Jessica Reif Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Blockbuster will be selling movies as well as renting  
them over the Internet. Customers will still have to pick the 
rentals up at stores, however, though a delivery service is a 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Blockbuster chairman John Antioco acknowledges that  
video-on-demand will happen, though he expects it ``is probably 
four or five years out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Antioco said in an interview Thursday that the technology of  
providing true, unlimited video-on-demand -- as opposed to glorified 
pay-per-view, in which viewers select from a limited menu of movies 
and times -- is still far from market-ready. Issues of technology, 
bandwidth and copyright issues must be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Antioco said video stores have survived the advent of  
pay-per-view and will survive video-on-demand. Some analysts agree. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the plain-vanilla video store will be around for  
quite some time,'' said Frederick Moran, an analyst with Jefferies 
&AMP; Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, Blockbuster aims to become the Web site that people  
remember when they think of movies, Antioco said. In addition to 
6,860 stores, he said the chain has the brand name, customer list 
(65 million people in its database), distribution and marketing 
muscle to make an attractive e-company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should be the clear favorite to deliver movies to people  
over the Internet,'' Antioco said.

<HEADLINE> Sacramento Becomes Haven for Webber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chris Webber found happiness in the place he  
least expected it. 
</P>
<P>
	Not Golden State, where he was the No. 1 draft pick. Nor  
Washington, D.C., where he was teamed with former Fab Five teammate 
Juwan Howard. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sacramento, the lowly outpost of the NBA and a place he  
never wanted to go, has become a haven for the oft-troubled Webber. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know it was going to be a new beginning. I thought it  
was going to be the continuation of things being bad,'' he said. 
``I'm glad it turned around and things are good. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope this is the future and I can move forward and play  
with this team because it's definitely fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fun wasn't a word in Webber's vocabulary much the last few  
years. Though immensely talented -- he's averaged 20 points or more 
the last five seasons -- he drew more attention for off-the-court 
troubles than his game. 
</P>
<P>
	He's on his third team -- fourth if you count the Orlando Magic,  
who traded him to the Golden State Warriors on draft day. His last 
season with the Washington Wizards was marred by marijuana 
offenses, traffic violations and accusations of sexual misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was traded to the Kings, he was so unhappy his agent  
hinted he might refuse to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was my low point,'' he said Tuesday before the Kings  
played the Chicago Bulls. ``That's the lowest point I think I've 
ever been, and not just because of being in Sacramento. It was the 
culmination of things that had happened to me in that year, and 
Sacramento was the final chapter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the lockout dragged on, Kings coach Rick Adelman and the  
Sacramento players wondered what Webber would do once the season 
began. Would he play? Would he sit out? 
</P>
<P>
	A no-show the first day of training camp, Webber arrived the  
second day after a talk with his father. He still wasn't thrilled 
to be there, but he assured Adelman he'd play hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``The basketball part is the only thing that keeps me sane,''  
Webber said. ``The pressure on the court, I've loved that. It's 
made me play better, kept me goal-oriented while all of the 
distractions are going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adelman, in return, promised Webber a fresh start. Whatever had  
happened in the past was in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	He also gave Webber freedom on the court, telling him -- and the  
rest of his players -- he'd give him a game plan and then let him 
go. As long as the Kings accomplished what Adelman wanted, they 
could play their own games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a coach that trusts in our instincts,'' Webber said.  
``When you have a coach who trusts his players, then the players 
trust the coach that much more and they'll run through a brick wall 
for him. That's the type of team we have. We play for each other, 
and that's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webber started the first month of the season strong, taking the  
Kings along for the ride. By the time the season was over, the 
Kings were the surprise of the NBA. They finished 27-23, their 
first winning season in 16 years, and made the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Webber, who averaged 20 points and 13 rebounds a game, led the  
league in rebounding and was second-team All-NBA. He also became a 
fan of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	``After seeing the pieces of the puzzle they were putting  
together, I knew with the success we'd have that he'd change his 
mind,'' Kings forward Corliss Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Webber doesn't know exactly when he realized Sacramento was the  
place for him, but he knows why. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys on the team, they make it enjoyable to go to work  
every day. It's almost like I'm not even working. It's more like 
we're playing hard every day,'' he said. ``The fans supported the 
team when the team wasn't good at all, so it's easy for them to 
support a team that's halfway good. So it's fun being in that 
situation and being with young guys and young talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``And coach, he lets us play. He gives us responsibility, but he  
lets us be individuals.''

<HEADLINE> Tyson's Trainer Has Poor Word Choice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- There's no doubt Tommy Brooks is a boxing  
trainer and not a boxing publicist. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what Mike Tyson's strategy will be against Orlin Norris on  
Saturday night, Brooks said, ``Mike's going to do what he does 
best, pin somebody's ears back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks said ``pin,'' not ``bite,'' but any mention of Tyson and  
ears in the same breath is enough to make grown men quake. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson made news earlier this month when he told the Los Angeles  
Times that he would bite an opponent again if a referee allowed the 
opponent to head butt as Mills Lane allowed Evander Holyfield to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was disqualified and had his license revoked for biting  
Holyfield's ears in the third round June 28, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Just kidding. Ah, that old joker -- Mike Tyson.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was just talking smack,'' the 33-year-old former undisputed  
heavyweight champion said. ``I was trying to sell some tickets. The 
Nevada State Athletic Commission knew I wasn't serious. They knew 
the trauma that I went through. I won't do that in the ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada State Athletic  
Commission said after a Wednesday news conference for the 10-round 
match in the MGM Grand Garden that ``what he does in the ring is 
the only thing we can judge him on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Steele will referee Saturday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Tyson seems to be a creature of impulse and what he might do in  
or out of the ring on given night or day is what keeps him an 
attraction. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest act in show business'' is how Dan Goosen,  
president of promoter America Presents, introduced Tyson at the 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad actor is what Tyson is to many people, but many of those  
same people follow his career and pay to see him. The Black Hat 
actor has always been an attraction. 
</P>
<P>
	The main theme of Tyson's act is uncertainty -- will he lose,  
will he hurt somebody, will he do something outrageous? Slowed by 
age and inactivity, Tyson no longer is the intimidating baddest 
man. Francois Botha was mocking Tyson when he got careless and was 
knocked out by a right to the jaw late in the fifth round Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The power remains, and the 33-year-old Tyson still is a factor  
in a heavyweight division sorely lacking in depth. But when it 
comes down strictly to boxing, he is one of the pack. At one time, 
there was Tyson and far behind him, the rest of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of his performance against Botha -- he was clearly behind  
on all three official cards after four rounds -- and because he 
hasn't fought since because of a jail time in Maryland for 
assaulting two motorists, the people selling Tyson have elected not 
to make Saturday's fight a pay-per-view match. It will be seen live 
on HBO sometime around midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	What the sellers need Saturday night is a dominating performance  
from Tyson, and that is why Norris is being paid $800,000 to fight 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old Norris is a former cruiserweight champion who  
not only is close to Tyson's age, but at 5-foot-10 matches Tyson's 
size. Tyson is listed at 5-11 1/2, but appears shorter than that. 
</P>
<P>
	More importantly, Norris is now a power puncher.  
</P>
<P>
	``My job is not to get hit with that big shot,'' Norris said.  
</P>
<P>
	But sooner or later he will, and ``the biggest act in show  
business'' will next be seen on pay-per-view.

<HEADLINE> Senate Supports Abortion Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a rare referendum on Roe vs. Wade, the  
Senate went on record Thursday as saying the landmark abortion 
ruling established ``an important constitutional right'' and should 
not be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	The nonbinding resolution, sure to provide fodder for campaign  
ads for the 2000 election, won near-party-line support from the 
Senate's Democrats, and eight Republicans joined them to ensure 
passage. It was added to a bill that would ban certain late-term 
abortions, which later passed 63-34. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be an absolutely huge issue next year,''  
declared Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif, of the Roe vs. Wade 
resolution. The abortion-rights supporter said: ``Now we see the 
extremists in the United States Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said the vote was irrelevant to the main legislation  
up for debate: a ban on certain late-term abortions sponsored by 
Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who has vetoed two earlier bans, also opposes  
Santorum's bill because, although it makes an exception for a woman 
whose life is endangered by the pregnancy, it lacks an exception 
for a woman whose health, but not life, is endangered. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again the bill fell short -- by four votes, if all 100  
senators cast votes -- of the two-thirds majority required to 
override a veto. Republican Sens. Connie Mack of Florida and Judd 
Gregg of New Hampshire -- who both voted yes in last year's override 
attempt -- were absent. So was Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, who 
voted no last year and earlier Thursday voted in support of Roe vs. 
Wade. 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum described the debate as a moral attack on a brutal  
medical procedure that involves partially delivering a live fetus 
before emptying its skull and killing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an attempt to change or overturn Roe vs. Wade,''  
he said. ``At least we should be able to draw the line that when a 
child is in the process of being born, it's too late to have an 
abortion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats declared a political victory based on an amendment  
to that bill, which passed earlier in the day. By 51-47, senators 
passed a nonbinding resolution that supports the 1973 Supreme Court 
decision that legalized abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsored by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, a third-term senator for  
whom the late-term abortion issue caused trouble in his 1996 
re-election, the amendment reads: 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the sense of the Congress that Roe v. Wade was an  
appropriate decision and secures an important constitutional right 
and such a decision should not be overturned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eight Republicans joined 43 of the chamber's 45 Democrats in  
support of it. They were Sens. Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado, 
Susan Collins of Maine, James Jeffords of Vermont, Olympia Snowe of 
Maine, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, Ted Stevens of Alaska, John 
Warner of Virginia, and Chafee. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Democrats voted against the amendment, Sens. John Breaux of  
Louisiana and Harry Reid of Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	To the rest of the Democrats, Harkin advised: ``Don't be afraid  
of this issue'' during next year's campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	In a glimpse of stump strategy in 2000, when a third of the  
Senate goes before the voters, Harkin said in his floor speech that 
the vote on his amendment could turn the late-term abortion issue 
into a debate on Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about whether or not we believe Roe vs. Wade was a wise  
decision and whether or not women ought to have their right to 
decide their own reproductive health,'' he said. ``It has 
everything to do with the underlying bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican supporters of the late-term abortion bill  
virtually ignored the Harkin amendment and streamed to the floor to 
speak in favor of Santorum's measure -- and against a ``brutal'' and 
``inhumane'' medical procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time once again ... for members of the Senate to stand  
up and be counted for or against the most helpless human beings 
imaginable, for or against the destruction of innocent human life 
in such a repugnant way,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman 
of the Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustration over the lack of a veto-proof majority showed in  
some corners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just one time! Let's beat President Clinton,'' said Sen. Bob  
Smith, independent from New Hampshire. ``He's won on everything. 
... I'm sick of losing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The late-term abortion issue also has caused Democrats some  
political discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin was attacked in television commercials over the issue in  
1996, and dropped sharply in the polls before recovering. More 
recently, the Senate's Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South 
Dakota, and Sen. Ernest Hollings of South Carolina, got behind the 
measure before their re-elections in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	During debate Thursday, another Democrat suggested he, too,  
might support the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., an abortion-rights supporter, told  
Santorum he was troubled by the procedure and ``keeping an open 
mind'' on his vote, after opposing the ban the last time around. 
Kerrey is among the senators up for re-election next year. In the 
end, however, Kerrey stuck with his 'no' vote.

<HEADLINE> Columbine H.S. Student Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- A Columbine High School student has been  
arrested for allegedly threatening to ``finish the job'' of the two 
teen-age gunmen who massacred classmates and a teacher last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old student, whose name was withheld because he is a  
juvenile, was jailed Tuesday on charges of inciting destruction of 
life or property, and theft for allegedly stealing a school 
microphone. He was held on $500,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they seized a diagram of the school and other  
writings from the senior, who last year helped Columbine gunmen 
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold produce videos foreshadowing their 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
	A classmate said the three had spent a lot of time together.  
</P>
<P>
	``They sat at the same table in (video) class,'' said  
18-year-old Jeffrey DiManna. ``They were always together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff John Stone said another student reported the teen had  
remarked that he would ``finish the job'' started by Harris and 
Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, killed 12 fellow students and a  
teacher before committing suicide April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the Jefferson County school district said they  
contacted police after hearing rumors about the student. Security 
was increased at Columbine and parents, students and staff were 
notified of the threats.

<HEADLINE> Wilt Remembered With Love, Laughter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Wilt Chamberlain was remembered Thursday  
with uproarious laughter and a few tears at a church just blocks 
from the high school where he first soared to basketball fame. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 500 people attended the lighthearted memorial service,  
telling stories about the tall skinny kid who went on to become 
perhaps the sport's most dominant player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wilt never really left Philadelphia even when he was  
geographically far away. He never forgot us and we never really 
forgot him,'' Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain died Oct. 12 in his Bel-Air, Calif., home at 63 of  
an apparent heart attack. A previous memorial service was held in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those attending Thursday were former Warriors teammates  
Tom Gola and Paul Arizen, former 76ers teammates Bill Melchionni, 
Billy Cunningham and Matt Guokas, ex-Knicks star Earl Monroe and 
Temple coach John Chaney. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamberlain led West Philadelphia's Overbrook High School to  
several championships before playing 14 dazzling seasons in the 
NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaney played alongside Chamberlain while he was in high school  
and Chamberlain was in junior high. Even then, Chaney said 
Chamberlain was dazzling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would put the ball up, and Wilt would take the ball out of  
the air and while he was up there would put the ball in the basket, 
and then he would get credit for my basket,'' Chaney said. ``I had 
to pull him aside and tell him to stop taking my shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gola said he still has a crook in his nose from an elbow by  
Chamberlain. Gola noted that Chamberlain's height, sometimes in 
question, was actually 7-foot-1 3/4. Gola said he measured Chamberlain 
using a ladder at training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Several friends and former teammates likened Chamberlain to such  
greats as Babe Ruth and Michael Jordan. Chamberlain still holds the 
NBA record for most points in a game (100) and highest season 
average (50 points in 1962). 
</P>
<P>
	But Chaney said Chamberlain should be compared to the late  
Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, who was instrumental in 
the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``He changed the game that we all know and love. So you can  
actually say, `We're playing the game according to Wilt,''' Chaney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizin remembered Chamberlain as generous and big-hearted.  
Chamberlain befriended Arizin's 16-year-old dying granddaughter in 
1996, helping her get autographs from dozens of NBA stars. He 
corresponded with the girl for six months before she died. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was more than an athlete, more than a great ball player, he  
was a great human being, which is probably more important than 
being a great athlete,'' Arizin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the church, a sea of tall, graying men swapped stories  
of when Chamberlain was only 6-9 and played at the local community 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those were things to remember ... playing against him every  
Sunday in a gym where we both went ... didn't get too many points 
against him,'' said Sylvester Brosier, 66. ``The records that he 
set will never be broken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vince Miller, Chamberlain's best friend for more than 50 years,  
was not at the 100-point game in Hershey in 1962. But he did see 
Chamberlain score 90 points in high school during a 32-minute game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a friend, my confidante, the best man at my wedding,''  
Miller said, choking back tears. ``I'll love him forever.''

<HEADLINE> Former Twins Owner Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Calvin Griffith was one of the last members  
of a fading breed of baseball owners -- those whose primary focus 
was baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith, who moved the Washington Senators to Minnesota and  
earned a reputation as one of the game's most frugal owners, died 
Wednesday in Melbourne, Fla. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	He developed pneumonia, a kidney infection and a high fever on  
Monday, said Sima Griffith, his daughter-in-law. She said he had a 
pacemaker put in three or four weeks ago and had been in a 
rehabilitation center. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith moved the Senators, the team he inherited from his  
adoptive father, after the 1960 season and renamed the team the 
Minnesota Twins. He sold the club for $36 million to Minneapolis 
banker Carl Pohlad in 1984, ending 65 years of franchise ownership 
by the Griffith family. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith was one of the last remaining baseball owners who  
didn't have another source of income; baseball was the family's 
primary business. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps because he had no other cash spigot to keep the Twins  
afloat, Griffith was intent on holding the line on escalating 
salaries. Former Twins great Harmon Killebrew recalled tough 
negotiations with him one year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were $500 apart and I wasn't going to let $500 stand  
between us and me getting to spring training,'' Killebrew said 
Wednesday from his home in Scottsdale, Ariz. ``I ended up signing 
the contract. I told him that if that $500 meant that much, I'd go 
ahead and sign the contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For all the acrimony brought by Griffith's frugality, his  
reputation was hurt much more by a speech to a Rotary club in 
Waseca in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``Black people don't go to ballgames, but they'll fill up a  
rassling ring and put up such a chant they'll scare you to death,'' 
he said. ``We came (to Minnesota) because you've got good, 
hard-working white people here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Minneapolis Star wrote a front-page editorial calling for  
Griffith to sell the team. Griffith said his words were taken out 
of context, but civil rights groups called for a boycott of Twins 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Rod Carew, whose contract was soon to expire, said he would no  
longer play on Griffith's ``plantation.'' Carew left Minnesota for 
the Angels in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Griffith, the Twins led the American League in attendance  
their first 10 seasons, featuring such stars as Killebrew, Carew, 
Tony Oliva, Zoilo Versalles, and Bob Allison. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people in Minnesota were trying to get a baseball club for  
so many years,'' Griffith said in a 1995 interview. ``They were on 
the verge of getting one several times. Then the Giants went to 
California, Cleveland stayed in Cleveland and the White Sox stayed 
in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Minnesota fans) got disappointed so many times, when they got  
a team they wanted to show their appreciation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The love affair peaked in 1965, when the Twins lost the World  
Series in seven games to the Los Angeles Dodgers. It began to fade 
during the 1970s as free agency crept into the game, and the Twins 
began losing top players. 
</P>
<P>
	``You talk about somebody standing up for his principles -- about  
how the game should be run or the ownership of a team -- Calvin 
certainly was one of the dinosaurs,'' Twins manager Tom Kelly, who 
joined the team as a coach a year before Griffith sold the team, 
told WCCO Radio on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith was among the first owners to prophesy doom for  
small-market teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very difficult for Calvin to compete in the way that  
the game is today, so I think he saw the writing on the wall,'' 
Killebrew said. ``There wasn't any way he could survive and that's 
why he sold the team to Mr. Pohlad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Twins, under Pohlad, won World Series titles in 1987 and  
1991. Some of the key players on those teams were acquired under 
Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
	Public sentiment turned against Griffith when he talked about  
selling the Twins to a group that wanted to move the Twins to 
Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Pohlad sold the Twins two weeks ago to a group led by Glen  
Taylor, owner of the NBA's Timberwolves, and Robert Naegele Jr., 
the lead investor of the Wild, the Minnesota team that enters the 
NHL next season. The sale is contingent on a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The Twins have languished at or near the bottom of the American  
League in recent years and attendance has plunged considerably at 
the Metrodome. The Twins finished 1999 with a 63-97-1 record, worst 
in all of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith was born in Montreal on Dec. 1, 1911, one of Jimmy and  
Jane Robertson's seven children. He and sister Thelma were sent to 
Washington to live with their aunt and uncle when Calvin was 11 and 
Thelma was 9 because their parents were struggling financially. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jimmy Robertson died a short time later, the children were  
adopted by Addie and Clark Griffith and took the Griffith name. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1920s, Griffith was a bat boy and the mascot for  
the Senators, the team for which his uncle and adopted father 
became a Hall of Fame pitcher. Clark Griffith was also a co-founder 
of the American League and owner of the Senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Calvin Griffith worked in various capacities in the minors and  
majors before taking control of the Senators in 1955 after his 
adopted father died. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith, who spent winters in Florida and summers in Minnesota,  
is survived by his wife, Belva Block; son, Clark II; daughters 
Corinne Pillsbury and Clare Griffith; three grandchildren; sister 
Mildred Cronin, widow of former major league shortstop Joe Cronin; 
and brother Billy Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service is planned at Westminster Presbyterian Church  
in Minneapolis at an undetermined date. Griffith will be buried at 
Fort Lincoln Cemetery in Washington.

	BLOOMFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- A woman jailed Thursday on charges of  
selling her infant grandson for $20 says it was an informal 
adoption. 
</P>
<P>
	Police, meanwhile, continued searching for the child's  
16-year-old mother, two teen-age friends and the child's 
great-grandmother, Mary Ackers of St. Louis, who allegedly made the 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	The grandmother, Cathy L. Adams, 39, was arraigned Thursday on a  
felony charge of trafficking in children. Police said she had 
handed 3-week-old Michael over to a couple from Wardell, Mo., on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said there was a questionable document transferring  
custody of the child, and the couple told officers that the $20 
they gave Adams on Sunday was for gasoline, not the baby. 
</P>

	No charges had been filed against the couple Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Settlement Reached in Ali's Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Former heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad  
Ali resolved a case against his former attorney and former manager 
over control of his life story. 
</P>
<P>
	The $3 million lawsuit filed two months ago in U.S. District  
Court was withdrawn Thursday. In a joint statement, Ali, attorney 
Richard Hirschfeld and manager Jabir Muhammad said the suit was 
settled on confidential terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although differences arose among us regarding the matters  
placed at issue in this case, each of us believed at the time that 
he was dealing with the others in good faith,'' the statement said. 
``We believe it is time to put our differences behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement clears the way for Columbia Pictures to make a  
movie about Ali's life. The movie, to star actor Will Smith as Ali, 
is scheduled to be filmed next year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the suit filed Aug. 13, Ali claimed Hirschfeld and Muhammad  
duped him into signing away the rights to his life story in 1988 
while he was in treatment for Parkinson's disease. Ali said he was 
never paid in the deal, which created a company in which Ali, 
Hirschfeld and Muhammad were the only directors with one vote each.

<HEADLINE> E-Markets: Your Life Is Changing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If in need of evidence that the marketplace is  
changing, and that it intends to take you and your way of life with 
it, you can look it up in any index under ``Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For practical purposes, the Internet is synonymous with change.  
Just a few years ago it existed only as a concept, but it is 
everywhere now, with every product, every service, every company 
tagging along. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Computer was only the dream of a college student when the  
Justice Department accused IBM of operating a computer monopoly, a 
case that dragged on for 13 years in the 1970s and '80s before 
being dropped by the government.Now International Business Machines 
has followed Dell in selling computers on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch, a securities firm with ancient roots, was finally  
enticed to sell stocks on the Internet, but relative upstarts, 
including Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., were doing it years before. 
</P>
<P>
	Encyclopaedia Britannica, with roots in the 18th century,  
finally conceded that students weren't impressed by its cumbersome, 
costly caseload of books and announced it too is joining the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest grocery chains must consider changing too. Groceries  
on line are now purchased a month's worth at a time and delivered 
to a company-supplied freezer that it stations in your garage. 
</P>
<P>
	How can they do it at competitive prices? Low overhead, say the  
new-fashioned food marketers, explaining that they pay very little 
for their great location which, as they say, is the new Main 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Even government economists, not known to cede ground easily, are  
changing. Henceforth, business software will be treated as an 
investment, not a cost, and so will add to gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to gross domestic product -- that's something the Internet  
does very well. And adding to productivity too, and very likely 
aiding substantially in the nation's war against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	None other than Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chief and  
inflation vigilante, has all but conceded the point, suggesting 
that high-tech has raised productivity while lowering production 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most visible daily reminder of the new marketplace  
is offered by the stock market, where stocks associated with the 
Internet have helped send markets to uncharted heights. 
</P>
<P>
	When in stock market history, for example, have shares of brand  
new companies with big ideas but no earnings been valued more 
highly than international concerns with decades of steady 
dividends? 
</P>
<P>
	Answer: Never before. Investors are betting on the future.  
</P>
<P>
	And that suggests that the new technology of the Internet age is  
not through with changing the present, but that it and its 
supporters intend to change the future too. 
</P>
<P>
	It might. It might not. Change seldom occurs uninterrupted. But  
for the time being it has enough momentum on its side to carry it 
into the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	If you doubt that, watch the sales of Harry S. Dent's new book  
about how the Dow Jones industrial average might top 40,000 points 
within the next decade. It's called ``The Roaring 2000s Investor.''

<HEADLINE> Bill: Bilingual Programs Need OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House has approved a bill to prevent  
children from being placed in federally funded bilingual education 
programs without their parents' consent. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved the parental consent provision and other  
changes to bilingual education programs during debate Wednesday on 
a larger education bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional critics say bilingual education programs often  
keep students from learning English and contribute to high drop out 
rates among Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal of having children speak more than one language is a  
noble goal ... but somewhere along the way bilingual education is 
miserably failing some of these students, predominantly the 
Hispanic students,'' said Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., the main 
backer of the parental consent provision. 
</P>
<P>
	Bilingual education programs often teach students academic  
subjects in their native language, such as Spanish, while gradually 
teaching English. Salmon said 3.5 million children in the United 
States are considered to have limited English skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Students would continue to take bilingual classes if their  
parents cannot be contacted or do not respond to attempts to get 
their consent.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Kid's Rail Death Is a Homicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SELIGMAN, Mo. (AP) -- Authorities have begun investigating the  
suspicious death of a 14-year-old boy who was hit by a train after 
he was either knocked unconscious or killed and put on the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Hocutt, an eighth-grader at Southwest High School, was  
last seen being chased away from his girlfriend's house by her 
father about 4 a.m. on Oct. 8, about two hours before he was hit by 
a freight train, authorities said. His body was found a day later. 
</P>
<P>
	``This young man was not on the tracks by his own means,'' said  
Ron Sparks, director of special investigations for the 
Arkansas-Missouri Railroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, everyone is still a suspect,'' said Capt. James  
Smith of the Barry County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities began investigating the case as a homicide after  
being given conflicting statements from several people, Smith said. 
An autopsy showed Hocutt had no alcohol or drugs in his system. 
</P>
<P>
	Hocutt had lived in Seligman, a town of fewer than 600 people  
near the Arkansas line, for only a few months before his death. No 
one was at Hocutt's home Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hocutt hadn't been home since Oct. 7, according to his parents,  
who told authorities that they didn't report their son missing 
because they thought he was staying at another boy's home. 
</P>
<P>
	``That really wasn't uncommon for that family,'' Smith said.  
``He was allowed to roam probably more than he should have been.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. Boxer, D-Calif., Takes on Lott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., served notice  
Thursday she will hold up confirmation of an appointee from 
Majority Leader Trent Lott's state of Mississippi as long as 
Republicans block votes on two long-stalled judicial nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no problem with Senator Lott's nominee, who has been  
waiting for a Senate vote for two days -- as long as Senator. Lott 
and the Republican majority also consider those who have been 
waiting years for a vote,'' she said in a statement prepared for 
the Congressional Record. 
</P>
<P>
	Her mention of Lott's nominee was a reference to Glenn  
McCullough, the mayor of Tupelo, Miss. He was named to the board of 
the Tennessee Valley Authority and his appointment was approved by 
the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Appeals court nominations for two Californians have been  
languishing for years in the Republican-controlled Senate. They 
include Marsha Berzon, who was appointed nearly two years ago, and 
U.S. District Judge Richard Paez, first nominated almost four years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of nominations arose briefly near the end of the day's  
Senate session, when Lott sought agreement for debate on Monday on 
six appointments, McCullough's among them. Democratic leader Tom 
Daschle asked Lott to include Paez and Berzon on his list. Lott 
objected and Daschle then objected to Lott's original request. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Senate's customs, any senator may place a ``hold'' on  
any appointment, effectively preventing a vote. Customarily, these 
holds are placed in secret, their identity sometimes known only to 
the senator involved and the leader of their political party in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent effort to require senators to identify themselves when  
placing a hold on a nominee has itself been stalled. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's office did not immediately return a call for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	McCullough was named to the TVA board earlier this year by  
President Clinton as part of an arrangement under which a former 
aide to Vice President Al Gore, Skila Harris, was also appointed. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris' nomination cleared through committee alongside  
McCullough's, and is also pending in the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Asian Markets Close Mostly Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stocks ended mostly lower Thursday on  
various local news, with the huge Tokyo market leading the fall on 
concerns over U.S. share prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 86.44 points,  
or 0.5 percent, to 17,448.27. On Wednesday, the average had risen 
1.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns over U.S. stocks followed drops in U.S. blue chips,  
such as IBM and America Online Inc. in after-hours trading in the 
United States on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices had risen after the market opened, but investors  
``quickly lost heart once the news of the big falloff in IBM,'' 
said Nobuhiko Kuromachi of Wako Securities in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. dollar slipped against the Japanese yen. The dollar  
bought 106.12 yen late in the afternoon in Tokyo, down 0.24 yen 
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 106.50 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, shares rose on news of a share deal between  
conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. and Germany's largest mobile 
phone company Mannesmann AG. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index was up 24.44 points, or 0.2  
percent, at 12,523.00. The index had risen 3 percent on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchison Whampoa said Thursday it would accept Mannesmann's  
offer of 113 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. $14.6 billion) for its 
stake in the British mobile phone company Orange PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchison owns 44.8 percent of Orange, and will end up with 10  
percent of Mannesmann. It expected to gain a seat on Mannesmann's 
supervisory board as its largest single shareholder.

<HEADLINE> Justice Department Sues Ohio City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The U.S. Justice Department doesn't have  
enough evidence to prove that the Columbus police department 
engaged in a pattern of civil rights violations, the city attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department sued the City of Columbus on Thursday  
after reviewing more than 300 complaints. Allegations against the 
1,700-member police department in Ohio's capital include excessive 
force, false arrests and improper searches. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are serious allegations, but that's all they are,'' said  
city attorney Janet Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	She said city officers come into contact with millions of  
citizens each year and reviewing only 300 of those contacts over a 
six-year period won't prove a pattern of abusive conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is there a magic number when it becomes a pattern?'' she said.  
``Statistically we will win this in terms of the few numbers of 
alleged abuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus, with a population of 670,000, is the state's largest  
city. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed the day after the local Fraternal Order of  
Police rejected an offer to settle the case. The city and Justice 
Department reached a tentative settlement in August, but union 
approval was necessary because the agreement would change practices 
covered by a labor contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department asked the U.S. District Court to take no  
action until Dec. 20 to allow time for more negotiation with the 
union. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraternal Order of Police President William Capretta said the  
union is still willing to negotiate a settlement, but not in the 
form of a consent decree. 
</P>
<P>
	``A consent decree is the federal government running our police  
department,'' Capretta said. ``They need to prove to us Columbus is 
such a bad town that they have to watch us. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an insult to the police officers in this city.''  
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit demands improvements in the training and supervision  
of police officers, and the investigation of civilian complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer Steve Rosenbaum said the lawsuit was  
not an indictment of the entire police force. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know there are many fine officers doing their jobs  
properly, but there are officers that are problematic,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the proposed settlement, the city would not have admitted any  
wrongdoing. Among other things, the settlement called for improved 
police training and appointment of an independent monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Before passage of the federal Violent Crime Control and Law  
Enforcement Act of 1994, the Justice Department could bring 
criminal charges against individual officers for civil rights 
violations, but it could not sue a whole department for misconduct 
under civil law.

<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Race driver Sam Schmidt, who suffered severe  
foot injuries during the Indy Racing League's Mall.com 500 last 
week, underwent a second operation on Thursday at Methodist 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Sharp, who was involved in the crash with Schmidt at the  
Texas Motor Speedway, will take over Schmidt's Treadway Racing 
G-force car this weekend during private tire tests at the 
Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

<P>
	``I am still really regretful for what happened,'' the Carmel,  
Ind., driver said. ``I feel really bad for Sam and I am happy that 
I am able to help the Treadway team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt, 34, fractured both feet in the collision with Sharp  
last Sunday. Part of his right big toe was amputated during a first 
operation that night. He was flown from Dallas to Indianapolis on 
Tuesday, and the operation Thursday was on the left foot.

compensation for the May 7 bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 
Belgrade, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said at a

</P>
<P>
	Negotiations began Wednesday, the fourth round of talks aimed at

</P>
<P>
	David Andrews, a U.S. State Department legal adviser leading the

Embassy in Beijing said the talks were ``positive and productive'' 
and that the two sides agreed to meet again soon. 
</P>
<P>
	This visit is the first by Andrews since two days of talks in  
late August. He also was expected to discuss U.S. claims for damage 
to American diplomatic offices in China during protests that 
followed the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has paid $4.5 million to the families of three

trial, filed court papers accusing the judge in his case of being 
biased against black men. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Thursday she would answer his allegations within 10  
days. 
</P>
<P>
	The motion claimed Municipal Judge Dale S. Fischer was chief  
executive officer of an extremist group that is against men in 
general and black males in particular. However, the executive 
director of the group, founded by Warren Burger, former chief 
justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, said he believe that the group 
had a higher percentage of black members than the American bar. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm only one person going through something entirely unfair,''  
Brown said outside the Hollywood courthouse Thursday. ``I'm a 
catalyst to represent all these people that have been unjustly 
prosecuted by the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The motion, filed Tuesday, asked that Fischer be removed from  
the case and the sentence voided. Brown was ordered to do 400 hours 
of community service and enroll in a domestic violence counseling 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	The motion claimed Fischer was an officer of the American Inns  
of Court, a professional legal organization it called a ``radical 
and extremist group of white upper-class women who target men of 
color, including Jim Brown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Judge Fischer has converted the court into a command post used  
to wage a war against all men, and black men,'' the court filing 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fischer, 48, was president last year of the 75 or 80-member Los  
Angeles chapter of American Inns of Court. The judge, who has a 
Harvard Law School degree, refused to talk to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexandria, Va.-based American Inns of Court is a 20,000-member  
organization founded in by Burger in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	The group mentors young lawyers and strives to improve the  
skills, professionalism and ethics of the bench and bar, executive 
director Don Stumbaugh said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a big Jim Brown fan, or was when he played football. I  
guess he's emotionally upset. I feel sorry for him, really,'' 
Stumbaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 31 percent of the group's members are women and there are  
three blacks on its 30-member board, he said, adding, ``We don't 
keep racial statistics, but I'd say more of our members are black 
than in the American Bar as a whole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During sentencing earlier this month, Brown objected to any  
domestic violence conditions because he was acquitted of a charge 
of making a terrorist threat against his 25-year-old wife, Monique. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown was prosecuted for making a terrorist threat against his  
wife even though she recanted her accusations to police that he had 
threatened to snap her neck. 
</P>
<P>
	She testified she made the statements following a June 15 fight  
at the couple's Hollywood Hills home to get attention because she 
believed her husband was having an affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown was originally ordered to court Wednesday to prove that he  
was enrolled in domestic violence counseling and a community 
service program. That hearing was delayed a day because Brown 
changed lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	After Thursday's five-minute proceeding, Fischer delayed the  
hearing again until Dec. 14. She said she would respond to Brown's 
motion, filed by attorney Lachelle M. Woodert, within 10 days.

<HEADLINE> Mets Fans Face Dilemma in Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hometown pride and a dash of bloodlust may trump  
the resentment generated over decades of rivalry between New York 
fans of the Mets and Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	In a World Series matchup that will pit the Yanks against the  
same Atlanta Braves who broke Met hearts in the National League 
championship series, Mets supporters said Thursday that their 
choice is clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping for revenge, even some diehard fans of the Mets are ready  
to swallow their pride and make a deal with the pinstriped devils 
from the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Yankees hopefully will make a nightmare for the Braves  
that the Mets couldn't pull through,'' said Mets fan Orlando Cepin, 
21, of Queens. ``They'll finish off the nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still aching from their team's 4-2 series loss to the Braves,  
Mets fans are in a tough spot. They'd hoped for a Queens vs. the 
Bronx Subway Series, but will have to settle for vicarious 
vengeance delivered by the team they love to hate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was bad enough (for the Braves) to beat one, I don't want  
to see them beat two New York teams,'' Cepin said. The World Series 
starts Saturday night in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets fan Tom Moloney, 48, of Queens, defined his loyalties  
carefully. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to, reluctantly, I wouldn't say root for the  
Yankees, but hope that the Braves lose,'' he said while browsing at 
the Mets Clubhouse Shop in midtown Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad feelings following the Mets-Atlanta series made his choice a  
little easier. As if it weren't tough enough to watch their boys 
climb out of hole after hole just to lose in the end, Mets fans 
bristled at insults from Braves players John Rocker and Chipper 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker raised hackles when he called New York fans ``stupid,''  
and ``a tired act,'' and Jones admonished Mets fans in late 
September to ``go home and put their Yankees stuff on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot call myself a Yankees fan in any way,'' said Chris  
Belena, assistant manger of the Mets shop. ``However, I despise the 
Braves even more, so I will secretly be rooting for the Yankees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like most fans, he said he was still proud of the Mets -- and  
stung by their loss. For many, the team's comeback habit became 
almost addictive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted that Subway Series,'' said Tracy Rizzo, 24, who lives  
in Oak Lawn, Ill., outside Chicago, but likes the Mets. ``I wanted 
it so bad. ... But you can't be down on the Mets. They had an 
incredible season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And what about the Yankees-Braves World Series?  
</P>
<P>
	That's easy, Rizzo said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We can't stand the Braves. We want somebody to put them in  
their place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Mets fans, steeped for years in crosstown rivalry, weren't  
quite so clear. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to see the Yankees kick (the Braves') butt,'' admitted  
Eric Van Alstyne, 38, an actor. But ``there is part of me saying, 
`It would be nice to see the Yankees get bumped off.''' 
</P>
<P>
	That sentiment might have gotten him into trouble at City Hall  
Park, where several hundred gathered Thursday for a Yankees rally. 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the city's self-proclaimed No. 1 Yankees 
fan, boldly predicted a World Series victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Yankees are going to finish out the millennium as the most  
successful team in baseball, the most successful team in sports,'' 
he said. ``I want the Yankees to understand ... that the entire 
city is behind them (and) we just can't wait to have that great big 
parade up Broadway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, the mayor announced that the World Series  
could generate as much as $37.8 million in revenue for the city.

	Megawati Elected Indonesia VP  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Popular opposition leader Megawati  
Sukarnoputri was elected Indonesia's vice president today, one day 
after she lost the first contested presidential vote in the 
country's history. For the first time in days, not a single protest 
was reported in the capital, Jakarta. The victory by Megawati, the 
daughter of Indonesia's founding president, means she could 
eventually succeed Abdurrahman Wahid as the country's new 
president. Many believe Wahid, 59, a moderate Muslim cleric who is 
blind and has had two strokes, may not be able to complete his 
five-year term.

	Hurricane Jose Threatens Caribbean  
</P>
<P>
	THE VALLEY, Anguilla (AP) -- Hurricane Jose battered Antigua and  
bore down on the U.S. Virgin Islands today with strong winds that 
stretched 150 miles from its center and dwarfed a string of tiny 
eastern Caribbean islands laid out like dominoes before it. Jose 
passed the sleepy island of Anguilla early today and was headed on 
a course that would take it near the northern Virgin Islands, east 
of Puerto Rico, by late morning. The storm uprooted trees, tore 
down some electrical and telephone lines and flung debris on roads 
in Anguilla, a British colony of 9,000 people.

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans filing new claims for unemployment  
benefits rose by 9,000 last week after a sharp decline the previous 
week. The Labor Department reported today that 298,000 persons 
filed new jobless claims for the week ending Oct. 16 following a 
drop of 25,000 the previous week. The increase pushed the four-week 
moving average to 300,750, the first time it has been above the 
300,000-level in three months. Even with the increase, the number 
of newly laid off workers remains at historically low levels.

	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- More Russian troops have crossed the Terek  
River to take up positions near Chechnya's capital, Grozny, and 
forward units were less than eight miles from the city, Russian 
officials said today. Yesterday, Russian artillery pounded the 
outskirts of the capital, making the earth tremble in parts of the 
city. Russian warplanes flew 20 combat mission yesterday and early 
today, opening fire on a bridge, a fuel storage facility and 
vehicles transporting militants, officials said.

	French Court Hearing Papon's Appeal  
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Rejecting prosecutors' arguments, France's highest  
court ruled today that lawyers for Maurice Papon -- the former Vichy 
official convicted for his role in sending Jews to Nazi death camps 
-- can present an appeal even though their client has fled the 
country. Papon, 89, was convicted in April 1998 for complicity in 
crimes against humanity for his role in the deportation of 1,590 
Jews from the city of Bordeaux. Most of the deportees later died at 
Auschwitz. His flight has become an embarrassment for French 
officials, who did not place judicial controls on Papon or revoke 
his passport after his conviction.

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and  
his wife Sarah were questioned by police today after officers 
seized dozens of valuable items the couple is suspected of having 
kept illegally after he left office. Netanyahu waved briefly before 
he and his wife entered the Fraud Squad headquarters in the Tel 
Aviv suburb of Bat Yam. Netanyahu's lawyer accused police of 
conducting a politically tainted investigation. Police said the 
searches were part of an ongoing investigation into allegations 
that Netanyahu accepted illegal favors from a contractor while in

Arther M. Boyd Jr., 53, was convicted in 1983 of killing Wanda 
Hartman at the car wash sponsored by her church, where her father

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Football Hall of Famer Jim Brown, railing  
against a community service sentence in his domestic violence 
trial, filed court papers accusing the judge in his case of being 
biased against black men. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Thursday she would answer his allegations within 10

<HEADLINE> Women for Giuliani Poke Fun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton's face was on a lot of  
buttons at the ``Women for Rudy'' breakfast this morning, but it 
wasn't looking pretty for the first lady: Every button bore a slash 
through her picture and her name. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're here to take what I like to think is a great New York  
opening shot across the bay: Come on Hillary, make our day!'' said 
former U.S. Rep. Susan Molinari, who emceed the $100,000 
fund-raiser for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's likely campaign for the 
Republican Senate nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Molinari derided the first lady's frequent appearances  
around New York state as ``months of listening by Mrs. Clinton'' 
compared to ``months of action by Mayor Giuliani.'' Mrs. Clinton, 
Giuliani's likely Democratic opponent in the U.S. Senate race, has 
been on a ``listening tour'' around the state since early summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The breakfast was attended by 1,600 women, from celebrities such  
as comedienne Joan Rivers and socialite Georgette Mosbacher to 
secretaries and entrepreneurs from the outer boroughs. Tickets 
ranged in price from $50 to $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the women wearing anti-Hillary buttons was Louise Martin,  
an administrative assistant from Brooklyn. ``I've never seen 
anybody change stripes faster than she does,'' she said. ``Rudy's 
the greatest mayor this city's ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Mrs. Clinton's claim that she is a longtime Yankee fan --  
despite the fact that she has never lived in New York -- came under 
attack. Pat Harrison, co-chair of the Republican National Committee 
and a native New Yorker, wore a Yankee cap as she praised the 
mayor. ``Anyone who would lie about being a Yankees fan shouldn't 
be trusted with a seat in the U.S. Senate, much less a seat in the 
house that Babe Ruth built,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor, for his part, tried to soften his image as a  
tough-talking crime-buster. ``I care about people,'' he insisted as 
he explained his welfare-to-work policies and asserted that 
lowering crime was especially important to women. ``I love them. 
They're entitled to the dignity they deserve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's wife, Donna Hanover, who rarely gets involved in his  
campaigns or takes a public role as the city's first lady, did not 
attend.

<HEADLINE> GAO Issues Funeral Industry Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government lacks adequate oversight of  
funeral industry practices, according to a congressional report 
made public Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission ``does not have a systematic or  
structured process for measuring funeral homes' compliance'' with 
rules for the fair treatment of consumers, concluded the General 
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC disputed the findings and said it was satisfied that  
compliance with consumer protection rules has improved. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO report, commissioned by Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa,  
and John Breaux, D-La., also faulted the FTC for not enforcing 
penalties against funeral homes and cemeteries found violating 
consumer service rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of adequate oversight, Grassley said, ``ought to be  
disturbing, particularly when you consider there are 22,300 funeral 
homes in this country providing more than 2 million funerals a 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley noted that a typical funeral and burial costs $8,000,  
making it one of the larger purchases most Americans will ever 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, the FTC began requiring that homes provide an itemized  
price list and not charge for services people did not receive, want 
or need. The Funeral Rule was a response to complaints that people 
were being deceived or overcharged by some unscrupulous funeral 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC says industry compliance with the rules has been good.  
But GAO said that between 1994 and 1998, the FTC did not check out 
enough homes -- the agency test-shopped 958 homes, of 4.3 percent of 
the country's total -- to conclude that there was broad adherence to 
the rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC chairman, Robert Pitofsky, said the checks, carried out  
over 24 states, did provide accurate evidence that compliance with 
the requirements of the rule had risen markedly compared with the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Smith, spokesman for the National Funeral Directors  
Association, also stressed that ``a vast majority of funeral homes 
are in compliance with the Funeral Rule.'' He said the industry has 
been pressing the FTC to strengthen the rule, which now covers only 
homes, so it also applies to cemeteries, casket stores and other 
providers. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO said that in 1997 and 1998 the FTC did not take  
enforcement actions in more than half the cases of potential rule 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``What incentive is there for the bad apples to comply with the  
Rule if they face no penalty for violating it?'' Grassley asked. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pitofsky said the FTC and the industry have developed ``a  
remedial rather than a punitive law enforcement program that is 
more effective in stimulating compliance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO also looked into state oversight of the funeral industry  
in California, Florida, Maryland, New York and Texas, but found it 
difficult to assess the extent of problems because there is no 
single organization that collects and compiles complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	It also found relatively few complaints: The Better Business  
Bureau received 453 complaints about death care goods and services 
in 1997, compared with 654 complaints about barber and beauty 
shops. The FTC received 152 complaints in 1998, only 0.33 percent 
of 46,091 consumer complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason for the small number of complaints might be that  
consumers consider death care a personal rather than a consumer 
matter, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley and Breaux, who head the Senate Special Committee on  
Aging, said they plan hearings next year on consumer concerns in 
the funeral industry.

<HEADLINE> Mannesmann To Buy Orange PLC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- Germany's Mannesmann AG plans to buy  
British mobile phone company Orange PLC for $32.93 billion in cash 
and stock, and expects to spin off its own engineering and 
automotive divisions to help pay for the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced today should strengthen Mannesmann's position  
as Germany's largest mobile phone operator and in the fast-growing 
European telecommunications market. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange is the third-biggest mobile phone company in Britain.  
</P>
<P>
	Mannesman shares tumbled almost 5 percent in early trading today  
in Frankfurt. Traders said investors are concerned that the deal is 
too expensive and that Mannesmann will accumulate too much debt to 
execute it. 
</P>
<P>
	Mannesmann shares had already dropped for the same reason on  
Tuesday when it first confirmed its interest in Orange. The 
reported price then was only $26.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange shares, meanwhile, gained 6 percent. The purchase price  
represents an almost 22 percent premium over Orange's share price 
at the beginning of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Mannesmann didn't disclose how much it expects to raise by  
spinning off its engineering and automotive operations, but a 
spokesman for the company said the businesses had combined revenues 
of around $12.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange's largest shareholder, Hong Kong investment firm  
Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., has agreed to accept the offer, Mannesman 
said. Hutchison's nearly 45 percent stake in Orange would give it 
about a 10 percent interest in Mannesmann. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the trend toward consolidation in Europe's  
telecommunications market is unavoidable as deregulation and the 
cost of keeping up with technological advances favors larger 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, Mannesmann had pulled out of the race for another  
British mobile operator, One2One, saying the price was too high. 
German rival Deutsche Telekom, the former state monopoly, then 
bought One2One for $11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, France Telecom announced plans to buy a majority  
stake in E-Plus, Germany's third-largest mobile phone network, for 
$7.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>

Grosse, said a deal to increase Telekom's presence in France is 
expected ``very shortly.''

<HEADLINE> Ark. Arena Cancels Sat. Opening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTH LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The opening of the city's civic  
arena was further delayed Thursday after more problems were found 
with beams that support the $80 million building's upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
	A minor league hockey team was to make its home debut Saturday  
night but arena chairman Bob Russell said the game would not go on. 
Last week, the arena canceled an NBA exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to rush the process,'' Russell said Thursday.  
``We will not open until the building passes'' a city inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18,000-seat Alltel Arena is scheduled to play host to an  
Elton John concert Oct. 29 as part of an elaborate opening 
ceremony. Russell said he expects the building to be cleared for 
occupancy by then. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what the problems are. We know what the fixes are,''  
Russell said during a news conference at the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	More problems surfaced Thursday, Russell said. Five of the 23  
cantilevers that overhang lower-deck seats were found deficient, 
requiring repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The fixes to the overhang will be in addition to those required  
for all 19 upper-deck beams, which had misaligned metal reinforcing 
bars. Crews are attaching external U-shaped support brackets at the 
correct angles and steel tension plates along the beams' sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Arena officials said repairs were complete or under way on 17 of  
the 19 beams as of Thursday afternoon and likely could have been 
finished before Saturday's scheduled game. However, the additional 
problems with the cantilevers prompted the cancellation, he said.

<HEADLINE> Russians Nearing Chechnya's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- More Russian troops have crossed the Terek  
River to take up positions near Chechnya's capital, Grozny, and 
forward units were less than eight miles from the city, Russian 
officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Russian artillery pounded the outskirts of the  
capital, making the earth tremble in parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian warplanes flew 20 combat mission Wednesday and early  
today, opening fire on a bridge, a fuel storage facility and 
vehicles transporting militants, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has waged a cautious, creeping offensive against Chechen  
militants in a bid to avoid the heavy casualties it suffered in a 
1994-96 war with the rebels. The Russian forces have relied mostly 
on airstrikes and heavy artillery, with few major ground clashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia says its aims are to maintain a security zone around  
Chechnya and to wipe out the militants. The Russian military has 
said it does not intend to storm Grozny in a bid to retake full 
control of Chechnya -- but that option has not been ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Grozny is not an end in itself,'' said Gennady Alyokhin, a  
Defense Ministry spokesman. ``The operation will be carried out 
according to plan. Our only goal is to eliminate the rebels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest advances come three weeks after Russia sent troops  
into Chechnya following weeks of airstrikes to eliminate Islamic 
militants who invaded neighboring Dagestan this summer. The 
militants have also been blamed for a series of September apartment 
explosions in Russia that killed 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian forces have been approaching the city from the north,  
west and east, and moved several miles closer in the eastern sector 
on Wednesday, Alyokhin said. Additional troops also crossed the 
Terek River, north of the capital, to join forces already 
positioned on a ridge overlooking the city. 
</P>
<P>
	While Russia's representative to Chechnya, Nikolai Koshman, says  
Russian troops are less than eight miles outside the capital, 
Chechens say some Russian soldiers have been spotted even closer. 
Chechen fighters north of the capital can easily see Russian troops 
through their binoculars, conducting drills and morning exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has lost 350 soldiers since fighting in the Caucasus  
region began more than two months ago, according to Russian 
officials. The military claims that up to 3,000 Chechen militants 
have been killed, but the figure cannot be independently confirmed, 
and both sides routinely inflate casualty figures suffered by the 
enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechnya, which has fewer than 1 million residents, has been  
effectively independent since Russian troops withdrew three years 
ago, but the territory has been wracked by lawlessness and a 
crippled economy.

<HEADLINE>  Mannesmann To Buy Orange PLC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- Germany's Mannesmann AG plans to buy  
British mobile phone company Orange PLC for $32.93 billion in cash 
and stock, and expects to spin off its own engineering and 
automotive divisions to help pay for the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced today should strengthen Mannesmann's position  
as Germany's largest mobile phone operator and in the fast-growing 
European telecommunications market. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange is the third-biggest mobile phone company in Britain.  
</P>
<P>
	Mannesman shares tumbled almost 5 percent in early trading today  
in Frankfurt. Traders said investors are concerned that the deal is 
too expensive and that Mannesmann will accumulate too much debt to 
execute it. 
</P>
<P>
	Mannesmann shares had already dropped for the same reason on  
Tuesday when it first confirmed its interest in Orange. The 
reported price then was only $26.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange shares, meanwhile, gained 6 percent. The purchase price  
represents an almost 22 percent premium over Orange's share price 
at the beginning of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Mannesmann didn't disclose how much it expects to raise by  
spinning off its engineering and automotive operations, but a 
spokesman for the company said the businesses had combined revenues 
of around $12.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange's largest shareholder, Hong Kong investment firm  
Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., has agreed to accept the offer, Mannesman 
said. Hutchison's nearly 45 percent stake in Orange would give it 
about a 10 percent interest in Mannesmann. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the trend toward consolidation in Europe's  
telecommunications market is unavoidable as deregulation and the 
cost of keeping up with technological advances favors larger 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, Mannesmann had pulled out of the race for another  
British mobile operator, One2One, saying the price was too high. 
German rival Deutsche Telekom, the former state monopoly, then 
bought One2One for $11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, France Telecom announced plans to buy a majority  
stake in E-Plus, Germany's third-largest mobile phone network, for 
$7.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Deutsche Telekom's chief for western Europe, Paul  
Grosse, said a deal to increase Telekom's presence in France is 
expected ``very shortly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom have been feuding since

May when the German company pursued an ill-fated attempt to merge 
with Telecom Italia.

<HEADLINE> Goodyear Earnings Fall 47 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. reported a 47  
percent decline in third-quarter profits Thursday, saying earnings 
were hurt by the company's inability to keep up with growing demand 
for tires in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest tire manufacturer earned $97.2 million, or  
61 cents a share, down from $185 million, or $1.17 per share, in 
the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Goodyear's earnings exceeded the 49 cents expected by  
analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $3.29 billion from $3.19 billion a year earlier,  
with sales at its tire unit increasing 8.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear said earnings fell because the company was unable to  
meet higher-than-expected demand in North America. According to the 
Rubber Manufacturers Association, demand for tires rose 4 percent 
from last year, with demand for performance tires up 9 percent and 
demand for light truck radials up 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep up, Goodyear has decided to continue operations at its  
Gadsden, Ala., plant, a factory that had been scheduled for closure 
by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear cited further problems with integrating the Dunlop tire  
business into existing operations. The company took over Dunlop's 
North American and European production from Sumitomo Rubber 
Industries Ltd. last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also said it would streamline its brands into  
specific consumer price brackets -- Goodyear targeting the premium 
market, Dunlop occupying the mid-range and Kelly-Springfield 
shooting for economy shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tire lines that don't fit into that structure will be  
eliminated, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear stock fell 50 cents to $44.31 1/4 a share on the New York  
Stock Exchange Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, Goodyear earned $188 million,  
or $1.18 per share, down from 1998 profits of $560 million, or 
$3.53 per share. Revenue fell to $9.32 billion from $9.42 billion.

<HEADLINE> National Saint Wins at Keeneland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- National Saint rallied at the top of the  
stretch Thursday and ran away by five lengths in the inaugural 
running of the $68,900 Perryville Stakes at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of the race, which was contested over seven  
furlongs and 184 feet, National Saint settled into second place and 
two lengths off the lead set by jockey Pat Day aboard 4-5 favorite 
Hidden City. 
</P>
<P>
	At the top of the stretch, jockey Robby Albarado steered  
National Saint to the middle of the track and shook the reins. The 
Saint Ballado colt, trained by Bob Baffert, quickly sprinted to the 
front and clear from the rest of the field and drew off. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon Over Prospect rallied late in the stretch to grab second  
and Hidden City held on for third. Perfect Score was fourth, 
followed by Mighty Tricky and Torrid Sand. 
</P>
<P>
	National Saint paid $5.60, $3.80 and $2.40. Moon Over Prospect  
paid $12.20 and $3.60. Hidden City returned $2.20.

<HEADLINE> Study: Early Care Helps Adult Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Poor infants and toddlers who get  
high-quality child care are more apt to graduate from high school, 
attend college and delay having children, according to a new study 
released today. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers believe their results are the first to definitively  
link high-quality child care, beginning as early as 6 weeks of age, 
with a better adult life. 
</P>
<P>
	``We view these results as grounds for optimism that  
high-quality, early childhood education can be an important 
ingredient in supporting young families,'' said Craig Ramey, a 
psychology, pediatrics and neurobiology professor at the University 
of Alabama and director of the Abecedarian Project. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about changing the course of children's lives in  
the most fundamental way possible,'' said Frances Campbell, one of 
the investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	The project -- named after a word formed from the first letters  
of the alphabet and meaning novice or elementary -- tracked 111 
children from infancy through age 21, beginning in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Research was conducted at the University of Alabama at  
Birmingham and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	The children were divided into two groups -- 54 who had an array  
of childcare arrangements, and 57 who received high-quality child 
care at the Frank Porter Graham Child Development Center starting 
between 6 weeks and 4 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 111 original participants, 104 were evaluated last  
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the findings:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The high-quality day-care children had higher cognitive test  
scores than the control group from toddler years to age 21. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Their academic achievement in both reading and math was higher  
from the primary grades through young adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
	-- They completed more years of education and were more likely to  
attend a four-year college. 
</P>
<P>
	-- They were, on average, two years older (19 years) when their  
first child was born compared with those in the control group (17 
years), though the youngest parents in both groups were comparable 
in age when the first child was born. 
</P>
<P>
	Benefits also extended beyond the children: Their mothers  
achieved higher educational and employment status than mothers of 
control-group children, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	The children who attended the Frank Porter Graham center  
attended the day care all day, five days a week. The 
student-teacher ratio was low, gradually increasing from 3-to-1 to 
7-to-1. Teacher turnover was low because the pay was high. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers say the Abecedarian Project corroborates findings of  
similar projects including High/Scope at Perry Preschool in 
Ypsilanti, Mich., widely considered a landmark study. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants in High/Scope -- which began in the 1960s and has  
almost 30 years of follow-up -- were arrested less often; were more 
likely to be married with children born in wedlock; and tended to 
do slightly better academically. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, we have corroboration of findings from two studies  
done quite differently,'' said Larry Schweinhart, research division 
chairman at High/Scope Educational Research Foundation in 
Ypsilanti. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a real strong indication that we really have a  
long-term effect that can be obtained from early childhood 
programs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Abecedarian Project still needs a cost-benefit analysis,  
said Edward Zigler, a psychology professor at Yale University who 
helped plan government-run child care programs for low-income 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, High/Scope showed that for every $1 spent on child  
care, taxpayers saved $7, mainly from costs to crime victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what really turns decision-makers on,'' said Zigler, a  
member of the Frank Porter Graham advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramey said such an analysis has begun.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Immigration Measure Revised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A sponsor of a voter-approved measure  
that sought to deny public services to illegal immigrants said he 
is likely to revive the proposal for the November 2000 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was and still is a serious problem that needs to be  
looked at objectively,'' Ron Prince said Wednesday. He was chairman 
of the Proposition 187 movement that California voters passed in 
1994 with nearly 60 percent of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition 187 would have barred the state from providing  
public services such as education and non-emergency health care to 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince's 2000 initiative would force California to conform with  
a provision of federal immigration law that forbids state and local 
governments from providing benefits to illegal immigrants. The same 
law permits such state or local benefits only if a state passes a 
law allowing them. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince's 2000 initiative would forbid the Legislature from  
approving any such law. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince is also preparing a companion initiative meant to protect  
the measure against the legal maneuvering that doomed Proposition 
187 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince has asked lawyers to scrutinize both measures to see  
whether they would stand up in court. He said he is ``99 percent 
sure'' he will proceed with both. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition 187 had been ruled unconstitutional and in July, the  
administration of Democratic Gov. Gray Davis agreed with civil 
rights groups that the state should stop defending the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	With no one to defend the measure in court, the last nail in  
Proposition 187's coffin was driven behind closed doors during a 
court-sanctioned mediation session. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, a Proposition 187 critic, said he  
would oppose any similar measure. The governor will not comment 
before reviewing the proposed initiatives, spokeswoman Hilary 
McLean said.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Still Court Chung for Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) -- Johnny Chung admitted to making illegal  
campaign contributions, was sentenced to probation and is being 
forced out of business by the scandal. But he's still popular with 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither his business reversals nor his criminal prosecution have  
stopped Democratic fund-raisers from asking him to donate to Vice 
President Al Gore's presidential campaign and Hillary Rodham 
Clinton's likely Senate bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this a joke?'' Chung asked recently while waving an  
invitation to a Nov. 5 dinner for Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The dinner, being held by movie director Steven Spielberg, seeks  
donations of $1,000 to attend either an afternoon tea or a cocktail 
reception and $10,000 a couple for dinner with the first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there are the letters that keep arriving from Gore's  
election committee and from Clinton. Clearly they are mass 
mailings, but they have a personal tone. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a business leader that endorsed the Clinton/Gore ticket in  
1996, your support in the upcoming Gore 2000 campaign is vital,'' 
said a letter from former White House Chief of Staff Erskine 
Bowles, suggesting that Chung attend a Gore speech in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Al Gore has delivered to business,'' the letter reads. ``Help  
deliver the business vote to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	You can't miss the irony.  
</P>
<P>
	Chung, 44, once a frequent White House guest, became a key  
target in the probe of campaign finance irregularities and Chinese 
government efforts to influence the 1996 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	He donated more than $366,000 to Democratic candidates and  
causes between 1994 and 1996. The money was returned after 
questions arose about its legality. Chung eventually pleaded guilty 
to campaign finance irregularities and was sentenced to five years 
of probation and 3,000 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned there is a system in the United States. You give  
money. You buy access,'' Chung said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung said he only got involved with the White House to drum up  
business for his fax service, a unique operation which was able to 
send hundreds of copies of documents to different outlets at once. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a businessman, I was buying my future,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But now, thanks to the scandal, his business is all but gone.  
The downfall began after he was accused of making illegal donations 
to the White House and he started helping investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``The same day I begin to cooperate, my business dropped 90  
percent,'' he said. ``All of the government offices dropped me. I 
had 260 accounts and I now have 24.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has no choice but to close the doors of his Automated  
Intelligent Systems Inc. on Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung still has the souvenirs of his White House days. A special  
album of photos shows him with the president, first lady, vice 
president and other dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
	There is Chung smiling beside South African President Nelson  
Mandela, with California's Sen. Barbara Boxer, former House speaker 
Newt Gingrich, Nebraska's Sen. Bob Kerry and with Robin Williams, 
Maya Angelou and other artists who visited the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	More of his 3,000 White House photographs can be found on his  
Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes,'' Chung laughed, ``I think I am Forrest Gump.''

<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Concerned that hot-dogging skiers who go too fast  
are scaring others off the slopes, resorts across the nation plan 
to crack down this winter with tougher safety programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Skiers or snowboarders who fly through congested areas may find  
themselves pulled off the hill. Others who engage in outrageous 
behavior may lose their season passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``More people will be more closely watching the slopes this  
year,'' said Paul Witt of Vail Resorts, who expects the guests as 
his resort west of Denver to help police each other. ``If people 
don't feel the resort is doing something about safety they are not 
going to come to the slopes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Ski Areas Association launched its new safety  
campaign, called ``Heads Up,'' on Thursday, just days before some 
ski areas officially open. 
</P>
<P>
	While insisting the slopes remain safe overall, industry  
officials point out that many deaths and serious injuries involve 
young men who ski too fast. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last ski season, 39 people died on U.S. ski slopes,  
compared with 26 the year before and an average of 34. The record 
was set in 1994-95, when 49 people were killed while skiing. 
</P>
<P>
	Serious injuries, such as paralysis or other spinal cord  
injuries, also increased slightly, even though the number of people 
skiing or snowboarding nationwide declined slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa O'Brien of the Park City resort in Utah said officials  
there decided to implement a patrol program after guests suggested 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were complaining about people speeding through slow  
skiing zones,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Chiefs 35, Ravens 8 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- As expected, the Kansas City Chiefs didn't  
generate much offense against the Baltimore Ravens. They didn't 
have to. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs turned two interceptions into touchdowns, including a  
56-yard score by James Hasty, and cruised to a 35-8 victory 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City (4-2) had 80 yards in the first half and only 132  
yards through three quarters. Elvis Grbac threw two touchdown 
passes to Tony Gonzalez and the defense did the rest, completely 
frustrating Baltimore quarterback Stoney Case in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasty's touchdown made it 14-0 in the third quarter, and that  
was enough to dispatch the Ravens (2-4), who lost their second 
straight under first-year coach Brian Billick. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservative game plan of Chiefs coach Gunther Cunningham  
worked to perfection -- thanks to a defense that came within four 
minutes of the team's first road shutout in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
	After Grbac connected with Gonzalez for a 22-yard touchdown with  
12:37 left, Donnie Edwards picked off Case's pass and lateraled to 
Reggie Tongue, who went the final 38 yards for a 28-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	That ended the night for Case, a hero earlier in the year but  
the recipient of jeers from the crowd of 68,771. Case was 15-for-37 
for 103 yards before being replaced by Tony Banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens broke the shutout with 4:05 left, thanks to a pass  
interference call that covered 35 yards. Errict Rhett scored from 
the 2, ruining the Chiefs' bid for their first road shutout since a 
19-0 victory over San Diego in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasty had two interceptions in a game for the first time since  
1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs had one efficient drive in the first half, and it was  
enough to put them up 7-0 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	Case was 1-for-10 in the first quarter, but the Ravens benefited  
from two pass interference penalties against Cris Dishman, 
including a 37-yarder, to move to the Kansas City 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Stover kicked a 32-yard field goal, but Baltimore had 12  
men on the field. Stover then hit the right upright with a 37-yard 
try. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs, meanwhile, didn't get their initial first down until  
Grbac completed a 20-yard pass to Kevin Lockett the final play of 
the first period. That started a 73-yard drive that ended with 
Grbac throwing an 11-yard touchdown pass to Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City managed only seven yards and failed to make a first  
down on its other six possessions before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs doubled their advantage when Hasty stepped in front  
of Justin Armour to pick off a pass and cruised down the left 
sideline for his first touchdown since 1995.

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After Abraham Lincoln was fatally shot on Good  
Friday in 1865, American preachers forgot their prepared Easter 
sermons and rhapsodized about the martyred president. Some compared 
him with Moses or even Christ. Ever since, religionists have 
portrayed Lincoln as an exemplar of Christian faith. 
</P>
<P>
	But he wasn't, not in any conventional sense.  
</P>
<P>
	So reports Allen C. Guelzo, professor of American history at  
Eastern College in St. Davids, Pa., in a book out next week: 
``Abraham Lincoln: Redeemer President'' (Eerdmans, 516 pages, $29). 
Much has been written about Lincoln's belief and disbelief, but 
this account goes deeper. 
</P>
<P>
	Guelzo, a 46-year-old Episcopalian, has been intrigued with the  
man since he narrated Aaron Copland's ``Lincoln Portrait'' with his 
Pennsylvania high school orchestra. And yet, the professor said in 
an interview, ``I thought of him as a secular figure with 
relatively few intellectual interests.'' After all, Lincoln 
received only a few winters of formal schooling. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 1994, Guelzo researched American thinking about free will  
and discovered that Lincoln gave considerable attention to this and 
other theological topics. That roused Guelzo to write what's billed 
as the first intellectual biography of the man about whom more has 
been written than any other American. 
</P>
<P>
	The religious aspect of the tale, in a nutshell: Lincoln was  
unable to believe, but was never comfortable in his unbelief. 
</P>
<P>
	Youthful skepticism gave way to deeper respect for religion. And  
during the devastation of the Civil War, Lincoln's self-made 
theology reshaped American history. The key to Lincoln's belief 
system was a roughhewn version of predestination that he absorbed 
from his parents' churches. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kentucky, Lincoln's parents were devoted to the hard-shell  
Primitive Baptists; later in his boyhood, in Indiana, his father 
and stepmother joined the slightly more moderate Separate Baptists. 
Both were rigidly Calvinistic. 
</P>
<P>
	Young Abe had little interest in his parents' churches. And  
while living in New Salem, Ill., in 1834, he wrote a ``little Book 
on Infidelity'' that contemporaries said attacked the divinity of 
Jesus and the special inspiration of the Bible. Then 25, he 
considered submitting it for publication in a newspaper but friends 
persuaded him to burn it. 
</P>
<P>
	That was fortunate, since Lincoln was just launching a political  
career. As a champion of small and big business, his natural home 
was the Whig Party. Like today's Republicans, the Whigs drew heavy 
support from Evangelical Protestants -- roughly equivalent to 
today's Religious Right -- who wanted public piety and the abolition 
of slavery. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln would have gained politically by joining some church,  
maintaining a religious front and keeping doubts to himself. But 
that would have been completely out of character. ``He was, quite 
literally, honest Abe,'' Guelzo says. 
</P>
<P>
	Religion became a hot issue in 1846 when Lincoln won a seat in  
the U.S. House over Democrat Peter Cartwright. The Cartwright camp 
spread talk of Lincoln as infidel and he responded in a handbill 
distributed days before the election. Guelzo thinks this was 
probably Lincoln's most revealing theological statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``That I am not a member of any Christian Church, is true,''  
Lincoln wrote. But he denied disrespect toward religion in general 
or any Christian group. 
</P>
<P>
	When young, he said, he became inclined toward the ``Doctrine of  
Necessity -- that is, that the human mind is impelled to action, or 
held in rest, by some power over which the mind itself has no 
control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four years later his wife, Mary, devastated by the death of  
their son, Edward, converted to active Presbyterian commitment. 
Thereafter, Presbyterian clergy in Springfield, Ill., and 
Washington, D.C., were regarded as the Lincoln family pastors. But 
Lincoln never affiliated with any religious body. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln had many chats with the Springfield pastor, James Smith,  
who recounted that unlike most skeptics, Lincoln was ``a constant 
reader of the Bible.'' That was obvious in his speeches, 
culminating in the magisterial Second Inaugural Address (``let us 
judge not that we be not judged''). 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said Lincoln believed some form of providence was at work  
in the universe, but was unable to believe in a personal God or in 
Jesus as his savior. That amounted to Unitarianism, but Lincoln had 
no interest in that liberal denomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Guelzo believes Lincoln combined two classic strains in American  
culture. He personifies the hope that in a market-oriented 
democracy the poorest citizen can prosper through ambition. But in 
addition, Americans ``want our mobility linked to a lofty set of 
principles, not just profit,'' says Guelzo, and Lincoln also 
represents firm moral commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, on principle he helped conquer Protestant Whig and  
Republican elements that despised Catholic immigrants. And, after 
some struggle, he came to see slavery not as a pragmatic problem 
but a moral blight. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the Civil War, with the North's effort sputtering,  
Lincoln came to believe that defeat was inevitable if the war was 
being waged only to save the Union, not for a higher moral cause. 
</P>
<P>
	At a crucial cabinet meeting after the Battle of Antietam in  
September 1862, Lincoln astounded his colleagues by saying he had 
made a vow to himself and -- he added after a pause -- ``to my 
Maker'': If God allowed the North to repel Lee's Confederate 
invasion, it would then be Lincoln's duty to abolish slavery. 
</P>
<P>
	This prewar skeptic was now, Guelzo writes, ``offering as his  
reason for the most radical gesture in American history a private 
vow fulfilled in blood and smoke by the hand of God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Emancipation Proclamation was issued the following  
January, Lincoln added this conclusion, at the prompting of 
Treasury Secretary Salmon Chase: ``Upon this act, sincerely 
believed to be an act of justice, warranted by the Constitution 
upon military necessity, I invoke the considerate judgment of 
mankind and the gracious favor of Almighty God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Mary Lincoln, the daughter of Kentucky slave-owners,  
questioned the president about abolition, he looked heavenward, son 
Robert recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am under orders,'' Lincoln told his wife, ``I cannot do  
otherwise.''

<HEADLINE> Vaccine May Fight Prostate Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Researchers say they have found a way to trick  
the human immune system into attacking prostate cancer, the 
second-leading cancer killer of U.S. men. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers induced the immune system into recognizing cancerous  
prostate cells as foreign invaders by genetically engineering 
patients' own cells and injecting them back into the body. 
</P>
<P>
	``This same concept could be applied to breast cancer or other  
cancers,'' said Jonathan Simons, who led the study done by 
researchers at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center. ``This is not a 
cure, but this is a whole new door to walk through to get to curing 
prostate cancer using the immune system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study is reported in the October issue of Cancer Research.  
</P>
<P>
	While the approach has been tried before, the researchers said  
they were able for the first time to activate the body's entire 
immune system to fight prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The immune system is like armed forces with different  
branches,'' Simons said Wednesday. ``Some vaccines have activated 
the Army, for example, but not the Navy. In this case, all arms of 
the services were turned on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers used a gene, called GM-CSF, that activates the  
immune system, attached it to a common virus and implanted it 
inside cancerous cells of 11 prostate organs surgically removed 
from patients. 
</P>
<P>
	In eight cases, researchers were able to grow a culture of the  
modified, cancerous cells in the laboratory. The cells were then 
irradiated, which kept them alive but stopped them from 
multiplying. 
</P>
<P>
	After the vaccine was injected, the immune system of all eight  
patients produced antibodies that identified foreign invaders as 
well as immune cells that attack and kill infectious cells, Simons 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vaccine not only recognized the injected cells as foreign  
but apparently told the immune system to recognize cancerous 
prostate cells remaining in the body as foreign, said Dr. John 
Gutheil, clinical research director at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer 
Center in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our immune system doesn't see cancer as being that much  
different from our normal tissue, a situation we refer to as immune 
tolerance,'' he said. ``What you're seeing here is people are 
trying to use GM-CSF to actually override this immune tolerance 
that we have for our own tissues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prostate cancer trails only lung cancer as the leading cause of  
cancer death among U.S. men. This year, doctors will diagnose about 
180,000 cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still too early to tell what impact this is going to have  
on the disease,'' said Dr. Charles Myers, director of the 
University of Virginia Cancer Center. He has been diagnosed with 
prostate cancer. ``I think it's an important step in the 
development of prostate cancer immunotherapy, but it doesn't look 
to be the final step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simons said it is also unclear whether the vaccine would  
convince the immune system to attack normal prostate tissue in 
patients with cancer of the prostate who have not had the organ 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chances are the immune system would attack the normal prostate  
as well, but that's not a big deal because the prostate is not a 
life-sustaining organ,'' Gutheil said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said he believes the vaccine technology can  
eventually be improved enough so the immune system only targets 
cancerous cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Simons said while the study dealt with whether it could produce  
the immune response, further research is under way to determine 
whether the immune system can fight cancer in patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in the field for decades and people have been  
skeptical about whether the immune system could ever see prostate 
cancer,'' Simons said. ``What's truly novel about this paper is not 
only can the immune system see prostate cancer, but you can 
activate all the appropriate anti-cancer killing arms.''

<HEADLINE> Insurance for Addictions Pushed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying alcohol treatment saved his life, Rep.  
Jim Ramstad urged a House panel to pass legislation aimed at 
increasing insurance coverage for alcoholism and drug addiction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know this disease is fatal,'' Ramstad told members of the  
House Government Reform's subcommittee on criminal justice, drug 
policy and human resources. ``If it weren't for treatment, I would 
be dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramstad, a Minnesota Republican, has sponsored legislation that  
would prohibit health insurance plans from imposing limits on 
substance abuse treatment that are different from those for medical 
or surgical benefits. The bill would not require plans to cover 
substance abuse treatment, but would prohibit discrimination by 
health plans that do. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposing the bill, Charles Kahn III, president of the Health  
Insurance Association of America, said, ``Mandates can impose 
significant burdens on health insurance carriers and drive up costs 
for consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several people at the hearing had personal stories to tell.  
Susan Rook, a former reporter with CNN, told how drug abuse and 
alcohol landed her in the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
	After entering an alcohol and drug treatment program, however,  
her insurance coverage ran out in a week. Only when CNN agreed to 
pick up the full cost of her 28-day stay was she assured she could 
get the treatment she needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had the Cadillac Deluxe (insurance) plan -- and the substance  
abuse was capped at $10,000,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1977.

<HEADLINE> Former Comm. Guilty of Bribery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A former Miami-Dade County commissioner, seen on  
tape proclaiming ``This is a wonderful country'' as he took a 
$5,000 kickback, was convicted Thursday of one count of bribery. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight other charges against former commissioner James Burke and  
all the charges against his former top aide and a bond dealer also 
accused in the bribery scandal were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had charged that Burke and former aide Billy  
Hardemon sold out the public trust by taking kickbacks to steer 
business to San Francisco financier Calvin Grigsby, a founder of 
what was once the nation's leading minority-owned municipal bond 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Grigsby allegedly arranged to pay $350,000 in bribes to Burke  
and Hardemon to help obtain a $180 million refinancing bond on a 
recycling plant and a $210 million bond issue on a sports arena, 
and a third bond deal was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardemon was accused of pressing a county finance committee to  
award the bond business to Grigsby's San Francisco firm, the now 
defunct Grigsby Brandford &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was based largely on audio and video surveillance  
tapes, including the tape of Burke taking $5,000 from the 
informant. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense blamed the man handing over the money, bond dealer  
and former Miami city manager Howard Gary. Gary, who wore a wire, 
had made a deal with prosecutors and was not charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke, who was released pending sentencing Jan. 28, was upbeat  
after being cleared of the other charges Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``God has been very good to me all these years,'' he said. ``I  
don't believe he's brought me all this way to leave me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burke attorney Ed Shohat said, ``This jury had great difficulty  
returning a verdict -- don't lose sight of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate federal trial, Grigsby and two Port of Miami  
officials were acquitted in June of stealing $1.3 million from the 
county.

<HEADLINE> Santa Fe Man Faces 21st DWI Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- A man sentenced to prison at least twice  
for drunken driving was taken into custody again this week -- his 
21st arrest on a DWI charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Leonard Rael was arrested Tuesday night. Police said an  
officer saw him drive into a gas station and stagger to the 
cashier, and he flunked a field sobriety test. He was freed 
Wednesday after posting a $750 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know when this guy's luck is going to run out and he's  
going to kill somebody -- that's the scary part,'' police Lt. Raye 
Byford said. ``I'm shocked that this guy has this many DWIs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rael was carrying a license even though his driving privileges  
were suspended in 1997 for 10 years. State officials are 
investigating how he got the license, said Victoria Smith, deputy 
director of the state Motor Vehicles Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Rael, 45, who was first arrested on a drinking-and-driving  
charge when he was in high school, was sentenced to 18 months in 
prison -- the maximum -- in 1997 after pleading guilty to his 20th 
DWI charge. At the time of that arrest, Rael was on parole from a 
prior DWI prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the sheer number of arrests, Rael has become something  
of a local legend for the circumstances surrounding them. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, he was arrested after ramming into a police car. The  
same year, he was arrested a few hours after a court-ordered 
alcohol screening session. In 1994, he was drunk when he went to a 
meeting with his probation officer. And the same day he was 
sentenced in 1997, his 24-year-old son was in court to face his 
fifth DWI charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Byford said Rael serves as an example of New Mexico's need for  
stiffer penalties against drunken drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating to stop the same people numerous times and  
have them back on the road,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his 1997 conviction, prosecutors said that a  
state Supreme Court decision allowing habitual offenders to receive 
longer sentences doesn't apply to felony convictions under the 
state's drunken driving law.

	CENTRAL BRIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- A bus transporting elementary school  
pupils on a Halloween-time field trip collided with a dump truck 
this morning, injuring dozens of youngsters, three critically. 
</P>
<P>
	The students were first- and second-graders at Albany school No.  
118. They were being taken to visit a pumpkin patch in Schoharie 
County, about 30 miles west of Albany, when the crash happened 
shortly after 10:30 a.m., school spokesman David Albert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three critically injured students were airlifted by helicopter  
to the Albany Medical Center, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 47 other people were taken to other hospitals in Albany  
and other cities, authorities said. There were 44 pupils, plus 
teachers and parent chaperones, on the bus. 
</P>
<P>
	Television scenes of the accident showed that the bus sustained  
damage to its front section. It was not upended and there was no 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Albany school officials told parents to meet at a local school  
so they could be transported to whichever hospital their children 
were taken. Crisis counseling teams were on hand.

<HEADLINE> Coke's Third-Quarter Earnings Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Coca-Cola Co. reported an 11 percent drop in  
third-quarter earnings, citing economic troubles overseas and 
fallout from recalls of its products in Europe last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the world's biggest soft drink maker said today its  
case volume, an important industry measure, rose during the quarter 
after dropping in the first half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola earned $787 million, or 32 cents per share, down from  
$888 million, or 36 cents per share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke said its per-share earnings were reduced by 2 to 3 cents  
because of the costs associated with the beverage recalls in 
Belgium and France, including marketing expenses aimed at 
rebuilding its image. 
</P>
<P>
	But the per-share earnings matched what analysts surveyed by  
First Call/Thomson Financial had predicted for the Atlanta-based 
soft drink maker. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola stock fell to a 52-week low of $47.31 1/4 earlier this  
month, down from a high of $75.43 3/4 last November. Coke shares were 
trading at $53.31 1/4, up 56 1/4 cents or about 1 percent, at midmorning 
on the New York Stock Exchange, moving higher despite an overall 
sharp decline on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``The past year has not been what the company's shareholders or  
its management, most especially me, want or expect,'' said Coke 
chairman and chief executive officer M. Douglas Ivester. ``Both our 
volume and profit results and our stock price have disappointed us 
all, even recognizing the difficult circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Coke reported that its case volume, an industry indicator  
measuring sales of units of 24 eight-ounce servings, rose 3.5 
percent during the quarter. One percentage point was due to the 
recent acquisition of Cadbury Schweppes, but even accounting for 
that gain, Coke's performance was a turnaround following case 
volume declines in the first and second quarters of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported third-quarter revenues of $5.2 billion, a 9  
percent increase from $4.75 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The company named the global economic crisis as one reason for  
its earnings decline and said its profit margin also narrowed 
because of the consolidation of bottling operations in India and 
company-owned vending operations in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ivester said early signs of economic recovery bode well for  
Coke's future sales and earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fundamentals for our business have not changed; in fact, I  
believe they are stronger today than they were a year ago,'' 
Ivester said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke reported income of $2.48 billion for the first nine months  
this year, a 16 percent drop from last year's $2.94 billion. 
Earnings per share were $1, a 15 percent drop from $1.18 for the 
first nine months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month revenues were $15 billion, up 5 percent from $14.36  
billion.

<HEADLINE> Pizza Hut Airing Hillary Clinton Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new Pizza Hut television commercial  
lampooning Hillary Rodham Clinton as a New York carpetbagger hits 
the airwaves on Saturday as the World Series debuts. 
</P>
<P>
	But some are crying foul.  
</P>
<P>
	On the board of Tricon Foods -- the parent company of the  
Texas-based Pizza Hut -- is Kenneth Langone, a billionaire backer of 
Mrs. Clinton's likely Senate race rival, New York City Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	Although neither has formally declared their candidacies, Mrs.  
Clinton, a Democrat, and Giuliani, a Republican, are raising money 
to run for the Senate seat being vacated next year by Sen. Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	Tricon donated $2,500 to Giuliani's Senate exploratory  
committee, while Langone and his wife each have given $1,000, 
according to Federal Election Commission records. Langone served as 
Giuliani's campaign finance chairman in 1993 when he first won the 
mayor's job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite a set of coincidences,'' Mrs. Clinton's campaign  
spokesman Howard Wolfson said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Langone vigorously denied any impropriety Thursday. ``I had no  
idea about this ad until right now,'' he said. ``For anyone to 
imply anything different is wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the commercial, a blonde woman clad in a business suit and  
sporting a heavy Southern accent extolls the virtues of the ``Big 
New Yorker'' pizza. She appears on a bunting-decked platform with 
skyscrapers behind her. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do I know so much about New York pizza?'' she drawls.  
``'Cause New York, I want to be your next senator!'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the commercial, a police officer with a New York  
City accent chimes in ``$9.99! What do they think this is, 
Arkansas?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pizza Hut spokesman Jay Allison described the commercial as  
``just tongue-in-cheek fun'' that is part of the Big New Yorker 
pizza ad campaign that began in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Allison said there are no plans at present to do a similar  
parody of Giuliani. The company spokesman referred further 
questions about Langone's relationship to Giuliani to Tricon Foods. 
Officials there did not immediately return a telephone call seeking 
comment Thursday. Neither did the Giuliani camp.

<HEADLINE> ABC Food Lion Verdict Reversed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- First Amendment advocates cheered the  
reversal of a jury verdict that found ABC committed fraud by 
sending undercover journalists to do a hidden-camera expose of a 
supermarket chain. 
</P>
<P>
	``This lawsuit was an attempted end-run around the First  
Amendment,'' Floyd Abrams, a New York media lawyer, said following 
the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court threw out a $315,000 judgment in punitive  
damages against ABC over a 1992 ``PrimeTime Live'' story about the 
Food Lion chain -- an award that a judge had earlier reduced from 
$5.5 million. The ruling left only $2 of the jury's original award. 
</P>
<P>
	Two ABC reporters used false resumes to get jobs at a Food Lion  
store, then secretly videotaped employees for a story on 
food-handling practices that accused the chain of selling 
rat-gnawed cheese and rotting meat. 
</P>
<P>
	The report alleged that Food Lion employees ground out-of-date  
beef along with new beef, bleached rank meat to remove its odor and 
re-dated products not sold before their expiration date. 
</P>
<P>
	While the grocery chain denied the accusations, it did not  
pursue claims of libel or slander. Instead, Food Lion claimed it 
was the victim of fraud for hiring of two bogus workers and won 
$1,402 in compensatory damages in addition to the punitive award. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury award had stunned some because it appeared to open a  
new line of legal attack against news media and hidden-camera 
journalism that did not center on the accuracy of the story. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case was sitting out there as a very dangerous precedent  
for the press,'' said Gregg Leslie, acting executive director of 
the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court, in a 2-1 ruling, overturned the punitive and  
compensatory damages, saying the supermarket chain wasn't damaged 
by the reporters' deception -- though it upheld $1 in damages 
against each reporter for trespass and breaching their duty to be 
loyal to Food Lion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a victory for the American tradition of investigative  
journalism. In the end, after Food Lion spent millions of dollars 
on legal fees and public relations offensives, the court ordered 
ABC News to pay only $2 in damages,'' said David Westin, ABC News 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court also reversed the jury's finding that ABC  
violated the North Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices 
Act, ruling that the law did not apply because the network and the 
Salisbury, N.C.-based supermarket chain were not in competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``ABC was not competing with Food Lion, and it did not have any  
actual or potential business relationship with the grocery chain,'' 
so the law could not be used in this case, said the opinion by 
Judge M. Blane Michael. 
</P>
<P>
	``Presumably, ABC intended to benefit the consuming public by  
letting it know about Food Lion's food handling practices,'' 
Michael added. Judge Diana G. Motz joined his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Paul V. Niemeyer disagreed with the majority, writing in a  
dissenting opinion that there was ample evidence to support the 
jury's finding of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Food Lion said it was disappointed. ``This is a complicated  
legal area, and our lawyers will review the court's decision and 
advise us of our options,'' it said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Paulson, executive director of the First Amendment Center at  
Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn., said the ruling means 
plaintiffs who would never win a traditional libel suit ``will 
think twice using alternative methods of striking back at news 
media that are reporting in the public interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abrams, the media attorney, said: ``The enduring message of this  
opinion is that the press will be protected against enormous 
judgments based on the content of articles unless the companies 
suing can prove that the articles weren't true.''

<HEADLINE> USC To Start on Arena Next Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- USC, which has played its home basketball  
games in the LA Sports Arena since 1959, plans to build a new arena 
next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The university still has to raise funds for much of the  
approximately $70 million total for construction. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12,000-seat, multi-purpose facility will be built across the  
street from the campus, and could be completed by January 2002, 
athletic director Mike Garrett said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``USC is the only university in the Pac-10 that doesn't own its  
own arena, and we have missed out on many prime recruits over the 
years because of the lack of a facility,'' Garrett said. ``Our new 
arena will level the recruiting playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The arena will be just several blocks from the new Staples  
Center, home of the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers and the 
NHL's Los Angeles Kings. That new arena cost $375 million and 
opened earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The new USC arena will also serve as home for the Trojans'  
volleyball teams, and as the site of concerts, plays and other 
cultural events.

<HEADLINE> Ore. City Bans After-School Fights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OREGON CITY, Ore. (AP) -- The City Council in this Portland  
suburb has banned boxing matches in parks in an attempt to stop 
after-school bouts that had been occurring weekly in one park since 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	The fights haven't been like the bare-fisted basement brawls in  
the movie ``Fight Club'' -- in the park, participants wear boxing 
gloves, although there is no ring and often no protective gear. 
</P>
<P>
	Several residents had complained about the matches, saying they  
give the city a bad image. Tabloid TV programs such as ``Inside 
Edition'' and ``Real TV'' have shot footage of the bouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The City Council voted unanimously Wednesday night to ban the  
matches, citing the risk of injury to participants and spectators. 
The measure takes effect immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Some parents expressed regrets about the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``A big part of me that is a parent and small-business owner  
understands the city position about liability,'' said Cherie 
Garcia, whose son, Derick, 18, has taken part in the matches. 
``Unfortunately it has come to this that we live in a society that 
is so sue-happy that kids can't go to the park and box if they want 
to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Robertson, whose son, Justin, 16, has fought in the  
matches, praised the teens involved for their ability to organize 
the activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was kind of proud of them for putting it together,'' she  
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Associated Press reported erroneously  
Friday, Oct. 15, that Michael Weinstock, an Atlanta attorney, had 
been accused by the Securities Exchange Commission of fraudulently 
obtaining $1.6 million in an investment scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinstock was named as ``relief defendant'' in an SEC complaint  
alleging that Mark Drucker of Atlanta defrauded investors through a 
Ponzi scheme in which some early investors made large profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC alleged those profits were paid from funds invested by  
subsequent customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint alleged that Weinstock was unjustly enriched at  
the expense of later investors and asked that he be ordered to pay 
back all profits from his participation. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC complaint contained no allegation of fraud against  
Weinstock. It alleged that he invested roughly $1,036,000 and 
received approximately $1,575,000 in return from Drucker. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinstock's lawyer, Pat Huddleston said Weinstock was ``an  
investor and at no time did he have knowledge that there was 
anything illegal.'' Huddleston said his client had cooperated fully 
with the SEC investigation.

<HEADLINE> Feds Name New Auto Safety Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rosalyn G. Millman has been named acting  
administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration, the agency announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Department Secretary Rodney Slater made Millman  
acting head of the agency this week after the recent departure of 
the former administrator, Dr. Ricardo Martinez. The agency is in 
charge of federal regulation of the auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Millman had joined the agency in the No. 2 slot as deputy  
administrator in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Millman served the past six years as transportation economist  
for the Democratic staff of the House Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Millman graduated from Pennsylvania State University in 1983 and  
received her master's degree in economics and public policy from 
Princeton University in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, an emergency-room physician, was head of the agency  
for five years and was at its helm during a turbulent time when 
agency officials crafted a series of initiatives to response to the 
public outcry over deaths from automobile air bags. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez stepped down last Friday to become vice president of  
health affairs for Web MD, Inc., an Atlanta-based company that 
provides health news and services to physicians and consumers over 
the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Falcons: Stewart's Eyes Tip Defenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Atlanta Falcons cornerback Ray Buchanan was  
watching the Pittsburgh Steelers, and he couldn't believe what he 
saw. 
</P>
<P>
	Namely, quarterback Kordell Stewart tipping off pass plays with  
his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL players rarely drop strategic hints before a game, but  
Buchanan said Wednesday he can always tell where Stewart will throw 
by watching his eyes from the time the ball is snapped. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, he looks where he is throwing the ball. I don't know  
what's going on with their offense, but he's pretty easy to read,'' 
Buchanan said. ``I'm going to go ahead and let these receivers take 
me to the football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because he always tips off his pass plays, Stewart worries the  
Falcons (1-5) more as a runner than a thrower, Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart didn't seem surprised by the news -- only that somebody  
had blurted out the Atlanta secondary's game plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``For him to be telling me that, I know what to expect of him  
Monday, so, thank you, Ray,'' Stewart said. ``Now that you told me 
that, I have to go practice and not stare down receivers so he 
can't see that and use that to his advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who has thrown only five touchdown passes in his last  
12 starts, doesn't deny he eyes a receiver down the field, rather 
than looking one way to confuse defenders before throwing another. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's right. I may look at guys once in a while to get the ball  
to them,'' Stewart said. ``Ray's one of those guys who studies film 
and he noticed that. That's smart on his part. But, at the same 
time, a lot of people have said that in the past, even when we were 
successful in doing what we were doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, the Steelers aren't doing much offensively, as  
evidenced by their rankings: 23rd in the league in offense and 27th 
in passing. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart hasn't thrown a touchdown pass at home -- and the  
Steelers haven't won in Three Rivers Stadium -- since Nov. 22 
against Jacksonville. His three touchdown passes are one fewer than 
Cleveland rookie Tim Couch has thrown, and his 68.3 passer rating 
is the lowest of any AFC quarterback who has started every game. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart has avoided interceptions, throwing three in six games,  
but hasn't completed a pass longer than 43 yards. The absence of 
the deep pass is allowing defenses to gang up against the run; 
Jerome Bettis hadn't had a 100-yard game until gaining 111 yards 
Sunday in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart wouldn't speculate whether his habit of locking onto a  
receiver may be giving cornerbacks the extra edge they need to take 
away long passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of things are going on out there and sometimes you're  
unsure,'' Stewart said. ``Some quarterbacks are going to look to 
where they want to throw the ball. John Elway did it, Dan Marino 
does it, anybody will do it. It doesn't have to be a bad throw even 
if defenders are looking for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad Ray said it, because it will make me very aware  
of what's going on now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart had his best game of the season Oct. 10 in Buffalo,  
throwing for two touchdowns and 216 yards in a 24-21 loss. But he 
seemed to regress in Sunday's 17-3 victory in Cincinnati, finishing 
17-of-29 for 134 yards, a low 4.6 yards per attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The statistical part of things, that will play its course  
through time,'' coach Bill Cowher said. ``Maybe the circumstances 
of the game will dictate that the ratio of the pass or run will be 
a little more lopsided than the other. You have to have a 
conviction in what you're doing and stay with it.''

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Rise by 9,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans filing new claims for unemployment  
benefits rose by 9,000 last week after a sharp decline the previous 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported today that 298,000 persons filed  
new jobless claims for the week ending Oct. 16 following a drop of 
25,000 the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase pushed the four-week moving average to 300,750, the  
first time it has been above the 300,000-level in three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the increase, the number of newly laid off workers  
remains at historically low levels. The unemployment rate in 
September remained at a 29-year low of 4.2 percent even though the 
number of payroll jobs actually fell slightly during the month, 
partly because of job losses blamed on Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists are looking for payroll growth to accelerate in  
the current month, possibly enough to drive the unemployment rate 
down another notch to 4.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve, worried that tight labor markets could lead  
to rising wage demands and higher inflation, has pushed interest 
rates up twice this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists believe a third rate hike will occur at the  
Fed's next meeting on Nov. 16 because of Fed concerns that economic 
activity must be slowed further to make sure inflation does not get 
out of hand. The government reported Tuesday that consumer prices 
rose by 0.4 percent in September, the biggest gain in five months, 
as energy and tobacco posted big price gains. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week ending Oct. 9, 46 states and territories reported  
increases in applications for unemployment benefits and six 
reported declines with one reporting no change. The state data lag 
one week behind the national figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The states with the biggest increases were California, up 4,125,  
a gain blamed on layoffs in service industries; Texas, up 3,644, 
due to layoffs in the electrical equipment and other manufacturing 
industries, and Pennsylvania, up 2,711 because of layoffs in the 
lumber, paper, primary metals and electrical equipment industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states with a large number of layoffs for the week ending  
Oct. 9 were Tennessee, up 2,026; Oregon, up 1,823; Washington, up 
1,563, Georgia, up 1,415; Alabama, up 1,196; Wisconsin, up 1,190, 
and New York, up 1,069. 
</P>
<P>
	States with the largest number of declines in benefit  
applications for the week ending Oct. 9 were South Carolina, down 
1,605 because of fewer layoffs in manufacturing; Virginia, down 
1,158 because of fewer layoffs in the textile industry, and North 
Carolina, down 1,055 because of fewer layoffs in the fabricated 
metals, apparel and plastic industries.

<HEADLINE> Donovan Interim Coach for WNBA Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Anne Donovan, a three-time Olympian and  
member of the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, has been hired as 
interim coach of Indiana's WNBA expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	Donovan will coach the team, which begins play next summer,  
while head coach Nell Fortner fulfills her obligation with the U.S. 
Women's National Team through the 2000 Olympic Games. Donovan will 
then become Fortner's top assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	Donovan was a three-time All-American at Old Dominion, as well  
as the 1983 Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being an interim coach is different and it hasn't been done in  
the WNBA before,'' Donovan said. ``It's a unique opportunity and a 
great opportunity ... to build a great team in Indiana.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donovan previously coached the Philadelphia Rage of the  
now-defunct ABL and at East Carolina. She was an assistant with 
Fortner on the 1998 world championship team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've known Anne for many years,'' Fortner said. ``We're very  
fortunate to have someone of her caliber come in and help us get 
this team off the ground.''

<HEADLINE> Jury Rules on Mistaken Prescription </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ODESSA, Texas (AP) -- A jury has ordered a cardiologist, a  
drugstore and a pharmacist to pay $450,000 to relatives of a man 
who died of a heart attack after the druggist misread the doctor's 
handwritten prescription. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the verdict was to be paid by Dr. Ramachandra Kolluru,  
and the other half by an Albertson's pharmacy in Odessa and 
pharmacist Thomas Updyke. The verdict was issued on Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctor is disappointed, because he very strongly felt in  
his mind that he had written a legible prescription,'' said 
Kolluru's attorney, Max Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney also said he believes strong evidence was presented  
that the man's heart disease killed him, not the medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of heart patient Ramon Vasquez, 42, contended that he  
died in 1995 because he took an overdose of the wrong medication 
after Updyke misread an illegible prescription from Kolluru.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Rise by 9,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans filing new claims for unemployment  
benefits rose by 9,000 last week after a sharp decline the previous 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported today that 298,000 persons filed  
new jobless claims for the week ending Oct. 16 following a drop of 
25,000 the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase pushed the four-week moving average to 300,750, the  
first time it has been above the 300,000-level in three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the increase, the number of newly laid off workers  
remains at historically low levels. The unemployment rate in 
September remained at a 29-year low of 4.2 percent even though the 
number of payroll jobs actually fell slightly during the month, 
partly because of job losses blamed on Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists are looking for payroll growth to accelerate in  
the current month, possibly enough to drive the unemployment rate 
down another notch to 4.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve, worried that tight labor markets could lead  
to rising wage demands and higher inflation, has pushed interest 
rates up twice this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists believe a third rate hike will occur at the  
Fed's next meeting on Nov. 16 because of Fed concerns that economic 
activity must be slowed further to make sure inflation does not get 
out of hand. The government reported Tuesday that consumer prices 
rose by 0.4 percent in September, the biggest gain in five months, 
as energy and tobacco posted big price gains. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week ending Oct. 9, 46 states and territories reported  
increases in applications for unemployment benefits and six 
reported declines with one reporting no change. The state data lag 
one week behind the national figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The states with the biggest increases were California, up 4,125,  
a gain blamed on layoffs in service industries; Texas, up 3,644, 
due to layoffs in the electrical equipment and other manufacturing 
industries, and Pennsylvania, up 2,711 because of layoffs in the 
lumber, paper, primary metals and electrical equipment industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states with a large number of layoffs for the week ending  
Oct. 9 were Tennessee, up 2,026; Oregon, up 1,823; Washington, up 
1,563, Georgia, up 1,415; Alabama, up 1,196; Wisconsin, up 1,190, 
and New York, up 1,069. 
</P>
<P>
	States with the largest number of declines in benefit  
applications for the week ending Oct. 9 were South Carolina, down 
1,605 because of fewer layoffs in manufacturing; Virginia, down 
1,158 because of fewer layoffs in the textile industry, and North 
Carolina, down 1,055 because of fewer layoffs in the fabricated 
metals, apparel and plastic industries.

<HEADLINE> Report: 2 Mets Ignored End of Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- While their teammates struggled to hold onto a  
one-run lead in Game 6 of the National League Championship Series, 
New York Mets outfielders Rickey Henderson and Bobby Bonilla played 
cards in the clubhouse in a show of defiance against manager Bobby 
Valentine, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Record of Hackensack reported that, according to people in  
the organization, the two spent the last three innings in the 
clubhouse ignoring the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson, in particular, was angry with Valentine because the  
manager replaced him with Melvin Mora in the eighth inning of Game 
4 -- after Henderson had already taken his spot in left field. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammates were not happy about the pair's absence.  
</P>
<P>
	``Guys who saw (the card game) wanted to take a bat to their  
heads after the game,'' one person affiliated with the team said. 
``There were players crying and screaming in the dugout (after the 
Mets lost the game in 11 innings). Then they walk in the clubhouse 
and see that?''

	Late-Term Abortion Ban Passes Senate  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate approved a bill Thursday that would  
ban certain late-term abortions. President Clinton has vetoed two 
earlier bans. The legislation was approved by a vote of 63-34 -- 
four votes shy of the two-thirds majority required to override a 
veto. But Democrats declared a political victory based on an 
amendment to that bill, which passed earlier in the day. By 51-47, 
senators passed a nonbinding resolution that supports the 1973 
Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion.

	Earthquake Jolts Southern Taiwan

<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A strong earthquake with a preliminary  
magnitude of 6.4 jolted southern Taiwan on Friday, injuring at 
least three people as it collapsed homes and triggered a fire in a 
city near the epicenter, state-run radio said. The quake, which 
struck at 10:22 a.m., was centered at 1.5 miles north of Chiayi 
City, about 180 miles south of Taipei, the Central Weather Bureau 
said. The bureau said the Friday quake was unrelated to a 
7.6-magnitude temblor that hit Sept. 21 and killed more than 2,300 
people.

filled central Dili on Friday to welcome the return of their exiled 
guerrilla leader, Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao. Australian 
forces secretly flew Gusmao here from Darwin, Australia, Thursday 
night. His arrival comes two days after the Indonesian parliament 
endorsed the results of East Timor's independence referendum, 
effectively relinquishing control of the province. In another 
development, 2,000 refugees arrived in Dili aboard the first ship 
to carry displaced East Timorese home from Indonesian territory.

country's four provinces on Thursday, the state-run news agency 
said. Three of the four governors are retired army officers, and 
all will be under the control of a six-member National Security 
Council, which has yet to be created and was expected to include 
military and civilian appointees. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was 
overthrown by the army in a bloodless coup on Oct. 12. He has not 
been seen since, but the military says he is in good health in 
``protective custody.''

	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- The Russian Defense Ministry in Moscow is  
denying Chechnya's claims that the rockets that hit Grozny on 
Thursday, killing 118 people and injuring up to 400, were fired by 
Russian forces moving in on the capital. Bleeding bodies were 
scattered throughout a crowded open air market after six rockets 
exploded in the stalls. At least four other rockets slammed into 
other parts of the city. Russia has been waging an offensive in 
Chechnya to eliminate Islamic militants who invaded neighboring

suspended publication of a new book about Republican presidential 
candidate and Texas Gov. George W. Bush after questions were raised 
about the author's background. The Dallas Morning News reported 
this week that J.H. Hatfield, author of ``Fortunate Son,'' was 
paroled from a Texas prison in 1993 after serving time for a felony 
conviction. Hatfield told the newspaper it was a case of mistaken 
identity. The book alleges that Bush was arrested for cocaine 
possession in 1972 but the matter was dropped after he performed 
community service arranged by his father, former President Bush.

cruised to a 35-8 victory Thursday night over the Baltimore Ravens. 
Kansas City (4-2) had 80 yards in the first half and only 132 yards 
through three quarters. Elvis Grbac threw two touchdown passes to 
Tony Gonzalez and the defense did the rest. The Ravens (2-4) lost 
their second straight under first-year coach Brian Billick.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bring Pete Rose Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- By a 2-1 margin, most people think Pete Rose  
should be reinstated to baseball, even though many believe he did 
gamble on his sport, according to an Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-six percent of those surveyed said Rose should be  
reinstated, while 29 percent said he should not, according to the 
poll, conducted for the AP by ICR of Media, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven out of 10 said baseball's career hits leader belongs in  
baseball's Hall of Fame, while almost two out of 10 said he 
doesn't. Rose is not eligible for the Hall of Fame as long as his 
lifetime ban remains in effect. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 78 percent to 15 percent margin, people said commissioner  
Bud Selig made the correct decision to invite Rose to the World 
Series ceremony Sunday honoring the sport's All-Century team. Rose 
was among the 25 players elected in fan balloting in the second 
half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who think Rose should be allowed to appear at the  
series was Levona Walker, a communications specialist in her 40s 
from Bainbridge, Ga. The decision to let Rose appear with the 
All-Century team at the World Series is a good one, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a great player,'' said Walker, who considers herself a  
big baseball fan. ``Everybody has faults, so why blame him for his 
faults?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, more people don't believe Rose's gambling denial than  
believe him. Forty percent don't believe Rose is telling the truth 
about betting on baseball, while 30 percent believe him. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Murray, a 55-year-old retiree from Tonawanda, N.Y., says he  
thinks the example Rose set on the field far outweighs the charge 
of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the greatest baseball players,'' said Murray. ``He  
was a great example through his hustle -- he showed a lot of hard 
work and hustle. He was a good example of youth of that day and 
this day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray said he doesn't know whether Rose bet on baseball or not,  
``But I like him, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey of 1,012 adults was taken Oct. 1-5 and has  
a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, then manager of the Cincinnati Reds, agreed to a lifetime  
ban from baseball in August 1989 following an investigation of his 
gambling. He applied for reinstatement in September 1997, and Selig 
has not ruled on the request, saying he sees no reason to chance 
the ban originally imposed by commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who describe themselves as following baseball  
closely, Rose got even higher backing, with 67 percent saying he 
should be reinstated and 29 percent saying he shouldn't. 
Seventy-two percent say he belongs in the Hall of Fame and 79 
percent said he should be invited to the All-Century team ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	But 49 percent think he's lying when he says he didn't bet on  
baseball, with 36 percent believing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Among casual fans, those who say they follow baseball but not  
closely, 64 percent say he should be reinstated, 79 percent say he 
belongs in the Hall of Fame and 84 percent agree he should be 
invited to the All-Century team festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	This group was about evenly split, with 40 percent saying they  
think he's lying about gambling on baseball and 36 percent 
believing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Carbonneau, a 66-year-old retiree from Champaign, Ill.,  
is a lifetime baseball fan who thinks some officials in the sport 
may not have a good historical perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless they could prove he was throwing Reds games, they  
should let him back in,'' Carbonneau said. ``The Babe wasn't 
exactly a saint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press poll on former major leaguer Pete Rose is  
based on telephone interviews with 1,017 randomly selected adults 
from all states except Alaska and Hawaii. The interviews were 
conducted Oct. 1-5 by ICR of Media, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were weighted to represent the population by  
demographic factors such as age, sex, region and education. 
</P>
<P>
	No more than one time in 20 should chance variations in the  
sample cause the results to vary by more than 3 percentage points 
from the answers that would be obtained if all Americans were 
polled. 
</P>
<P>
	This margin of sampling error is larger for responses of  
subgroups, such as income categories. There are other sources of 
potential error in polls, including the wording and order of 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll's questions:  
</P>
<P>
	1. Which statement best describes your level of interest in  
baseball? 
</P>
<P>
	--I follow major league baseball closely, 14 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--I follow major league baseball, but not closely, 28 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--I don't pay much attention to major league baseball, 58  
percent. 

</P>
<P>
	2. As you may know, Pete Rose had the most hits of any major  
league baseball player ever, but was banned from baseball for life 
in 1989 after he was accused of gambling on the sport. Do you think 
he should be reinstated or not? 
</P>
<P>
	--yes, 56 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--no, 29 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--don't know, 14 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--refused, 1 percent  

</P>
<P>
	3. Do you think Pete Rose belongs in the baseball Hall of Fame  
or not? 
</P>
<P>
	--yes, 69 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--no, 18 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--don't know, 12 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--refused, 1 percent  

</P>
<P>
	4. The players elected by fans to the All-Century baseball team  
will be invited to the 1999 World Series. If Pete Rose is elected 
to the team, should he be invited to the 1999 World Series or not? 
</P>
<P>
	--yes, 78 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--no, 15 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--don't know, 7 percent  

</P>
<P>
	5. Pete Rose has admitted to sports gambling, but denies  
gambling on baseball. Do you believe Pete Rose when he says he 
didn't gamble on baseball or do you not believe him? 
</P>
<P>
	--believe him, 30 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--don't believe him, 44 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--don't know, 24 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--refused, 2 percent

<HEADLINE> Student Movie Star Missing Premiere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPEAKE, Ala. (AP) -- One of the stars of ``Crazy in Alabama''  
won't be at its world premiere this Friday in Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas Black's other role -- left guard and nose guard for the  
Speake High School football team -- is more important. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first year to play varsity football,'' said Black,  
the 16-year-old actor who made a name for himself in the 1996 
Oscar-winning movie ``Sling Blade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have too good a record, but it's been fun. I don't  
think I need to miss a game to go to that premiere,'' he said. 
``Besides, I know what happens in the movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While he enjoys making movies, Black said he prefers hunting,  
fishing or playing sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``Crazy in Alabama,'' based on Mark Childress' best-selling  
novel of the same name, is a coming-of-age story about a boy 
nicknamed Peejoe, played by Black, and how he comes to the aid of 
his eccentric aunt during the 1960s. Melanie Griffith plays the 
aunt.

<HEADLINE> Rookie Edwards Shines for Steelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Troy Edwards is finding it easier to get open  
downfield than it is to get off the Pittsburgh Steelers' bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, a first-round draft choice, leads all NFL rookie  
receivers -- and the Steelers -- with 25 catches for 285 yards and 
two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	But he still finds himself strapped to the bench for multiple  
plays as Courtney Hawkins plays, forcing Edwards to wait to get 
onto the field until the Steelers use three- or four-receiver sets. 
</P>
<P>
	For Edwards, who isn't a patient person, the waiting is the  
hardest part. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of hard to sit on the sidelines for three, four,  
five plays and they throw you out there and want you to be a 
Superman, a hero,'' Edwards said. ``It is kind of hard to go into 
the game and be totally focused like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Especially for Edwards, who led NCAA Division I-A receivers with  
140 catches and tied Jerry Rice's NCAA record of 27 touchdown 
receptions last season at Louisiana Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Edwards was having trouble learning a complicated  
offense installed in training camp by coordinator Kevin Gilbride. 
The system calls for receivers to alter their routes and adjust to 
the defense, even after leaving the line of scrimmage. The 
quarterback must make the same read the receivers do. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the 5-foot-9, 192-pound Edwards is comfortable with the  
offense but is having difficulty with the constant changes in 
coverage and formations made by NFL defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the offense,'' he said. ``It's just the defense I am  
trying to learn. Every week, they seem to come up with a different 
scheme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers probably wouldn't have drafted Edwards if either of  
the first two receivers selected, Torry Holt of St. Louis or David 
Boston of Arizona, had been available. Now, Holt and Boston have 
fewer receptions and yards receiving than Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	But Edwards has begun playing some on first and second downs,  
which previously were played exclusively by Hawkins. Edwards and 
Hines Wards sometimes open a series together, and Edwards always 
lines up outside in three-receiver sets. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to be a good receiver, he really is,'' coach Bill  
Cowher said. ``Kordell (Stewart) has developed a rapport with him. 
A lot of it has to do with Troy's approach to practice. I think 
he's grown up in the last couple of weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards came to the Steelers with the reputation of being an  
undisciplined receiver who took plays off and practiced poorly. 
When training camp began, Edwards said he always was a poor 
practice player who needed the motivation of a game to play well. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards had four catches for 58 yards Sunday in a 17-3 victory  
in Cincinnati, the third time he has led Pittsburgh in receptions. 
One problem: he still drops passes as he looks to get upfield, a 
problem he hopes to eliminate before Monday night's game against 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``I dropped the ball, and there are no excuses,'' he said.  
``I've got to start hanging onto the ball and making plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Stewart seems to be looking to Edwards more and more on  
key passing downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``But how can I be the go-to guy when I'm not even starting?''  
Edwards said. ``I'm trying to start. But I'm not the coach. I don't 
even know what the coach thinks. I'm just trying to work hard and 
make it a hard situation every week for them to name a starter.''

<HEADLINE> N.M. Gov. Wants Drugs Legalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARRIZOZO, N.M. (AP) -- The cyclist focused hard on the deserted  
road ahead as he pumped his way up a steep slope amid the 
scrub-covered mountains of southern New Mexico. The sun was just 
coming up, and he was on the last leg of a five-day, 430-mile 
journey. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gary Johnson had barely broken a sweat.  
</P>
<P>
	The Republican governor and triathlete has never attempted an  
uphill battle he thought he couldn't win. That goes for his latest 
cause: trying to convince anyone who will listen that drugs should 
be legalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 46, is a former drug user who now gets high on nothing  
more than his own endorphins. He has shocked politicians in both 
parties by becoming the nation's leading proponent of the 
legalization of such drugs as marijuana, cocaine and heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson doesn't drink or smoke, and has a bet with colleagues  
about who can survive longer without cake, cookies or colas. He 
insists his athleticism and position on drugs are not 
contradictory, saying legalization would curb drug-related health 
problems by controlling dosages, frequency and paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Drugs are a bad choice. They're a handicap,'' he says. ``But  
does that warrant putting that person in jail or putting a felony 
on their record for the rest of their lives?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson says drugs should be regulated and taxed much like  
cigarettes and liquor. He envisions a scenario in which marijuana 
would be legalized first, followed by more dangerous drugs such as 
heroin and cocaine, which would be available by prescription, only 
for addicts. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson admits he doesn't have a specific, detailed plan, but  
says he wants to start a debate on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	In his home state, which last year led the nation in  
drug-induced deaths, Johnson's views on drug legalization have been 
labeled crazy and irresponsible by both Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	His own public safety secretary insists Johnson's crusade has  
crushed the morale of law officers fighting the war on drugs. U.S. 
drug czar Barry McCaffrey has ridiculed the governor as ``Puff 
Daddy Johnson'' and rushed to New Mexico earlier this month to 
denounce Johnson's position. 
</P>
<P>
	Where others see dissension, Johnson sees progress.  
</P>
<P>
	``If this were a wacko idea,'' he says, ``then it wouldn't be  
going anywhere, there wouldn't be any attention given to it at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A millionaire who made his fortune in the construction business,  
Johnson ousted New Mexico's longest-serving governor in 1994 to 
capture his first elective office. 
</P>
<P>
	The next year he vetoed a record 200 bills. He later became the  
first New Mexico governor to be held in contempt of court when he 
failed to halt a welfare program he implemented without legislative 
approval. He has also become one of the country's most vocal 
champions of school vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
	State Democratic Party chairwoman Diane Denish says Johnson's  
leadership style mirrors his approach to fitness: He is 
competitive, unrelenting and prefers to work alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an athlete who has not been part of teams, and that's  
very much how he operates in government -- as a single competitor,'' 
Ms. Denish says. 
</P>
<P>
	For Johnson, the idea that criminalizing drug use is wrong began  
taking shape in high school, when he tried marijuana despite the 
warnings of teachers and police. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we learned was what everybody learned -- that, hey, you  
smoke marijuana and you are going to go crazy,'' he says. ``Then, 
there are my friends that actually began smoking pot, and it wasn't 
the bogeyman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While campaigning for governor, Johnson admitted smoking pot and  
using cocaine in college. He says he quit when, while skiing 
stoned, he noticed his time was slower than when he was clean. 
</P>
<P>
	These days Johnson says he doesn't touch drugs. He rises at 4:30  
a.m. to run, swim or lift weights, and plans to participate in his 
third Ironman triathlon this Saturday in Hawaii. The competition 
combines running, swimming and biking. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sad thing about it is he's a great role model for kids,  
and he's getting ridiculed all the time,'' says his wife, Dee. The 
couple have two children: one in high school, the other in college. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson didn't make an issue of legalization during his first  
term out of concern over losing re-election. With his second term 
up in 2002, and term limits prohibiting a third consecutive bid, 
Johnson says he no longer has a reason to keep quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	He also insists he has no plans to pursue another elective  
office, despite being wooed by New Mexico Libertarians as a 
possible presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would just absolutely die a thousand deaths if 10 years from  
now I'm sitting around reading some article about somebody raising 
the drug issue,'' he says. ``I couldn't imagine myself saying, 
`That was something I should have done because I believed in it, 
but I just didn't have the guts to do it.' ''

 *Yankees:* Hernandez hammered in both career starts vs. Atlanta. ...  
Clemens also hit hard in only start vs. Braves this season. ... 
Pettitte, who outdueled Smoltz in 1-0 Game 5 victory in 1996, has 
only win vs. Atlanta this season. ... Cone facing Braves for third 
time in Series. Beat Atlanta in Game 3 in 1996 and started in two 
games won by Toronto in 1992, including clinching Game 6. ... 
Rivera hasn't allowed a run since July 21, but gave up four in one 
inning July 16 against Atlanta. ... Williams and O'Neill hit only 
.167 in '96 Series. 
</P>
<P>
 *Braves:* Klesko 5-for-5 with two homers off Hernandez. ... Andruw  
Jones hit three-run homer vs. Rivera. ... Glavine beat Clemens on 
July 15 in only second matchup of reigning Cy Young winners. ... 
O'Neill a .212 hitter with two homers in 113 career at-bats against 
Maddux, Smoltz and Glavine. ... Three left-handed relievers -- 
Rocker, Remlinger and Mulholland -- should neutralize Yankees lineup 
that feasts on righties. ... Yankees catchers will have tough time 
containing Braves' running game. ... Odalis Perez, out for the 
season, has the Braves' only loss against the Yankees.

</P>
<P>
                            *Big Picture    	
</P>
<P>
 *Yankees:* Led AL in wins with 98 and won AL East. Still, 16 wins  
fewer than last year marked biggest drop-off in league. Showed form 
of record-setting '98 by sweeping Texas and beating Boston in five 
games to get back to Series. ... O'Neill slowed with fractured rib 
and has only one RBI -- albeit a game-winner in Game 2 of the ALCS -- 
in playoffs. ... Manager Joe Torre, who missed start of season 
after being diagnosed with prostate cancer, cautioned team -- and 
fans -- not to compare to '98 World Series champions. ... Looking to 
win record 25th Series title. ... In postseason for fifth straight 
year, longest streak since reaching Series in 1960-64. ... 
Williams, O'Neill, Martinez and Jeter made up Yanks' first quartet 
with 100 RBIs since 1939. ... Clemens' continued inconsistent 
season in playoffs, pitching seven shutout innings against Texas 
before allowing five runs in two innings vs. Boston. The Rocket has 
two wins in 11 postseason starts. ... Hernandez, not Clemens, has 
taken the place of David Wells, who went 4-0 in last year's 
playoffs. Hernandez is 4-0 with an 0.97 ERA in five postseason 
starts. ... Rivera has the lowest postseason ERA among pitchers 
with at least 30 innings in major league history. He's allowed two 
runs in 42 2-3 innings (0.42). ... Strawberry returned this year 
from colon cancer, which was diagnosed during last year's playoffs. 
Also was delayed by suspension for drug violation. Has two homers 
in playoffs. ... Stanton in postseason for eighth straight time, 
including 1991-3 with Atlanta. Has 1.10 ERA in those games. 
</P>
<P>
 *Braves:* In Series for fifth time this decade, with only one  
championship to show for it. ... Probably most impressive 
performance overall by Atlanta this year since the worst-to-first 
season of 1991. ... Lost cleanup hitter Andres Galarraga to cancer 
and four other players -- closer Kerry Ligtenberg, All-Star catcher 
Javy Lopez and pitchers Odalis Perez and Rudy Seanez -- to 
season-ending injuries. ... Free agent Jordan took over Galarraga's 
cleanup spot and succeeded despite wrist injury that limited his 
power in the second half of the season. Hitting .310 with three 
homers and 12 RBIs in playoffs. ... Eddie Perez replaced Lopez and 
was NLCS MVP. ... Rocker hasn't allowed earned run in 10 playoff 
innings. ... Chipper Jones is top candidate for MVP. Broke Todd 
Hundley's NL record for homers by a switch-hitter. A big postseason 
player in past, he's hitting only .250 with two RBIs in postseason. 
Hasn't homered since Sept. 23. ... Maddux struggled in first half 
but bounced back. He is 1-1 with 2.14 ERA in playoffs. ... Millwood 
ranked second in NL ERA, and followed up with two wins and save in 
playoffs. ... Defending Cy Young winner Glavine struggled, while 
Smoltz altered motion and began using knuckleball to cope with 
persistent pain in his right elbow. ... General manager John 
Schuerholz pulled off key trade just minutes before deadline, 
acquiring Mulholland and Hernandez from Cubs.

</P>
<P>
	-- Team of the decade. There's no prize for it and few can  
remember the team of the '80s, but that will be the talk in this 
matchup. Third Series championship should cement title for Yankees. 
Second championship, along with eight division titles, will give it 
to the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Starting something. Teams playing only opposition that can  
match their own starting pitching depth. Five of eight starters 
have Cy Young Awards, New York's Hernandez has been one of the 
toughest postseason pitchers, and Millwood and Pettitte have big 
playoff wins to their credit. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Mightiest pen. Yankees bullpen, led by postseason stalwart  
Rivera, biggest reason for team's playoff success. Braves would be 
looking for fourth or fifth title with more reliable relievers. 
Manager Bobby Cox has called on his starters to shine in relief, 
though Rocker is still most important piece.

<HEADLINE> NYers in Atlanta Rooting for Yanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Like many former New Yorkers who call Atlanta  
home, Harlem native Malcolm Berkley relishes seeing the Yankees in 
the World Series, particularly against the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I actually rooted for the Braves over the Mets because I love  
to see the Yankees beat them,'' said Berkley, a public relations 
manager for United Parcel Service. ``As much as I'd love to see a 
Subway Series, I always like to see the Yankees in town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talk to many New Yorkers-turned-Atlantans about the World  
Series, which starts in Atlanta on Saturday night, and they'll 
start getting nostalgic, talking about Mickey Mantle or exactly how 
many subway stops they lived from The House that Ruth Built. 
</P>
<P>
	Braves fans, on the other hand, can't even fill the House that  
Ted Built. Thousands of seats at Turner Field were empty during 
first two games of the NL Championship Series against the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Former New Yorkers are quick to point out that Yankees and Mets  
seats never go wanting during the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playoff games you can't sell out? That's ridiculous!'' Berkley  
said. ``Look at the Mets' fans ... It's pouring down rain and you 
don't see anybody leaving. I honestly think it's a diehard feeling 
for most New Yorkers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And New Yorkers seemed to hold onto that feeling after they  
moved to Dixie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I live here now and I have to live with all these Southerners  
so I'm willing to tell them I'm a Braves fan with my fingers 
crossed,'' said Jim Zito, a 48-year-old Atlanta lawyer from Long 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Zito yearned for a Subway Series, but now says he'll follow his  
8-year-old son's wishes and support the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Atlanta is traditionally a very self-conscious city,''  
he said. ``A lot of people from Atlanta feel as if they've got 
something to prove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when it comes to baseball and New York, they do. The Braves  
and Yankees played in the 1996 World Series, when the Yankees won 
the championship from a Braves team that won the first two games at 
Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 series made Brendan Dunwoody a bit of a celebrity. When  
his Peachtree City elementary school celebrated Braves Spirit Day, 
11-year-old-Brendan was sent home when he defied his teacher's 
instructions and wore his Yankees jersey to class. 
</P>
<P>
	Brendan's parents moved from Queens in 1989, right after he was  
born, but the family packed its Yankees' allegiance along with the 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Oliver, assistant superintendent of the Fayette County  
school system, said Yankee jerseys won't be a problem for any 
students this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm wearing a Yankees shirt tomorrow myself -- no, just  
kidding,'' Oliver said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zito, the lawyer, said he likes being an unabashed Yankee in the  
land of Scarlett O'Hara and Civil War ghosts. But he predicts the 
Bronx Bombers might hear a few heckles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think just having the name Yankees is going to be a sore  
point for a lot of Southerners,'' Zito said. ``Every Southerner at 
heart is still a rebel, and everything north of the Mason-Dixon 
line is a Yankee to them. A damn Yankee, in every sense of the 
word.''

<HEADLINE> Singapore Licenses 4 Foreign Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Four foreign banks received much-coveted  
licenses to open more branches and set up automated teller machines 
in Singapore, The Straits Times reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	They are the Dutch ABN Amro Bank NV, Banque Nationale de Paris,  
U.S.-based Citibank NA and Standard Chartered Bank of Britain, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The licenses were the first new, full-banking permits issued to  
foreign banks in Singapore since 1970. They were granted by the 
Monetary Authority of Singapore, the city-state's de facto central 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks are allowed up to 10 branches or offsite ATMs.  
Qualifying banks also can share ATMs, creating the potential for a 
network to rival those of local banks.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Executes Convicted Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- A man convicted of stabbing his  
ex-girlfriend to death in front of her relatives at a 
church-sponsored car wash was executed by injection early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur M. Boyd Jr., 53, was pronounced dead at 2:18 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
	He was convicted in 1983 of killing Wanda Hartman at the car  
wash sponsored by her church, where her father was a pastor. Her 
mother and 8-year-old daughter were among those who saw the August 
1982 attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hartman was stabbed 37 times in what a federal appeals court  
called a ``brutal and hideous'' attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Boyd and Ms. Hartman lived together for three years before she  
left him. According to court testimony, Boyd argued with Ms. 
Hartman eight days before her murder and told her he would hunt her 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll see me, like a German submarine, when you least expect  
me,'' a witness quoted Boyd as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys claimed the trial judge improperly barred  
testimony about Boyd's background that could have helped in his 
defense.

<HEADLINE> 49ers' Jervey Suspended for Steroids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- San Francisco 49ers running back Travis  
Jervey was suspended for four games by the NFL for violating its 
policy on anabolic steroids and related substances. 
</P>
<P>
	Jervey cannot return to the 49ers until Nov. 22, the day after  
the team plays the St. Louis Rams. He is expected to be out four 
weeks anyway, while recovering from ankle surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL did not specify how Jervey had violated the policy.  
Coach Steve Mariucci also was tight-lipped. 
</P>
<P>
	``He and I spoke, he knows I'm not pleased with the situation,''  
Mariucci said. ``There's really not much to say about it. He feels 
he made a mistake. It's something that occurred a while back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci would not elaborate.  
</P>
<P>
	Jervey, signed in the offseason as a free agent from the Green  
Bay Packers, has played only sparingly with the 49ers this season 
because of complications from a broken left ankle 10 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-year NFL veteran has been inactive for four games  
because of problems with the ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	This past week Jervey underwent surgery to remove calcium  
deposits where the break had occurred and was not expected to play 
for at least four weeks.

<HEADLINE> School Bus Hits Dump Truck in N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CENTRAL BRIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- A bus carrying second-graders to a  
pumpkin hunt collided with a dump truck at a dangerous intersection 
Thursday, injuring 51 youngsters and adults. 
</P>
<P>
	One child was in critical condition, and three youngsters and an  
adult were in serious condition Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus was carrying 44 children, three teachers and four adult  
chaperones from Albany School No. 18 on a field trip to the Pumpkin 
Patch, a popular Halloween spot 30 miles west of Albany. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids are going to be traumatized,'' said Sandra Bowles,  
whose 7-year-old granddaughter escaped serious injury in the crash. 
``They are so young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The empty dump truck, registered to a construction company, was  
pulling a trailer when it struck the back right side of the bus. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus spun 180 degrees and rolled to a rest in grass about 500  
feet from the point of impact. The collision caused the front end 
of the bus to dip onto the pavement, knocking the hood off the 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck was traveling on Route 7, which has a 55 mph speed  
limit. The bus was traveling on Route 30A, which has a 30 mph speed 
limit. At the intersection of the two roads, there is a flashing 
yellow light for traffic on Route 7 and flashing red on Route 30A. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire Chief Eric Johnson called it one of the most dangerous  
intersections in the area, although he said this was the worst 
accident he's seen in his 25 years with the department. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus driver, William J. Treacy, 79, and the truck driver,  
Edward Cook, 52, were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Schoharie County Sheriff John Bates said it did not appear that  
drugs or alcohol were factors in the crash, and no charges were 
filed.

<HEADLINE> Spotty Y2K Record for Chemical Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A check of small and medium-size chemical  
industry firms found that only a small number are prepared for the 
Y2K computer glitch, according to a Texas A&AMP;M University survey. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was cited Thursday by two senators who urged the  
Environmental Protection Agency and the Federal Emergency 
Management Administration to alert state and local emergency 
planning officials to remain vigilant over the New Year's period in 
event of a chemical accident caused by a computer problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the probability of a Y2K-related disruption is low, the  
potential harm even one chemical accident can cause means we must 
be especially vigilant,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd of 
Connecticut, the ranking Democrat on a special Senate committee 
dealing with Y2K. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, the panel's chairman, said individuals  
and communities ``can take reasonable steps'' to prepare for any 
chemical industry Y2K-related problem and that companies and 
community leaders should ``work together to ensure a smooth and 
safe transition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas A&AMP;M survey covered small and medium companies that  
handle, ship or process chemicals. The survey included about 200 
randomly selected companies in New Jersey, California, Kansas and 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey found ``only 13.5 percent indicated they have  
completed their Y2K implementation,'' according to a summary of the 
findings, although 70 percent of the companies reported being 
engaged in Y2K readiness activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also found that 86 percent had not coordinated  
emergency plans with local community officials and nearly eight of 
every 10 companies reported that they had never been surveyed for 
Y2K readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers selected companies with fewer than 200 employees  
and in many cases fewer than 50 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Mayhew, a vice president at the Chemical Manufacturers  
Association, said most of the companies were not association 
members and as far as he knew none was involved in manufacturing 
chemical, but in other areas of the chemical industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayhew said that among the association's members -- mostly large  
chemical manufacturers -- 80 percent of the firms had completed 
their Y2K planning and the rest have reported they would be 
finished by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the largest chemical manufacturers have said they  
planned to shut down some of their operations over the New Year's 
holiday as a precaution against accidents or production foul-ups. 
Among these companies are DuPont, Monsanto, Ashland Chemical and 
Rhone-Poulenc. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Dean, executive director of the Center for Y2K and  
Society, a private advocacy group involved in Y2K issues, said that 
the EPA or FEMA should require chemical facilities to shut down on 
the days immediately before and after Jan. 1 to minimize the risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the survey of small companies, Dodd said that while  
``time is running out ....it's not too late for these firms to act. 
Developing viable Y2K contingency plans in conjunction with state 
and local officials must be a top priority in the chemical 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are an estimated 66,000 sites in the country where  
hazardous chemicals are produced or handled, according to the 
Senate committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Tthe Y2K problem exists because many older computers and  
software programs recognize only the last two digits of the year 
and could mistakenly interpret ``00'' as 1900 on Jan. 1, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Half of U.S. Households Play Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly half of all American households play the  
stock market, but despite all the hype about day trading and online 
transactions, most are long-term investors who rarely call upon a 
broker. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are among the findings of a survey being released today by  
the Investment Company Institute and the Securities Industry 
Association, two trade organizations representing the nation's 
investment companies, securities firms and investment banks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hear a lot about people trading actively -- day trading  
over the Internet -- and that's simply not the case,'' said 
Elizabeth Powell, a spokeswoman for ICI. ``Most people are saving 
for retirement, and presumably, we can expect that trend to 
continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Powell said the study was the first to take such a detailed look  
at the habits of small-time, individual investors. Through random 
phone interviews with 4,842 people, the survey found that the 
typical stock owner is 47 years old, married, has a household 
income of $60,000 -- and generally subscribes to the 
``buy-and-hold'' investment strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	The average investor also considers himself market-savvy,  
although he may have no formal background in finance or business. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 49.2 million U.S. households, or 48 percent, own  
equities either individually or through mutual funds, according to 
the study. And those numbers have steadily been on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, only 32.5 percent of U.S. households held stock, Powell  
said. By 1992 that number had increased to 36.3 percent. And it 
approached 41 percent by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Powell said more people have been drawn to the market because  
they can get bigger returns for their investment in stocks than 
they can elsewhere. Declining interest rates, on a relative basis, 
have only added to the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Others have turned to 401(k) retirement plans, which are  
increasingly being offered by employers and may be some workers 
sole retirement benefit as pensions become less common. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of all, investing is easier now that was 10 years ago, with  
countless magazines pumping out advice and investment companies 
offering toll-free, 24-hour service, Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the high tech access, most individual investors do it  
the old fashioned way -- just sit and wait. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the study, only 11 percent of all stock owners  
conducted transactions over the Internet, and most hadn't bought or 
sold a single stock during all of 1998, the year examined. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, which has a 2 percentage point margin of error,  
found that 48 percent of all stock owners are between the ages of 
36 and 54, 32 percent are older than 55 and 19 percent are between 
the ages of 19 and 35.

<HEADLINE> Police Nab Suspected IRA Dissidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Anti-terrorist police arrested 10  
suspected Irish Republican Army dissidents and found assault 
weapons inside a hidden, underground firing range north of Dublin, 
authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Those arrested in the late Wednesday raid ranged in age from 14  
to 45 and came from Dublin, the Irish Republic border town of 
Dundalk and the hard-line border region of South Armagh in 
British-ruled Northern Ireland, said police spokesman John 
Farrelly. 
</P>
<P>
	Those three cities have been recruiting grounds for an IRA  
dissident group dubbed the Real IRA, which has been under police 
surveillance in the Irish Republic for the past year. The 
dissidents seek to undermine the July 1997 cease-fire being 
observed by most IRA members. 
</P>
<P>
	The Real IRA called its own cease-fire 13 months ago after  
killing 29 people in the town of Omagh -- the deadliest terrorist 
attack ever committed in Northern Ireland. But police have been 
predicting that the group will resume its attacks in response to 
the political stalemate over Northern Ireland's Good Friday peace 
accord of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have little doubt that they are currently planning a  
terrorist attack,'' Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan, commander of 
Northern Ireland's police force, told the British Broadcasting 
Corp. on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the raid on the firing range, police seized a Kalashnikov  
assault rifle, a heavy-duty machine gun and a revolver. The bunker 
appeared originally to have been a wine cellar beneath an isolated 
cottage that was demolished long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspects can be interrogated for up to 72 hours before being  
charged or freed. 
</P>
<P>
	Former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell, who led the negotiations that  
produced the peace accord, has been trying for two months to 
kickstart the agreement by charting a compromise path between the 
IRA-linked Sinn Fein party and Northern Ireland's major pro-British 
Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants in this week's negotiations say Sinn Fein still  
refuses to give an assurance that the IRA will gradually disarm. 
Without such a commitment, the Ulster Unionists refuse to form a 
new Protestant-Catholic government for Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	The government should have been formed by last November.  
</P>
<P>
	In New York City, Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-linked Sinn  
Fein party, told supporters at a fund-raiser to be prepared for the 
peacemaking effort to fail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think on balance that the Mitchell review will probably not  
succeed,'' Adams said.

<HEADLINE> Former DEA Agent Gets 15 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A former Drug Enforcement  
Administration agent has been given the maximum sentence of 15 
years in prison for shooting his partner while in a drunken stupor. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Fekete, 57, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the  
shooting of Shaun Curl, was also sentenced to 15 years of 
probation, random drug testing and counseling. He must write a 
letter every year on the anniversary of Curl's death, explaining 
what happened and apologizing to Curl's family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Paul Backman blamed Fekete's friends and  
colleagues for failing to take appropriate action to prevent the 
tragedy on Dec. 12, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it wasn't Shaun, it would've been somebody else. Mr. Fekete  
was a time bomb waiting to explode,'' Backman said Thursday. ``It's 
a travesty that the friends of Mr. Fekete, both within the agency 
and outside the agency, never stepped in to stop him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An undercover DEA agent testified that Fekete had got drunk at a  
Metro-Dade Police Christmas party and had to be helped to the car. 
Curl, 39, was driving Fekete to his home when Fekete pulled his gun 
and shot him several times in the head and chest. 
</P>
<P>
	A psychologist, a psychiatrist and a neuro-psychologist  
testified that Fekete was having an alcohol-induced psychotic 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuro-psychologist Dr. Jorge Herrera testified that in 1993,  
Fekete suffered brain damage when he fell and hit the back of his 
head on a metal deck. He was advised not to drink, because alcohol 
combined with a brain injury can trigger violent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987 Fekete killed a knife-wielding man at a bar in  
Philadelphia. He was working undercover at the time and had been 
drinking for four hours.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Off 94.67 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks wobbled to a mixed finish on Wall Street  
Thursday, rebounding from steep losses wrought by IBM's warning 
that worries about the Year 2000 computer bug are hurting hardware 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average ended with a loss of 94.67 at  
10,297.69. Earlier in the session, the Dow had dipped 213 points. 
IBM accounted for nearly all of the decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators rallied late in the day and ended  
mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 5.82 to 1,283.61, and the 
Nasdaq composite index rose 13.82 to 2,801.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks plunged at the start of trading in a selloff attributed  
almost entirely to IBM's disappointing forecast. The company said 
after the close of trading Wednesday that potential buyers of IBM's 
network and database servers are postponing purchases until after 
the start of the new year, when concerns over Year 2000 computer 
bugs are fully resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from IBM's network and database business dropped 40  
percent in the third quarter, and the weakness is expected to 
continue through the fourth quarter and into January, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of IBM plummeted 16 to 91.  
</P>
<P>
	IBM's news robbed the market of the ebullience that drove the  
Dow 187.43 points higher and the Nasdaq 99.95 points higher on 
Wednesday. That rally was sparked nearly entirely by Microsoft, 
which released earnings that soundly beat expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft officials attributed the company's strong earnings and  
sales to ``awesome'' demand for personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as it was all about Microsoft yesterday, it's all about  
IBM today,'' said Larry Wachtel, a market analyst with Prudential 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's decline set off a slide in a wide range of technology  
stocks. Sun Microsystems, a maker of computer servers, fell 3 7/16 
to 92 7/8. Computer Associates, a major maker of software used to run 
computer systems, fell 5 3/8 to 52 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a long food chain involved with IBM, and they're all  
down because of IBM's problems,'' Wachtel said. 
</P>
<P>
	But by midafternoon, investors had begun snapping up technology  
stocks at relative bargains. Also, investors turned their attention 
toward good news in the technology sector, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online rose 4 1/4 to 122 1/4 after announcing late Wednesday  
that earnings in its fiscal first quarter tripled from the same 
period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL also announced a deal to have its Internet software loaded  
onto computers sold by Gateway, the country's largest direct seller 
of consumer PCs. AOL will invest $800 million over two years in 
Gateway, which soared 10 1/2 to 62 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco stocks fell after an appeals court ruled Wednesday that  
a lump sum payment may be awarded to plaintiffs in a landmark suit 
against the major tobacco companies. Lawyers for cigarette makers 
say the payment could cripple the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component Philip Morris fell 3 3/8 to 23 5/8. Without IBM and  
Philip Morris, the Dow would have finished with a gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Two separate economic reports stoked fears that the Federal  
Reserve will raise interest rates later this year in its effort to 
slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported 298,000 Americans filed new  
jobless claims for the week ending Oct. 16, up 9,000 from the 
previous week. Even with the increase, the number of newly laid off 
workers remains at historically low levels. Economists say tight 
labor markets could lead to rising wage demands and higher 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, a survey released by the Federal Reserve Bank of  
Philadelphia showed prices paid by Philadelphia-area factories for 
raw materials rose sharply in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices tumbled, sending the yield on the 30-year Treasury  
bond to 6.35 percent, from 6.33 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is, bond prices still don't look like they've hit  
bottom, and until they do, it will be tough for stocks to rally,'' 
said Steven Goldman, market strategist at Weeden &AMP; Co. in 
Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. NYSE volume totaled 984.66 million shares, 
compared with 917.51 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.33 to 414.27.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.5 percent.  
Germany's DAX index fell 0.9 percent and Britain's FT-SE 100 lost 
1.1 percent. France's CAC-40 closed with a gain of 0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Knight Cited in Hunting Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOONER, Wis. (AP) -- Bob Knight, Indiana's basketball coach,  
will be cited for failure to report a hunting accident and for 
hunting without a license after he accidentally shot a friend while 
hunting grouse, the state Department of Natural Resources said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, two companions and Thomas Mikunda, 49, of Exeland, a  
longtime friend, were hunting Oct. 12 in southern Sawyer County 
when a grouse flushed, said Dave Zeug, law enforcement director for 
the DNR's northern region in Spooner. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight told investigators as he turned to aim at the bird, his  
finger slipped off the shotgun's safety and hit the trigger, 
accidentally firing the gun before he was ready to shoot, Zeug 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shotgun pellets struck Mikunda in the back and upper shoulder.  
The wounds were not life-threatening but required medical 
attention, Zeug said. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident was not properly reported to authorities as  
required by state law, Zeug said. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNR also determined Knight did not have a $43 nonresident  
small game license and that he had hunted before in Wisconsin 
without one, Zeug said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fine for each of the three citations to be issued to Knight  
is $165. Zeug said the DNR will mail Knight the citations. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight told investigators he didn't think he needed the license  
to hunt on private property, Zeug said. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, who is an avid hunter, did not immediately return a  
message to The Associated Press left at his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Kit Klingelhoffer, sports information director at Indiana,  
declined immediate comment today on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Homuth, a policy officer for the DNR, said state law  
requires all hunting accidents where someone is injured or killed 
to be reported to the county sheriff or police authorities with 
jurisdiction over property where the shooting occurred. Those 
authorities then alert the DNR, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors also are required to report all gunshot wounds that they  
treat, Homuth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zeug said he did not have all the details of how the proper  
authorities eventually learned of the hunting accident involving 
Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, 59, has led the Hoosiers to 10 Big Ten championships,  
five Final Four appearances and three NCAA championships.

<HEADLINE> Congress May Revive Cleanup Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taxes on oil and chemicals that lapsed in 1995  
could be revived if Congress approves legislation designed to 
overhaul Superfund, the federal program that cleans up hazardous 
waste sites. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., is attempting to blend  
together two bills that would cut down on lawsuit costs, remove 
barriers to redevelopment of old industrial sites and protect 
innocent businesses from getting tangled in litigation or 
unwarranted cleanup costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Many business organizations support the reforms, which also have  
backing from both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill. But 
other influential corporate groups and the House Ways and Means 
Committee chairman, Rep. Bill Archer, oppose resurrecting the 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics say the opposition by Archer, a Republican from  
Houston, is aimed at protecting Texas oil and gas interests. But 
Archer said in an interview Thursday that he does not believe any 
industry should be singled out with a tax to resolve a waste 
problem unless it was directly to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a question of what's right and what's wrong,'' Archer  
said. ``I would oppose this if it were levied against the steel 
industry or the electronics industry, if they were not involved in 
the creation of the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many corporate groups side with Archer on the taxes but favor  
the proposed Superfund reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to see a bill get through, but that does not  
include the tax,'' said Mark Whitenton, a vice president at the 
National Association of Manufacturers. ``It has never made much 
sense, except that it was a convenient source of revenue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But others say the costs should not be borne by the taxpayers.  
President Clinton proposed reviving the $1.5 billion tax in his 
fiscal 2000 budget and repeatedly has called on Congress to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't reinstate the taxes, what you're doing is  
shifting billions of dollars from polluters to the public,'' said 
Karen Florini, senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund. 
``These industries have a closer connection to the dump sites than 
the general public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The excise taxes on oil and chemicals were imposed when  
Superfund was created in 1980, but they were allowed to expire in 
1995 -- saving the affected industries some $6 billion over the last 
four years. Enough money has been shifted into Superfund to keep it 
operating through 2002, including $700 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	A leading Republican congressman on environmental issues, Rep.  
Sherwood Boehlert of New York, said the tax should be reinstated to 
ensure Superfund can finish the hazardous site cleanup job -- and 
then slowly phased out over eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to complete the program,'' said Boehlert, sponsor of  
one reform bill. ``I'm not excited about any taxes. But it's the 
responsible thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A main sponsor of the other Superfund bill, GOP Rep. Michael  
Oxley of Ohio, said many business groups are willing to accept the 
tax to get the reforms, particularly small businesses that are 
often roped into huge Superfund cleanups simply because they shared 
a landfill where hazardous wastes were dumped. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like a reasonable tradeoff,'' Oxley said.  
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting this week, Hastert urged Oxley, Boehlert and others  
involved in the issue to put the two bills together and then 
present them to Archer's committee for a decision on reinstating 
the tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to reconcile some of the differences ... so that is  
the first step,'' Hastert said Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Strike Threat Causes Panic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAIPAHU, Hawaii (AP) -- Hawaiians are stripping store shelves of  
rice, Spam, toilet paper and other items for fear of a dockworkers 
strike that could cripple a state that gets 90 percent of 
everything via ship. 
</P>
<P>
	The 507 members of the International Longshore and Warehouse  
Union Local 142 are demanding a new contract with the state's four 
major shipping companies. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, dockworkers on the islands of Kauai, Maui and Hawaii  
have authorized a strike. The Oahu members, by far the local's 
largest contingent, vote Friday. Union leaders could call a strike 
any time after that. 
</P>
<P>
	If the dockworkers strike, ships that arrive in Hawaii will sit  
in port without being unloaded. And if the walkout drags on, 
shipping companies will stop sending vessels on the five-day 
journey from the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the voting started, residents have swamped Hawaii  
supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got us by the throat,'' said Shirley Oshiro, 61, a  
retired schoolteacher who found rice but no toilet paper. ``It's 
like we're getting ready for a hurricane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gina Agpaoa went to the Sam's Club warehouse to stock up but  
found bare shelves. Rice and toilet paper were long gone, and 
gallons of milk were going fast. She grabbed Spam and Vienna 
Sausages. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wal-Mart in Hilo limited customers to 24 rolls of toilet  
paper, one bag of rice, two bags of disposable diapers and six cans 
of infant formula. ``We're trying to make sure as many people as 
possible get the supplies they need,'' assistant manager Seni 
Kaseli said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii's docks shut down for five months in 1949 and 100 days in  
1971 because of a West Coast strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The dockworkers union wants a contract similar to the  
three-year, 8 percent wage increase West Coast stevedores received 
this summer. Contract talks are set to resume Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not expecting a strike,'' said Paul Stevens, senior  
vice president for Matson Navigation Co., whose subsidiary, Matson 
Terminals Inc., is one of the four shipping companies involved. 
``We want to keep the commerce to Hawaii flowing. We're not digging 
in here at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union local President Eusebio Lapenia also sounded optimistic.  
``Don't panic,'' he said. ``We're going to give it our honest 
effort to try to come to some kind of agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But because of a work slowdown at the docks last week, there is  
already a backlog at the harbor, with four ships sitting unloaded. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike threat comes just as the islands are recovering from  
a nine-year economic slump. Tourism is up, as are real estate sales 
and construction. 
</P>
<P>
	``A whole lot of things are finally moving in the right  
direction,'' said Michael Sklarz, an economist who is chairman of 
the state Council on Revenues. ``You can't say anything positive 
about a strike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The effects of the hoarding alone could be far-reaching. The Ala  
Moana Shopping Center and its 200-plus tenants on the outskirts of 
Waikiki will have to close if the mall can't enough toilet paper 
and cleaning supplies to meet health codes, general manager Dwight 
Yoshimura said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, people like Althea Kahai are preparing for life  
without rice. ``There's always potatoes or poi,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Sink; Coffee Falls  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Soybean futures plummeted to their lowest closing level in a  
month Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade as rain brought 
much-needed moisture to parched growing areas of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's weather also influenced another commodity, sending  
coffee futures falling by 5 percent. Elsewhere, natural gas prices 
rose sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	After a poor showing on Wednesday, soybean prices slid further  
Thursday due to a combination of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The market plunged immediately lower after weekly export sales  
were reported to be less than anticipated -- 732,000 tons, down 35 
percent from last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasts for rain in northern Brazil, which have rocked the  
soybean market periodically this month, sent the price spiraling 
further. 
</P>
<P>
	Meteorologists said top soybean-growing states in the north  
would receive rain Thursday and again this weekend, helping to 
relieve low soil moisture which has delayed spring planting. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts also suggested that traders with long positions,  
obligating them to take delivery, were bailing out on the eve of 
the expiration of the November soybeans contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans for November delivery fell 8 1/4 cents to $4.79 3/4 cents a  
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rain in northern Brazil was the fundamental reason for today's  
decline, but the real reason was technical,'' said Anne Frick, 
oilseeds analyst for Prudential Securities Corp. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, she said, funds may have tired of waiting for  
prices to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``This market has made no headway to the upside since Sept. 7,''  
when November soybeans reached $5.21 1/4 a bushel, she said. ``Some of 
those people holding technically inspired long positions may be 
throwing in the towel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Koch, an analyst for the Stewart-Peterson Group in West  
Bend, Wis., agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of speculative buying that has been trickling into the  
market for the past two weeks came out very aggressively in the 
last two sessions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures lurched lower after a report by Salomon Smith  
Barney that said the worst of the Brazilian drought is over in 
coffee-producing regions. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said enough rain had fallen in the previous 48 hours  
to help the coffee trees recover from the extended dryness. 
</P>
<P>
	December coffee fell 4.80 cents to 90.60 cents a pound on New  
York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures gained  
by 3 percent after an American Gas Association report that said 
U.S. supplies rose less than expected last week, signaling a 
tightening market for natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Also influencing the price were forecasts for  
cooler-than-average weather this weekend, which could jump-start 
the heating season. 
</P>
<P>
	November natural gas rose 9.6 cents to $3.064 per million  
British thermal units. 
</P>
<P>
	Other energy futures also were higher. December crude rose 13  
cents to $22.61 a barrel; November heating oil rose .30 cent to 
58.99 cents a gallon; November unleaded gasoline rose .12 cent to 
63.98 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent crude rose 24 cents to $22.11 a  
gallon on the International Petroleum Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Presses Halted on New Bush Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- St. Martin's Press said Thursday that it has  
suspended publication of a new book about Republican presidential 
candidate and Texas Gov. George W. Bush after questions were raised 
about the author's background. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News reported this week that J.H. Hatfield,  
author of ``Fortunate Son,'' was paroled from a Texas prison in 
1993 after serving time for a felony conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield told the newspaper it was a case of mistaken identity.  
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Thursday, St. Martin's press said it had stopped  
all sales, promotion and other publishing activities for the book 
and was notifying booksellers. 
</P>
<P>
	The book alleges that Bush was arrested for cocaine possession  
in 1972 but the matter was dropped after he performed community 
service arranged by his father, former President Bush. The 
allegations are based on anonymous sources. The book is at odds 
with other accounts of Bush's life and the Texas court system.

ripped up trees and utility poles on ritzy St. Barts and sleepy 
Anguilla, but forecasters said it could weaken to a tropical storm 
as it veers north out of the Caribbean this afternoon. In Puerto 
Rico, many of the 350 people who sought refuge in shelters last

	Bradley Offers Youth Poverty Plan  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Calling child poverty a hidden, ``slow-motion  
national disaster,'' Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley 
offered a $9.8 billion prescription today to lift family incomes 
through automatic, annual increases in the minimum wage and 
expanded tax credits and child care subsidies. He also proposed new 
government programs to recruit 60,000 teachers into poor school 
districts and give children an after-hours school hangout seven 
days a week. An estimated 13.5 million American children live in 
poverty, defined as a yearly income of $16,400 or less for a family 
of four.

attend college and delay having children, according to a new study 
released today. Researchers believe their results are the first to 
link definitively high-quality child care, beginning as early as 6 
weeks of age, with a better adult life. The project tracked 111 
children from infancy through age 21, beginning in 1972. Research 
was conducted at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the 
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

country's history. ``I thank God for this, and I will do my best 
for the republic of Indonesia,'' Megawati said, as a crowd of 
legislators burst into cheers and sang the national anthem. The 
vote in the People's Consultative Assembly was 396 for Megawati and 
284 for the leader of the Muslim United Development Party, Hamzah 
Haz. For the first time in days, not a single protest was reported 
in the capital, Jakarta.

newspapers reported today. The attorney general's office in the 
southern state reported that 700 aid packages were stolen early

Police can send people to labor camps for up to three years without

Sept. 10 for smashing his wife's car with a shovel during an 
argument. Superior Court Judge Dale Fischer sentenced Brown to 
three years' probation, to attend a domestic violence counseling 
program and to complete 400 hours of community service. Brown is to 
appear in court today to prove he has enrolled in the counseling 
and community service programs.

other parts of the city. A Chechen official said 118 people were

trees are under attack from two types of beetles: the Western oak 
bark beetle, which burrows under the bark until it falls off, and 
the oak ambrosia beetle, which tunnels into the wood and deposits a 
fungus that clogs the trees' circulation. The theory is that the 
tan oaks were somehow weakened by drought and El Nino and developed 
some kind of disease. Beetles then preyed on the weakened tan oaks, 
and eventually spread to the live oaks.

<HEADLINE> Maryland Man Sentenced for Killing Girl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- A Maryland man was sentenced to 30 years  
in prison Wednesday for the murder 13 years ago of a young girl 
whose body has never been found. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-year-old Michele Dorr was last seen outside her father's  
Silver Spring, Md. home on May 31, 1986. Police believe she walked 
to a nearby home to play with a 5-year-old friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contended during the trial that Hadden Clark  
encountered the girl playing at his brother's house and slashed her 
to death. Clark, 47, was convicted Monday of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors said Clark buried the girl's body in a Cape Cod,  
Mass., cemetery, then dug it up on Halloween in 1992. But they have 
been unable to find it, despite years of questioning people and 
searching sites up the East Coast to Rhode Island and 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark pleaded guilty in 1993 to the murder of a 23-year-old  
Bethesda, Md., woman and is serving a 30-year sentence for that. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland District Court Judge Michael D. Mason cited ``the  
denial of the ability of the parents to bury the child'' as a 
factor in imposing a sentence that will not begin until Clark 
completes the previous 30-year term and a separate 10-year sentence 
for a theft charge tried earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mason urged Clark to tell where the little girl was buried, but  
prosecutors and family members expressed little hope that would 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendant did not testify during the trial and made no  
statement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went through great pains to cover it up, and has no  
remorse,'' said Carl Dorr, Michele's father. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Clark had told them during questioning that ``I  
blacked out, and I might have done something to her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys cited their unsuccessful effort to suppress a  
videotape of the police interview with Clark as one of several 
possible grounds for appeal. During the four-hour tape, a 
sometimes-nervous Clark said he suffered frequent blackouts. He 
said he slept in the Cape Cod cemetery near his father's grave on 
Halloween 1992.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Band Cancels Miami-Area Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Cuban musical group the Buena Vista Social Club  
canceled a concert in Miami Beach, citing the recent furor over a 
show by another well-known Cuban group, Los Van Van. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Debbie Ohanian said Wednesday that the agent for the  
group had canceled a Feb. 11 concert at the Jackie Gleason Theater 
in Miami Beach. The band, which won a Grammy last year for their 
recording with American roots musician Ry Cooder, has some of 
Cuba's most-heralded musicians. 
</P>
<P>
	When Los Van Van performed at the Miami Arena on Oct. 9,  
thousands of protesters yelled insults and pitched bottles at 
concertgoers. Eleven people were arrested. Protesters, mostly Cuban 
exiles, argue that Cuban artists who perform in the United States 
bolster Fidel Castro's government. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-Dade County's mayor and some city officials have said they  
oppose having Los Van Van perform in Miami again, claiming the 
band's return is meant to provoke Cuban exiles and is a threat to 
public safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Buena Vista Social Club is on a U.S. tour that has sold out  
venues across the country. But Ohanian said the band won't be 
coming to Miami Beach because its U.S. agent fears for the 
musicians' safety. She said she was unable to convince the agent 
that a venue in another South Florida city would be an acceptable 
alternative.

<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Third-quarter profits rose 36 percent  
at Nokia OY as demand for the company's mobile phones drove a 49 
percent jump in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finnish company earned 638 million euros ($686 million), or  
0.56 euros a share, an increase from 464 million euros, or O.41 
euros a share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-quarter sales totaled 5.04 billion euros ($5.35 billion),  
up from 3.38 billion euros a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobile phone sales rose 58 percent to 3.44 billion euros, while  
the network equipment unit generated revenues of 1.44 billion 
euros, up 38.5 percent from the third quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive Jorma Ollila predicted that sales for the whole  
year will increase by more than 40 percent at Nokia, the world's 
top supplier of wireless phones.

<HEADLINE> Philips Electronics Profits Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Royal Philips Electronics's profit  
leapt 92 percent in the third quarter, led by strong performances 
in its consumer products and components divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips earned 372 million euros, or $394 million, in the  
July-September period, up from 193 million euros in the same period 
in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to 7.74 billion euros from 7.32 billion euros a  
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips said its semiconductor division is gathering strength,  
with margins improving, though sales were down by 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The results benefited by comparison with the third quarter of  
1998, when its consumer communications unit suffered heavy losses 
in a joint venture with U.S.-based Lucent Technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips said it intends to meet its double-digit growth targets  
for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month income from operations was 1.12 billion euros, or  
$1.18 billion, up 32 percent from 849 million euros a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economic environment in Europe and the Asian Pacific is  
improving and compares favorably with the second half of 1998,'' 
Philips said in a statement. ``Our objective to grow this year's 
earnings from continuing operations with double digits stays 
firm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philips' third-quarter results were at the high end of the range  
of analysts' expectations. Its shares rose sharply on news of the 
earnings, up 5 percent in early trading on the Amsterdam Stock 
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> House Rejects School Voucher Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Moderate Republicans today rejected a voucher  
plan for private schools that could have lead to the defeat of 
larger legislation on education programs for poor students. 
</P>
<P>
	Overriding the wishes of the House leadership, more than 50  
Republicans sided with Democrats today to reject the plan, which 
would have given poor students private school vouchers for $3,500 
if their public schools were failing academically or deemed unsafe. 
The vote was 257-166. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate Republican-backed bill was also floundering today.  
Conservatives joined moderates in backing away from a proposal that 
would give states more freedom in complying with Title I and other 
federal school programs. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has vowed to veto the bill -- The Academic  
Achievement for All Act, or Straight A's -- saying it would turn 
federal education programs into a lump sum that states could invest 
in children who are neither poor nor low-achieving. 
</P>
<P>
	Moderates who voted for the plan in committee now want it  
limited to 10 to 12 states in a pilot program. Such a compromise 
could siphon conservative votes; and Democrats won't support it 
either way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we should pick and choose,'' said Rep. J.C.  
Watts, R-Okla., who held a news conference to boost the program. He 
acknowledged that the pilot program was on the table but would not 
speculate on any votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, touted his voucher  
plan on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can we not stop for a moment and say no child should be  
trapped and ... have as the only alternative to stay in a school 
that is a failure,'' said Armey, a Texas Republican, who added that 
more than 100 schools have been on the Education Department's list 
of troubled schools for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Those arguments haven't swayed moderates who want to keep  
private school choice out of the $8 billion Title I program, which 
is designed to boost the academic achievement of poor children. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee  
planned to oppose the provision. ``The main focus of this program 
is to improve Title I,'' said Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., a 
former school superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans split on a smaller issue as the House ended the  
first day of debate Wednesday by voting to keep a Democrat-backed 
gender equity program in the Title I bill. 
</P>
<P>
	After several speeches by many female lawmakers, more than 100  
Republicans joined the Democrats in restoring the $3 million 
program, which provides teachers and others information on ways to 
encourage girls to participate in science and math classes 
dominated by boys. It was cut by Republican critics on the 
education committee who argued that girls often do better in their 
studies and don't need special attention over boys. 
</P>
<P>
	In the larger debate over Title I, Democrats sought to further  
target funding so it goes to the poorest of the nation's 50,000 
schools. Republicans want more flexibility for schools complaining 
of cumbersome federal rules and paperwork associated with a program 
that accounts for less than 10 percent of their total budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	The developments came as the House debated the renewal of an  
$8.3 billion federal education bill that governs programs for 
nearly 11 million of the nation's impoverished and failing 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is considering modest changes to Title I, the  
34-year-old law designed to raise the historically low achievement 
of poor children. After Title I's last overhaul in 1994, it became 
a high standards program, shifting from its remedial focus. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill number is H.R. 2.

<HEADLINE> Desperate Sabres Shake Things Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres are still without a  
victory and goaltender Dominik Hasek is without a starting job -- at 
least for now. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres sent their struggling goaltender to the bench after  
one period in a loss to the Nashville Predators and have decided to 
leave him there awhile. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-string goalie Martin Biron will start against Carolina on  
Friday as the desperate Sabres try to stave off the worst start in 
team history. 
</P>
<P>
	How long Hasek remains idle depends on 22-year-old Biron.  
</P>
<P>
	``If Marty plays unbelievable and wins games, he's going to  
play,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said Thursday. ``That turns up the 
competition level, too. The team needs that fire right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek admitted he was lacking intensity after he allowed two  
goals in the first period including one at 46 seconds in a 4-3 loss 
to the Predators on Wednesday night. Backup Dwayne Roloson gave up 
two more goals in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just doesn't seem that our goaltenders are on top of their  
game,'' Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek vowed to work hard to win his job back and end his slump.  
``I have to solve it,'' he said. ``I have to play better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres called up Biron from the team's AHL affiliate in  
Rochester, N.Y., where he has won all six of his starts this 
season. ``I was surprised and happy at the same time,'' Biron said. 
</P>
<P>
	The wiry and acrobatic Biron, a Hasek clone in appearance and  
style of play, had a 1-2-1 record and a 2.14 goals-against average 
in six appearances with the Sabres last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is getting out of hand,'' defenseman Jason Woolley said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres are 0-5-2, the longest a Buffalo team has gone  
without a victory at the start of a season since the 1990-91 Sabres 
went 0-4-3. Another loss would set a franchise record for games 
played without a first victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a distinction that we really don't want to be  
associated with,'' Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, who announced in the offseason that he will retire at the  
end of the season and move back to his native Czech Republic, 
appears to have run out of enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff is running low on patience with his goaltender, a two-time  
league MVP who won the Olympic gold medal in 1998 and has been 
voted the NHL's top goaltender five of the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he's focused he gets himself in a zone,'' Ruff said. ``We  
haven't seen that zone yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In six appearances Hasek is 0-3-1 with a 3.04 goals-against  
average and 15 goals allowed. His .911 save percentage pales next 
to last year's .937, the best of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been times in and out of games where you've seen those  
incredible saves and it seems like he's not going to get beat, but 
he hasn't really put it together for a full 60 minutes,'' Ruff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres are running out of patience.  
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a message being sent here, it's being sent not just  
to the goalie but to all of us,'' Woolley said. ``All of our jobs 
are in jeopardy here -- the players, the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Changing the goalie is the biggest move you can make on a  
team. We'll see if it works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are other ailments besides the goaltending. The team is  
averaging 2.1 goals per game; the potent line of Michael Peca, 
Dixon Ward and Vaclav Varada is still looking for its first goal of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres started training camp without five holdouts including  
last season's leading scorer, Miroslav Satan. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's no excuse anymore,'' Woolley said. ``We've run out of  
excuses. We have to win Friday.''

<HEADLINE> La Nina Reappears in Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The Pacific Ocean phenomenon La Nina has  
reappeared, prompting forecasts for a wet winter across the 
Northwest, and a dry one in the Southwest, NASA scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather-altering pattern had appeared to all but vanish this  
summer. But a U.S.-French satellite monitoring sea surface height 
and temperature earlier this month detected a pool of unusually 
cool water marked by lower-than-normal sea levels in the eastern 
North Pacific, and warm water in the western and mid-latitude 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those conditions will have a powerful impact on the weather  
system delivering jet streams out of the North Pacific,'' said 
oceanographer William Patzert of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	La Nina is characterized by unusually cold sea-surface  
temperatures in the eastern and central equatorial Pacific, which 
trigger atmospheric patterns that influence weather around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's La Nina contributed to a series of huge storms that  
blasted Washington, Oregon and northern California with 
hurricane-force winds, heavy rains and mountain snows, and powerful 
storms elsewhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Patzert called conditions ``ripe'' for a stormy winter in the  
Pacific Northwest and a relatively dry winter in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, these unusual conditions, which have persisted for 2 1/2  
years, will not be returning to normal anytime soon,'' Patzert 
said. ``This climate imbalance is big and we're definitely going 
through a decade of wild, climatic behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last winter's La Nina followed the historic 1997-98 El Nino,  
which was blamed for heavy snow in the West, massive flooding in 
Africa and drought in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Senate Supports Abortion Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A narrow majority of the Senate voiced support  
today for the 1973 Supreme Court decision to legalize abortion. The 
vote was non-binding, but supporters said it would be used in the 
2000 elections against senators who voted the other way. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is now clear what the true agenda of the anti-choice  
members ... really is,'' Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said, minutes 
after an attempt to kill his non-binding resolution failed, 51-48. 
``They want to criminalize choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin said the resolution, an amendment to another bill, would  
be a key weapon during next year's campaigns, when a third of the 
Senate will be up for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
	But the sponsor of the main bill up for debate, which would ban  
certain late-term abortions, said Democrats were just trying to 
``change the subject'' from the specific type of procedure targeted 
by his bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about abortion, this is about where we draw the  
line between who's protected and who's not,'' said the sponsor, 
Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-five of the Senate's 54 Republicans voted to kill Harkin's  
non-binding amendment, which reads: ``It is the sense of the 
Congress that Roe v. Wade was an appropriate decision and secures 
an important constitutional right and such a decision should not be 
overturned.'' They were joined by two Democrats, Sens. John Breaux 
of Louisiana and Harry Reid of Nevada. Sen. Bob Smith of New 
Hampshire, an independent, also voted against the resolution. And 
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who was campaigning for president in New 
Hampshire Thursday, did not vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight Republicans joined 43 Democrats in support of the  
resolution. The Republicans are Sens. John Chaffee of Rhode Island, 
Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado, Susan Collins of Maine, James 
Jeffords of Vermont, Olympia Snowe of Maine, Arlen Specter of 
Pennsylvania, Ted Stevens of Alaska and John Warner of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate then voted to formally pass Harkin's amendment, with  
one less vote against it. Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., was absent. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes on the amendment were the latest development in the  
Senate's debate over a bill that would ban some late-term 
abortions, the third time in four years the issue has come before 
Congress. It is headed for the same outcome: a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents today condemned the main legislation as  
unconstitutional and designed to boost GOP election prospects next 
year at the expense of pregnant women whose lives and health are in 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the third time the president will veto this bill,''  
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif, said Wednesday. ``Why go through this 
if not for politics?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House issued a statement Wednesday saying the bill  
``contains the same serious flaws'' as the bills Clinton vetoed in 
1996 and 1997, and that the president will veto this one as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum said unborn children deserved another attack on a  
medical practice that brutalizes ``the most vulnerable members of 
our society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about infanticide,'' Santorum said from the Senate  
floor. ``This is a baby who is all but born and then killed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a replay of previous debates over similar bills since 1995,  
two presidential vetoes and two failed override attempts, 
Wednesday's debate almost immediately degenerated into an argument 
over the definitions of viable life and when a fetus should be 
considered born. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure in question involves the partial, feet-first  
delivery of a fetus and the draining of its skull contents. 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum's bill, the ``Partial Birth Abortion Act of 1999,''  
would make it a felony punishable by a fine and/or a two-year 
prison term unless the procedure is ``necessary to save the life of 
a mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, illness 
or injury.'' The mother could not be prosecuted under the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, the legislation provides for lawsuits against the  
physician by the father of the fetus and by the mother's parents, 
in certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate on Wednesday rejected 61-38 an alternative, sponsored  
by Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., that would have stopped all abortions 
after fetuses can survive outside the womb, except in cases where 
two independent doctors certify a woman's life was at risk or she 
faced ``grievous injury'' to physical health. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said the proposal was a broadly worded attempt to  
permit abortions in almost all cases because pregnancy easily can 
be considered a threat to a woman's health. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 1692.

<HEADLINE> S.C. NAACP Pres. Holds on Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The South Carolina NAACP chapter is not  
stepping up the boycott of its home state, but its president 
promised it would not meet again at home until the Confederate 
battle flag atop the Statehouse comes down. 
</P>
<P>
	The boycott over the flag, called by the National Association  
for the Advancement of Colored People this summer, has so far 
persuaded more than 40 groups nationwide to cancel plans to come to 
South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	State leaders of the civil rights group have raised the  
possibility of extending the boycott to South Carolina products 
such as such as BMW cars and Michelin tires. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the start of the three-day conference of the state  
chapter, held across the border in North Carolina, state president 
James Gallman would only say that step might be discussed. He did 
not mention the boycott in his opening remarks, and said the 
meeting wouldn't focus on the flag. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the state chapter hopes to return to the Palmetto State  
for future meetings. ``But as long as South Carolina continues to 
disrespect our people by waving the flag on the state Capitol, 
we'll be forced to meet away from our home,'' he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP considers the flag a symbol of slavery and racism;  
supporters say it represents South Carolina's heritage and honors 
its war veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina, the only state to fly the Confederate battle  
flag over its Statehouse, first raised the flag in 1962 to 
commemorate the Civil War's centennial. Critics say it was actually 
a swipe at the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wall is up until South Carolina stops flying the flag of  
slavery,'' said Nelson Rivers III, NAACP national field operations 
director and former state chairman. ``If it takes a year, we'll be 
pleased. If it takes 10 years, we'll still be doing it.''

	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Exiled guerrilla leader Jose Alexandre  
``Xanana'' Gusmao has slipped back into East Timor, military 
sources said Friday, while nearly 2,000 refugees arrived aboard the 
first ship to carry displaced East Timorese home from Indonesia. 
Loudspeaker trucks drove through the city streets announcing the 
homecoming of the 53-year-old guerrilla chief, who is likely to

	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- The Russian Defense Ministry in Moscow is  
denying Chechnya's claims that the rockets that hit Grozny on 
Thursday, killing 118 people and injuring up to 400, were fired by 
Russian forces moving in on the capital. Bleeding bodies were 
scattered throughout a crowded open air market after six rockets 
exploded in the stalls. At least four other rockets slammed into 
other parts of the city. Russia has been waging an offensive in 
Chechnya to eliminate Islamic militants who invaded neighboring 
Dagestan this summer.

the Senate went on record today as saying that the landmark

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House rejected a voucher plan today that  
could have given the families of poor children $3,500 each to 
attend private schools if their public schools were failing 
academically or deemed unsafe. Despite a push from GOP leaders, 
moderate Republicans crossed party lines to keep proposals for 
vouchers out of the $9.9 billion Title I program aimed at closing 
the achievement gap for 10.5 million poor and otherwise 
disadvantaged children. In a 358-67 vote, House members 
overwhelmingly approved the Title I bill.

and disrupting tourism. By late day, the storm was 55 miles 
north-northeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and heading 
west-northwest to open seas. Its winds had dropped to 65 mph from 
100 mph a day earlier. Tropical storm warnings were canceled for

20th century, making it one of the century's most significant 
advances in public health, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention said today. At the beginning of the century, nearly

<HEADLINE> Kids Still Uninsured as Rates Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of uninsured children remains at 11  
million despite the strong economy and a new program that has been 
enrolling them for nearly two years, according to two reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, advocates say, is that the children lost Medicaid  
coverage when their families left welfare, even though many of them 
are still eligible for the program. 
</P>
<P>
	A new Children's Health Insurance Program, created to help  
reduce the number of uninsured children, has signed up more than a 
million kids, but its efforts are not enough to counter the falling 
Medicaid rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're no further down the road toward protecting children than  
we were in 1996 or '97,'' said Ronald Pollack, president of 
Families USA, which released a study comparing 12 states' coverage 
of children in 1996 and 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	That study found that overall, more children left Medicaid than  
joined the new program, which is aimed at kids who are not poor 
enough to qualify for Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	A Census Bureau report, released earlier this month, had already  
determined that the portion of uninsured children did not change 
significantly from 1997 to 1998, remaining at 11.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the states losing the most ground in the Families USA  
study was Texas, and Vice President Al Gore's office wasted no time 
in blaming Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the frontrunner for the 
Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's report is further evidence that the governor's batting  
average, when comes to children, is Bush league -- last in 
environment, last in children's health care coverage and near last 
in the quality of life for our kids,'' said Gore spokesman Chris 
Lehane. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Medicaid roles dropped by about 228,000 between 1996 and  
1999, but just 34,553 children were added through the new program, 
meaning the number of kids covered by both programs fell 14.2 
percent, the biggest percentage drop among the 12 states examined. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker responded by noting that Bush was  
overwhelmingly re-elected by Texans last year. ``We don't know what 
planet Al Gore's been on but it's obviously a different one than 
the 69 percent of Texans who just last year overwhelmingly approved 
of Gov. Bush's record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been always been a considerable number of children  
who qualify for Medicaid but do not receive it. But the number 
appears to have grown with falling welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, welfare and Medicaid went together, and many  
states have allowed children who still qualify for Medicaid to 
leave the program when their families leave welfare. In fact, some 
states' welfare computer systems automatically cut Medicaid when 
welfare checks are cut, because the two used to be so closely tied. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a problem that's been noted by President Clinton and  
advocates for the poor. But the reports released Wednesday are the 
first that attempt to quantify the impact on the total number of 
uninsured children. 
</P>
<P>
	A study by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a  
liberal research group, examines low-income children in 1996 and 
1998. (For a family of three, low-income meant an income of $26,006 
or less in 1998.) 
</P>
<P>
	It found there were 7 million low-income uninsured children last  
year, a number that has not changed over two years, despite low 
unemployment and creation of the new program. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, it said, is ``sharp declines'' in the number of  
poor children in Medicaid. In 1996, there were 9.1 million poor 
children in Medicaid, but that fell to 7.8 million by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the drop is due to the drop in the total number of  
poor children, but the rest represents kids who remain poor but 
still do not have the coverage, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	So as states enroll children in the new insurance program, they  
are simply replacing, at least numerically, those who lose 
insurance from Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nation is losing a significant opportunity to reduce the  
number of low-income children without health insurance,'' the 
Center on Budget report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The Families USA study looked at children in 12 states and found  
that, overall, the number of kids being insured by the new health 
program did not make up for the kids who left Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Five states saw net declines in the number of kids enrolled.  
Besides Texas, they included Ohio, with a 7.3 percent drop; 
Arizona, 6.5 percent drop; California, 4.2 percent drop, and 
Pennsylvania, 3.9 percent drop. 
</P>
<P>
	But seven states saw net gains. They were North Carolina, with a  
15.8 percent gain; Louisiana, 8.4 percent gain; New York, 3.2 
percent gain; New Jersey, 2.7 percent gain; Georgia, 1.2 percent 
gain; Illinois, 0.5 percent gain and Florida, 0.1 percent gain.

at prices inflated by up to 300 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of continuing public outrage that many of the best  
seats at the most sought-after events were not included in the 
public offer, the board of the Sydney Organizing Committee for the 
Olympic Games (SOCOG) voted Thursday to reveal exactly how many of 
the total of 9.6 million tickets were set aside for sale to wealthy 
groups and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG will publish detailed figures Monday showing which and how  
many tickets were made available to the public for a range of key 
sessions, including opening and closing ceremonies, swimming and 
track and field finals. 
</P>
<P>
	But the board decided not to release the names of the groups who  
had applied for the premium tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shouldn't be too cute about this,'' SOCOG president Michael  
Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, there were a number of seats that were quarantined to the  
public in the public offering and to the best of my knowledge 
nothing was taken out of that number of seats that was quarantined 
and put into premium packages. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, if the premium packages didn't exist there would have  
been a bigger pool for the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG already has raised more than $22 million from the sale of  
54,803 premium tickets and smaller amounts from 21,986 tickets 
included in sports passes and 49,050 tied to stadium packages. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the public outcry, SOCOG intends to push ahead with the  
sale of an additional 200,000 tickets above face value which are 
expected to raise another $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG's commercial and marketing general manager Paul Reading  
said about 25 percent of the premium ticket packages would be sold 
overseas.

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Hey, the Atlanta Braves already beat the New York  
Yankees 2-1 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody has mixed opinions about interleague play,'' Atlanta  
first baseman Ryan Klesko said Thursday after the Braves worked out 
at Turner Field. ``We know what they've got. They know what we've 
got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since interleague play began in 1997, this is the first time the  
American and National league champions met during the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta won the opener July 15 at Yankee Stadium, with Tom  
Glavine beating Roger Clemens. Javy Lopez, who is missing the World 
Series because of injury, drove in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
	New York blew a 7-6 lead in the ninth the following night when  
Klesko hit an RBI single and Andruw Jones hit a three-run homer off 
Mariano Rivera. The Yankees have had 186 ninth-inning leads the 
last two years, and that was one of just three instances when they 
didn't win. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando Hernandez, the Yankees' Game 1 starter Saturday, gave up  
a career-high four homers in that game, including two to Klesko, 
one to Jones and one to Chipper Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees won 11-4 in the third game, breaking a 3-all tie  
with five runs in the fifth. Bernie Williams and Chuck Knoblauch 
homered for the Yankees, who got eight runs and eight hits in 4 2-3 
innings against Odalis Perez, who's out for the year with an 
injured left elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't look at anything,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said.  
``It's like us beating the Mets during the regular season. It 
doesn't mean anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Yankees had similar thoughts.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't even remember those games,'' catcher Joe Girardi said.  
``It was three days in the middle of the season. It's not like it 
was September. I don't remember it like games against teams in our 
division.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *USING HIS BAT:* Yankees manager Joe Torre picked David Cone to  
start Game 2 because it would give him five days off before 
pitching Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Cone, who has excelled with extra rest this season, supplied  
another theory for the Game 2 assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm 3-for-8 in my World Series career in case you're looking  
for notes,'' said Cone, who will make both of his starts at Turner 
Field and will be called upon to bat. ``The minimum qualifier is 10 
at-bats, so I can go 0-for-2 and still be a .300 hitter in the 
World Series.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SIGN OF THE TIMES:* When the Braves walked into their clubhouse  
Thursday, they quickly found a sign they were in the World Series: 
68 boxes of baseballs for the team to sign -- a total of 816 scrawls 
per player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have to do too much -- AJ, that's it,'' Andruw Jones  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Players got to it early, not wanting to push it off until Friday  
or Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why it's good to have some days off,'' Klesko said.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HOTEL SHORTAGE:* With convention business booming, it's hard to  
find hotel rooms in downtown Atlanta. The Yankees will be staying 
at a Westin about 20 miles north of the city center. Many baseball 
officials will be staying at airport hotels. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NEW RULES:* Joe Torre watched with envy during Game 6 of the NL  
Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	He saw Braves manager Bobby Cox and Mets manager Bobby Valentine  
making moves batter by batter and longed to play games without the 
DH. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, a former manager of both NL finalists, gets his chance in  
the first two games of the World Series in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``The manager has to be more alert without the DH,'' he said.  
``We're so spoiled in this league by the DH that we don't worry 
about when the pitcher's spot comes up. You have to be more on your 
toes with double switching and everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre has excelled in those situations in the World Series. The  
Yankees have won all five games in NL parks and Torre outmanaged 
Cox in Game 4 against Atlanta in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre held back Wade Boggs until the 10th inning, when he came  
in as a pinch hitter and walked with the bases loaded, driving in 
the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
	``The danger in the NL park is running out of players,'' he  
said. ``We aren't confronted with that in our league.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *JORDAN UPDATE:* Brian Jordan says his right fingers, hit by a  
Turk Wendell pitch on Tuesday night, aren't bothering him, 
</P>
<P>
	``In the regular season, I definitely would have gone out there,  
but if we lose, we've got a Game 7 and I'm suspended,'' Jordan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	His hand has been sensitive since he was hit by a pitch from  
Montreal's Mike Thurman on June 22. Jordan, who has been icing the 
hand, had only one homer in his final 139 at-bats during the 
regular season but has three in 42 at-bats during the postseason.

<HEADLINE> Report: Pistons Center To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit Pistons center Bison Dele has filed  
retirement papers with the NBA office in New York, a newspaper 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Sund, the Pistons vice president of basketball operations,  
confirmed that Dele filed the paperwork, The Detroit News reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's what we expected,'' Sund said. ``He has notified us, his  
agent and the league that he is retiring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dele will forfeit the $5.67 million he stood to earn this  
season. The Pistons can put Dele on the retirement list or the 
suspended list. If on the suspended list, the Pistons could 
reinstate him if he changes his mind -- or trade him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could put him on the retirement list,'' Sund said. ``But  
that wouldn't be to anyone's advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Dele goes on the retirement list, he will have to sit out the  
entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said from the beginning that his talent really helps our  
ballclub,'' Sund said. ``If he wanted to come back, we would look 
at that situation very strongly. Or, if he wanted to be traded we 
could look at that if it was something that made sense for our 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dele averaged 10.5 points and 5.6 rebounds in 49 regular-season  
games and 10.6 points and 6.4 rebounds in five playoff games last 
season. He has five years and $36.45 million left on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old told the Pistons late last month about his  
possible desire to retire. He missed training camp and preseason 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	Pistons coach Alvin Gentry said the team will move forward if  
Dele doesn't come back. Terry Mills, a former Pistons forward who 
returned after a two-year stint as a reserve with the Miami Heat, 
could replace Dele in the starting lineup, Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dele, a 6-foot-11 center formerly known as Brian Williams, was  
the team's highest-paid player. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent two seasons in Detroit after signing as a free agent,  
and his relationship with his teammates was said to be strained. 
Dele's name came up frequently in trade rumors during the summer.

<HEADLINE> N.C. River Crests Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- A sign put up by the owners of a washed-out  
store here in the heart of flood-ravaged eastern North Carolina 
reads: ``We'll be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message in the window at Rusty's Gift Shop could just as  
easily refer to the rain that keeps coming back to torment weary 
residents and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tar River crested at 3 feet above flood stage Wednesday  
after runoff from Hurricane Irene's rains couldn't be contained. It 
was the fourth time in two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll survive,'' said Mary Jefferson, who was shopping for  
groceries in Tarboro, 60 miles east of Raleigh. ``We always have 
and we always will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the Tar's brown waters began to drop, rain fell again from  
the dirty chalkboard sky, with accumulations of more than an inch 
reported in some counties. Clearing skies were forecast for today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of seeing water,'' said Rachel House, a legal  
secretary in Tarboro whose office was inundated last month. She 
said she remained unconvinced the river's cresting necessarily 
signaled better times. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been a wet two months in North Carolina. Hurricane Dennis  
dumped 8 inches of rain in early September. Floyd's epic, 20-inch 
rainfall was next on Sept. 16, followed less than two weeks later 
by a tropical storm that poured 8 inches. Irene dumped up to 6 
inches of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	During the height of Floyd's flooding, the Tar swelled to 43  
feet, flooding most of east Tarboro and swallowing Princeville 
under 20-foot floods. That town remains uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Neuse and the Cape Fear rivers have also built toward crests  
in the Irene's wake, but like the Tar, neither was expected to 
cause serious flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Many area residents now are worried about Hurricane Jose  
churning in the Atlantic. ``We just need to keep an eye on Jose and 
see where he's going and get a chance to catch our breath a bit,'' 
said Thomas Rowe, an emergency services specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	There may not be much time for that if Jose, now terrorizing the  
Eastern Caribbean, brings more rain. Forecasters, uncertain of its 
path, were hoping a cold front would deflect it north before it 
reached the U.S. mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton signed into law Wednesday a $99.5 billion  
spending bill that pumps $2.5 billion into the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency's Disaster Relief Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the money has been earmarked for eastern North  
Carolina for temporary housing, home repair, debris removal and 
replacement of cars and other possessions.

<HEADLINE> Madagascar Dig Reveals Old Dinosaur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jawbones of two animals from before the  
Jurassic period may be the oldest dinosaur fossils ever discovered 
and could focus new light on an era when mammals, dinosaurs and 
reptiles were in a frenzy of evolutionary change. 
</P>
<P>
	The new fossils were found in an ancient riverbed in Madagascar  
mixed with the remains of other animals that are believed from 
earlier studies to have lived 227 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are probably the earliest dinosaurs known from anywhere  
in the world,'' said Andre Wyss of the University of California, 
Santa Barbara, co-founder of a research team that is excavating the 
Madagascar site. 
</P>
<P>
	A report on the fossil find appears Friday in the journal  
Science. The other co-authors are John J. Flynn of the Field Museum 
in Chicago, J. Michael Parrish of Northern Illinois University, 
Berthe Rakotosamimanana of the University of Antananarivo in 
Madagascar and Robin L. Whatley of the University of California, 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
	Dating of the fossils is based on the co-discovery of fossils  
from primitive forms of other animals, including a mammal-like 
reptile, that lived just before the age of dinosaurs. Fossils that 
had held the title as most ancient dinosaur were found in Argentina 
and age-dated using radioisotopes at 227 million years. The South 
American site included mammal-like reptiles that were more 
advanced, and therefore younger, than similar fossils found at the 
Madagascar site, said Wyss. 
</P>
<P>
	On this basis, he said, it is believed the Madagascar fossils  
are older than those from Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we are earlier than 227 million years, and these  
animals could be as much as 5 million years older,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new specimens consist of the upper and lower jaw bones of  
two dinosaur species never before seen, said Wyss. Based on the 
teeth and the characteristics of the jaw, the researchers 
identified them as prosauropods, primitive plant-eaters with small 
heads and long necks. The prosauropods are thought to be the 
beginning of an evolutionary lineage that eventually produced 
apatosaurus, a 36-ton plant-eating monster that was the largest 
animal ever to walk the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the animal that Fred Flintstone rode,'' Wyss joked.  
</P>
<P>
	The estimated age of the fossils would put the unnamed animals  
between the middle and late Triassic, the geologic period that 
ended 200 million years ago with the beginning of the Jurassic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dinosaurs didn't appear until the end of the middle  
Triassic,'' said Wyss. ``This find pushes that appearance deeper 
into the Triassic'' by about 5 million years. 
</P>
<P>
	The middle to late Triassic is a time little understood by  
researchers, said Wyss, but it was an age that helped set the 
course of life on Earth for millions of years. During this period, 
220 million to 230 million years ago, animals were evolving in many 
directions. The time marked the appearance of mammals, turtles, 
crocodiles, flying reptiles, frogs, many types of bony fish and, of 
course, dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
	The dinosaur went on to dominate until 65 million years ago when  
a major extinction, probably linked with a massive meteor collision 
with Earth, caused the huge lizards to disappear, allowing mammals 
to eventually dominate. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the newly discovered specimens are of animals that already  
were beginning to specialize, said Wyss, that means that they were 
not among the very first dinosaurs but were evolved from even more 
distant ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
	``That means that there must be even older dinosaurs out  
there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyss said the fossils come from an immense collection that is  
still being analyzed or dug out of quarries in Madagascar, an 
island off the southeast coast of Africa. The researchers are not 
naming the new animal species until more is known about them, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've undoubtedly got more pieces, but they are still entombed  
in rock,'' said Wyss. It may take years, he said, ``but eventually 
we'll be able to put together the bulk'' of a whole skeleton. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Shubin, a dinosaur researcher at the University of  
Pennsylvania, said that experts may argue about the age of the new 
specimens because it was not established by the accurate 
radioisotope method. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether you want to call this the earliest dinosaur or one of  
the earliest dinosaurs depends upon your interpretation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But whatever the case, said Shubin, ``this is really an  
important find'' because it sheds new light on a critical time in 
evolution when dinosaurs were dividing into the meat-eaters and the 
plant-eaters. 
</P>
<P>
	``This suggests that very early in the evolution of dinosaurs,  
these two major groups were already appearing,'' Shubin said.

<HEADLINE> Sore Foot Sidelines Mavs' Finley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Michael Finley, the Dallas Mavericks' starting  
shooting guard and leading scorer, is sidelined with a sore foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Finley was examined Wednesday by Dr. Jim Brodsky, who told him  
he will miss the Mavericks' remaining four preseason games because 
of plantar fasciatis in his right heel. Finley was scheduled to 
undergo a bone scan today, which will determine if he has a stress 
fracture. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Mavericks' injuries mean the team is without three key  
players from its planned nine-man rotation, less than two weeks 
before the start of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Point guard Steve Nash also will be sidelined for the remainder  
of the preseason. Nash was examined Wednesday and it was determined 
he had a strained tendon in his right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Center Shawn Bradley has a strained lower back. He skipped  
Wednesday's practice and was listed as day-to-day.

<HEADLINE> Rafter To Undergo Shoulder Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Two-time U.S. Open champion Pat  
Rafter will undergo surgery Sunday to repair a damaged shoulder, 
but is hoping to recover in time to play in the Australian Open in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter said Friday that he decided to have surgery after the  
torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder failed to heal. He's been 
plagued by the injury for the past six months and he was unable to 
defend his U.S. Open title. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian also missed the semifinal of the Davis Cup  
against Russia. He has ruled himself out of the final against 
France in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter said at a press conference that he made the wrong  
decision in delaying surgery, hoping the shoulder would mend 
itself. He said he and his trainer Mark Waters thought they were 
doing the right thing but ``obviously we haven't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably took the wrong step but now we're going to try and  
get ready for the Australian circuit,'' he said. ``I've played some 
tough tennis over the past few months and really haven't given 
myself a good rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Davis Cup is definitely out -- it's gone. The Australian  
Open is the reason why we are going into this thing right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said if he's slow to recover from surgery he won't take any  
risks in returning too early to the men's tennis tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Australian circuit would hurt for me to miss but if I'm  
not ready to come back, I won't be coming back,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Texaco in Philippine Gas Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- President Joseph Estrada announced  
Thursday that Texaco Inc. of the United States is investing in a 
natural gas development project that should considerably reduce 
power costs in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco, one of the world's largest oil companies, signed an  
agreement to buy 45 percent of the Royal Dutch Shell Group of 
Companies' interest in the Malampaya Deep Water Project, Estrada 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the investment proves the continuing confidence of  
foreign businesses in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Texaco will help fund construction of the  
$2 billion project in a gas field located 30 miles northwest of the 
Philippine island of Palawan. Shell will continue as operator. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell said it remained ``fully committed'' to the project  
despite the sale. Texaco's investment will allow Shell to pursue 
opportunities elsewhere, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Malampaya field, discovered in 1992, is believed to have  
reserves of some 3 trillion cubic feet of gas and 120 million 
barrels of condensate. 
</P>
<P>
	First deliveries are scheduled for the end of 2001, with  
production at a rate of 360 million cubic feet per day projected 
for the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	Estrada said the government expects to earn $10 billion in  
royalties from Malampaya over 20 years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Soldier Charged With Sodomy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEIDELBERG, Germany (AP) -- The U.S. Army's highest-ranking  
enlisted soldier in Europe has been charged with sodomy, kidnapping 
and mistreatment of a subordinate, the Army said in a statement 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The military also charged Command Sgt. Maj. Riley C. Miller with  
assault. The allegations were filed in Hanau, Germany, just east of 
Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army statement gave no details on the charges. But the U.S.  
military's unofficial newspaper, Stars and Stripes, has reported 
that the allegations were related to an incident involving a woman 
who was under Miller's command. An Army official at the Pentagon in 
Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step likely would be to appoint a military investigator  
to conduct hearings and recommend whether the case should proceed 
to a court martial. 
</P>
<P>
	An Army statement released in Germany said Miller was suspended  
last month and reassigned to other duties, pending the outcome of 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller has served in the Army for more than 30 years. He has  
been command sergeant major for the U.S. Army Europe since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past few years, the Army has been troubled by several  
high-profile cases involving alleged sexual misconduct among its 
ranks. Pentagon leaders have introduced stricter guidelines to 
prevent fraternization between men and women.

<HEADLINE> Seagram Loss Smaller Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Seagram Co. reported a narrower loss for its  
first fiscal quarter than Wall Street had expected Thursday, 
reflecting growth its music and beverage business. Seagram's 
Universal movie studio remained in a slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Not counting a one-time gain from the sale of its concert  
operations and an accounting charge, Seagram had a loss of $95 
million on continuing operations, or 22 cents a share, less than 
the loss of 32 cents per share expected by analysts surveyed by 
First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	In the comparable period a year ago, Seagram earned $95 million,  
or 27 cents per share. The figures do not include a one-time gain 
from Seagram's sale of its Tropicana business. 
</P>
<P>
	When one-time items are included, Seagram had a net loss of $124  
million, or 29 cents per share in the latest quarter, compared to 
$1.16 billion, or $3.35 per share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram's stock rose $4.50 Wednesday after the company said it  
was moving up its earnings announcement by two weeks. Shares 
remained unchanged Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the quarter rose to $3.64 billion from $2.25  
billion a year ago, mainly reflecting the company's acquisition of 
the Polygram music business. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall cash flow, a measure widely used by financial analysts,  
declined 13 percent as a loss from its movie studio offset strength 
in the company's other operations, which include music, spirits and 
theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram's movie business posted a loss of $38 million due to  
several box office flops, including ``Mystery Men,'' ``Dudley Do 
Right'' and ``For the Love of the Game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram's music operations fared much better. Universal Music  
Group, the world's largest music company, posted a 12 percent 
increase in cash flow, despite a 7 percent decline in revenues, 
thanks to hit albums from Shania Twain, Limp Bizkit and others. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its media properties, the Montreal-based company  
also produces a wide line of spirits and wines, including Absolut 
vodka and Captain Morgan rum.

	China, U.S. Discussing Compensation  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China and the United States had fruitful talks on  
compensation for the May 7 bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 
Belgrade, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said at a 
briefing today. Negotiations began yesterday, the fourth round of 
talks aimed at reaching an agreement on compensation for NATO's 
destruction of the embassy during the war in Kosovo. David Andrews, 
a U.S. State Department legal adviser leading the U.S. delegation, 
was scheduled to leave Beijing tomorrow. The U.S. Embassy in 
Beijing said the talks were ``positive and productive'' and that 
the two sides agreed to meet again soon.

	Indonesia Faces Crucial Political Choice  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's parliament today is  
concentrating on the crucial decision of who will be the new 
president's deputy and possible successor. It was unclear whether 
popular opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri would accept a 
nomination for the vice presidency. Megawati was nominated for the 
vice presidential post along with Hamzah Haz, leader of the Muslim 
United Development Party. Two other leaders -- Gen. Wiranto, the 
powerful head of the military, and Akbar Tanjung, chief of the 
former ruling Golkar Party -- had been leading candidates. But both 
withdrew as the legislative debate began, saying they did so in the 
interest of national unity.

	Russians Nearing Chechnya's Capital  
</P>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- More Russian troops have crossed the Terek  
River to take up positions near Chechnya's capital, Grozny, and 
forward units were less than eight miles from the city, Russian 
officials said today. Yesterday, Russian artillery pounded the 
outskirts of the capital, making the earth tremble in parts of the 
city. Russian warplanes flew 20 combat mission yesterday and early 
today, opening fire on a bridge, a fuel storage facility and 
vehicles transporting militants, officials said. Russia has waged a 
cautious, creeping offensive against Chechen militants in a bid to 
avoid the heavy casualties it suffered in a 1994-96 war with the 
rebels.

	War Suspect Going To The Hague  
</P>
<P>
	ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- Croatia's highest court upheld a ruling  
today that allowed a Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect to be sent to 
the international tribunal in The Hague. The Constitutional Court 
rejected an appeal by Mladen Naletilic, who is accused of war 
crimes during the 1992-95 Bosnian war. Naletilic had accused a 
lower court of violating his constitutional rights when it agreed 
last week to send him to The Hague to face 17 war crimes charges. 
Naletilic's lawyer, Kresimir Krsnik, argued in his appeal that 
under the constitution, Croatian citizens cannot be extradited to 
another state -- even though the law makes an exception in the case 
of The Hague tribunal.

	Netanyahu Questioned Over Valuables  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and  
his wife Sarah were questioned by police today after officers 
seized dozens of valuable items the couple is suspected of having 
kept illegally after he left office. Netanyahu waved briefly before 
he and his wife entered the Fraud Squad headquarters in the Tel 
Aviv suburb of Bat Yam. Netanyahu's lawyer, David Shimron, said his 
client had not done anything wrong and accused police of conducting 
a politically tainted investigation. Shimron said the items were in 
storage to be sorted. Police said the searches were connected to an 
ongoing investigation into allegations that Netanyahu accepted 
illegal favors from a contractor, Avner Amedi, while in office.

	Car Bomb Kills Turkish Intellectual  
</P>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- A prominent, pro-secular Turkish professor  
and journalist died today when a bomb left on his car exploded. The 
bomb was in a plastic bag left on the windshield of Ahmet Taner 
Kislali's car, which was parked in front of his suburban home. The 
Anatolia news agency said the bomb went off when he picked up the 
bag. Private television NTV said a radical Islamic group, the Great 
Eastern Islamic Raiders' Front, had claimed responsibility. 
Authorities would not confirm the report.

	Tokyo Stock Prices Close Lower  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Share prices closed lower in Tokyo today amid  
investor worries over the direction of U.S. stocks. The dollar fell 
against the yen. The Nikkei closed down 86.44 points, or 0.49 
percent, at 17,448.27. On Wall Street yesterday, the Dow rose 
187.43 to close at 10,392.36.

	Rose To Be on Field for Game 2  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Despite his lifetime ban from baseball, Pete Rose  
is scheduled to be on the field before Game 2 of the World Series 
on Sunday as part of baseball's All-Century team. Fans voted for 
the century's top 25 players, including nine outfielders, and Rose 
was consistently ninth in the voting, which ran from July 13-Sept. 
19. His election was confirmed yesterday by a baseball official 
familiar with the final vote totals, speaking on the condition he 
not be identified.

<HEADLINE> Trailblazers Trim Roster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Portland Trail Blazers cut three  
players on Thursday, including former UCLA star Charles O'Bannon. 
</P>
<P>
	Also released were forward Jim Carruth and guard Ira Bowman.  
</P>
<P>
	All three players appeared in just one exhibition game for the  
Blazers, a 105-85 home win over Golden State on Oct. 14. O'Bannon 
was the only one who scored, getting four points and two rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts reduced Portland's roster to 17 players. They must get  
down to 15 -- 12 active and three on the injured list -- by Nov. 2, 
the start of the regular season. The Blazers open at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Bannon, a 6-foot-5, 209-pound guard, played on the Bruins'  
1995 national championship team, led by his brother Ed. Charles 
O'Bannon played in all 124 games during his four-year UCLA career 
and averaged 14.4 points. 
</P>
<P>
	He was selected in the second round of the 1997 draft by the  
Detroit Pistons. He played in 48 games the past two seasons, 
averaging 8.3 minutes and 2.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Carruth, a 6-10, 265-pound forward from Virginia Tech, played  
last season with the Milwaukee Bucks. Bowman, a 6-5, 195-pound 
guard from Pennsylvania, played the last three seasons with the 
CBA's Connecticut Pride.

<HEADLINE> Dow Chemical Profits Up 2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) -- Dow Chemical Co. reported a 2 percent rise  
in earnings for the third quarter, the first year-over-year 
increase since the second quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow said Thursday it earned $320 million, or $1.44 per share, up  
from $314 million, or $1.40 a share, in the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat Wall Street's expectations. A survey of  
analysts by First Call/Thomson Financial predicted earnings of 
$1.32 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow reported sales of $4.7 billion, up 9 percent from $4.31  
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's higher earnings came despite a 30 percent spike in  
feedstock and energy costs from the same period a year ago, 
executive vice president and chief financial officer J. Pedro 
Reinhard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased with the quarter's results, which again  
demonstrate Dow's resilience based on our global business 
leadership positions and low-cost structure,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's two-year slide in profits has been blamed on drops  
in demand for chemicals, metals and plastics in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-quarter earnings before interest and income taxes were  
$584 million, compared with $540 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Dow Chemical's net  
earnings were $1.06 billion, or $4.74 per share, down from $1.16 
billion, or $5.10 per share, in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales totaled $13.73 billion, down from $14 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Dow shares rose $5.37 1/2 to $116.31 1/4 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> FCC Moving Toward Digital Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Radio listeners are getting closer to the day  
when they can enjoy CD-quality sound from their FM stations and 
less interference from their AM stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission is taking the first steps  
toward making digital radio a reality, hoping that consumers 
eventually will benefit from better sound quality plus a host of 
other new data applications. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole world has gone digital,'' FCC Chairman Bill Kennard  
said in an interview. ``We can't afford to leave radio broadcasters 
out of the digital age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is expected in the coming days to offer a  
proposal on setting technical standards for digital radio. It 
delayed a vote on the matter today, but Kennard anticipated it 
would be addressed in the next few days. After adopting a proposal, 
the FCC will then review the comments and data on different digital 
radio technologies before selecting a final standard -- a process 
that could take months. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the language of computers -- 0s and 1s -- to transmit  
information, digital broadcast signals are less susceptible to 
interference and more efficient. What's more, radio airwaves can 
carry large volumes of digital information. That opens the door for 
a new breed of radios that can give listeners data like traffic 
reports and stock quotes. 
</P>
<P>
	With hundreds of millions of radios in use, one of the FCC's  
highest priorities is to ensure a smooth transition from the 
current analog radio technology to digital, Kennard said. For that 
reason, the FCC is likely to look at technology that would allow 
broadcasters to transmit digitally encoded music or data at the 
same time as they send out regular AM or FM service. 
</P>
<P>
	That means traditional radios would not become obsolete right  
away. They would continue to receive stations, even as listeners 
started to replace them with digital models. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard declined to speculate on when consumers might begin to  
sample the new sounds. But he stressed that the road to digital 
would be far shorter than the decade-long process to bring about 
digital television. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a much shorter timeline than digital television,''  
Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry leaders say they are happy to see the process getting  
off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly extremely good news from our perspective,''  
said Suren Pai, president of Lucent Digital Radio, one of the 
companies developing digital radio technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major step forward,'' said Robert Struble, president  
of USA Digital Radio, which has the backing of some of the nation's 
top radio groups as it works to develop digital radio technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Struble hopes to have stations up and running by this time next  
year, with consumers buying digital radio equipment in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies are testing to make sure they can add the digital  
signal to the existing analog channel without causing interference. 
At the same time, manufacturers are developing new receivers to 
capture the digital signal. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect that digital radios will be cheap enough to  
entice consumers to switch. Some industry estimates put the cost of 
new receivers at 15 percent to 30 percent more than current 
high-quality radios.

<HEADLINE> Nokia Profits Rise 36 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Third-quarter profits rose 36 percent  
at Nokia Oy as demand for the company's mobile phones drove a 49 
percent jump in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finnish company earned 638 million euros ($686 million), or  
0.56 euros a share, an increase from 464 million euros, or O.41 
euros a share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-quarter sales totaled 5.04 billion euros ($5.35 billion),  
up from 3.38 billion euros a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobile phone sales rose 58 percent to 3.44 billion euros, while  
the network equipment unit generated revenues of 1.44 billion 
euros, up 38.5 percent from the third quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive Jorma Ollila predicted that sales for the whole  
year will increase by more than 40 percent at Nokia, the world's 
top supplier of wireless phones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our performance in the third quarter gives us every reason to  
be satisfied. We launched numerous products and solutions, and made 
several changes to our structure,'' Ollila said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, Nokia's net profit totaled  
1.72 billion euros or 1.50 euros per share, up from 1.10 billion 
euros or 0.96 euros in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month sales grew to 13.4 billion euros from 8.9 billion  
euros for the same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Nokia shares rose $8.25 to $104 in trading on the New York Stock  
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Rockies Ring in The Bell Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Despite a career winning percentage of .399 as a  
manager, Buddy Bell was the No. 1 choice of Colorado Rockies 
general manager Dan O'Dowd from Day One. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Rockies made it official, introducing Bell as  
the third manager in the team's seven-year history, succeeding Jim 
Leyland, who retired after the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Under orders from the commissioner's office to consider minority  
candidates, the Rockies had discussions with four minorities -- 
Arizona coach Carlos Tosca, Cincinnati coach Ken Griffey, Florida 
minor league manager Lynn Jones and New York Yankees coach Willie 
Randolph. Colorado had a black manager, Don Baylor, the first six 
years of the franchise's existence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I interviewed four minorities who were very impressive,''  
O'Dowd said, ``but none of them impressed me as much as Buddy Bell. 
He is the perfect fit for this ballclub.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, 48, who managed the Detroit Tigers from 1996-98, described  
himself as a player's manager who will emphasize defense and team 
chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell -- who has worked for the Cincinnati Reds the past year,  
most recently as director of player development -- signed a 
three-year contract believed to be worth about $2.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dowd, named the Rockies general manager a month ago, said Bell  
``knows the game. He knows how it should be played, and he will 
demand that from every one of our players. He understands the 
importance of creating an atmosphere where every player has the 
potential to play to the best of his ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dowd also promised to acquire talent ``to give Buddy the  
chance to put the kind of product on the field to realize our 
mission: having a championship-contending ballclub each and every 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denied those assurances in Detroit, Bell guided the Tigers back  
to respectability but was fired late in his third season. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished runnerup in the 1997 AL Manager of the Year  
balloting after leading the Tigers to a 79-83 record, a 26-game 
improvement over the previous year. But the Tigers cut their 
payroll for 1998, and Bell was fired on Sept. 1, 1998, after a 
52-85 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``My run in Detroit was great as long as it lasted,'' Bell said  
at a news conference. ``I think it taught me I could manage. It 
also taught me about getting along with people in the organization, 
how important scouting and player development are, the business 
side of things. Everybody has to work together. When you're a 
player, you don't necessarily understand that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the best fielding third basemen of his generation, Bell  
played 18 seasons in the majors for Cleveland, Texas, Cincinnati 
and Houston. A five-time All-Star, he hit .279 for his career with 
201 homers and 1,106 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell worked with O'Dowd when the pair were in the Cleveland  
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``My initial appeal for this job, obviously, was because of Dan  
O'Dowd,'' Bell said. ``I trust Dan's leadership, I enjoy his 
aggressiveness and I understand his plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``But Dan O'Dowd is not the only reason that I'm here. I had  
other opportunities. I am not going to pick up my family and move 
to Colorado if I didn't think this was a great move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the negotiating process for Bell's contract, one of the final  
pieces to fall into place was Bell's willingness to move to Denver 
from his home in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies, who finished 72-90 this season, want to avoid a  
repeat of this summer when Leyland lived in the Colorado clubhouse 
while his family stayed in Pittsburgh. The Rockies also want their 
new manager to be more involved in the community and to have input 
in trade discussions and free-agent decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like players,'' Bell said. ``I prefer to give them the  
benefit of the doubt. I can be demanding at times, but I also 
understand how hard this game is to play. And I think that gives me 
a little edge on some other people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said getting adjusted to the high-altitude dangers of Coors  
Field will take some time, but he has some theories. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an offensive ballpark,'' he said. ``Defense has to be  
a priority. You can't walk people, you can't make errors, you can't 
give up the extra base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell is expected to retain Rockies hitting coach Clint Hurdle  
and third base coach Rich Donnelly from Leyland's staff. The team 
also has had discussions with Marcel Lachemann about becoming the 
pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need good people around me,'' Bell said. ``There are some  
guys I want to bring over here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said chemistry ``is a major part of any successful team.  
Look at the Yankees. They might not have the best talent, but they 
have the best team because they have guys who can play together. I 
prefer that.''

<HEADLINE> Winston Churchill Watch Fetches Almost $16,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A gold watch Winston Churchill once gave to a man  
who helped him escape from a prisoner-of-war camp during the Boer 
War has fetched $15,600 at auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The former British prime minister gave eight engraved pocket  
watches to the people who helped him flee Pretoria in December 
1899. The watch sold by Spinks Auction House on Wednesday had 
belonged to mining engineer Daniel Dewsnap, whose relatives live in 
South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	It was purchased by a South African private collector, the  
auction house said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the other seven watches are in museums, two are with the  
recipients' families and one was destroyed in a fire. The fate of 
the other two is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	Churchill, who had run unsuccessfully for a parliamentary seat  
in Britain five months before, was working as a war correspondent 
in South Africa when he was captured by the Boers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dewsnap and seven others hid him in the bottom of a railway coal  
truck so he could flee to Mozambique. As Churchill made his escape, 
Dewsnap was said to have whispered, ``They'll vote for you next 
time.''
